# Micronesian Conservation Coalition fails to open, they are whitelisting some how, works in Firefox, Chrome, but not with skimmer or wget.
# Curl response shows a HTML document with JavaScript, that appears to be some sort of redirect have doing tracking creepy stuff.
# This may explain why it works in Firefox, Chrome, Safari but not in skimmer.  But when I use Firefox and disable JS
# I still get to the feed content. Lynx will treat the content as downloadable and ask to download (which it can).
