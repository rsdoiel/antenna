I want you to imagine what it must have been like in the years, the months and the days, leading up to November 3rd, 1986. A day that would go down in history.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">When I think of what those times must have been like, for our leaders, for our people, who were navigating the complexities of forging a national identity and a triumphant transition &ndash; I cannot help but be filled with an immense sense of gratitude and pride.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Gratitude because, how blessed are we, that we, and our children, and our children&rsquo;s children, have a rightful place in this world, that we can forever call our home.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Pride, because, despite all the odds stacked against them, our forefathers saw what no one else saw, and triumphantly paddled us to self-determination.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Imagine, the audacity of them, to look at hundreds of scattered islands across the vast ocean, and not see division, but see unity.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Imagine, the courage it took, to stand in the face of colonial powers, and not choose continued dependency, but choose independence.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Imagine, the vision they had, when they looked at four distinct island groups with our own unique characteristics, and did not see our diversity as a weakness, but as our strength.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">And that ladies and gentlemen, is what is what today is all about.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Today we celebrate the giants of whose shoulders we stand upon.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Today we celebrate the heroes and the matriarchs that made us who we are today.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Today we remember people like Tosiwo Nakayama, John Mangefel, Bailey Olter and Leo Falcam.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Today we pay tribute to them and their families, because we recognize that as a Micronesian people, we are only able to accomplish anything through the support of community and family.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Today we give thanks to our Heavenly Father, for blessing our journey as a people.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Our history, much like the vast and unpredictable seas that surround us, has been a voyage filled with challenges, but it is the resilience and unwavering determination of our people that have steered us through turbulent waters. Our ancestors were masterful navigators, using the stars, the wind, and their deep knowledge of the ocean to guide them to new horizons. In much the same way, we, the people of the Federated States of Micronesia, have shown remarkable skill in navigating the often complex and unpredictable currents of history. Our journey towards independence was not just about breaking free from colonial rule; it was about affirming our identity as a unique nation in the Pacific.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Just as a navigator relies on a steadfast star to chart their course, our shared values and commitment to unity have been our guiding stars. The principles of democracy, freedom, and self-determination have been the North Star that has led us through the stormy seas of colonization and towards the peaceful shores of independence.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Today, as we stand on the deck of our nation, we can see the vast expanse of opportunities that lie ahead. The horizon is boundless, and we, the crew of this great ship called the Federated States of Micronesia, are ready to sail into the future. And it is my honor to stand at the helm, as your President.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">As we celebrate our Independence Day, let us renew our commitment to preserving the unique cultures and traditions that make us who we are. Our cultural heritage is the anchor that keeps us grounded, reminding us of our roots and guiding us through the uncertainties of the modern world.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">In the spirit of our seafaring ancestors, let us embrace unity and cooperation among our four states&mdash;Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap. Just as different stars guide us through the night, our states are unique, yet they shine together to light our path.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<span style="font-size:18px;">Happy Independence Day!

Though both centered around gratitude and harvest, these celebrations reveal nuanced differences rooted in the cultural fabric of each society.Chuseok, Korea''s harvest festival, is steeped in tradition, dating back to ancient farming practices. Families gather for three days, engaging in rituals to honor ancestors and partaking in culinary customs. It''s a reflection of Korea''s historical continuity, where past and present intertwine.  Thanksgiving in the United States traces its roots to the Pilgrims'' feast with Native Americans in 1621. While honoring history, the modern-day celebration centers around a single day marked by a traditional meal, symbolizing unity and abundance.Chuseok''s timing is determined by the lunar calendar, falling in September or early October. The extended holiday period allows for more extended family reunions and additional days for celebration. The festivities involve traditional rituals and games, complemented by dishes like songpyeon and japchae. Also, many Koreans and Chinese travel during this period of time, including to Saipan.Thanksgiving, occurring on the fourth Thursday of November, is a one-day affair. Families gather for a meal featuring a quintessential roasted turkey. It marks the beginning of the holiday season, often extending into a long weekend.Chuseok engages the senses with vibrant colors, fragrances, and flavors. Traditional attire, the scent of songpyeon preparation, and the taste of classic dishes contribute to a multi-sensory experience. The celebration includes traditional dance, games, and the rhythmic sounds of the janggu drum.Thanksgiving, in contrast, focuses on familiar scents associated with a classic American meal—roasted turkey (or roasted chicken), stuffing, and pumpkin pie. The celebration is accompanied by parades, football, and the start of the holiday shopping season.In contemporary times, both Chuseok and Thanksgiving have evolved. Chuseok witnesses diverse celebrations, ranging from travel to modern leisure activities. Thanksgiving has expanded beyond its traditional roots, incorporating activities like Black Friday shopping and online deals.As we navigate these autumnal traditions, let''s appreciate the distinct beauty of Chuseok and Thanksgiving. In their expressions of gratitude and harvest, these celebrations offer insights into the cultural nuances that shape our global society. This season, let''s acknowledge the rich diversity present in these festivals, highlighting the various ways societies express gratitude for their respective harvests.',NULL,'2023-11-22 16:00:00','2023-11-22 16:00:00','Marianas Variety','',NULL,'2023-11-22 16:39:32','read');

Irene Holl, Rotary Club president, stated that the menu included red rice, turkey, ham, stuffing, and many other holiday essentials. She mentioned that the organization hosts a lunch for the manamko’ so that they know how much the community appreciates its elderly.“We want to make sure that the manamko feel that they are important and that the Rotary thinks of them,” Holl said. “That’s why we set a budget and a plan for the manamko lunch every year. We want them to feel that they are still a part of this community.”Holl explained that the Rotary Club is an organization where business and community leaders can collaborate and pool resources for charitable activities such as the Manamko Center Thanksgiving lunch.“The stronger the pool [of participants], the better we can serve the community,” she said of the composition of the Rotary Club. She confirmed that Rotarians made donations to the day’s Thanksgiving feast.“If [businesses] can send a member to the rotary, that’s the biggest part, is to have somebody representing your business in the Rotary Club.”Over at NMTech, Culinary Level 1, Culinary Level 2, and pastry students spent their morning preparing their own feast, which included ham, turkey, pumpkin pie, and more, donating their hard work to Guma Esperansa.Ben Babauta, NMTech marketing and outreach coordinator, confirmed that this was the third year in a row that the NMTech Culinary Arts program donated a holiday meal to Guma Esperansa, which houses victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other victims.“What we did was we used the skills that [Culinary Arts students] learned at school and used that to give back to the community,” Babauta said. “What we’re doing is showcasing that our skills learned at NMTech could be transferable into the job workforce, but also giving back to the community.”Lauri Ogumoro, of Guma Esperansa, said that the food will be served to around 30 clients in the shelter.“Thanksgiving has always been about the family,” Ogumoro said. “[NMTech] giving back to the family at Guma Esperansa is really important because they’re away from their families and they really appreciate that you care about them.”For this holiday season, Ogumoro is thankful for the relationship being built between NMTech and Guma Esperansa.“We’re thankful that they’re thinking of the women and children and adults that are residents of Guma Esperansa during this holiday season,” Ogumoro said. “[Clients] get to enjoy the fruits of their labor. It’s a beautiful relationship that we’re building and growing.”She adds that the residents at Guma Esperansa appreciate a home-cooked meal.“They appreciate that someone thinks about them and cares for them. That makes it special,” Ogumoro said.Finally, over at NMC, the Office of Student Activities and Leadership was able to serve prepackaged holiday meals to 200 students on campus.Students could select from a mashed potato with beef pot roast and corn set; a mashed potato and sliced ham with ko’ko’ set; a white rice and breaded mahi-mahi with ko’ko’ set; or a white rice, broccoli and tofu stir-fry set.For NMC Office of Student Activities and Leadership manager Maia Pangelinan, the event was a way to build camaraderie on campus as the holidays approach.“Our Thanksgiving event at NMC was designed to spread a grateful spirit by fostering a sense of unity, providing shared experiences, encouraging reflection, and promoting collaboration among our diverse community of students,” she said.',NULL,'2023-11-22 16:00:00','2023-11-22 16:00:00','Marianas Variety','',NULL,'2023-11-22 16:39:32','read');

Though our individual traditions may differ, America''s spirit remains focused on aspirations of hope, fellowship and mutual understanding to illuminate the path forward.The story of that first Thanksgiving celebration between the Wampanoag tribe and newly-arrived Pilgrim settlers reflects the power of unity across cultures. When the Pilgrims landed ill-equipped on New England’s harsh shores in 1620, local tribes like the Wampanoag saved them from starvation and generously taught them survival skills in the new terrain. The inaugural feast in 1621 fostered understanding between disparate groups who came together in the spirit of humanity.That establishing narrative reminds us to seek bridges across communities. As the Pilgrims and Wampanoag modeled, open-hearted dialogue and rectifying historical wrongs can nurture reciprocal learning to bolster collective resilience. The virtues that uplifted both groups - wisdom, courage and compassion - still serve as guiding lights today. It is by joining hands across factions to navigate a thoughtful path forward that we honor the struggles and triumphs of history, while sowing hope.Here in the CNMI, we are all branches of the same tree. While facing our share of typhoons, economic uncertainty, and the pandemic over recent years, the multicultural island communities have responded with characteristic warmth, kindness and moxie in times of trouble. By upholding this spirit of fellowship, understanding and celebrating our shared humanity this season, we are reminded that there is light ahead if we stand together.So as preparations commence for gathering ingredients, planning festive activities and celebrating gratitude this Thanksgiving season, may we continue lifting up virtues like wisdom, courage and compassion to guide the way.
