        <![CDATA[Summer Walker is closing a chapter in her career with another confessional album.
        The R&#38;B singer-songwriter&#8217;s third LP, &#8220;Finally Over It,&#8221; released Nov. 14, arrived as the final entry in a trilogy that includes her 2019 debut &#8220;Over It&#8221; and her 2021 sophomore album &#8220;Still Over It.&#8221; The new project spans 55 minutes of music across 18 tracks, split evenly between two discs with the first nine songs labeled &#8220;For Better&#8221; and the second half called &#8220;For Worse.&#8221; While Walker&#8217;s honest lyrics remain engaging across the LP over a variety of nostalgic R&#38;B beats, the overabundance of 13 guest appearances never produces a collaboration on par with her best work.]]>

      <source:markdown>Summer Walker is closing a chapter in her career with another confessional album.
The R&#38;B singer-songwriter’s third LP, “Finally Over It,” released Nov. 14, arrived as the final entry in a trilogy that includes her 2019 debut “Over It” and her 2021 sophomore album “Still Over It.” The new project spans 55 minutes of music across 18 tracks, split evenly between two discs with the first nine songs labeled “For Better” and the second half called “For Worse.” While Walker’s honest lyrics remain engaging across the LP over a variety of nostalgic R&#38;B beats, the overabundance of 13 guest appearances never produces a collaboration on par with her best work.</source:markdown>
