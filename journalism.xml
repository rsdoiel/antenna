        <![CDATA[In the most remote parts of Alaska, staying in touch can involve a bit more effort than sending a text. Cell service is spotty, highways are nonexistent, and the postal service remains a vital lifeline, delivering supplies and mail by plane.

        <![CDATA[In the first federal election since news was banned on Meta platforms, Canadians lost out, a new report finds. The 2025 federal election was likely the &#8220;most poorly covered election in modern Canadian history&#8221; due to the erosion of local news and Facebook&#8217;s news ban, according to the Ottawa-based nonpartisan think tank Public Policy Forum...]]>

        <![CDATA[Alden Global Capital sure is confused a lot lately. The vulturous hedge fund has kindly offered to pillage The Dallas Morning News, just as it&#8217;s pillaged the other newspapers it&#8217;s bought over the past decade-plus.
