## 102. Michel Pellerin

date: 2025-05-31, from: Luthier on Luthier with Michael Bashkin

<p>For episode 102 of the podcast, I talk with Michel Pellerin, an inspiring guitar maker from Québec.</p> <p>Michel shares his journey, from teaching guitarmaking at lutherie schools to his time at the Godin factory, to developing and teaching his own advanced finishing course.</p> <p>We also dive into his current line of guitars — from parlor to harp — and how he continues to evolve his work through collaboration with musicians and colleagues.</p> <p>Michel explains his method of building two nearly identical instruments, changing just one feature between them to push the boundaries of design and sound.</p> <p>Stick around after the main episode for a bonus segment: I catch up with Mario Beauregard at the Sound Messe Guitar Show in Osaka for a quick conversation on what's new.</p> <p>Links: <a id="m_-6410116869913058645LPlnk808322" href= "https://www.guitarespellerin.com/en/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.guitarespellerin.com/en/&source=gmail&ust=1748738062879000&usg=AOvVaw25wDDhfFldbF4pDu2xRQu3">https://www.guitarespellerin.<wbr />com/en/</a></p>
