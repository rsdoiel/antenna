## Closeout Sale on Our Roubo Volumes

date: 2025-02-07, from: Lost Arg Press blog

We are closing out the last 400 (or so) copies of our two translations of A-J Roubo’s “l’Art du menuisier” in order to make room for new editions of these books. The savings are significant. Act quickly to avoid disappointment. “With All the Precision Possible: Roubo on Furniture” is now $21 (on sale from $63)....

## New Pinch Rods in Development

date: 2025-02-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Thanks to a clever idea from our friend Roger Davis, we&#8217;re well on the way to once again offering Crucible Tool Pinch Rods (the brass on our former offering has become prohibitively expensive). Shown here is the second prototype. They work, but not as perfectly as possible, so we&#8217;re still working with Craig Jackson at...

## New Deluxe Edition of ‘Roubo on Furniture’

date: 2025-02-05, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Ever since we sold out of the original 12&#8243; x 17&#8243; deluxe editions of &#8220;With All Precision Possible: Roubo on Furniture,&#8221; Chris has been itching to do another luxurious book…if perhaps not _quite_ so extravagant (the almost-full-folio size of that edition was crazy expensive). Instead, we&#8217;re working on a new quarto-size edition (9&#8243; x 12&#8243;),...

## Wood Structure & Classification of Trees

date: 2025-02-04, from: Lost Arg Press blog

The following is excerpted from the third edition of Christian Becksvoort’s “With the Grain: A Craftsman’s Guide to Understanding Wood.”&#160; It is, above all, succinct, easy to understand and perfectly suited for the furniture-maker.

## How to Open a New Book Without Wrecking It

date: 2025-02-03, from: Lost Arg Press blog

A few years back (OK – more than a decade ago), we shared designer Wesley Tanner&#8217;s instructions for opening a new book with a sewn binding: “The first thing I do when I get a book like this with sewn signatures is to ‘open it up.’ I remove the jacket off and lay the book...
