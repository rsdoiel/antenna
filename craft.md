## When Holdfast Holes Shrink

date: 2025-02-13, from: Lost Arg Press blog

date: 2025-02-12, from: Lost Arg Press blog

I love this plane, and love to put a bead on just about everything. Once you try one, you can&#8217;t stop! I&#8217;d be bereft without this tool. A...

## Wood Properties

date: 2025-02-11, from: Lost Arg Press blog
