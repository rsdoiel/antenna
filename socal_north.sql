The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of Caltech or the editorial board of Caltech Letters. Please see <a href="https://caltechletters.org/disclaimer/" target="_blank">our disclaimer</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><span class="first-letter">S</span>cience is a labor of love—love of discovery, and love of pushing the limits of current human knowledge and ability. As graduate student and postdoctoral workers at Caltech, we nourish our cell culture lines on weekends, stay up all night observing through telescopes, spend hours welding devices, and travel long distances to study our world. We care deeply about our science, and we want the best environment in which to do that science.</p>\n\n<p>Some aspects of our environment support our ability to do strong science, such as access to cutting-edge technologies, brilliant colleagues, and compelling classes and seminars. Other factors hinder or harm that ability, particularly for colleagues disadvantaged by our current system: for example, wages that fall short of the cost-of-living year-after-year, unexpected changes or cuts to our health insurance, unsafe laboratory environments, and a history of institutional failures to address <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation" target="_blank">mistreatment by faculty</a>. To address these issues and create the best environment in which to do our science, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars across the Institute are in support of forming a union (<a href="https://caltechgpu.org/" target="_blank">known as Caltech Graduate Researchers and Postdocs United, or C/GPU</a>). Unionization will allow us to collectively bargain for better working conditions and codify them in an enforceable contract.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, administrators leading Caltech are actively opposed to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars forming a union. In an email to graduate students in May 2023, Dean of Graduate Studies David Chan <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXukjDK-flgHf3GVaG3XydVXx1--mu0N/view" target="_blank">bluntly wrote</a>, “As Institute leadership, we believe that unionizing is not in the best interest of our students or community”. Provost David Tirrell  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLUWlNWjYpTkfTCwK82BtoEVvIfYBkx6/view" target="_blank">expressed a similar sentiment</a>, writing in March that unionization would alter the “direct” and “collaborative” relationship between administrators and students.</p>\n\n<p>Why is Caltech against us unionizing? A union will better position us to negotiate for the best conditions to do our science by challenging the current power dynamic where Caltech administrators unilaterally control all aspects of our working conditions. Case-in-point: year after year, the Graduate Student Council has presented Caltech with data-driven, explicit, well-formulated requests for stipend increases that meet the rising costs of living. Each time, Caltech has given marginal increases. Then, after the public debut of Caltech Grads and Postdocs United in December 2022, Caltech announced a sudden $5,000 increase in the graduate student stipend. In a message to faculty, Provost Tirrell explained that this stipend increase would be funded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKYRA3hDGrXhHxv6AK8Qd_F8x75NCVaf/view" target="_blank">without impacting research budgets</a>. Despite years of pleading from the Graduate Student Council, it took the specter of a union and a possible shift in power to finally persuade Caltech to increase stipends, and prove that they could do so without burdening lab funds. It is no wonder that on May 10th, 2023 the Caltech Graduate Student Council <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ax-s1AXrfOIom9NmvfHTAdtgDRpJIQrh/view" target="_blank">released a statement</a> of support for C/GPU!</p>\n\n<p>Caltech administrators have repeatedly sent graduate students and postdoctoral scholars a link to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OkiteVPXrsV45FCRvB5bHt51zpEwVGvw/view" target="_blank">website</a> which provides supposedly unbiased “facts about, and resources for, current discussions about the potential Caltech graduate student and postdoctoral scholar unionization.” We were dismayed that much of the information in Caltech’s “Know the Facts” page lacks evidence, and worse, some of the “facts” are blatantly misleading. For example, they provide an example where “if only 100 out of 500 eligible people vote, 51 voters would determine the outcome for all 500 people in the bargaining unit, as well as future graduate students and postdocs”, which would suggest that graduate student and postdoctoral scholar union elections often have low (20%) participation. Twenty percent participation is far lower than any graduate student worker and postdoctoral scholar union election in recent history.

We put all of our intellect (and most of our waking hours) into the generation, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of critical scientific advances. We do this work because we love science and discovery, but at the same time many of us struggle to pay for rent, healthcare, childcare, and international scholar visa and legal fees. Some of us deal with unsupportive or abusive advisors, and work in research settings with very real health hazards. Unionization can address these challenges and enhance our ability to do the scientific work that we love.</p>\n\n<p>The undersigned graduate student workers and postdoctoral scholars have collectively contributed over a century of research and teaching years at Caltech. We have seen the  serious hardships many fellow researchers have faced while trying to do their science at Caltech. We came here to work with and learn from Caltech’s world-class faculty, and we believe that a union will allow us to achieve more together. Many faculty, having once been junior researchers themselves, have expressed support for graduate students and postdocs unionizing at Caltech. We advocate not only for ourselves, but for all of our colleagues, especially those in more vulnerable positions. With a union, we will have the ability to bargain for long-overdue improvements and protections, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Formal grievance procedures and third-party arbitration that puts students and survivors first, similar to mechanisms that the <a href="https://thetech.com/2022/02/03/unionize-students-first" target="_blank">graduate student union at MIT</a> is fighting for and the <a href="https://uaw5810.org/2022/10/03/major-victory-on-workplace-bullying-and-abuse/" target="_blank">unions at UC have won</a></li>\n  <li>Protections and rights for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/protests-uc-san-diego-agrees-not-fire-chinese-postdoc-raised-concerns-rcna43737" target="_blank">international students and scholars</a></li>\n  <li>Written, contractual stipend increases that reflect cost of living every year for graduate students and postdocs</li>\n  <li>Guaranteed funding to transition away from toxic lab environments, <a href="https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/contract" target="_blank">conditions that Columbia</a> academic workers recently won in their contract</li>\n  <li>Affordable health insurance and child care</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We have done our homework and made the decision that forming a union is necessary to ensure that we and future scholars at Caltech are best positioned to make discoveries that can positively change our world.</p>\n\n<p>In support of Caltech Grads and Postdocs United (C/GPU):</p>\n\n<p><em>Alexander Viloria Winnett</em>, BBE, 5 years<br />\n<em>Ranjani Murali</em>, BBE/GPS, 6 years<br />\n<em>Tom Naragon</em>, CCE, 6 years<br />\n<em>William Denman</em>, CCE/GPS, 6 years<br />\n<em>Ryan Rubenzahl</em>, PMA, 5 years<br />\n<em>Varun Wadia</em>, BBE, 6 years<br />\n<em>Mike Greklek-McKeon</em>, GPS, 4 years<br />\n<em>Ashay Naren Patel</em>, PMA, 5 years<br />\n<em>James Williams</em>, EAS, 3 years<br />\n<em>Lambda Moses</em>, BBE, 6 years<br />\n<em>Richard Horak</em>, BBE, 3 years<br />\n<em>Sasha Alabugin</em>, CCE, 3 years<br />\n<em>Sam Ponnada</em>, PMA, 3 years<br />\n<em>Tessa Rusch</em>, HSS, 3 years<br />\n<em>Rahma Elsiesy</em>, BBE, 2 years<br />\n<em>Natasha Reich</em>, CCE, 2 years<br />\n<em>Simona Miller</em>, PMA, 2 years<br />\n<em>Nadia Suryawinata</em>, BBE, 2 years<br />\n<em>Elina Sendonaris</em>, EAS, 2 years<br />\n<em>Jasmine Emtage</em>, BBE, 2 years<br />\n<em>Ruby Byrne</em>, PMA, 2 years<br />\n<em>Quinn Morgan</em>, EAS, 2 years<br />\n<em>Matt Ratanapanichkich</em>, CCE, 2 years<br />\n<em>Talya Klinger</em>, PMA, 1 year<br />\n<em>Elisabetta Benazzi</em>, CCE, 1 year<br />\n<em>Daniel Utter</em>, GPS, 2 years<br />\n<em>Jessics Spake</em>, GPS, 3 years<br />\n<em>Abdullah Farooq</em>, BBE, 6 years<br />\n<em>Joel Chacko</em>, EAS, 2 years<br />\n<em>Emma Cosner</em>, CCE, 1 year<br />\n<em>Korbinian Thalhammer</em>, GPS, 3 years<br />\n<em>Ethan Klein</em>, EAS, 2 years<br />\n<em>John Chapman</em>, CCE, 3 years<br />\n<em>Nikolaus Prusinski</em>, PMA, 3 years<br />\n<em>Evie Harel</em>, CCE, 2 years<br />\n<em>Ruth Moorman</em>, GPS, 3 years<br />\n<em>David Abramovitch</em>, EAS, 2 years<br />\n<em>Himanshu Chaudhary</em>, PMA, 4 years</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-09-04 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

It’s one of my favorite ways to meet people outside of Caltech. Armed with bags of dice in every color imaginable, I guide players through zany high-fantasy tales and lay out puzzles for our team of intrepid heroes to solve.</p>\n\n<p>But tonight’s D&amp;D session isn’t your standard lair-crawling, monster-slashing module. Tonight, I’m running an adventure that doubles as science outreach. I still have plenty of classic D&amp;D hijinks planned, but as a battery chemist, I’ve put my own spin on the story. I’ve written different types of real-world batteries into the game mechanics, and I’ve plotted a tale that will show my players how those batteries work as they use a battery-powered device to defeat this week’s villain. As people start to join my table, introducing themselves or chatting about their characters, I’m excited to see how they’ll approach the science-themed adventure I’ve laid out.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2023-01-17-dungeons-dragons-outreach/dice.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The author''s &ldquo;Dungeons, Dragons, and Batteries&rdquo; game setup, complete with multicolored dice.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Skyler Ware</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>My battery-based D&amp;D module was developed with the assistance of the <a href="https://stemap.org/" target="_blank">STEM Ambassador Program</a> (STEMAP), an outreach training program that helps scientists design their own community engagement activities. I had a little experience leading community outreach, though mainly through programs developed by someone else. STEMAP taught me to design my own outreach program, and their approach surprised me in its difference from the work I’d done previously.</p>\n\n<p>STEMAP prioritizes building trust between scientists and the community, instead of a strict focus on teaching science. Rather than reaching out to conventional places of learning like schools, libraries, or museums, STEMAP encouraged us to look for places where science outreach doesn’t usually happen, like game stores or tattoo parlors, <a href="https://stemap.org/engagement-activities/" target="_blank">among others</a>. Looking beyond the obvious venues allowed us to reach people who don’t, or can’t, engage with science in those spaces. And instead of showing up with a demonstration already planned out or with activity kits already in hand, we spent time talking to leaders and representatives of the focal group—the group we wanted to work with—about the best way to present scientific material before we even began planning our program.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2023-01-17-dungeons-dragons-outreach/locations.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">STEMAP''s approach encourages science outreach in less conventional places, like tattoo parlors or breweries.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Jennah Colborn for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>This relationship-centered model seems simple, but it fosters an empathic approach to outreach that seems to be lacking in the modern scientific community. Too often, scientists fall into the trap of the “<a href="https://smallpondscience.com/2020/01/18/the-deficit-model-of-science-communication/" target="_blank">deficit model</a>”: the belief or assumption that skepticism of science stems from a lack of scientific understanding, and that we do outreach to teach science to people who lack scientific knowledge. But that approach devalues the sociocultural factors that influence attitudes toward science, ignores what people might already know about the topic from their own lived experiences, and erases the group’s agency in deciding how and why they want to learn more. The deficit model alienates people whose <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/society/how-western-science-is-finally-catching-up-to-indigenous-knowledge/" target="_blank">science knowledge</a> draws from experiences outside of formal education, who have historically been <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-racism-in-healthcare-has-led-to-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank">undervalued</a> by scientific institutions, or whose attitudes toward science stem from deeply held <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-4-fall/feature/nimby-threat-renewable-energy" target="_blank">values</a> and beliefs that are challenged by scientific advances. In contrast, a more empathic, value sharing approach <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/69/4/305/5369893" target="_blank">increases</a> public interest in science and improves scientists’ connections to their communities.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2023-01-17-dungeons-dragons-outreach/models.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The deficit model sees scientific outreach as a didactic practice, providing scientific knowledge where it was previously lacking. The relationship-centered model recognizes and draws on the lived experiences and existing knowledge of community members.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>\n\n<p>So how can we, as scientists, build authentic and trustworthy relationships with the communities we want to reach? Below are a few considerations that we can implement at any stage of the engagement process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Get to know your audience.</strong> When communicating our science, trainees are encouraged to “consider your audience,” usually to get us to think about our audience’s education level. Dig deeper. Consider your audience’s interests, the tools and resources they have (or need), and the knowledge or skills they might already have acquired outside the school system. Use those interests, tools, and knowledge to build common ground.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Talk to community leaders.</strong> Build your outreach and engagement programs in collaboration with people who already know your audience. Ask what the group wants to learn. Listen to, and learn from, how they already engage with science. Spend time in the space you’ll be occupying. Resist the urge to guess (or to assume you already know) what your audience cares about or how they want to engage with the material.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be your full self.</strong> Engage with your own community, whether that community is built around shared identities, interests, or values. That shared connection can be as deep or as frivolous as you want it to be, but bonding over something important to both you and your focal group builds trust and invites the public to see you as more than just your lab coat. Building that trust is just as worthy and important of a goal as sharing the science, and it will open doors to more effective and long-lasting relationships with our communities.</p>\n\n<p>I encountered a powerful example of these principles in action at a conference in the summer of 2022. I met a researcher from South Africa who was working with rural and tribal groups to find more climate-friendly alternatives to coal mining. Her efforts weren’t focused on educating those groups on climate change though; as she explained, they already knew a lot about the effects of climate change on agriculture from their own lived experiences. They understood the science of climate change through a different lens, and they knew that closing coal mines would help fight both climate change and mining-related illness. But closing the mines would destroy the economies of their mining towns. Rather than hammering home the negative impacts of coal mining on the environment, her work focused on building trust and open conversations with the residents of those towns to ensure that alternatives to the coal mines would meet their economic and public health needs.</p>\n\n<p>These principles can be applied just as easily in less politically charged situations, like classroom outreach or my battery D&amp;D adventure. Though the stakes are much lower, there are clear parallels in how our focal groups respond when given the freedom and agency to direct their own engagement with a topic. When we approach outreach with empathy and openness, we build stronger, more trustworthy relationships with the communities we want to reach.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As our party of heroes defeats their last imaginary foe, I look out across the table at the smiling faces of a team that were strangers to each other, and to me, not three hours before. Even if they don’t remember a single thing about batteries, I’ve taken the first steps towards building an outreach relationship based on trust and mutual interest. I’ve shown that I’m more than just a scientist, and that I see them as more than just people who don’t know about batteries. Building trust through shared values might not be a typical focus during outreach, but I’m hopeful that by prioritizing those relationships, we can grow lasting, authentic, and impactful educational partnerships.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-01-17 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

In cheerful comic sans, it proclaimed “Study, Eat, Coffee, All-Nighter, Repeat.” The facilitators waxed poetic about how we would bond spending long nights studying under the bright fluorescent lights of the library, running problem sets over to their drop boxes at 3 a.m. together, and enjoying the beautiful sunrises before finally going to sleep. The next four years were a whirlwind as I desperately tried to stay on top of my assignments, and it was only in the year after I graduated that I realized the extent to which I was burnt out by my time at Caltech. I realized the habits of overwork I developed as a student were working to my detriment outside of college. As it turns out, I wasn’t alone.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-13-study-eat-burnout-repeat/tshirt.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The "Study, Eat, Coffee, All-Nighter, Repeat" T-shirt the author received during freshman orientation.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Jadzia Livingston</p>\n\n<p>In preparing for this article, I interviewed several recent alumni from various majors, houses, and extracurricular groups at Caltech. They all described experiencing burnout, an occupational condition characterized by exhaustion, lack of passion, and reduced productivity due to chronic workplace stress. Everyone felt it; we all agreed that overworking students makes them dislike what they are doing and makes them less effective at doing it. Each interview underscored an unfortunate truth: the Caltech undergraduate experience is structured in a way that puts students at a high risk of burnout and encourages bad work habits that will serve them poorly as they enter the workforce.</p>\n\n<p>Every graduate I talked to remembered struggling to find time for everything. If their life was in perfect order, if every moment was scheduled, showers and meals were carefully timed, and leisure activities were used as a chance to do some of the easier work, only then was it possible to get all of the coursework done. There wasn’t a margin for error. There was never a moment to take for yourself, to think about what you were learning and what it all meant. There was always another set to do, another experiment to run, another recitation to go to. If something went wrong, if you got sick or injured, your whole life tumbled out of control.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-13-study-eat-burnout-repeat/iceberg.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The appearance of undergraduate success often masks unhealthy habits and feelings of stress and burnout.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Jennah Colborn for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>I thought I flourished in that environment, having deadlines that pressured me to succeed in a short time. If every moment was carefully structured, then my productivity must have been maximized. If I spent every spare moment learning, then I must have learned a lot. To an outside observer, I was successful — I led two clubs, did publishable research, and kept a high GPA — but under the surface I was always exhausted, never slept enough, and felt like things were about to fall apart.</p>\n\n<p>Many alumni I spoke to expressed concern that the students at Caltech were chronically sleep deprived. Some alumni worried that students aren’t aware of the negative effects of poor sleep habits, including <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation/" target="_blank">reduced attention span, difficulties with memory formation and critical thinking, and increased depressive symptoms</a>. Others worried that students—unaware of the consequences of poor sleep—were not putting in effort to fix their sleep schedules.  Even though I knew the cost of sleep deprivation during my time at Caltech, I was still unable to maintain a healthy sleep schedule while also fulfilling my academic duties. The students I spoke to who did manage to cut enough time out of their work schedule to sleep often had to give up research, networking, teaching, or extracurriculars and deal with unbearable stress to make up the time “lost” to sleep. They didn’t feel they had the opportunities afforded to students who gave up sleep to get everything done.</p>\n\n<p>Many students seem to take a perverse pride in — or at least have a grim acceptance of — this toxic culture. Students and professors alike look with awe at those students who are able to excel without appearing to struggle. This attitude plays into widespread impostor syndrome (the feeling of being academically out-of-place) among the student body (as described in the 2022 <a href="https://president.caltech.edu/documents/21447/Caltech_Co-Curricular_Group_C3_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Co-Curricular Group Report</a>). Students feel that they “don’t belong here” if they don’t force themselves to maximize their accomplishments at the expense of their physical and mental health. As a result, poor sleep habits and poor work-life balance are marks of pride, representing the sacrifices we make to succeed. They demonstrate how much harder we are working than everyone else and “prove” that we aren’t impostors. A selfless devotion to the pursuit of knowledge at the cost of physical and mental health is the hallmark of the mythical (and perhaps unduly venerated) “Caltech Genius.”</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-13-study-eat-burnout-repeat/genius.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The mythical "Caltech genius."</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Jennah Colborn for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>Proper sleep hygiene is made even more challenging by work expectations that force students to prioritize completing their work over healthy sleep habits. At Caltech, most problem sets are expected to be done collaboratively. They are intentionally made more difficult than what one person can do on their own so that they are suitable for a group, which incentivizes students to work together and penalizes students for working alone. This system, paired with undergraduate work culture, promotes work habits that make healthy sleep patterns impossible. Groups are generally only available at night due to daytime classes and extracurriculars, so most work gets done between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. In addition, many sets incorporate information taught up to the due date, so it often isn’t possible to work ahead of time. Classes at Caltech are also chronically “under-unitted,” meaning that the actual hours spent by students on the class far exceed the hours listed in the course catalog. While intending to create a collaborative environment, the assignment structure at Caltech inadvertently causes students to spend more time struggling through homework than thinking critically about what they have learned.</p>\n\n<p>The time pressure undergraduates experience at Caltech forces students to choose between central aspects of the traditional college experience. A lot of undergrads at Caltech don’t go to lectures, and many that do are late or exhausted. I always found this puzzling — here we are with some of the most accomplished scientists in the world teaching us the secrets of the universe, and yet we can’t bother to get out of bed for class. But when every moment has to be strictly scheduled, and lectures aren’t essential to learn the material, it often becomes a choice between going to lecture or getting the work done. An hour of lecture could be used to edit a paper, work on a problem set, or even just catch up on the sleep missed because of a paper or problem set for a different class.</p>\n\n<p>The culture of burnout at Caltech isn’t the fault of any one person or group. It’s systemic, and the students and faculty are complicit. The bad habits that students internalize and often glorify are both encouraged and taken advantage of by the way classes are structured. There is a general assumption that students will sacrifice sleep and career opportunities to get their coursework done, which in turn allows professors to assign more work. This environment of chronic stress and poor sleep makes learning that much harder, which makes assignments take longer, which creates more stress and worse sleep; the result is a cycle of unhealthy conditions.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-13-study-eat-burnout-repeat/valued.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The culture of burnout at Caltech leads students to question their value and sense of belonging within the establishment.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Jennah Colborn for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>These habits don’t magically disappear with an easier workload or a different institution. I still find myself working at strange hours, struggling to get up in the morning, and taking on more than my share, even when my supervisors encourage me to put my mental health first. Without ingrained healthy work habits, I often find myself ignoring signs of fatigue and illness to get more work done. Having now worked at other institutions, I’ve seen how environments that intentionally prioritize the health and wellbeing of students and staff actually increase productivity and quality of work. I’m still unlearning the work and sleep habits I developed at Caltech, but I’m lucky to be surrounded by coworkers and supervisors who not only encourage me to take care of myself but model healthy work habits themselves. I’m grateful to have the experience I gained from Caltech, but it came at the cost of my health.</p>\n\n<p>One night at freshman orientation, in 2016, an admissions officer got up in front of the assembled class of 2020 and told us that all of us belonged here, even though we might not feel that way. This school would be better served if the students and faculty believed this. That means structuring classes with the goal of most effectively teaching the information, rather than trying to weed out students who “don’t have what it takes.” That means both students and faculty recognizing unhealthy work habits as detrimental and encouraging and modeling healthy work habits. That means reevaluating class curricula to ensure that students are not expected to spend more than their unit load worth of hours doing work for classes. That means mindfully structuring classes such that students can easily understand the concepts rather than being mired down in busywork. Caltech is one of the most selective universities in the country, and everyone here has earned their place. Students deserve an environment where they are free to learn without sacrificing their health.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2022-12-20 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://caltechletters.org/science/star-stuff','How the universe made us',replace('<p>Have you ever wondered where the particles we are made of come from? In the words of the late, great Carl Sagan, ‘We are made of star stuff.’ The hydrogen and oxygen in water, the carbon in every life form, the nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our bones and teeth, the iron in our blood, and the gold we wear were all made in exotic places in the Universe. To understand how this came to be, we need to zoom out of your room, city, and even Earth and take a journey to the edge of the Universe.</p>\n\n<p>Before starting this journey, we will detour to some basic science. What makes carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and all other elements different? To answer this question, we have to take a look inside the structure of the elements. The constituent particles of an element are called atoms, which are the smallest building blocks of all matter. Atoms are made of positively charged protons and chargeless neutrons packed tightly into a highly compact nucleus that is orbited by negatively charged electrons. The number of protons in the nucleus determines the elemental identity of the atom. For example, eight protons combine with eight neutrons and eight electrons to create oxygen, twenty of each combine to form calcium, and so on. From a pool of a little over one hundred different elements comes your body and everything we know on Earth. But where and how did these elements, the basis for our entire existence, originate?</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-06-star-stuff/atom-diagram.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Schematic of an atom showing the general arrangement of protons, neutrons, and electrons</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://keystagewiki.com/index.php?title=Atomic_Structure&amp;mobileaction=toggle_view_mobile" target="_blank">Key Stage Wiki</a></p>\n\n<p>Let us start with the simplest element, hydrogen, which is made of one proton in the nucleus and one orbiting electron. Hydrogen is present in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the fuels we put in our cars. To see where hydrogen first formed, we need to travel back to the start of time, to the birth of the Universe itself. Astronomers have theorized that the Universe began with the Big Bang—an explosion with extremely high energy. Immediately after the Big Bang, bits and pieces of matter and energy rapidly expanded into the Universe. In these early moments, however, the environment was far too hot, dense, and chaotic for larger structures—like atoms and molecules—to form. Hydrogen didn’t appear until the Universe had spread out and subsequently cooled down—enough for the first protons, neutrons, and simple atoms to form. Electrons were formed within the first microsecond (one-millionth of a second) after the Big Bang. Protons and neutrons began forming shortly after, within a single second. About three minutes after the Big Bang, conditions had cooled enough for these protons and neutrons to form a hydrogen nucleus. This is called the era of nucleosynthesis (i.e., the synthesis of atomic nuclei). As the Universe cooled down further, these hydrogen atoms came together under the influence of gravity to form the first stars of the Universe. Continuing our journey to understand the basis of our existence, we now turn to these twinkling stars.</p>\n\n<p>Humanity has looked at the stars and wondered about our place under them for hundreds of years. In the bellies of these stars—seemingly serene dots in the sky—a high-pressure inferno begins to squeeze together atoms of lighter elements and combine them into heavier ones. Because all protons are positively charged, they tend to repel each other. However, the extreme conditions of stellar interiors make them one of the few places in the Universe where protons can be forced to fuse into a heavier nucleus. Let’s examine this fusion process more closely.  When two protons and two neutrons are squeezed together, they form the nucleus of helium. This nuclear fusion process releases enough energy to power the Sun. Then, three helium nuclei can combine in a multi-step process to form the nucleus of carbon, a 6-proton element. The fusion of carbon and helium nuclei leads to an oxygen nucleus containing 8 protons. The process continues. Through successive fusion reactions, the nuclei of most elements lighter than iron (26 protons) can be formed. The atomic factories inside stars continuously churn day in and out, generating all the carbon and oxygen atoms in the Universe. In fact, all the organic elements inside plants, animals, and even humans once came from the bellies of stars.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-06-star-stuff/Red_Giant.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The extremely high pressures and temperatures in the interiors of stars provide ideal conditions for the generation of atoms of elements like carbon and oxygen.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by <a href="https://www.sarahzeichner.com" target="_blank">Sarah Zeichner</a> for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>While lighter elements are created in living stars, heavier elements originate in magnificent, explosive stellar deaths. When a star dies, it explodes in a phenomenon known as a supernova, an explosion so bright that it may even look like a second sun in the sky. In the few seconds of a supernova, more energy is released than during a star’s billion-year lifetime. In 1054 AD, <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~akr/crab_webtifr.html" target="_blank">Chinese astronomers discovered such a second ‘sun’</a> visible in the daylight for nearly twenty days. This energy provides ideal conditions for heavy atomic nuclei to bind together and form even heavier elements, such as calcium and iron. My own research involves scanning the night sky to discover new supernovae. We then study how they evolve over time with the hope of understanding the physics driving the explosion itself, and the processes involved in making these heavy elements.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-06-star-stuff/Supernova.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">An artistic rendering of a supernova</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by <a href="https://www.sarahzeichner.com" target="_blank">Sarah Zeichner</a> for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>There are much heavier elements of course, like gold, that even supernovae can’t create. So where do these elements form? You might understand the game by now: we need to travel to places in the Universe that are even more exotic. After a supernova explosion, what’s left is an extremely high-density object called a neutron star. It’s so dense that a spoonful of a neutron star weighs more than the Himalayas! These highly compact objects provide a gigantic reservoir of neutrons essential for the synthesis of heavier elements. But to access this neutron reservoir,  we need  a way to tear it  open. In this pursuit, we now turn to binary neutron stars. While we started our journey in a single star, like our Sun, most stars are actually binary (double): two stars orbiting each other. After both stars in a binary system explode, the two dense neutron stars left behind eventually spiral into each other and collide, releasing neutrons heated to billions of degrees. Heavy elements form in under a second. In 2017, <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-led-teams-strike-cosmic-gold-80074" target="_blank">observations</a> made by Caltech scientists and others helped astronomers discover such a merger for the first time. The color and brightness of the merger provided direct evidence for the presence of gold and platinum—it was like observing alchemy in action!</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-12-06-star-stuff/Double_Star.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Two neutron stars spiral in moments before merging, resulting in a highly energetic explosion that created the first gold and platinum atoms.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by <a href="https://www.sarahzeichner.com" target="_blank">Sarah Zeichner</a> for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>How did these elements, formed billions of years ago, finally make their way to us? As stars die and explode as supernovae, they release all the elements they made into space. Similarly, mergers of stellar corpses also produce explosions that expel all synthesized elements, forming a cloud of gas and dust. This stardust later forms new stars, like our Sun, and new planets, like Earth. Astronomers believe that our solar system formed from one such cloud of stardust called the Solar Nebula around 5 billion years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The origin story of the atoms that make up our muscles, bones and blood, the jewelry we wear, and the smartphones we use, a story that predates us by billions of years, is identical for each and every one of us. It is a story independent of one’s caste, race, religion, or country. Times are uncertain. No matter what you are going through, remember that we all are connected by this incredible, better-than-science-fiction story. You are made of stardust; every bit of you is glorious star stuff.

Can I pet it?”</p>\n\n<p>“That wasn’t the right response,” I thought to myself, my hands sweating inside my blue nitrile safety gloves. But instead of saying anything, I just smiled back at the volunteer, who by this point was far too enamored with the test animal to pay attention to instructions from me.</p>\n\n<p>And the animal in question?</p>\n\n<p>A palm-sized, three-ounce adult tarantula.</p>\n\n<p>Surprised? Well I was, too. This was meant to be an experiment on fear and anxiety, and my eight-legged lab partners were supposed to help us understand how those emotions work by eliciting them from volunteers.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as I learned that day, nothing in an experiment ever goes exactly according to plan…</p>\n\n<p>Still, it was strange that I was getting this many volunteers who seemed unafraid of my test animals. The fear of spiders is called arachnophobia, and it is the most common fear among humans. Around 5% of the human population have this phobia, and in a study run by Graham Davey at City University London, 75% of the people interviewed were at least somewhat afraid of spiders.</p>\n\n<p>So what exactly was I trying to test with this experiment? Long story short, I was trying to see how fears could affect how humans make decisions, and perhaps use the findings to come up with practical ways to use our emotions to guide our own decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say that someone is afraid of spiders: Could money incentivize them to kiss their fears goodbye and touch a spider? Or, in the reverse sense, could the presence of a spider impede them from collecting money? We were interested in investigating how fear could control a person’s decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>In the <a href="https://www.deanmobbslab.com/people" target="_blank">Mobbs Lab</a>, we constructed large black boxes with holes that allowed people to stick their entire arms into them. We then placed Easter eggs that represented different amounts of award money within those boxes. During each trial, the subject would reach their arm into a box and try to collect as many of the four Easter eggs as they could. The caveat? There was a 25% chance the box had a tarantula in it, acting as a stimulus to induce fear and stopping people from collecting all the eggs.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-11-15-science-of-fear/image1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The “black boxes” constructed by the Mobbs lab.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by <a href="https://www.julieinglis.com/" target="_blank">Julie Inglis</a> for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>When I first toured the lab, the members showed me the tarantulas, which were alive, awake, and ready to scare their next subject. As a proud member of the 75% that feel mildly uncomfortable with spiders, I shivered as I saw them stretch their legs out and zip around in their cages. Lab members showed me how to handle them: they noted that wearing lab gloves was important, and they even fed the tarantulas live crickets. They told me about not only the spider experiments, but also other experiments, including one where the fear stimulus was in the form of a haunted house with actual electric chairs, cockroaches, and rooms designed for suffocating visitors.</p>\n\n<p>It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work on these experiments. I knew that I wanted to be a part of cool experiments where I could handle tarantulas and use them to scare subjects, and see how their fear could affect how they act. Usually, labs performing psychology and neuroscience experiments on human subjects have resorted to using fake stimuli for convenience. For example, in past experiments looking at arachnophobia, subjects were simply shown images of spiders on a flat computer screen.</p>\n\n<p>Later, I learned that the lab wasn’t working with real stimuli just because it sounded cooler than using fake stimuli. Looking at an image of a spider simply does not engage the same brain areas and fear pathways in the brain as actually interacting with a moving, real-life spider. Two behavioral scientists at Caltech, Professor Colin Camerer and Professor Dean Mobbs, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661316301905" target="_blank">contended in a 2017 paper</a> that using real stimuli is important for obtaining meaningful experimental results when studying fear.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-11-15-science-of-fear/image2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Real versus fake stimuli.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by <a href="https://www.julieinglis.com/" target="_blank">Julie Inglis</a> for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>In addition to using realistic stimuli, we designed mini questionnaires that we gave the subjects before each “spider box” trial, in which we asked how many eggs they were planning on collecting and how anxious they felt, since anxiety is the feeling that you experience before a fear-inducing event. After each trial, we would ask the subject to rate the fear they had felt while collecting eggs. Along with those questionnaires, we planned to take an automated, constant stream of objective biological measurements of the subjects during each trial. One measurement was a subject’s sweat level, taken using a Fitbit-like gadget at the subject’s fingertips. Another measurement was the blood flow in a subject’s face, computed using computer vision techniques on video recordings taken throughout the experiment.</p>\n\n<p>I worked with the team to advertise the research study and recruited an initial fourteen volunteers to come into our lab to undergo the experiment.</p>\n\n<p>To thoroughly assess our volunteers’ fear of spiders, I gave them thick packets of questionnaires to fill out, including the <a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/spider-fear-spq.html" target="_blank">Spider Fear Questionnaire</a> (SPQ) and <a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/spider-fear-fsq.html" target="_blank">Fear of Spiders Questionnaire</a> (FSQ) when they first entered the lab. After that, I led the volunteers into the experiment room for them to undergo the experiment. It was at this point when some volunteers would make comments that revealed how eager they were about meeting the spiders! It was clear that they would be willing to stick their hands into the boxes just for the opportunity to pet the spiders, even if the boxes didn’t contain any money.</p>\n\n<p>In a final survey after the volunteers underwent the experiment, we asked them what their strategies were for grabbing the Easter eggs from the box. I had naively prepared myself to read about strategies to dodge the tarantula. Instead, I ended up reading about the strategies that they used to help protect the spider from their hands, such as by curling their fingers to stop themselves from poking the spider.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, every subject managed to pick up all the Easter eggs and thus the maximum amount of money from each box. And what I found when I took a close look at the results of the spider fear questionnaires was that none of our volunteers were actually arachnophobic, confirming my suspicions.</p>\n\n<p>Although none of my study participants were fearful enough of spiders to be classified as arachnophobic, some subjects did show signs of mild fear. One person jumped up when they felt their hand had rubbed against the spider when their arm was in the box.</p>\n\n<p>Even though there was some variation among the fear scores, we couldn’t find a relationship between the amount of money people collected and the spider fear scores; the subjects who had the lowest fear scores and the subjects who had the highest fear scores collected the same number of Easter eggs – all of them. And although we had also eagerly collected reams of physiological data, like sweat levels and blood flow, we couldn’t correlate the number of eggs collected with any of it either.</p>\n\n<p>This was a great example of self-selection bias, where those who volunteer to participate in an experiment don’t reflect the general population and lead to skewed results. In my case, those who were less prone to be fearful of spiders were more likely to sign up for the experiment. Not having any arachnophobic people in our volunteer pool became a huge obstacle to eliciting findings from our study.</p>\n\n<p>But we weren’t done just yet.</p>\n\n<p>Remember those mini questionnaires we painstakingly issued before and after each trial? It turns out there were patterns within them!</p>\n\n<p>By simply looking at the survey data we had collected both before and after each trial, we could see if the levels of anxiety and fear that each subject experienced had changed over time, over all the trials.</p>\n\n<p>First, we looked at anxiety, which was the fear that subjects felt before reaching their hand into the box. We found that it decreased the more trials the subject participated in, which could mean that if you repeat a scary action over and over again, you could feel less anxious about performing the action the more you’ve done it before.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, our surveys also revealed that fear during egg collection stayed the same over all the trials. This meant that the actual feeling of fear did not change with the amount of egg-collecting experience a subject had.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings show that although we failed to answer our question of how fear could affect decision-making because of selection bias, we could still find meaningful patterns of anxiety and fear even among people who do not have very high levels of fear.</p>\n\n<p>A similar analysis on the physiological measurements that we took could teach us something about how the levels of blood flow or sweat changes between trials as well. The next step we have planned is to take a look at our biological measurement data and find out!</p>\n\n<p>What are some practical applications of understanding how anxiety and fear work in humans? It turns out that there are quite a few! For instance, if we understood better how strong emotions influence how we make decisions, we might be able to create tools that trigger specific emotions within us and help us perform better decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>In the spider experiment, I wanted to see how fear could deter people from collecting monetary rewards. This didn’t work out perfectly since all of our volunteers were undeterred, but we still found out about how repeated exposures to fear-inducing stimuli could affect fear and anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>This finding could be extended to people with higher baseline levels of fear, and this fact could help us with coming up with tools that help people with decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Since doing this experiment, I have tried to apply my learnings to help with my own decision-making. To reduce the time I spent on my phone on entertainment such as social media and YouTube, one day I decided to change my phone background to a picture of holes. Since I have mild trypophobia, the fear of holes, every time I wanted to turn on my phone that day, I was too scared to do so. Unfortunately, it made me scared of using my phone even when I really had to for non-entertainment purposes, so I changed the phone background back to what it was originally by the end of that day.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, we still have a long way to go before the lessons learned from this study can be used for practical applications! But I am confident that continued research into the complex nature of fear could one day yield deep insights into human behavior, allowing us to better understand and control our decision-making in the real world.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2022-11-15 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

Armed with a notepad, ruler, and magnifying glass, I’d march to the neighborhood park to catalog its geology in as much detail as possible. I still remember the rush of excitement that came each time I “discovered” a new stone, like no one had ever set eyes on it before. It was the first time I ever felt like a scientist.</p>\n\n<p>That kind of wondrous, wide-eyed exploration is the reason I decided to pursue research in the first place, albeit more recently as a biology student (my passion for pebbles has since subsided). This is the realm of what we call “basic” science, which is termed for its focus on curiosity-driven discovery rather than any inherent simplicity. Yet the closer I get to becoming a card-carrying academic, the more I’m forced to ask myself whether my motivations should be more pragmatic. We urgently need to solve real-world problems, from global pandemics to climate change. Why bother developing abstract theories when we could spend that effort creating new medicines? Even if those theories later prove to be prerequisites that yield practical dividends, getting there by curiosity alone seems slower, riskier, more circuitous, and harder to control.</p>\n\n<p>This debate is as old as science itself—and yet I can’t help but feel suspicious of those who deride basic research as foolishly romantic. I’m reminded of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/986790" target="_blank">the apocryphal story</a> about Michael Faraday who, when challenged by an audience member to justify the value of some discovery, retorted: “Madam, what is the use of a newborn child?” Clearly, it would be ridiculous to judge a person’s future potential based solely on their defenselessness as an infant. Similarly, when science aggressively optimizes for immediate utility above all else, it risks missing a wealth of mysteries we have yet to understand or even conceive. How much is a fact really worth? What’s the going rate for a flash of insight, a new model in biophysics, or an entire branch of mathematics? Why did Newton invent calculus, Darwin follow finches, and Einstein ponder gravity? The most impactful advances in human history were born of curiosity alone. And while their initial value is difficult to formulate in dollars and cents, their ensuing practical ramifications have revolutionized our lives. “People cannot foresee the future well enough to predict what’s going to develop from basic research,” <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/people/fred.prochaska/courses/ScWk170/s0/Basic-vs.-Applied-Research.pdf" target="_blank">says George Smoot</a>, a 2006 Nobel Laureate in Physics. “If we only did applied research, we would still be making better spears.”</p>\n\n<p>On its own, applied research is a fundamentally myopic endeavor. We cannot see the future, and we will never know the answers to our questions unless we ask them first. We’ll never know which new discoveries will be made—or how, or when—until we find them, lurking at the edges of our perception, and yank them into the light. This is the reality of our existence, as inescapable as death, or entropy, or taxes. It’s the reason science must always be a defender of curiosity-driven inquiry.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, today’s academia leaves less room for basic science than ever before. <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21324" target="_blank">Only 17% of total U.S. R&amp;D expenditure</a> is devoted to basic research—and while universities performed 58% of it in 2007, that proportion <a href="https://www.ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20202/academic-r-d-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">has since dropped</a> to just 48% in 2017. Even federal support for basic research has stagnated over the past decade (in absolute dollars), as reviewers and funding agencies <a href="https://newscience.org/nih/" target="_blank">become increasingly risk-averse</a>. Taxpayers and policymakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110530002942/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/26/6724606-funny-science-sparks-serious-spat" target="_blank">bristle</a> at the idea of underwriting esoteric research without obvious practical impact. Scientists, forced to devote a growing portion of their time to chasing vital grants, are incentivized to pursue the kinds of projects that are more likely to be funded: low-risk proposals with clear, short-term results. Together, these forces leave curiosity-driven science in a quiet crisis. Society demands progress, but in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheLivesOfACell" target="_blank">words of Lewis Thomas</a>, “we’d like to pay less for it and get our money’s worth on some more orderly, businesslike schedule.”</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-11-01-in-defense-of-basic-science/chart.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">A breakdown of federal R&amp;D funding from 2000-2017. While the U.S. government remains the single largest backer of science, it no longer bankrolls the majority of basic research.

In a country where <a href="https://www.ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20201/u-s-r-d-performance-and-funding" target="_blank">just 3.6% of total R&amp;D funding reaches universities</a>, competition for those research dollars is intense. Tacitly or overtly, trainees are encouraged to frame, upsell, and twist their research into the most “fundable” version possible. In the life sciences—which account for <a href="https://www.ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20202/academic-r-d-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">more than half</a> of all academic research expenditure—it is a common practice to contort grant proposals until they offer some tenuous translational relevance, so that they might be considered by the monolithic National Institutes of Health. Even if a basic project is funded to completion, it can be an entirely different battle to publish the findings. Peer review at the most prestigious journals—<em>Cell</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and <em>Science</em>—emphasizes groundbreaking results with broad applicability, which naturally incentivizes authors to play up the importance of their work. Those who publish successfully in “high impact” journals bring in more grant money, boosting their academic careers. Researchers unlucky enough to be interested in unfashionable questions have little recourse; when they fail to publish “well” or to obtain further funding, they are promptly ejected from the scientific establishment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The system now favors those who can guarantee results rather than those with potentially path-breaking ideas that, by definition, cannot promise success… Many surprising discoveries, powerful research tools, and important medical benefits have arisen from efforts to decipher complex biological phenomena in model organisms. In a climate that discourages such work by emphasizing short-term goals, scientific progress will inevitably be slowed, and revolutionary findings will be deferred.</em></p>\n\n  <p><sub><sup>—<em>Alberts et al., <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1404402111" target="_blank">Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws</a></em></sup></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite these monumental pressures, pockets of resistance still exist. <a href="https://arbesman.net/overedge/">New communities are emerging</a> with the goal of establishing alternative ecosystems outside of academia, where basic science can flourish. <a href="https://www.theseedsofscience.org/" target="_blank">Alternative</a> <a href="https://research.arcadiascience.com/" target="_blank">publishing</a> <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83889" target="_blank">platforms</a> could help address the limitations and misaligned incentives of modern peer review. A growing number of private and philanthropic organizations are starting to invest in riskier, exploratory projects, which might help to pick up the slack as federal funding slows. These are all welcome efforts, but we also need fundamental reform—which is where trainees are uniquely equipped to fight back.</p>\n\n<p>To my fellow graduate students: resist the deforming gaze of today’s academia, which compels the commodification of your innate curiosity. You have the freedom to direct your research; this is a unique privilege. Do work that fascinates you, even if you can’t justify its immediate utility. Share your passion with the world, instead of letting the world beat it out of you. Tell old friends and first dates about your work. Blog about it. Present it at conferences. You will feel pressure to defend your interests in terms of technological advancement or practical impact, but remember that your curiosity is always worth your time. Following it isn’t some recreational or ivory-towered pursuit; it’s the beating heart of what science is all about.</p>\n\n<p>After all, basic science is the original science. Since our earliest sapient ancestors first gazed up at the stars in wonder, we have been fighting to make sense of the universe. In the same way, our childhood fixations—whether rocks, space, dinosaurs, or something else entirely—reveal that there is something universal about our desire to understand. This search for meaning has been the engine of progress for our species throughout history. Curiosity is humanity’s most valuable compass—we must protect it in order to protect our future.</p>\n\n<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/skylerdware" target="_blank">Skyler Ware</a> for many rounds of thoughtful edits (and remarkable patience while I struggled to meet my deadlines); <a href="https://www.ceciliaandthebedofbones.com/" target="_blank">Cecilia Sanders</a> for an incredible illustration that’s way out of my writing’s league; <a href="https://twitter.com/NikoMcCarty" target="_blank">Niko McCarty</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey" target="_blank">Alexey Guzey</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divesh04/" target="_blank">Divesh Soni</a>, and countless other friends for reading and critiquing my drafts; and the entire Caltech Letters team for helping bring this little piece to life.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2022-11-01 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

Small lifestyle changes like carpooling, taking public transit to work, or ditching single-use plastics can all add up over time. But some changes, like switching from natural gas to electric appliances, can have even farther-reaching impacts.</p>\n\n<p>In Los Angeles, building energy use makes up a staggering 40% of carbon emissions, most of which comes from natural gas appliances. Transitioning away from natural gas in buildings in favor of universal electrification, according to recent graduate Cora Went (PhD ’22), is the only practical way to eliminate this source of greenhouse gas.</p>\n\n<p>Cora notes, however, that natural gas providers in California have been broadly opposed to electrification initiatives—all the while advertising their support for renewable energy research at universities like Caltech.</p>\n\n<p>In this incisive commentary, Cora details her experiences fighting for local building electrification and urges scientists to critically examine the implications of accepting funding tied to fossil fuel companies.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/dirty-money-green-science" target="_blank">Read the article</a></p>\n\n<h3 id="non-utilitarian-scientific-ethics"><a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/nonutilitarian-scientific-ethics" target="_blank"><strong>Non-Utilitarian Scientific Ethics</strong></a></h3>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-22-year-in-review/resnick.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"></p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">llustration by Isabel Swafford for Caltech Letters over "Braun Laboratories at Caltech", captured by Lev Tsypin</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Stewart and Lynda Resnick—billionaire owners of agriculture conglomerate The Wonderful Company — pledged a record $750 million to Caltech to support energy and sustainability research, including a brand-new 80,000 square-foot research building.</p>\n\n<p>This eye-popping figure—the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/us/resnick-caltech-donation-trnd" target="_blank">second-largest</a> private donation ever made to a US university—spurred a range of commentary, from <a href="https://www.pasadenanow.com/main/caltech-breaks-ground-on-new-institute-building" target="_blank">excitement</a> over future breakthroughs enabled by the Resnicks’ largesse to newfound <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-01/hiltzik-resnicks-caltech-gift" target="_blank">scrutiny</a> and <a href="https://sacramento.newsreview.com/2022/05/18/pressure-mounts-in-sacramento-as-big-ag-newsoms-corporate-donors-prove-that-voluntary-water-conservation-is-a-total-failure/" target="_blank">criticism</a> over the environmental practices of the Resnicks’ own companies.</p>\n\n<p>In a world of scarce research funding, how should researchers grapple with the dilemma of accepting donations from controversial sources?

The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of Caltech or the editorial board of Caltech Letters. Please see <a href="https://caltechletters.org/disclaimer/" target="_blank">our disclaimer</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>Caltech recently received the second-largest gift ever donated to a US university, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/caltech-resnick-climate-change.html" target="_blank">a whopping $750 million from the Resnick family</a>, meant to support research into sustainable technologies and means of combating climate change. This money will be used to erect a new building, bolster Caltech’s endowment, and fund environmentally-oriented research. Researchers who receive these funds will retain full self-determination over their work. It is tempting to unquestioningly celebrate this gift and the freedom to use it, but I believe that it is not ethical to pursue research using these funds without critically examining our relationship with the Resnicks. As scientists, we mold our work, our speech, and our way of interpreting the world in pursuit of objectivity. However, we often end up deluding ourselves and each other into believing that we actually are objective beings. Such beliefs are dangerous when we encounter ethical dilemmas: a person who believes themself to be objective can always justify their actions as “right.” As we consider how the Resnick gift should be employed, we need to be clear about how we judge the ethics of its use.</p>\n\n<p>When we think of moral dilemmas, we usually think of dramatic scenarios: for example, the <a href="https://www.existentialcomics.com/comic/106" target="_blank">trolley</a> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/#TrolProb" target="_blank">problem</a> or, in the case of scientific research, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/02/516280895/embryo-experiments-reveal-earliest-human-development-but-stir-ethical-debate" target="_blank">how long artificial embryos should be allowed to develop</a>. But the vast majority of ethical choices scientists face are mundane. These choices are typically not even related to experiments, but rather to funding: from whom to procure it and how to compete for it. In the US, scientists usually turn to a combination of government agencies and private organizations. The government agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), usually have a very broad scope and support many diverse scientific ventures. The private foundations typically have very concrete missions, such as developing treatments for a particular disease. Despite the differences in breadth of focus between public and private sponsors, US scientists typically justify their applications for funding by claiming that their research will contribute to the “Greater Good”. These contributions are codified in grant and proposal guidelines and are sometimes termed the “broader impacts” of the work. For example, the Center for Advancing Research Impact in Society (ARIS) developed a <a href="https://researchinsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GuidingPrinciplesDoc2020.pdf" target="_blank">guiding document</a> to advise grant reviewers and program managers on how to evaluate NSF grant applications, underscoring the importance of the quality of their proposed broader impacts. This document states that a key factor in evaluating a given proposal is its potential “to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes.” In other words, while scientific research directions are typically driven by myriad human motivations like aspiration, ego, and curiosity, they have to be recontextualized and sold as socially beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>Relying on the strength of the broader impacts of their research, scientists make a utilitarian claim. Maximizing utility, broadly defined as achieving the most good for the most people, is an important motivation and should be at the foundation of public policy. But I contend that it can never be an objective goal. There is no universal definition of “Good,” and, for most definitions, this Good cannot be evaluated within our lifetimes. Utilitarianism usually cannot be a moral basis for a scientist to pursue their work ethically because the work’s utility cannot be guaranteed. In applications for funding, utility often emerges as either an afterthought or an assertion provided solely to procure funding. Unless a different, non-utilitarian moral ground underlies the work, the scientist’s ethical obligations as a human being cannot be satisfied by their proposed research alone.</p>\n\n<p>To give a concrete, admittedly dramatic, example of the tension between utilitarianism, funding, and social values, I present the case of Martin Couney:</p>\n\n<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the burgeoning eugenics movement held <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/better-babies-contests-pushed-infant-health-also-played-eugenics-movement-180971288/" target="_blank">“Better Babies” contests</a> (e.g., which blue-eyed white baby is “scientifically best?”), and most doctors advocated that premature infants be left to die, <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/coney-islands-incubator-babies/" target="_blank">Martin Couney developed incubators that saved thousands of these children</a>, including his own daughter<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Couney did this as a showman who continually lied about his credentials: In 1898, he began traveling to expositions and fairgrounds in the US, with infants on display in his incubators as sideshows, all the while claiming to have a European medical license and training under Dr. Pierre Budin, a founder of modern neonatal care, neither of which was true<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In 1903 and 1904, respectively, Couney established permanent expositions on Coney Island and in Atlantic City that both ran for nearly forty years<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. By charging the peeping public for admission, Couney was able to fully cover the cost of the medical care, sanitation, and nurses’ wages at no cost to the desperate parents who brought him their newborns. When the infants matured, they were returned to their families. Couney <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36321692" target="_blank">saved roughly 85% of the premature babies</a> in his shows, in contrast to the <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-infantorium/" target="_blank">roughly 25% that were surviving standard care</a>. Gradually, Couney garnered enough respect to win over the medical establishment. His influence went beyond saving the preemies to proving that they could grow up to be indistinguishable from those who had been born at full-term. As one example, possibly due to the simple fact that oxygen was too expensive to provide in excess in Couney’s sideshows, infants under his care avoided developing retrolental fibroplasia, blindness that plagued children who were given too much oxygen in hospital incubators<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. The approximately 6,500 people saved by Couney’s enterprise grew up to have children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of their own; there are likely tens of thousands of people alive today because of him. Couney’s work made him a kind of anti-eugenicist, aligning him against the utilitarianism of his time: the reason why the medical establishment did not bother trying to develop means of saving premature infants was that those children were deemed to not be worth the effort. Preemies were considered weaklings who would be inferior to the “better babies.”</p>\n\n<p>This story underscores the capricious nature of utilitarianism. Back then, as it would now, the way that Couney funded his work delegitimized his efforts<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. However, the fact that there was no social ethic, no “legitimate” establishment that would support saving premature infants, created the possibility for Couney’s success. Couney wanted to save those children, to spread “preemie propaganda”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>, and found an unorthodox way to do it, while also accruing significant wealth. Today, after the fact, it is tempting to explain why what Couney did was right by making a utilitarian argument, that the ends clearly justified the means, but this retroactive argument is misleading. We now think that the ends have justified the means because our social values have changed (for the better), and we, as a society, agree that the lives of premature infants are worth saving. This change in values is not due to us having followed a utilitarian ethic. It is due to the non-utilitarian work of people like Couney.</p>\n\n<p>This example may seem incomparable to a gift of $750 million from one established group (the Resnicks) to another (Caltech), but Couney’s revenue was actually millions of dollars in today’s value<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. The connection that I want to draw between the two cases rests on their shared dissonance between utility, funding, and social values. To paraphrase one of Lily E. Kay’s opening arguments in <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-molecular-vision-of-life-caltech-the-rockefeller-foundation-and-the-rise-of-the-new-biology/9780195111439" target="_blank">The Molecular Vision of Life</a></em><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>, by participating in the given funding system, the scientist also participates in forming a consensus of values and priorities with the funder<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. This happens even when the scientist’s motivations—such as general curiosity, desire for social progress, or self-interest—have nothing to do with their relationship with the sponsor. This consensus of values and priorities, which constitute the social program of the funder, is more beneficial to the funder than the scientist. While a funding agency provides an individual scientist a sort of legitimacy (evidence that the scientist was able to convince someone to give them money), the fact that the agency unified a whole field of research solidifies that agency’s influence on society. Thus, uncritically using money from a given group strengthens it, regardless of what the funds are used toward. Neither a utilitarian claim nor a successful procurement of funding can serve as evidence of ethical work.</p>\n\n<p>So, in order to use the Resnick gift ethically, we must critically consider their values and priorities, as evidenced by their practices. The Resnicks made their fortune through questionable business practices, such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-01/hiltzik-resnicks-caltech-gift" target="_blank">shipping drinking water from Fiji to the US</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-aug-18-la-fi-hiltzik-20100818-1-story.html" target="_blank">taking control of a previously California-owned waterbank</a>. Accepting their donation raises questions about where the line between reputation laundering and reparation is drawn. For example, by conducting research with their money, are we justifying the way in which they accrued their wealth? Have the Resnicks given enough money directly to Fiji (via taxes, donations, investments, or reparations) to qualify as having made a restitution? Such questions are not restricted to the Resnick gift and apply generally to issues of accepting money for research from harmful enterprises, such as from <a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/dirty-money-green-science" target="_blank">fossil fuel companies</a>. However, the Resnick gift is unique in its size and intention, being the first of its magnitude to directly aim for environmental improvement. It will cause reverberations in donations to other universities, and so it behooves us to establish a system of ethics for using it from the outset.</p>\n\n<p>We already know part of how Caltech will use the gift: $400 million will go into Caltech’s endowment, $100 million will go towards a new building, and $250 million will be applied toward research via the Resnick Sustainability Institute (RSI). The RSI has four interconnected initiatives: “<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/sunlight-everything" target="_blank">Sunlight to Everything</a>”, which aims to use solar energy to combat pollution and greenhouse gasses; “<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/climate-science" target="_blank">Climate Science</a>”, which aims to mitigate the effects of global warming; “<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/water-resources" target="_blank">Water Resources</a>”, which aims to improve the availability of drinking water; and “<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/ecology-and-biosphere-engineering" target="_blank">Ecology and Biosphere Engineering</a>”, which aims to understand and mitigate negative human impacts on ecosystems. This mass project is uniquely poised to involve every branch of science found at Caltech. There is no doubt in my mind that research funded through the RSI will lead to applicable, beneficial, and interesting outcomes. But this research is unlikely to undo the direct harm done to the environment by the Resnicks’ companies, despite all the freedom that a private donation allows. Undoing this harm would require Caltech to start an explicit program to assess and address environmental damage done to Fiji, the Pacific Ocean, and California’s freshwater reserves by Caltech’s biggest donor.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-03-01-nonutilitarian-scientific-ethics/baxter.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">''Baxter Hall at Caltech'', captured by the author.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Lev Tsypin</p>\n\n<p>The question stands before every scientist at Caltech who is, or wants to be, funded through the RSI: Do you support the Resnicks’ practices? If you use their money and do not actually resist their business ethic, then it does not matter what your reflexive answer is; you are participating in the formation of the consensus that these practices are okay. As a member of society, you should feel free and welcome to follow your curiosity, invent new solutions to social problems, and pursue the work that you believe in. But you should also remember who is allowing you to do so. Scientists stand to gain from clarity about how funding shapes research and about how to formulate an ethical system in a changing world, and demonstrating this clarity will serve to increase public trust in science. There are several key questions that each scientist should engage with:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>What is the social program of the group funding me or the research I’m invested in?</li>\n  <li>Are the funders using researchers as props to justify their social programs?</li>\n  <li>By lending credibility to the funders, is my research supporting something that I stand against?</li>\n  <li>If yes, does the funding provide an excuse to keep doing what I have been doing, or is it an opportunity to subvert the practices or social program I oppose?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is almost always easier to keep doing what you have been doing, and it is sometimes right to do so. Ultimately, different people will have different tolerances for how much cognitive dissonance they can bear when their work supports a social program that they stand against. When I ask myself the above questions, I find myself where I believe most scientists are: the opaque moral gray. I find my own work interesting and worthwhile, insofar as all fundamental, creative pursuits are important human practices. But I do not believe that, during my PhD, I will be able to pursue research that compensates for the social programs of some of my funders (e.g., the Army Research Office). I have to live with this fact, and how I do so is the ethical choice before me. The way I see it, sticking to my research and doing nothing outside of it to improve my environment would be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the Resnick gift, my non-utilitarian stance is that money should be used to pursue sustainability research and combat climate change, as the gift was intended to be used, but that this cannot be done innocently. Guided by a non-utilitarian ethic, our use of the money ought to be paired with action that is separate from the exchange that the Resnicks and Caltech have made. This action should serve to subvert the aspects of the Resnick companies’ social programs that we disagree with and move us beyond a zero-sum moral accounting.</p>\n\n<p>If you find yourself in a similar position to mine, the call to action is three-fold: improve the immediate social space around us, improve the institution(s) we are a part of, and improve the society we find ourselves in. It is not possible for an individual to address or work on all scales at once, but there are a lot of issues that can be addressed on an approximately local scale through collective advocacy. In the case of Caltech, an obvious small-scale example is to combat food waste (it is absurd that we received $750 million for sustainability research without any infrastructure for composting on campus). More generally in academia, we should move to involve trainees in decision-making (e.g., admission, hiring, tenure, and curricula, which would foster increased trust and understanding between faculty and their mentees). Graduate students, postdocs, and staff should collectively advocate for more equitable working conditions, grievance procedures, and compensation. Labs, be they in academia, non-profit organizations, or industry, should have explicit conversations about their values and how they align or conflict with those of their funding sources. These are opportunities to supplement research in a way that centers actual, subjective values and thus sculpts the norms of scientific conduct. These are opportunities to do something good.</p>\n\n<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>\n\n<p>This piece has been in the works for a year, and has been shaped by many people.

Outside of the lab, I organize with the Los Angeles chapter of the Sunrise Movement Los Angeles (<a href="https://sunrisemovementla.org/" target="_blank">Sunrise LA</a>), a group of young people fighting to stop climate change through direct action, electing Green New Deal champions into office, and working on local policy.</p>\n\n<p>I represent Sunrise LA on the SoCal Building Electrification Coalition, which aims to pass <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2021/07/californias-cities-lead-way-gas-free-future" target="_blank">building codes</a> that transition both existing and new buildings to all-electric appliances. We don’t hear much about buildings in the context of climate change, but, in California, they comprise a <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/building-decarbonization" target="_blank">full quarter</a> of our carbon emissions. In Los Angeles, that number <a href="https://plan.lamayor.org/sites/default/files/pLAn_2019_final.pdf" target="_blank">exceeds 40%</a>. Much of this comes from natural gas appliances—mainly gas hot water heaters, gas stoves, and gas furnaces. On top of emitting carbon dioxide, natural gas appliances also come with significant health risks: growing up in a home with a gas stove increases asthma risk for children by <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/decarbonizing-homes/" target="_blank">as much as 40%</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are alternatives: electric heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling to a home and are at least <a href="https://www.eec.org.au/for-energy-users/technologies-2/heat-pumps" target="_blank">three times</a> as efficient as traditional furnaces. For new buildings, they are <a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RMI_Economics_of_Electrifying_Buildings_2018.pdf" target="_blank">less expensive over their lifetime</a> than traditional furnaces and air conditioners. Crucially, electric heat pumps <a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RMI_Economics_of_Electrifying_Buildings_2018.pdf" target="_blank">emit less carbon dioxide</a>, and the benefits will only compound as we add more renewable energy sources to the electric grid.</p>\n\n<p>Across all sectors, experts are <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" target="_blank">coming</a> <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68214.pdf" target="_blank">to</a> <a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-futures-study" target="_blank">consensus</a> on the cheapest and most equitable path to a zero-carbon future. This consensus can be summed up in two words: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything" target="_blank"><em>electrify everything</em></a>. We already know how to make cheap, abundant renewable electricity, and whatever runs on electricity is as clean as the grid. Not only will our buildings be all-electric, but so will our cars, our trucks, and our public transit. A wide range of <a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">energy models</a> have demonstrated that to achieve net zero by 2050, we will use at least twice the amount of <em>electricity</em> we currently do, while our total <em>energy</em> use (electricity plus other sources of energy, like liquid fuels) will decrease.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-02-08-dirty-money-green-science/RMIFig.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">This graph shows how much we can decrease US CO2 emissions with various changes. Decarbonizing our power generation alone only reduces emitted CO2 by 30%.

We need to use all of the policy tools at our disposal to accelerate electrification, from investing in electric public transit and electric vehicle charging infrastructure to subsidizing heat pumps and ensuring new buildings are all-electric.</p>\n\n<p>Electrifying everything also means that, for our survival, the fossil fuel industry must shrink dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>Many have said that the fossil fuel giants—Chevron, Exxon, BP, Shell—will simply become energy companies, providing the wind, solar, and other renewables that we need in a zero-carbon future. This is misguided: they <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/" target="_blank">missed their chance</a> to make that transformation decades ago. Instead, they dug in their heels, becoming the <a href="https://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/" target="_blank">purveyors of climate denial</a> and the opposers of climate legislation. Today, they are still extracting huge quantities of fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-02-08-dirty-money-green-science/VictoryMemo.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The “Victory Memo,” written in 1998 by a group of fossil fuel industry representatives (including Exxon, Chevron, and the American Petroleum Institute), showed clear intent to promote climate change denial in the general population.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Climate Files</p>\n\n<p>In the past five years, fossil fuel companies and utilities have taken a more subtle approach, trying to convince politicians and the public that they are <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/lawsuits-target-exxons-social-media-green-washing/" target="_blank">part of the solution</a> to climate change rather than denying its existence. The fossil fuel industry now argues that <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/1415383063635406850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1415383063635406850%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdennismichaellynch.com%2Freport-manchin-voices-his-concerns-at-biden-lunch%2F" target="_blank">we need more innovation</a>, so we should wait to eliminate fossil fuels. This is misleading—energy modeling shows that <a href="https://www.2035report.com/electricity/" target="_blank">we already have most of the technology</a> we need to stop climate change. It is also a false dichotomy, suggesting that we cannot innovate at the same time as we work to eliminate fossil fuels. Not only can we, but we must.</p>\n\n<p>On the local level, our SoCal Building Electrification Coalition is coming up against these same tactics and talking points. Our natural gas utility in Los Angeles, SoCalGas, is threatened by the electrification ordinances that we are advancing, since <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/2/14/21131109/california-natural-gas-renewable-socalgas" target="_blank">80% of their revenue</a> comes from selling natural gas to residential customers. Following the fossil fuel industry’s playbook, they are trying to position themselves as the solution while delaying the phase-out of natural gas to maximize their own profits.</p>\n\n<p>In public, SoCalGas has pledged to achieve <a href="https://www.sempra.com/southern-california-gas-company-sets-bold-net-zero-emissions-pledge" target="_blank">net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2045</a>. They heavily advertise their research on <a href="https://www.socalgas.com/sustainability/renewable-gas" target="_blank">renewable natural gas</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.socalgas.com/stories/the-h2-hydrogen-home-named-a-world-changing-idea-by-fast-company" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>. In private, they’re fighting tooth and nail against the climate progress we need to make immediately to solve this crisis, which is electrification and shrinking their industry.</p>\n\n<p>SoCalGas <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-08-04/california-sued-by-nations-biggest-gas-utility-in-climate-change-dispute" target="_blank">sued the California Energy Commission</a> when the commission tried to reduce gas use in the state. They <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/socalgas-misused-funds-to-fight-gas-regulations-judge-says" target="_blank">got in trouble with California regulators</a> last year for misusing customer money to lobby against energy efficiency standards. Recently, Santa Barbara residents <a href="https://www.independent.com/2020/12/31/its-time-for-santa-barbara-to-ditch-fossil-gas/" target="_blank">received a mass text</a> from SoCalGas encouraging them to call and oppose a building electrification ordinance. The utility has responded to these ordinances by pushing localities to adopt “<a href="https://www.socalgas.com/energychoice" target="_blank">balanced energy resolutions</a>” across the state.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps most egregiously, SoCalGas was found to have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-07/socal-gas-astroturf-group-allegations" target="_blank">launched and funded a front group</a>, Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions (C4BES), to advocate for continued natural gas use in the state. This organization poses as a group of natural gas consumers, with pictures of families cooking on gas stoves and messaging about “energy choice” and the “right to use natural gas” on their website. The principles on the C4BES website even match those on the SoCalGas website nearly word-for-word. This is a classic example of “astroturfing,” where a corporation creates a front group which poses as a grassroots organization in order to boost their political voice.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-02-08-dirty-money-green-science/C4BES.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions recently took down their website. However, their Facebook page still contains frequent references to SoCalGas as well as calls for residents to oppose building electrification ordinances (above).</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions, via Facebook</p>\n\n<p>Just last week, the California Public Utilities Commission <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-04/socalgas-faces-10-million-fine-for-fighting-climate-action" target="_blank">levied a $10 million fine</a> against SoCalGas for continuing to use ratepayer money to lobby against stronger rules for buildings and appliances. This lobbying <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M447/K845/447845811.PDF" target="_blank">included efforts</a> to weaken 2022 updates to the state building code, which <a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2022/california-fines-socalgas-10-million-for-efforts-to-weaken-building-and-appliance-efficiency-measures" target="_blank">moves California</a> towards all-electric new construction. Despite multiple sanctions and negative press coverage, SoCalGas, a company that derives its power from being a state-sanctioned monopoly, continues to use that power to keep us hooked to an energy supply that is damaging our health and the planet.</p>\n\n<p>In light of this, the public pledges that SoCalGas has made to achieve net zero by 2045 ring hollow. Further, their plan to rely on energy sources like hydrogen and renewable natural gas to achieve their goals is unrealistic. These sources have an important role to play in a zero-carbon future, <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-two-the-demand-side/" target="_blank">particularly in hard-to-electrify sectors</a> such as aviation, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abbd02/pdf" target="_blank">parts of industry</a>, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/pdfExtended/S2542-4351(20)30325-1" target="_blank">long-duration energy storage</a> (storing energy for days to years). However, neither is poised to take the place of natural gas in buildings. Renewable natural gas is <a href="https://www.ethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Deep_Decarbonization_in_a_High_Renewables_Future_CEC-500-2018-012.pdf" target="_blank">not abundant enough</a>, hydrogen is <a href="https://www.iee.fraunhofer.de/en/presse-infothek/press-media/overview/2020/Hydrogen-and-Heat-in-Buildings.html" target="_blank">inefficient</a>, and both are <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/CEC-500-2019-055-F.pdf" target="_blank">expensive</a>. Electrification remains by far the cheapest and the safest way to decarbonize buildings. The talk of hydrogen-powered homes is a classic example of greenwashing, or misleading the public to think that a company is more climate-friendly than it is.</p>\n\n<p>Given their history of underhanded tactics around Southern California, and their nefarious reputation in the building electrification world, I was surprised to learn that SoCalGas <a href="https://www.socalgas.com/sites/default/files/2020%20SoCalGas%20RD%26D%20Annual%20Report%20-%20Final%20Draft.pdf" target="_blank">funds research</a> on renewable natural gas, carbon capture, and hydrogen at Caltech. They recently <a href="https://newsroom.socalgas.com/press-release/socalgas-and-bloom-energy-showcase-technology-to-power-hydrogen-economy-with-gas" target="_blank">partnered with Caltech</a> on a hydrogen demonstration project. At first glance, this could seem like a good thing: the profits gained from polluting our environment are being reinvested into necessary research and development.</p>\n\n<p>But this funding should not be welcomed, and we can look to the parallels with the tobacco industry to see why. Cigarette companies have long funded cancer research, using the profits from their deadly products to create a public relations smokescreen. They claim to be solving the problems they have caused, while pursuing covert legal and political tactics to keep the sales coming in. Many <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/applying-for-funding/policies-that-affect-your-grant/code-of-practice-on-tobacco-industry-funding-to-universities" target="_blank">cancer researchers</a> now <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-09-2017-who-statement-on-philip-morris-funded-foundation-for-a-smoke-free-world" target="_blank">eschew funding from tobacco companies</a>, understanding that this money merely perpetuates the cycle of harm done by the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Armed with the <a href="https://newsroom.socalgas.com/press-release/southern-california-gas-company-sets-bold-net-zero-emissions-pledge" target="_blank">reputational benefits</a> of their collaborations with Caltech researchers, SoCalGas has the credibility today to make false claims to government officials and the public that we should not pass all-electric building ordinances, because they are funding research on technical solutions like hydrogen that are just around the corner. They can pump the brakes on the affordable and realistic solutions that are already here.</p>\n\n<p>Both tobacco and fossil fuel companies could take substantive steps towards solving the problems they claim to care about by supporting efforts to regulate their industry. Of course, under capitalism, a private company will never have internal incentives to support regulation that hurts their bottom line. But we, as energy researchers, can follow the example of cancer scientists and stop feeding into the industry’s cycle of harm.</p>\n\n<p>It’s time for scientists at Caltech, and other research institutions, to reject funding from SoCalGas. This would decrease SoCalGas’s credibility and political power, which would get us closer to passing the building electrification ordinances that we need in Southern California.</p>\n\n<p>I know this isn’t simple. Government funding can be hard to come by, and we need to drastically increase federal support for climate-related research—<a href="http://aip.org/fyi/2021/fate-‘build-back-better’-science-funding-pushed-2022#:~:text=In%20its%20original%20proposal%20for,the%20DOE%20Office%20of%20Science." target="_blank">the $45 billion over 10 years</a> of science funding included in the initial draft of the Build Back Better plan would be a good start. Additionally, many academic funding sources are dubiously ethical, and perhaps that money would just go to another institution if not Caltech. But the benefits gained from that research funding are outweighed by the costs of enabling SoCalGas as they slow political action on the climate crisis.</p>\n\n<p>I dream of one day being able to journey back to the emerald pools in Yosemite without fear of wildfires. But for me, this is a privilege. The climate crisis threatens the entire lives and livelihoods of Black, brown, and working-class people on the frontlines of climate change. At Caltech, our mission—to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education—has embedded within it a commitment to improving people’s lives through our research. If we are serious about this mission, we need to take a holistic view of our research, from funding sources to new technologies. For Caltech researchers working on climate solutions, upholding our mission means rejecting funding from the fossil fuel industry. The stakes could not be higher.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2022-02-08 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://caltechletters.org/science/feeling-wine','Feeling wine: The science behind our perception of tannins',replace('<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-01-25-feeling-wine/coverart_tannins.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"></p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Siobhán MacArdle</p>\n\n<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>f you’ve ever drunk wine with a wine aficionado (don’t call them snobs!) you’ve probably heard them describe what they smell—maybe dark fruits, baking spices, freshly cut grass—and also note whether or not the wine has tannins and how much. To understand what people mean when they talk about tannins in wine, we can start with an experience that has nothing to do with wine: drinking oversteeped tea. When you finally take a sip of the tea you forgot about 20 minutes ago, your soothing afternoon ritual is now stripping the inside of your mouth of all its moisture, causing you to recoil and shiver. You are feeling astringency, like your mouth is being dried out. This astringent experience is caused by molecules called tannins—chemicals found in many foods such as tea, dried fruit, and chocolate, but perhaps most famous for their presence in wine. In a good wine, tannins cause a more subtle drying sensation than in your forgotten oolong, providing complexity and structure, which adds another dimension to the tastes and smells we get from these chemical solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The astringent sensation caused by tannins makes your mouth feel dry. However, tannins aren’t actually drying out your mouth–this is just how our brains perceive the interaction between tannins and our saliva. The chemical structure of tannins makes them particularly good at sticking to things and clumping them up. Think of tannins like those burrs that get stuck to your clothes when you go for a walk in nature. Just like burrs, the interactions that tannins make are nonspecific; they will stick to many different types of molecules (whatever they happen to bump into). In our mouths, they bump into saliva proteins. The saliva in our mouths is full of proteins that keep our digestive tracts lubricated, but after taking a sip of wine or that neglected tea, the tannins in these beverages will bind to our saliva proteins and clump them up. All clumped up, these proteins are no longer dissolvable in our saliva and they become more like tiny pieces of sand—not big enough to see, but big enough to feel. We experience the friction of these tiny bits of sand-like protein-tannin clumps as astringency, or dryness, in our mouths.</p>\n\n<p>So, what is it about tannins that makes them so prone to clumping? Tannins are a subcategory of a broader class of molecules called polyphenols. Phenols are carbon rings decorated with oxygen atoms and polyphenols are many of these phenols joined into one big molecule. Phenols have many double bonds, which carry lots of negatively-charged electrons that aren’t married to any particular atom. The oxygens on the phenols are electronegative, which means they pull electrons toward themselves. This combination of lots of double bonds and lots of oxygen atoms creates many areas of polarization in the molecule, which means certain parts carry slight negative charges and other parts carry positive charges. This polarization makes the tannins more likely to form attractive interactions with things that they bump into than if they were neutral molecules.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when a negatively-charged part of the tannin comes into contact with another molecule, the negative charge will repel the electrons of that molecule, causing that part of the other molecule to be slightly positively charged. Now you have a slight negative charge in the tannin and a slight positive charge in the other molecule, which causes attraction! These attractions are called van der Waals forces and they are relatively weak, way weaker than the bonds that bind atoms in molecules: if bonds between atoms in a molecule are superglue, van der Waals forces are maple syrup. Long story short, tannins are sticky<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. They are likely to glom on to chemicals that they find, and when we’re talking about tannins in wine, the largest class of chemicals that they find are the proteins in our saliva.</p>\n\n<p>Our saliva proteins are well equipped to interact with tannins as well. All proteins are made up of a combination of 21 different amino acids stuck together in a long chain and folded into a unique structure. The proteins in our mouths contain a lot of a particular amino acid called proline. Proline is special because it forces a kink in the protein structure. So lots of prolines means lots of kinks and bends in the protein, which makes for a disordered squiggly mess. This open and unstructured shape of the proteins in our saliva provides many spots for tannins to bind. Although there are no specific bonds that happen between tannins and saliva proteins, both are perfectly suited for many non-specific interactions, thus resulting in clumping.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-01-25-feeling-wine/tanninfig.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The interaction between tannins and saliva proteins.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by Siobhán MacArdle</p>\n\n<p>But why did our saliva evolve to have all these squiggly proteins? Let’s imagine that we didn’t have these proteins in our saliva—the tannins would have nothing to clump to in our mouths and would make it to our stomachs and intestines all on their own. There, they would find the important digestive enzymes—chemicals that we need to get nutrients from our food. If free tannins made their way to these enzymes, they would bind and clump them up, taking them out of commission and disrupting our digestion. You might have experienced this if you stubbornly drank that over-steeped cup of tea anyway and gave yourself a stomach ache. We probably evolved to have these squiggly proteins in our saliva as sacrificial tannin sponges to protect our digestive enzymes from the tannins in our diet.</p>\n\n<p>There is immense range in the levels of tannins in wine, and wines are commonly described as having low, medium, or high tannins. If you start paying attention to the level of astringency you experience from certain wines, you might develop a preference for wines with a particular level of tannins. And then you might actually have an answer at the wine store when they put you on the spot with, “are you looking for anything in particular?”</p>\n\n<p>Most of the tannins in wine come from the skins of the grapes used to make wine<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. These skins and the winemaker’s choice of what to do with them are how we end up with wines of such varying tannin levels. If the winemaker chooses to include the skins during fermentation, the tannins dissolve into the grape juice and the resulting wine will have tannins. The extent of tannic character depends on the length of time the winemaker chooses to keep the skins around. Just like a tea bag, the longer the skins are “steeped,” the more intense the astringent experience caused by tannins will be. In addition to time with the skins, the other variable affecting tannin levels is the type of grape. Certain grapes are thicker-skinned than others, so they will impart more tannins to the wine than wines made from grapes with thin skins. Pinot Noir, for example, is notoriously thin-skinned, so these wines will always be low in tannins. Nebbiolo grapes, on the other hand, contain a lot of tannins in their thick skins, so wines made from these grapes will have an intense tannic character.</p>\n\n<p>Even within a grape variety, there can be variation in the levels of tannins depending on the conditions used to grow the grape. Tannin molecules may serve as a sort of “sunscreen” for the grapes, absorbing UV rays from the sun that could be damaging to the grape cells (all those double bonds in tannins that were mentioned earlier are also great for absorbing UV radiation!). Thus, grapes that are grown at higher altitude and in more direct sunlight, where they are more prone to harmful levels of UV radiation, will produce more tannins to protect themselves than grapes grown in the shade and at lower elevation.</p>\n\n<p>You might have noticed that red wines tend to have more tannins than white wines. This is because traditionally, red wine is made from red grapes and the skins are included in the fermentation, while white wine is made from white grapes and the skins are separated out before fermentation. With no skins around during fermentation of white wine, there are no tannins to be had. Rosé is made from red grapes, but the skins are separated before fermentation, as they are for white wines, which is why rosés are lighter in color and tannins than red wines<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. A fun tasting experiment is to try to find a red wine and a rosé from the same producer of the same grape (something to ask about the next time you’re at the wine store!). Tasting these wines side by side will give you a sense of what flavors and sensation come from the grape juice vs. the grape skins.</p>\n\n<p>There is a fourth variety of wine growing in popularity in the US called “orange wine” or “skin contact white wine.” Just like how rosés are made from red grapes in the style of white wines, orange wines are made from white grapes in the style of red wines. That is, orange wines are made by fermenting white grapes without separating out the skins. Therefore, these wines have some of the color and tannic complexity of red wines, with the brightness and acidity of white wines. They come in varying shades from light yellow to deep amber depending on how long the skins were kept mixed into the juice during fermentation. You can ask at your local wine store how much skin contact a particular orange wine has.  If they say 6 months, you’re getting a more tannic and dark orange wine, whereas if they say 24 hours, you’ll be drinking something more akin to a traditional white wine.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t need to know any of this to consume and enjoy the complexity that tannins bring to wine, but it is fun to think about how much more our mouths can do than just taste. Because the drying sensation we get from tannins happens in our mouths, we often talk about tasting them; however, the sense we use to detect tannins is actually touch. By feeling the clumping of saliva proteins in your mouth you’re getting a glimpse into the story of the wine, starting from the conditions of the grape growing in the vineyard, through the fermentation of the grape juice, and finally, into the bottle.  And understanding the mechanism behind our perception can help us bring awareness to the tannins and other features of great wine. You might get so focused that you start to notice differences in the astringency feeling you get from some wines versus others. In fact, people might describe different types of tannins in wine as soft, fine or even velvety.</p>\n\n<p>Finding tannins in food, even beyond wine, can be an effective mindfulness practice. The next time you eat or drink, try to distinguish between what your mouth is feeling versus what you are tasting, and you’ll likely discover many more tannins in food!</p>\n\n<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>\n<p><a name="1">1</a>: Polyphenol molecules are also what gives peated whiskey its smoky taste, which is another example of how sticky these molecules are. In this case, the polyphenols come from the peat that is burned to dry the barley before fermentation. They stick to the barley throughout fermentation, distillation, and decades of aging, allowing us to taste that peat smoke many many years later.</p>\n\n<p><a name="2">2</a>: This is called “aggregation” in chemistry-speak.</p>\n\n<p><a name="3">3</a>: There are some tannins that come from the seeds and stems of the wine, but they are often less prominent than the skin tannins. If a wine is described as “whole cluster”, that means it was fermented with the stems and therefore will have stem tannins. Barrel-aging is another source of tannins—if a wine is aged in barrels, especially new barrels, it will extract tannins from the wood.</p>\n\n<p><a name="4">4</a>: The compounds that give wine most of their color, anthocyanins, are also found in the skins of grapes.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2022-01-25 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

Wells, 1894</em></sup></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n 1862, three years after <em>The Origin of Species</em>, Charles Darwin published <em>On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilized by Insects</em>. Using the mechanics of orchid pollination, Darwin sought to provide empirical evidence for his new theory of evolution. Specifically, since orchids attract pollinating insects with nectar, traits of orchids and insects should have evolved together. When Darwin was sent an orchid from Madagascar with a nectar tube almost a foot in length, he surmised that there must exist an insect with a proboscis—an elongated tubular mouthpart—long enough to reach the nectar. The insect in question was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/oct/02/moth-tongues-orchids-darwin-evolution" target="_blank">discovered 21 years after Darwin’s death</a>. The moth <em>Xanthopan morganii praedicta</em> (translating to “predicted moth”) has a proboscis up to 14 inches long and exclusively pollinates the Madagascar orchid. Darwin’s accurate prediction that the orchid’s floral morphology was adapted to extremely specific pollinators vindicated natural selection as not just metaphysical speculation, but a principle able to generate hypotheses and guide experimentation.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-01-11-orchids-science-and-culture/2022-01-11-moth.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"><i>Xanthopan morganii praedicta</i></p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Esculapio" target="_blank">Esculapio</a>, Wikimedia Commons, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</p>\n\n<p>In his studies, however, one genus of orchid baffled Darwin. Orchids of the genus <em>Ophrys</em> rarely produced nectar but were clearly adapted to insect pollination. Most curiously, they resembled insects enough to be given common names such as bee orchid or fly orchid. Why these orchids had adopted insectiform mimicry, however, remained unclear. Only sixty years later, in the early 20th century, would naturalists Maurice Pouyanne, Edith Coleman, and Masters John Godfery separately answer this question. All of them observed that <em>Ophrys</em> orchids are indeed pollinated by insects, despite not producing nectar to attract them. Rather, the central petal at the base of the bee orchid specifically resembles the abdomen of a female bee, both in texture and in coloration. Males of the species mistake the orchid for a female bee, land on the petal, and attempt to mate with the flower. As the bee does so, its movements dislodge the orchid’s dense packets of pollen onto the bee, which will fertilize the next <em>Ophrys</em> flower the unwitting insect attempts to mate with. Unlike other orchids that leverage insects’ hunger for nectar, the <em>Ophrys</em> orchids leverage their hunger for sex.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-01-11-orchids-science-and-culture/2022-01-11-ophrys-photo.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"><i>Ophrys apifera labellum</i>, the bee orchid</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kocaeli_flora" target="_blank">Hüseyin Cahid Doğan</a>, Wikimedia Commons, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International</p>\n\n<p>Intriguingly, interactions between insects and these orchids were documented by Darwin himself. There are accounts of <em>Ophrys</em> being “attacked” by bees in his 1862 book, though his records read, “The meaning of these attacks, I cannot conjecture.” Though Darwin was making the same observations as the naturalists who would make the discovery sixty years later, he was unable to interpret their significance.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-01-11-orchids-science-and-culture/2022-01-11-ophrys-darwin-drawing.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Darwin''s original 1862 illustration of <i>Ophrys</i>.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Public domain</p>\n\n<p>Darwin’s struggle to understand <em>Ophrys</em> orchid was likely colored by the “<a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1904-06-26/ed-1/seq-54/" target="_blank">orchidelirium</a>” seizing broader Victorian society at that time. These rare flowers were a luxury commodity accessible only to the very wealthy, with desirable varieties selling for <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1906-02-25/ed-1/seq-31/#date1=1836&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;words=hunter+hunters+orchid+orchid-hunter+orchid-hunters&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=orchid+hunters&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1" target="_blank">over $20,000 in today’s money</a>. Demand produced a new professional class of orchid hunters, explorers commissioned by rich patrons to go on expeditions into the tropics. While “delirium” implies fevered psychological compulsion, the Victorian appetite for orchids can also be understood as an exercise in wealth, power, and control. Orchid ownership not only signified riches, but connections, education, and taste—a material avenue through which the hierarchies of Victorian England could be expressed.</p>\n\n<p>Nineteenth-century English society was highly stratified along lines of gender and culture, and the principles underlying Darwin’s own work were extrapolated to justify its social hierarchies. The philosophy of Social Darwinism suggested, rather conveniently, that the current social hierarchy was simply the “natural” outcome of applying natural selection and evolution to human society. The philosopher Herbert Spencer, coiner of the phrase “survival of the fittest,” used the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3177552.pdf" target="_blank">metaphor of the body</a> to describe the Victorian hierarchy of gender and class. Upper or middle-class men were the Head, the seat of reason, and thus suited to rule and govern. Women were the Heart, keepers of emotion and spirituality. Notably, botany, particularly the study of flowers, was a culturally sanctioned science for women, intended to socialize them into rationality and industriousness, and away from feminine frivolity. Cultural hierarchies were also used to justify British colonialism as a “civilizing mission” necessary to “assist” colonies to develop sufficiently sophisticated governments and societies. Therefore, orchids, from yet-unexplored regions beyond the empire’s reach, were seen as passive objects to be acquired and cultivated to English tastes.</p>\n\n<p>The process of acquiring orchids only reinforced their place in Victorian hierarchies as exotic objects. The expeditions were dangerous, and orchid hunting was a hypermasculine arena, far from the feminine associations of botany. Orchid hunters ventured to far-flung locales, lured by the promise of fortune and repute, but often met grisly ends. Moreover, the journey of the intrepid orchid hunter into the tropics was not only a physical danger, but a moral one as well. Explorers were entering a space unregulated by English societal norms and morality, with only their own self-control preventing them from being corrupted away from Victorian gentility. While lurid stories of murder and betrayal among orchid hunters resulted from financial competition rather than any tropical corruption, the idea of the tropics as an inherently transgressive space captured the public imagination. Surviving an orchid hunt acted out a cultural narrative of the triumph of civilization over chaos, of English propriety over deviant morality. In return, victors were rewarded with their own personal part of the tropics, a personal stake in the colonial machine. As the empire expanded with growing networks of colonists, missionaries, and traders, exploring and exploiting the tropics became easier. Maps were drawn, dangers were cataloged, and routes were constructed, enabling increased varieties and numbers of orchids to be shipped to England. The once-unattainable orchid was now safely contained in English greenhouses, stripped of its perilous origins, a tamed and civilized ornament.</p>\n\n<p>This view of the orchid, submissive to male impulses and receptive to “civilizing” forces, could certainly present an obstacle to understanding its actively deceptive and manipulative pollination strategies. In fact, the gradual understanding of its actual biology coincided with and may have benefited from a shift in Victorian society. As the reach of the British empire expanded rapidly through the 19th century, so too did cultural anxiety. The Victorian social hierarchy was being challenged both at home and abroad. The word “feminist” <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23720210?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">entered English usage in the 1890s</a>, with women campaigning for the rights to their own bodily autonomy, such as sexual consent within marriage and the ability to use contraception. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230117389_12" target="_blank">Organized anticolonial movements</a> escalated in the latter half of the century, including years-long armed resistance throughout the African continent and mass political mobilization in South Asia. The assured status of the patriarchal empire no longer seemed so certain, and the exoticizing fascination in cultural narratives took on a distinct element of fear.</p>\n\n<p>These growing fears around gender and loss of empire were conflated in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27278105/" target="_blank">common literary archetype</a> in tropical journey narratives of the 19th century: the “native woman.” She was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3177552.pdf" target="_blank">Other in both race and sex</a>, uncannily seductive, dangerously sensuous, and irrevocably foreign. Previously exotic and passive through the lens of white male protagonists, the “native woman” evolves into something more ominous by the end of the century, often with the help of the orchid. In the pulp magazine story, “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27278105/" target="_blank">The Orchid Horror</a>”, the protagonist is seduced by an unnamed native woman called the Goddess of the Orchids, who sends him to collect an orchid she does not yet have. Upon finding it, he realizes the orchid’s scent is a powerful narcotic, entrapping those who inhale it to the Goddess’s will. Other stories describe secretly carnivorous orchids worn around the necks of native women, or in more literal presentations, monstrous hybrid orchid-women endemic to the tropics. The orchid took on the recurring image of the provocative Other, capable of undermining and subverting hierarchy and social order—the flower as exotic seductress, as <em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/femme%20fatale" target="_blank">femme fatale</a></em>. The ending of the 1894 short story,  “<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/2865/" target="_blank">The Flowering of the Strange Orchid</a>,” by science fiction author H.G. Wells lays these anxieties bare: the unsuspecting protagonist is overwhelmed by the orchid’s sickly-sweet scent and is seized by its bloodsucking roots. The orchid he had assumed was a harmless beauty turns out to be a vampiric predator, and he is only saved by his housekeeper, who was suspicious of the overtly foreign bloom. The creeping unease is obvious: what if the subjugated are no longer truly within our control? In this space, so far from the assumptions of Darwin’s Victorian England, an orchid pollinated by providing false sexual promises is no longer far-fetched.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2022-01-11-orchids-science-and-culture/2022-01-11-pulp-horror.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Interior illustration, <i>Amazing Stories</i>, March 1928 by Frank R. Paul</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Public domain</p>\n\n<p>The slow discovery of <em>Ophrys</em> pollination illustrates the dialectic of scientific discovery: social context continuously influences the way we do and understand science. <em>Ophrys</em> pollination had to be observed, but it also had to be interpreted. Exactly how it was interpreted was dependent on the social and cultural narratives surrounding it. As science historian Jim Endersby concisely puts it in his book <em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo24044571.html" target="_blank">Orchid: A Cultural History</a></em>, “There is no stable boundary between the natural and the cultural.” For <em>Ophrys</em> pollination to be understood as an act of sexual deception, three intertwined cultural ideas—femininity, foreignness, and flowers—had to be simultaneously reimagined as active subjects instead of passive objects. The destabilization of Victorian society was a powerful catalyst for this reimagination: the greater emancipation of English women and the emergence of organized anticolonial movements challenged what were once thought of as “natural” hierarchies, inspiring reactionary consternation and manifesting as sublimated fears in popular culture like “The Flowering of the Strange Orchid.”</p>\n\n<p>Femininity, seduction, and deception remain entwined with <em>Ophrys</em> pollination even today, and the orchid continues to report on changing, though not necessarily improved, cultural hierarchies: tellingly, some botanists still refer to the bee orchid by another common name: the prostitute flower. While we may prefer to believe that the empirical process of science is completely separated from our sociocultural beliefs, the parallel shifts in the cultural and scientific understanding of orchids tell another story. Like an insect enticed by <em>Ophrys</em>, we labor under a compelling belief, but ultimately an illusory one.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2022-01-11 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

With further mastery of each set of laws came a new chapter in the history of mankind. Newton’s laws unlocked the secrets of motion. We have used his discoveries to build bridges and skyscrapers, and send rockets to the moon. The laws of thermodynamics brought about the engines that make our cars run, the refrigerators that preserve our food, and the machinery of the industrial revolution. The laws of electricity and magnetism taught us how to power our cities, to build the electronics in our cellphones and laptops, and to communicate with people halfway across the globe. But there is a set of laws in physics that we have not yet learned to fully exploit, and these are the laws of quantum mechanics. These laws describe very small things like atoms and molecules, and very cold things, hundreds of degrees below freezing. At these extremes, the physics of everyday life completely breaks down, and light and matter behave in very bizarre ways.</p>\n\n<p>To understand this behavior, let’s take a crash course on quantum physics.</p>\n\n<p>You’re probably familiar with the idea of a state. Traffic lights can be in one of three states: green, yellow, or red. Coins have two states: heads or tails. In the quantum world, objects exist in states with very specific physical properties. Atoms, for example, have <em>energy states</em>, where their energies take on specific values—we say the energies are <em>quantized</em>, hence the term ‘quantum mechanics’. In each energy state, electrons move around the atom with different speeds and spatial patterns. This is like if you were driving a car, but instead of gradually speeding up when you step on the gas, you jump spontaneously to different speeds: 10mph to 20mph to 50mph.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s more complicated than that: quantum objects behave wildly differently when we’re not looking at them. Before we look at a quantum object, it has no well-defined physical properties like energy, position, or speed. Instead, a quantum object exists in a combination of all of its possible states <em>simultaneously</em>, until someone looks at it. At that moment, the object pops into existence in a single state (there are other interpretations of this effect involving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZacggH9wB7Y&amp;t=182s" target="_blank">multiple universes</a>, but we’ll leave that for another day). The very act of <em>looking</em> at a quantum object changes its state.</p>\n\n<p>That’s like a car approaching a fork in the road, but instead of going down one path or the other, it exists in two different locations at once and travels down <em>both</em> paths. But the moment someone clocks the car’s speed, it pops into existence at a single place. It sounds ridiculous, but this is the reality of the quantum world. When we’re not looking, the tiniest objects like electrons can be in multiple places or move in different directions at once (though in reality it’s a bit more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv-YXKRUheQ" target="_blank">subtle</a>). We call this behavior <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwWRX9IdblE&amp;t=663s" target="_blank"><em>superposition</em></a>.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-11-03-quantum-revolution/car_.gif" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">A car traveling down a path that splits. If the car obeyed quantum physics, then it does not go down one path or the other; it partially goes down both paths at once while no one is looking. As soon as someone looks, the car randomly appears on one of the two paths and the version of the car traveling down the opposite path disappears.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Jennah Colborn</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps weirdest of all is that multiple quantum objects can behave in a coordinated way, where the state of one object <a href="https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/untangling-entanglement" target="_blank">seems to affect</a> the state of another, no matter where they are in the universe. Imagine having a pair of coins that always land on the same face when you flip them. If one coin lands on heads, the other coin will land on heads, even if they are on opposite sides of the galaxy. It sounds like wizardry, but this is the essence of a real phenomenon called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unb_yoj1Usk" target="_blank"><em>entanglement</em></a>, one of the most powerful resources of the quantum world. We observe entanglement in how electrons spin, how light propagates, how atoms move, and much more.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-11-03-quantum-revolution/coin_flip.gif" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Two coins that were brought to opposite sides of the galaxy. If the coins are entangled, then no matter when or where the coins get flipped, they will land on the same face.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Jennah Colborn</p>\n\n<p>What if we could tap into these strange properties? What could we do with them? This question is the foundation of quantum information, an emerging frontier of science. After a few decades of research, <em>quantum information</em> is poised to have a dramatic impact on science and technology.</p>\n\n<p>To understand how, let’s look at the simple idea that kickstarted today’s information revolution: all of the information in our computers is stored as a string of 1’s and 0’s. The text you just sent? Your recent bank transaction? The color of the pixels on your screen? All have a special code in your computer made of a specific combination of 1’s and 0’s. Each digit of this code is called a <em>bit</em>, and they are the fundamental building blocks of today’s information.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, 1 and 0 are just mathematical abstractions, so these bits are encoded in real life through the voltage in tiny electrical switches. ‘0’ corresponds to the switch being OFF, and ‘1’ corresponds to the switch being ON. Each computer chip contains billions of these switches, flipping on and off in a desired way to store and process information. The essence of solving a problem on a computer is flipping these switches into a final configuration that represents the answer to the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the way information behaves depends on the physical object that carries the information. In today’s computers, our information carriers can only do one of two things: turn on and turn off. What if we could store information inside something else, something that behaves fundamentally differently? That’s where quantum information comes in.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of electrical switches, the 1’s and 0’s in quantum information are stored in the quantum states of light and matter. This could be, for example, the energy states of an atom. ‘0’ corresponds to one energy state, and ‘1’ corresponds to a different energy state. Because of this, information behaves in a much richer way than before: information can exist in superposition and be entangled. The bits in quantum information, called <em>qubits</em>, can be 1, 0, or a superposition of 1 and 0 simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>Add more qubits, and the complexity increases. Two bits can have four states: ‘00’, ‘01’, ‘10’, or ‘11’. A superposition of two qubits allows them to be in all four states simultaneously. A three-qubit superposition has eight states, four have sixteen, and so on. Just 60 qubits in superposition have over one <em>quintillion</em> possible states, more than the world’s biggest supercomputers. A <em>quantum computer</em> made of 60 qubits could store and manipulate all of that information <em>simultaneously</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The caveat is that we can’t access all of that information. Just like the car approaching the fork in the road, as soon as we look at the qubits, the superposition is destroyed and only a single state out of the one quintillion is revealed to us. This is bad for computation: how do we know that the one state revealed to us contains the right answer? It boils down to the <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta/course/introduction-course" target="_blank">mathematics</a>, but scientists have found clever ways to control qubits in some algorithms to get around this problem. The result is that these quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems that are far beyond the capabilities of conventional computers.</p>\n\n<p>One example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD370qyxTyw" target="_blank">quantum simulation</a>, where we program a computer to replicate the behavior of the atoms, electrons, and nuclei in a chemical or material. Quantum simulation helps us understand how atoms and electrons interact to give chemicals their properties. This could pave the way for developing life-saving drugs, new energy sources, and a better understanding of the universe itself. Today’s computers are surprisingly bad at quantum simulation, because it requires keeping track of all possible quantum states of a complex arrangement of atoms. A typical drug like penicillin has more quantum states than the number of atoms in the universe. We couldn’t simulate its full quantum structure on a conventional computer within our lifetime. Quantum computers are uniquely poised for this task, because qubits obey quantum physics exactly the same way the states of a molecule do. A quantum computer with roughly 100-1000 qubits could simulate molecules like penicillin within a few days. Quantum computers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvIbrDR1G_c" target="_blank">aren’t all-powerful</a>, though. This type of magnificent speedup is only possible for a few problems, but these problems have enormous implications for a wide range of industries.</p>\n\n<p>We can also use qubits to send information more securely through a <em>quantum internet</em>. We’re constantly sharing important information online: credit cards, social security numbers, and more. Ensuring information is secure online is a crucial aspect of the internet. As computers get smarter and faster, it becomes easier for hackers to access your important information without you knowing. In fact, an alarming problem that a large (thousands of qubits) quantum computer would be very good at is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q&amp;t=846s" target="_blank">breaking RSA encryption</a> - the method that protects most of your information on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Quantum information is much trickier to hack. It hinges on the idea that looking at a qubit changes its state. Imagine you want to share information stored in qubits. If a hacker tries to read the message, the qubits containing the message will change their state, revealing random gibberish. Scientists have developed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiJiXNEm-Go" target="_blank"> <em>quantum encryption protocols</em></a> based on this idea. It’s a guaranteed way to know if a hacker is tampering with sensitive information. For this reason, a quantum internet has the attention of banks, governments, and schools.</p>\n\n<p>But perhaps the most exciting answer to what quantum information will be useful for is this: <em>no one really knows</em>. 50 years ago, we could never have predicted the enormous impact computers and the internet would have on our daily lives. The explosion of the Information Age came about through decades of experimentation. It’s likely we’ll see the same with quantum information: the most exciting applications may only reveal themselves once the technology starts maturing.</p>\n\n<p>So where are we in this grand vision? We have quantum devices with 50-100 qubits, but we can’t control them accurately enough to really do anything useful with them yet. This is because quantum states are incredibly sensitive to their environment. Remember that looking at a quantum object changes its state, but it’s not just us humans that do the looking. Everything in the environment can “look” at a qubit by interacting with it, from static charge to vibrations in the ground to molecules in the air. Even the tiniest disturbance can alter the state of a qubit, which leads to corrupted information. It’s like trying to balance a pencil on its tip: even the slightest push can topple the pencil. It’s why scientists are building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV1wL5jsfRU" target="_blank"> intricate</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-FyH2A7Ed0" target="_blank"> protective machinery</a> to isolate qubits from the outside world. Even then, it’s not enough.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, scientists have spent years developing protocols for detecting and correcting these errors. These protocols are known as <em>quantum error correction codes</em>, and they are the reason we believe quantum technology is feasible even in the presence of errors. In a quantum error correction code, the 1’s and 0’s aren’t the qubits themselves, but how the qubits are <em>entangled</em>. Let’s go back to the pair of entangled quantum coins. There are two possible ways they can be entangled. In one way, the coins always land on the same face. In the other way, the coins always land on opposite faces. We can call ‘0’ the state where the coins land the same, and ‘1’ the state where the coins land opposite. The stored information is protected because even if one of the coins is disturbed, the information about how the coins are entangled remains hidden to the environment unless <em>both</em> of the coins are disturbed.</p>\n\n<p>This protection comes at a cost: you need two qubits to encode one ‘protected’ qubit. Practical error correction protocols are more extravagant and require tens, hundreds, even thousands of entangled qubits per protected qubit. This means that quantum technology of any practical use requires control of thousands, even millions of qubits, far off from the number we have today.  No need to worry about quantum computers breaking the internet any time soon.</p>\n\n<p>But we’re making progress: over the last 20 years we’ve gone from pen and paper ideas to functional intermediately-sized quantum machines. We’re playing with atoms, light, and ultra-cold electronics in the lab, learning to harness their properties. We’re beginning to demonstrate the first quantum error correction protocol, sending qubits <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QlcKuxDGrs" target="_blank"> over hundreds of miles</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZNEzzDcllU" target="_blank"> doing calculations </a> on quantum computers that surpass the capabilities of our traditional computers. That said, large-scale quantum technology with practical relevance to our lives will likely only arrive once we figure out how to implement quantum error correction. How long will that take? No one really knows for sure: it could be 5 years, 5 decades, or more, but the work we do now will pave the way for that long-term vision.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2021-11-03 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

I had tutored before, but never through a computer screen, and I was anticipating challenges. However, when teaching a high school biology module on population genetics, I discovered a koi pond simulation<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The student and I watched as the fish in our virtual pond changed from orange to white over simulated generations, with young fish appearing and old fish disappearing. With just a few buttons, the student could adjust the parameters that affect the rates of evolutionary change in the koi population, like the number of fish and rate of genetic mutation, and rerun the simulation. As the koi changed from orange to white faster or slower, I saw the principles of evolution and genetics begin to click into place for the student. While this koi pond simulation may not have the aesthetics and user experience of today’s most popular video games, I was still impressed. The use of interactive virtual games was certainly not a widely available learning tool when I was a high school student, but over the past year of tutoring, I repeatedly discovered that virtual games are an effective way to teach.</p>\n\n<p>I might not have found the koi pond simulation if the COVID-19 pandemic had not forced me to meet with my student remotely. During the pandemic, many teachers turned to new virtual tools out of necessity, but even as many students return to the classroom, interactive and engaging virtual worlds could continue to be a valuable resource for teaching.</p>\n\n<p>The video game industry and the rise of virtual reality (VR) have laid the groundwork to make science education virtual. People who play video games spend an average of 7 hours a week in the virtual world<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In America, 60% of 18-29 year olds are gamers<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. Not only do more young people play video games, but they also spend the most time, averaging 8 hours per week with a preference for strategy and puzzle games<sup><a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a></sup>. Young gamers demonstrate incredible focus, persistence, attention to detail, patience, and creativity as they conquer each challenge and improve towards mastery. These are some of the same traits that are key to excelling in a different arena: science<sup><a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a></sup>. By adopting techniques successfully used in gaming, science education could more effectively captivate the interest of young people in primary and secondary school to improve scientific literacy and preparation for careers in science.</p>\n\n<p>Immersive design is a key element that keeps people playing. Gamers are engrossed by well-developed characters and stories that require constant interaction<sup><a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a></sup>. But it’s not just the story that keeps people hooked—background music<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> and interactive, aesthetic graphics<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> engage people in the virtual world. Elements of achievement and competition, such as the use of progress bars, level advancement, fake currency, prizes, and increased challenge as the user advances, help to keep gamers motivated and provide feedback<sup><a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>While the use of virtual interactive environments is starting to trickle into classrooms, the immersive design of technologies like video games and VR could purposefully be applied towards making science education more engaging. Scientific objectives could be part of a story where the student is a key character that actively participates by advancing through the material. Through engaging music and graphics<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>, the virtual format could bring abstract ideas to life or create more authentic and inspiring visualizations of cells or ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike a large classroom, the video game experience can be very individualized. The gaming interface makes it possible for learners to receive instantaneous, personalized feedback on their progress toward mastering scientific concepts through repetition. Students come from varying backgrounds and skill levels, and with the customized options of a video game, students can complete side quests for supplementary material to reward curiosity, spend more or less time on topics catered to their unique strengths and weaknesses, and progress towards mastery in a way not possible in a traditional classroom. The video game format could make education more immersive, individualized, and therefore, effective<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The design and mechanisms used in popular games can serve as inspiration to guide the gamification of scientific concepts. Take <em>Tetris</em>, a tile-matching game in which the user manipulates tiles to fill gaps under increasing time pressure as the user advances. A similar setup could be used to teach DNA transcription to RNA, as the user matches complementary base pairs of DNA and RNA nucleotides. Alternatively, inspired by <em>Mario Kart</em>, blood cells could race through the circulatory system, refueling with oxygen at the lungs and even delivering medications to treat obstacles like clots. For a more creative or survival themed game, the user could ward off viral or bacterial infections by producing an antibody response or applying therapeutics while learning how they work.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-10-19-video-games-stem-education/Mario_final.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"></p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://karenaxcai.com/" target="_blank"> Illustration by Karena Cai for Caltech Letters</a></p>\n\n<p>Video games demonstrate a long-established ability to engage the public in everything from education to exercise. <em>Wii Sports</em> and <em>Pokémon Go</em> got users moving, off the couch and into the neighborhood respectively, gaining attention not only for their interactive formats, but also for their fitness benefits<sup><a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a></sup>. On the education front, <em>Where in the World is Carmen SanDiego?</em> incorporates history, geography, and culture as players follow the titular character on her global crime-solving missions<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. <em>The Oregon Trail</em> similarly educates players on the harsh trials of the U.S. westward migration in the 19th century<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>. Both of these games have persisted in public consciousness years after they were first used in schools. The science-based television shows <em>Bill Nye the Science Guy</em> and <em>The Magic School Bus</em> and disease-combating board game Pandemic have also achieved mainstream popularity<sup><a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a></sup>. These successes show it is possible for broad science education to be engaging—perhaps now through a video game format.</p>\n\n<p>Promising efforts to use virtual worlds to enhance science research and education are already underway. In the video game <em>InCell VR</em><sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>, the player races to save a human cell from destruction by a virus while learning biology concepts along the way. Use of VR technology in <em>InCell VR</em> and other games shows promise for making science education even more interactive and collaborative<sup><a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a></sup>. Use of VR for training in science-related professions is also expanding: neurosurgeons can now practice operating on a virtual brain<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>, and scientists at Purdue University are developing VR courses for training in cryo-electron microscopy<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>, the topic of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Such applications demonstrate the value of immersive virtual learning environments for technical education.</p>\n\n<p>With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have had to adapt to a new age of “Zoom learning”. However, this isn’t the only way to approach remote learning. Since 2018, Caltech has also been developing a software prototype for a VR teaching space to provide a virtual environment for college-level education. In this virtual classroom, students have streamlined options to interact with the instructor, other students, and 3D scientific models, all with the click of a button<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>. Science teachers can use this technology to instantaneously assess understanding of the materials and rapidly customize activities to each student’s needs, creating a more personalized and immersive educational experience. Likewise, students can instantly and privately indicate confusion and get extra practice on difficult material, promoting inclusivity. Development of these new educational tools could not only facilitate more effective remote teaching during the current pandemic, but also expand the capabilities of future classrooms to tackle persistent challenges.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-10-19-video-games-stem-education/question_button.gif" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"></p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://karenaxcai.com/" target="_blank"> Illustration by Karena Cai for Caltech Letters</a></p>\n\n<p>Despite the potential benefits of incorporating this immersive technology into schools, this objective faces the same major hurdle as most educational endeavors: money. Video gaming is a massive industry that generated $120 billion in revenue in 2019<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>, but production costs can range in the millions for games with advanced graphics and modern software-development tools<sup><a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a></sup>. It is not clear if the government, schools, individuals, or some combination would contribute most to profits that drive production. Nevertheless, <em>The Oregon Trail</em> generated around ten million dollars in revenue annually by 1995, demonstrating the potential profitability of educational games<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>. The rising U.S. learning-based game market is also promising: valued at $2.4 billion in 2018, the value is projected to exceed $4 billion by 2024<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>. Heavy collaboration between educators and game developers seems critical to create games that are both educational and engaging (and therefore profitable)<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>. However, the impact of even a great science game will only extend as far as the number of people it reaches. While games like <em>The Oregon Trail</em> show us that popularity and revenue are possible for educational games, disparities in technology access and public school funding remain a hurdle for video games to be a truly equalizing force in science education.</p>\n\n<p>Combining immersive and entertaining virtual worlds with instructional design that meets learning objectives is key for this educational strategy to be successful. Using the interactive format of video games and VR in the classroom could not only increase engagement but also make science education more personalized, inclusive, and therefore, effective. Gamification of education to reach a diverse audience of young people may lead to a more informed world, increased appreciation for science, and preparation for a career in STEM. It is time VR headsets and game controllers made their way into the classroom, giving education an overdue technological upgrade to immerse students in science.</p>\n\n<h4 id="references">References</h4>\n\n<p><a name="1">1</a>:<a href="http://virtualbiologylab.org/ModelsHTML5/PopGenFishbowl/PopGenFishbowl.html" target="_blank">PopGen Fishbowl - Virtual Biology Lab</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="2">2</a>: <a href="https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019" target="_blank">The State of Online Gaming – 2019.

As the pandemic slowed and the campus gradually sputtered back to life, we celebrated the publication of our 40th feature-length science article and the second year of our viewpoints section.

Their building blocks are billions of tiny nucleotides—denoted by the letters A, C, T, G—which form instructions for cells to grow, die, or behave in certain ways.  This story, of course, is well-known to folks who remember high school biology.</p>\n\n<p>But how do cells actually read and interpret the contents of a genome? Given an almost endless list of instructions, when do cells know which ones to follow, and in what order? Enter the realm of gene regulation. Although they may seem like a static jumble of letters, genomes in fact operate dynamically and—like a novel—are richly infused with their own grammar, punctuation, and plot.</p>\n\n<p>Graduate students Suzy Beeler (PhD ‘21) and Nicholas McCarty explain how today’s biologists and physicists decode the beautiful, chaotic language through which genes express themselves.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://caltechletters.org/science/decoding-the-language-of-genomes">Read the article</a></p>\n\n<h3 id="geologists-and-the-earth-building-a-better-symbiosis"><a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/geologic-symbiosis"><strong>Geologists and the Earth: Building a Better Symbiosis</strong></a></h3>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2020-21-year-in-review/symbiosis_cover.jpeg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption"></p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Illustration by <a href="https://sarahzeichner.com" target="_blank">Sarah Zeichner</a> for Caltech Letters</p>\n\n<p>Objectivity is frequently viewed as a core tenet of the scientific method.

But until recently, detailed, distributor-level data on sales of opioids has been kept behind closed doors, posing challenges to researchers who have sought to reconstruct the epidemic’s path.

I was a freshman and she was a junior, and we were the only two women majoring in physics in Avery House. My first impression of Cassidy was that she was a little awkward, but nice. I remember being a little surprised when I got her email about participating in an Avery House Secret Santa: I hadn’t expected her to be involved in house-wide activities. As I got to know Cassidy better, she became like the older sister that I never had. I may not have been her closest friend, but she always offered help when I was struggling with problem sets, needed a ride to a play when I felt too anxious to ask anyone, or working on my graduate school applications. To remember who Cassidy was to me, I reflect back on the days I spent with her at Princeton in late March of 2018.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-05-18-memory-of-cassidy/Cassidy_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Cassidy Yang (Caltech class of 2016) and her sister Angel passed away in a car accident in December 2020.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>\n\n<p>Cassidy was my host when I made an unofficial visit as a potential graduate student in her program. When I arrived at her apartment on the night of March 26, Cassidy told me that she was going to sleep on the couch and that I should take her bed. I asked if she was sure—I was only there to meet people, while she had to go to the lab early the next morning—but she insisted. That was so typical of Cassidy as a friend, always worrying about others first. She was even concerned that she would wake me up while getting ready in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Cassidy was in the second year of her PhD and my visit was only a day after she had flown back from a conference in Los Angeles. While I was visiting her place in Princeton, she told me about her research on the collective behavior of social bacteria called <em>Myxococcus</em> and showed me her slides and some cool movies she had taken of the bacteria. I was amazed by Cassidy’s research on these droplets full of thousands of cool, little bugs.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-05-18-memory-of-cassidy/Cassidy_March_meeting_presentation.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Cassidy presenting her research on Myxococcus at a conference.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>\n\n<p>I remember asking Cassidy what she liked to do outside of research, and she told me she enjoyed inviting people over for dinner and making food for them. At a Princeton memorial on December 8th, 2020, several of Cassidy’s friends talked about her love of hosting, describing Friendsgiving gatherings and dumpling-making events at her apartment.</p>\n\n<p>Cassidy also told me what it was like to be a graduate student at Princeton, and not all of her comments were positive. She told me how frustrating it was when the WiFi was broken in a graduate residence hall, and how it took a ridiculous amount of time to get it fixed. She complained about not getting enough mentorship in the department. But what I admire most about Cassidy is that she didn’t just complain about things. She understood what needed to be changed, and she never stopped taking actions to make those changes happen—often behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<p>She reached out to the administrators of her department to work on making the Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB) program better and more inclusive. Whenever there was a new member in her lab, she was the one who made sure they got to know everyone and made them feel comfortable in a new environment. She shared ideas with her colleagues, gave helpful feedback, and practiced talks with people. She was also in charge of the QCB happy hours and mentored undergraduate women in physics throughout her PhD. Cassidy knew that people needed a better support network, especially in graduate school, and she helped create one. When I told Cassidy I’d accepted a position at Harvard, she wished me the best for my PhD career. Even though I went to a different school, we knew we would keep seeing each other, since we were in the same field.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-05-18-memory-of-cassidy/Cassidy_Getty_group_photo.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Cassidy (front row, center) was heavily involved in Avery House activities while at Caltech, including this group trip to the Getty Center.

At the end of my first year in the Harvard Molecules, Cells, and Organisms program, I had my own recruit. He had to visit on his own, since he missed the official recruitment week. When my program director told me about this, my first thought was that I should organize a dinner with my recruit and invite all my classmates, just like Cassidy had done for me. When I had visited Princeton, I had been worried because I had missed the department’s official recruitment events. But after Cassidy had invited more than 10 grad students to a dinner for just a single recruit—me—I had felt welcomed, and I hadn’t felt awkward anymore. Normally, I would have been too overwhelmed to organize an event like a big group dinner, but Cassidy made me step out of my comfort zone because her kindness and consideration had meant so much to me.</p>\n\n<p>The last time I met Cassidy in person was at the American Physical Society’s (APS) March meeting in Boston in 2019. I missed her talk because I had a class that day, but she came to mine. I regret so much that I missed her presentation. We were supposed to meet again at last year’s March meeting in Denver, but the conference was cancelled at the last minute due to concerns over COVID-19. I wanted to make it to her talk this time, ask her about a new exciting paper on <em>Myxococcus</em> that her group had published, and hang out with all of the Avery physics folks. I had no doubt that when she defended her thesis next year, we would all get together and celebrate all the great things she achieved during her PhD and what an amazing friend she was to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>It has been really difficult to cope with losing Cassidy and her sister Angel so suddenly, and I can’t imagine how heartbreaking it has been for the people who spent more time with her. Yet I am truly grateful that I had Cassidy in my life. She inspired me in so many ways, and even now I am discovering more and more incredible things that she gave us by reconnecting with all the amazing people who knew her.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-05-18-memory-of-cassidy/Cassidy_March_meeting_escape_room.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Cassidy and some of her friends from Princeton after successfully completing an escape room in Boston while at the March 2019 APS meeting.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>\n\n<p>I want to close by sharing a story about a beautiful Sunday I spent with Cassidy and two of our Avery housemates, Joseph and Yubo, during the APS meeting in March 2019 in Boston. In the morning, we were going to have brunch at Cafe Luna, but it was too crowded. Instead, we went to a cafe called Juliet. During the Lyft ride to the cafe, Yubo left his phone in the car. The driver was kind enough to drive back to return his phone. Cassidy offered to pay for the lost item fee, although Yubo wouldn’t let her. After brunch, we hung out at Joseph’s place, playing board games and hanging out with Joseph’s roommate’s cat, Marbles. Cassidy brought a cute board game called Root, Yubo and I brought some desserts from a bake sale at Harvard, and Joseph baked a cake for us. We were already full from all the desserts before heading to Spring Shabu Shabu, one of the best restaurants in the city. We wanted to have an early dinner because Cassidy had signed up for an escape room that night with her Princeton friends. The restaurant was jam-packed as always, so we walked through the Petco next door while we waited. I still have a video of a guinea pig sleeping with its mouth open, which I found hilarious. We ate so much (including the ice cream for dessert) and Cassidy left early to have fun with her other group of friends. During that week, we had a big snow storm after a very warm winter. Nobody could stop complaining about the weather, but it was the most beautiful week I have ever had in Boston. And Cassidy was there.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2021-05-18 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

One of the rare chances to hear someone’s full career trajectory is at a series of events hosted by Caltech’s Women in Chemistry group. These wonderfully low-key breakfast events take place in the historic Gates Chemistry Library. I’ve heard many different women share their stories over the space of an hour, yet even these conversations never seem to fully explore their paths. The career paths described sometimes seemed incredibly straightforward: <em>I have loved science since I was five years old, I went to graduate school, and finally, I got my dream job as a professor.</em> They might mention a departure from the typical trajectory or hardships encountered along the way, but these conversations, like the thirty second-introductions, are still a compressed version of the facts.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-04-06-meritocracy/img1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">A photo in the Gates Library after a Women in Chemistry breakfast event with Professor Corrina Hess (seated, white shirt) in 2018. The author is seated on the far right.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Elise Tookmanian</p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you my thirty-second introduction.</p>\n\n<p>I grew up outside of Philadelphia and graduated from high school near the top of my class with a deep love of learning and science. I attended Franklin &amp; Marshall College, a small liberal arts college in Pennsylvania with superb undergraduate research opportunities. After working hard in a lab there for three years, I published two first-author papers and received awards from the Chemistry department. I applied to several schools for graduate school but chose Caltech for its top-tier chemistry department. There, I joined Dianne Newman’s lab to do exciting interdisciplinary research in the field of geobiology. While at Caltech, I became an editor for Caltech Letters and plan to pursue a career in science communication after I graduate.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds nice, right?</p>\n\n<p>It’s all true, but it certainly isn’t the full story. This thirty-second introduction obscures my privileges, my struggles, and even my good luck. These details can easily become invisible because, especially in the United States and in academia, society constantly reinforces the idea that the world functions as a meritocracy. In a meritocracy, wealth, power, and opportunity are distributed to individuals based on talent and effort alone. It’s the tempting idea that race, class, or your family background don’t affect your future, that you can do well in life if you work hard. Meritocracy perpetuates the false beliefs that you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, that every kindergartener could be President one day, and that SAT or GRE scores are <a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/gre-selects" target="_blank">predictive of academic success</a>. The data consistently show the opposite. Race and background play demonstrable roles in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/interactives/racial-and-ethnic-gaps-in-the-u-s-persist-on-key-demographic-indicators/" target="_blank">measures of success</a>—especially in the context of <a href="https://heri.ucla.edu/nih/downloads/ASHE2013-URM-Grad-Students-in-STEM.pdf" target="_blank">STEM</a> higher education. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that even the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/05/financial-and-health-impacts-of-covid-19-vary-widely-by-race-and-ethnicity/" target="_blank">economic fallout of the pandemic</a> and <a href="cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fracial-ethnic-minorities.html" target="_blank">the virus itself</a> disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority groups. Meritocracy would have us believe that any of these failures are due to character flaws—laziness or lack of intelligence. In reality, these statistics are the fallout of systemic discrimination that cannot be overcome by determination alone. Meritocracy preserves the status quo of white supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, and class divisions by simply saying that they don’t exist. We’re all just blank slates with the same world of opportunities at our feet.</p>\n\n<p>The story of my life that more accurately accounts for the factors outside my control goes something like this.</p>\n\n<p>I grew up outside Philadelphia in a family of six. We were comfortably middle-class and never worried about necessities. Both of my parents graduated from college, so it was always assumed that we would have the opportunity to do the same. My mom didn’t have to work and chose to homeschool my siblings and me for a few years instead. She gave me a lot of specialized attention as I was learning to read and write, but also the freedom to explore whatever was interesting to me. These experiences fostered my love of learning, reading, and writing. My high school was well-funded and offered many AP classes. Taking these AP classes boosted my GPA and prepared me to take the same courses again in college. When I was accepted to different colleges and received the financial aid packages, I chose a school that was slightly more expensive because it was a good investment. I didn’t have to worry about going into debt. I had my family to fall back on, and I didn’t need to financially support them. Beyond that, I simply assumed that I would be able to get a good job and pay off my student loans without any problems. My background, growing up middle-class with two parents who graduated from college, normalized these assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>As a white woman growing up in a majority white town, I never felt that I didn’t belong. I chose to attend Franklin &amp; Marshall College and later Caltech without a single thought to my race. The note on Caltech’s application encouraging students from underrepresented groups to apply didn’t give me pause. I could choose these schools because I knew I would feel comfortable there. Their reputations as “elite” schools were positive features; I didn’t have to consider that the descriptor is often <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-s-higher-education-system-perpetuates-white-privilege-report-says/" target="_blank">correlated with</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/opinion/affirmative-action-new-york-harvard.html" target="_blank">whiteness</a>. Even choosing to continue in academia and attend graduate school was a comfortable decision. My whiteness allowed me to move through these white academic spaces easily, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01741-7">never doubting that I belonged there</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond my privileges, I also had some good old-fashioned luck along the way. When I started doing research, I was given a project that turned out to be relatively straightforward. When other students spent weeks trying to get their proteins to crystallize, my protein happened to crystallize on my very first attempt. I published this project with my advisors, and I spent the next year expanding on this work to publish a second paper. I worked hard, but I was also very lucky to be given that specific project in that particular lab.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-04-06-meritocracy/img2.jpeg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The author stands in front of her poster titled Development of a Vibrational Hydration Ruler at the 2015 Biophysical Society Meeting.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Elise Tookmanian</p>\n\n<p>This second version of my story is longer. And it accounts for only some of the luck, circumstance, and privileges that got me to Caltech. It is difficult to reconsider my accomplishments in the broader context of my privilege—I can no longer take full credit for my success. However, this version doesn’t negate my hard work or talents or drive. This version simply recognizes that there was more at play in the opportunities that presented themselves and my decision-making along the way.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way that meritocracy gives meaning to our success, it also gives meaning to our failure. When I got to graduate school, meritocracy flipped on its head. What had previously buoyed my belief in my belonging and success now became a source of deep insecurity and shame. My struggles became evidence that I didn’t belong at Caltech or even in graduate school, a reflection of my inadequacy. Within the framework of meritocracy, everything I did reflected my innate worth: my faults, my merits. When the problem is you, how do you escape it? Meritocracy puts all the weight on the individual: both success and failure. If you succeed, it’s because you are talented, but if you fail, it is because you are broken.</p>\n\n<p>These harsh dichotomies are not a fair or truthful way to view ourselves or the world. Outside of meritocracy, there are more realistic ways to understand failure. I failed because science is a place where things should fail most of the time. I failed because I was learning. I failed because I beat myself up for failing, making it harder and harder to try again. I failed because I was struggling with anxiety, a condition that surfaced during grad school and takes a lot of effort to manage. I failed because maybe graduate school wasn’t exactly right for me. Not because I am not smart or talented, but because it wasn’t a good fit. I missed the concrete goals and the opportunities to try new things that I had during my liberal arts college experience, and I learned how much I enjoyed writing and having an impact in my community. No hard feelings. It’s not me, it’s just, well, graduate school.</p>\n\n<p>I say “failed,” but my time in graduate school hasn’t been a failure. “Failed” may be the first word that comes to my mind because meritocracy is hardwired into my very neurons, but it (again) isn’t the truth. I may not have a thesis full of experimental data, but my contributions are still valuable. I’ve learned so much about myself and even discovered what I want to try next. The truth is graduate school was a really hard time for me, and that doesn’t define me as a person.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-04-06-meritocracy/img3.jpeg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The author sits in front of her laboratory bench at Caltech in the fall of 2016.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Elise Tookmanian</p>\n\n<p>I try to hold these truths together as a way to bring form to this invisible force in the world. I can be hardworking, benefit from white supremacy, and find it difficult to start working some mornings. This isn’t always an easy task. But, maybe it is getting easier. According to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/03/02/most-americans-point-to-circumstances-not-work-ethic-as-reasons-people-are-rich-or-poor/" target="_blank">Pew Center Research report</a> in 2020, 65% of adults in the United States say that some people are rich because they have had more advantages in life, rather than due to hard work. This erosion of the myth of meritocracy gives me hope.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I listen to the thirty-second introductions before seminars, I try to remember that I’m listening to a story. Stories help us better understand ourselves and our world. Stories simplify and make sense of information. But they undoubtedly lose some complexity in the telling. They are only an approximation of reality. We don’t always have time to get into all the details. Our stories about ourselves or others rely on shorthand and tropes in the same way that a movie or book does. And just as we should critique and analyze the media we consume, I think it is time to critique the stories we tell about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>By taking into account our privileges and our roadblocks, we can take control of our personal narratives. This empowering act decouples our worth and our “success” or “failure” by reevaluating our efforts within the bigger, more complex landscape that surrounds us. As we take control of our personal narrative, we can fight off our imposter syndrome and extend empathy to those around us. We can change how we read other people’s stories. When <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/31/us-college-faculty-student-diversity/" target="_blank">hiring a new faculty member</a>, admitting the next class of graduate students, or giving out awards, we can use this knowledge of our inequitable world to give someone a bit of good luck. In recognizing the myth of meritocracy, perhaps we can change the landscape to create the more just world we desire.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2021-04-06 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

When my doctor prescribed me a buffet of pain relievers after I got my wisdom teeth removed in the US, my parents urged me not to take them. They believed taking pain killers would burden my liver, and the temporary disappearance of pain would mask any symptoms of a potential complication. Their reasoning is rooted in the belief that medication is not needed for every discomfort—you do not <em>need</em> to take pain medication, unless the pain is life-threatening. Raised in this environment, I was shocked when I arrived in the US and saw the casual attitude people have toward pain relievers, as well as the prevalence of pain medication misuse among Americans.</p>\n\n<p>I reflected upon the different attitudes the US and China have towards medicine as I began my most recent project characterizing opioid misuse in the United States. Opioids are a class of drugs widely abused in the United States and are typically prescribed to treat moderate to severe pain. Opioids cause a sense of euphoria, a “high” that not only dulls the pain of the body, but also has psychoactive side effects. Long-term use of opioids creates dependencies and can lead to addiction. The United States has more people with opioid use disorder than any other country in the world. In 2017, 1.7 million Americans suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioids and approximately 47,000 died as a result of an opioid overdose. The issue is more severe today than ever, as the pandemic and isolation exacerbates feelings of loneliness and despair, causing some people to turn to drugs as a coping mechanism.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-23-opioid-crisis/pic1.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Top: Overdose death rates in the United States involving opioids. Bottom: Countries consuming most opioids from 2013-2015.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Data from the CDC and the UN International Narcotics Control Board (see references 2 and 3)</p>\n\n<p>There are many brands of prescription opioids that are manufactured and sold, but OxyContin is by far one of the most popular. OxyContin was launched in 1996 by Purdue Pharma (also known as “Purdue”), one of the major culprits behind the opioid crisis. OxyContin was a unique approach because it provided round-the-clock pain management from a single pill. One pill contained enough medication for several hours, but the innovative extended release formulation slowly delivered oxycodone, the active ingredient. Purdue spent a huge amount of money marketing OxyContin, and the company became a financial success in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2009, OxyContin accounted for 34.3% of all oxycodone pain relievers sold in the United States and 83.3% of all high-dosage pain relievers.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>  While the drug was intended to optimize patient care, the large amount of oxycodone packed in a single pill made the drug one of the most popular opioid products to abuse. Users could crush and snort the OxyContin pills to get an instant high.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-23-opioid-crisis/pic2.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Trend in Oxycodone Sales: Sales of all prescription oxycodone increased substantially from 2000 to 2010, with per-person sales quadrupling in the 10 year period. The sales of oxycodone declined from 2010 to 2015 as a result of the OxyContin reformulation and aggressive measures taken by the states and the federal government to counter opioid addiction.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Shiyu Zhang and Daniel Guth (see reference 4)</p>\n\n<p>In August 2010, under pressure from policymakers, Purdue reformulated OxyContin to make it “abuse-deterrent.” The reformulated OxyContin is almost impossible to crush and inject, so OxyContin lost its attraction among recreational users. However, it wasn’t clear if those recreational users were abusing opioids less as a result of the reformulation or turning to other opioids besides OxyContin (such as heroin) that was still easy to abuse. The reformulation provides a unique opportunity for social scientists like myself to study what policies are effective in reducing opioid misuse.  My colleagues and I wanted to know if the OxyContin reformulation was successful in reducing the recreational use of OxyContin and opioid abuse and whether it led to any unintended consequences.</p>\n\n<p>While the aim of our study was straightforward, the execution was more complicated. A lot of people have the misconception that social science research is qualitative in nature. In reality, gathering, processing, and making sense of data are all very important parts of our job. Real-world data is high-dimensional and complex, and we create mathematical models to mirror these complex, real-world scenarios. The process of finding the right framework to answer our research question reminds me of what my undergraduate econometrics teacher used to say about models. In his opinion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong" target="_blank">all models are wrong, but some are useful</a>. All models, by definition, are simplifications of reality, but they allow us to focus on the most critical aspects of the data relevant to our research question.  Simplifications that ignore the less important parts of the overall picture are useful for identifying the main factors that affect the world around us.</p>\n\n<p>For the first few months of our study, my coauthor Daniel Guth, a fellow graduate student from Caltech’s Humanities and Social Sciences Department, and I sifted through over 500 million records of prescription opioid shipments, read books and papers chronicling the opioid epidemic, and built several mathematical models in an attempt to understand how opioid use disorder takes hold and evolves in a community. Much of the data we relied on for this study was only available  because of a court case in 2019 that made half a billion records of opioid transactions from 2006 to 2014 publicly available. Before the publication of this data in the new ARCOS (Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System) database, researchers were unable to break down the sales of opioids by brand (OxyContin vs. non-OxyContin) or disaggregate the sales to specific locations beyond the state level. The new publicly available ARCOS data supplied a level of detail that enabled us to look at exactly where the OxyContin reformulation had the most impact with respect to misuse and overdose and compare use of the new abuse-deterrent OxyContin with other brands.</p>\n\n<p>This detailed dataset showed that the sales of OxyContin went down after the reformulation, and the sales of alternative oxycodone went up. Upon seeing this pattern, it is tempting to conclude that the reformulation caused users to switch to a different brand of oxycodone. However, correlation is not causation. Just because two events happened at the same time does not prove that the first event caused the second event. Let me use a simple example to illustrate this point: if you look at the number of people who drowned after falling out of a fishing boat and the marriage rate in Kentucky from 2000 to 2010, you will realize that the two numbers move together over time. Despite what the data shows, it is hard to believe that an increase in marriage rate would cause an increase in drowning or vice versa.  Similarly, just because the sales of OxyContin went down and the sales of oxycodone went up after the reformulation does not imply that the changes are caused by the reformulation. To make our claim stick, we need to investigate whether these two events are correlated purely by chance or whether one event causes the other.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-23-opioid-crisis/pic3.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">An example of spurious correlation.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlation</p>\n\n<p>In order to go from correlation to causation in the case of OxyContin reformulation, my team used a common mathematical model in my field called the difference-in-difference (DID) framework. To use the DID framework, we categorize all US states into two bins: those with either a high or low percentage of people misusing OxyContin before the reformulation. If the reformulation truly impacted how people misuse opioids, then the high-percentage misuse group would experience a bigger change in OxyContin usage since there are more people affected by the reformulation. However, if the reformulation had no impact on opioid abuse, then the low-percentage misuse group should experience the same amount of change during this period as the high-percentage misuse group. Hence, by comparing changes in OxyContin usage in both groups we can better assess whether the reformulation was successful in reducing OxyContin use.</p>\n\n<p>Using the difference-in-difference framework to analyze the ARCOS data revealed that our hypothesis was correct.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>  The reformulation did indeed cause OxyContin sales to decrease. Additionally, the same model established that the sales of alternative prescription oxycodone went up to compensate. Specifically, in locations where OxyContin misuse was high pre-reform, OxyContin sales dropped a greater amount than where misuse was low, and alternative oxycodone sales went up a higher amount. Because the OxyContin reformulation was a national change uncorrelated with local conditions, this difference-in-difference model provides causal evidence that reformulation caused individuals to switch to a different brand of oxycodone.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-23-opioid-crisis/pic4.jpeg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Difference-in-difference Framework Example:<br />\n\nScenario 1: Let us imagine that a state in the U.S., State A is exactly the same as State B except for its OxyContin misuse level in 2009. After the reformulation, State A experienced a higher drop in overdose death than State B. Since everything else between A and B are identical, the difference is likely caused by their initial OxyContin misuse level. Hence, the OxyContin reformulation likely played a part in reducing overdose.<br />\n\nScenario 2: Let us imagine the same situation as above. After the reformulation, State A experienced the same amount of drop in overdose death as State B. Hence, whatever caused overdose death to drop is likely to be independent of the initial OxyContin misuse level. Therefore, the OxyContin reformulation did not play a part in reducing overdose in this hypothetical situation.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Shiyu Zhang</p>\n\n<p>Although we are addressing very specific questions concerning the OxyContin reformulation, the findings from our study can be applied to develop more effective ways to control opioid abuse. Understanding how OxyContin users responded to the reformulation, a specific example of reducing the supply of an abused drug, can be incredibly informative for researchers and policy makers. These results can shed light on how recreational users of other drugs will respond to reductions in drug supply more generally, whether it is a raid on drug dealers or a change of formulation, as was done for OxyContin. Our study suggests that partial restriction on access to drugs is not effective in curbing use, and a strategy to combat addiction needs to be holistic. It needs to not only cut the supply of illicit drugs, but also connect addicted individuals with the right resources to fight addiction and withdrawal symptoms.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> Even the most well-intentioned interventions may be unsuccessful in curbing drug use, and teams of policy-makers, sociologists, and physicians must join forces to tackle this issue that continues to plague our country.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to think that the research I do at Caltech is both retrospective and forward-looking. In contrast to the work many of my friends do in other departments at Caltech, my research involves building quantitative models to make inferences about social phenomena. While the data I work with and the questions I try to answer concern the past, the inferences I make concern the future. Doing this research for the past year has made me cognizant of the fact that cultural differences in how Chinese and Americans perceive pain medication is not the only driver of the opioid crisis in the US. Rather, the market for prescription painkillers in China is much smaller because it started with stronger regulations. America’s current landscape of opioid use stems from a combination of government policies, pharmaceutical companies, and market forces. In each country or state, the drivers of addiction are complex, and mathematical models can precisely identify those drivers and therefore distill meaningful lessons from our past. The sooner we learn those lessons, the more lives we can save.</p>\n\n<h4 id="references">References</h4>\n\n<p><a name="1">1</a>: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p1218-overdose-deaths-covid-19.html" target="_blank">“Overdose Deaths Accelerating During COVID-19.” <em>CDC</em>, December 18, 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="2">2</a>:  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analysis.html" target="_blank">“Opioid Data Analysis and Resources.” <em>CDC</em>, January 25, 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="3">3</a>:  <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-opioid-epidemic" target="_blank">“The U.S. Opioid Epidemic.” <em>Council on Foreign Relations</em>, July 16, 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="4">4</a>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01128" target="_blank">Zhang, Shiyu and Daniel Guth. “The OxyContin Reformulation Revisited: New Evidence From Improved Definitions of Markets and Substitutes.” <em>ARXIV</em>, 2021</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="5">5</a>: <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" target="_blank">“Spurious Correlations.”</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="6">6</a>: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1550" target="_blank">Sordo, Luis and et al. “Mortality Risk During and After Opioid Substitution Treatment: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies.” <em>BMJ</em>, vol. 357, issue no. 0959-8138, doi: 10.1136/bmj.j1550.</a>.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2021-02-23 00:00:00','Caltech Letters (a student blog)','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:55','read');

I already knew that I was good at art, so I was excited to show off my math skills for her. I would not be able to articulate why until much later in life, but for some reason I just thought that I <em>should</em> and <em>would</em> be good at math. But on Math Olympiad day, I couldn’t do any of the worksheets, and my humiliation grew until the hour was over. To this day, being asked to calculate something on the fly ties a knot in my stomach.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve all heard the stereotype—Asians are good at math. This casual statement is a manifestation of the Model Minority Myth, the idea that certain non-white minorities can serve as a successful assimilation “model” for other non-white minorities. The myth may seem benign, even beneficial for Asians, but it stems specifically from anti-Black racism and contrasts the cherry-picked successes of certain East Asian Americans against stereotypes of Black, LatinX, and Native Americans as a justification for their continued marginalization. It centers Asian American and Pacific Islander narratives around East Asians, despite the rich history of many other Asian groups in the U.S. since the 1800s. It is also a direct product of the American myth of meritocracy, the idea that power and privilege are allocated by individual merit alone, blind to social and economic class<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. As a Caltech scientist, and as an Asian American<sup><a href="#✝">✝</a></sup> who used to believe in the Model Minority Myth, I believe we must subject this stereotype to the same level of critical examination we demand in our research.</p>\n\n<p>In order to dismantle this racist myth, we need to understand that “race” is a social construct with no scientific basis, based on perceived differences in physical appearance among human beings<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In the American colonies, race was used to justify why certain people—enslaved Africans and colonized Indigenous Peoples of North America—were denied the rights and freedoms that European colonizers took for granted<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Race was written into the legal system of the colonies, and later the United States, starting in the 17<sup>th</sup> century in order to grant exclusive rights and freedoms only to those considered “white,” like Virginia slave owners and other European colonizers.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> In the United States, race was explicitly set up as a hierarchical system with white landowners at the top and enslaved Black people at the bottom. The social, political, and economic forces that protect and reinforce this hierarchy are “white supremacy.”</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-09-model-minority-myth/figure1.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">A racist cartoon from 1899 called The Yellow Terror in All His Glory.

Asia has been consistently viewed as the West’s “other” throughout history, simultaneously fascinating and terrifying. <strong>Until after World War II, Asians living in the United States were primarily seen as “Forever Foreigners”—a homogeneous group primarily loyal to a monolithic “Asia” instead of the United States</strong><sup><a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a></sup>. Starting in the 1800s, thousands of Asian immigrants—primarily Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino — came to the United States to work in agriculture, construction, and other low-wage jobs<sup><a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Despite the diversity of this group and their hard work, they were dismissed as backward, submissive, and inferior<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. Their perceived lack of loyalty to the United States and their “otherness” were used as evidence to restrict Asian immigration and reject Asian immigrants. Regulations were put into place that barred them from becoming naturalized citizens, prohibited them from owning or leasing land, and crowded them into ethnic enclaves like Chinatowns that were considered “depraved colonies of prostitutes, gamblers and opium addicts.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-09-model-minority-myth/figure2.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">U.S. Asian population over time with notable legislation affecting Asian immigrants or immigration. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first immigration law to prevent an entire ethnic group from immigrating to the United States and becoming eligible for citizenship. Later, the Immigration Act of 1917 established an Asian Barred Zone of countries from which no immigrants were admitted, and the Immigration Act of 1924 supplanted that law to effectively ban all immigration from Asia. Finally, note the rise in population after the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Data from the 2010 U.S. Census and the 2012 Pew Research Report "The Rise of Asian Americans."</p>\n\n<p>Asian immigrants’ failure to thrive because of restrictive and racist laws began a feedback cycle that perpetuated their perceived inferiority and exclusion between the 1870s and World War II. This included passing increasingly prohibitive immigration policies to keep the Asian population low (&lt;1%). The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first immigration law to prevent an entire ethnic group from immigrating to the United States and becoming eligible for citizenship.6 Citizenship was even taken away from certain subgroups, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that Indians were not white and therefore ineligible for citizenship<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. Later, most Asian immigration was barred with the passage of the 1917 Immigration Act. The stereotype of the “Forever Foreigner” continued through WWII with Japanese internment, a federal policy where people of Japanese descent were uprooted from their homes, forced into internment camps, and required to complete “loyalty” questionnaires<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. California even ruled that only “1/16th” of Japanese heritage was enough to qualify<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>. Though the United States was also at war with Germany, sweeping demands for the internment of German Americans never materialized.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-09-model-minority-myth/figure3.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">An article from the December 22, 1941 issue of Life Magazine that was written during WWII in response to violence against people of Chinese descent, based on them being perceived as people of Japanese descent. This article encapsulates the “Forever Foreigner” stereotype—note that the article does not attempt to dissuade people from attacking those of Asian descent, but instead tries to help you do it more accurately. This article also illustrates debunked “race” science, masquerading as “physical anthropology,” used to distinguish the “friendly Chinese” from the “enemy alien Japs.”</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>\n\n<p>After WWII, a split between “good” and “bad” Asian Americans emerged. <strong>A select subset of Asian Americans—mainly U.S.-born and -educated Chinese and Japanese Americans—were held up as Model Minorities.</strong> Economically and academically successful, these Model Minorities allegedly achieved success due to their adherence to “traditional American values”—respect for authority, nuclear families, and adherence to strict gender roles<sup><a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a></sup>. As historian Ellen Wu has shown, the Model Minority Myth was so successful in the 1950s because it was used as anti-communist propaganda, arguing Chinese American success was due to American freedom and democracy that was not available to them in communist China<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The Model Minority Myth then evolved in the 1960s in response to the ongoing Civil Rights movement. William Petersen, then a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley, argued in an influential 1966 New York Times Magazine article titled “Success Story: Japanese American Style,” that Japanese Americans were the hard-working antithesis to what he termed “problem minorities, specifically the ‘American Negro.’”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> Those same “traditional American values,” he argued, had allowed them to overcome discrimination after World War II and achieve some success in the U.S. This idea immediately caught on in popular culture and academic literature to apply to all Asian Americans, resulting in an infamous 1987 TIME Magazine cover that proclaimed, “Those Asian-American Whiz Kids.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> When explicitly compared to Black Americans, Asian Americans were said to have achieved success “the old-fashioned way” through quiet hard work and perseverance—validating the myth of American meritocracy—instead of protesting in the streets as Black civil rights leaders were<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. This myth held despite the history of activism within the Asian American community, from the 1800s to the present. After all, it was only after the concerted activism of East, South, and Southeast Asian American groups that all people of Asian descent fully secured the right to vote and become U.S. citizens in 1952<sup><a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a></sup>. Even the term “Asian American” was only coined in the 1960s by a collective of college students and activists in order to unite disparate Asian identities in the fight for political and social change<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-09-model-minority-myth/figure4.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Time Magazine cover from 1987 proclaiming "Those Asian-American Whiz Kids." Note how the students shown on the cover appear to be racially homogenous and of East Asian descent.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Asian Americans were held up as Model Minorities to justify the enduring divide between white and Black Americans, and to gloss over the consequences of slavery.</strong> A 1966 article in U.S. News &amp; World Report noted, “At a time when it is being proposed that hundreds of billions be spent to uplift Negroes and other minorities, the nation’s 300,000 Chinese-Americans are getting ahead on their own, with no help from anyone else.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> This statement is willingly blind to the fact that the wealth of this country comes from the subordination of Black people, an unrepented sin that can be traced all the way from slavery, through segregation, to mass incarceration and police violence today. It also uses the Model Minority Myth to prevent policies of restorative justice. Today, it is used to scale back another legacy of the Civil Rights movement: affirmative action in university admissions. One example is the 2014 <em>Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em> lawsuit, which was filed not by an Asian American, but by an organization founded by a politically conservative legal strategist<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>. Asian Americans have consistently been used as an ideological tool to suggest that other minorities, particularly Black Americans, have only themselves to blame for their historical and structural marginalization<sup><a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, it was the Civil Rights movement, led by Black Americans, that shaped the Asian American population that we see today. The Civil Rights movement led to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished restrictive immigration policies that allowed the Asian American population to grow. The Asian America that we see today is largely the product of this post-1965 immigration, with 20 million Asian Americans tracing their roots to more than 20 countries in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. My parents are part of this post-1965 wave; they left China in the early 1980s to pursue PhDs at Columbia University, became naturalized U.S. citizens, and at this point have lived in the United States longer than they have lived in China. Today, Asian Americans represent 6% of the U.S. population and are the fastest growing racial group in America<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. This group is majority immigrant, with 74% of all Asian American adults born abroad<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Although Asian Americans are traditionally thought of as East Asian due to Japanese and Chinese Americans being the dominant Asian subgroups prior to 1965, it is projected that the 2020 census will show  Indian Americans as  the largest subgroup<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>. Asian Americans are also multiracial and the most likely racial group to marry across racial lines<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. One example is Vice President Kamala Harris, who has an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-09-model-minority-myth/figure5.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">2010 Demographics of Asian Americans (in blue) and Pacific Islanders (in orange). Information on ‘Other Asian’ for Asian Americans is shown in bar graphs to the right of the pie chart.

The 1965, and subsequent, Immigration Acts have all preferred family-based and high-skilled immigration, which has led to the phenomenon of “hyper-selectivity” in Asian immigrants where many are better educated than the general American public and their home country populations<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>. For example, 51% of Chinese immigrants have at least a bachelor’s degree while only 9% of Chinese citizens do<sup><a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a></sup>. Given the design of these immigration laws, it is not surprising that Asian Americans, as a whole, have the highest annual household incomes and highest household wealth in the U.S.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> It seems today that U.S. immigration policies, not “traditional American values,” are responsible for the Model Minority Myth.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-02-09-model-minority-myth/figure6.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Top panel from left to right: a) Percentage (%) of Adults Foreign Born, b) Of those foreign born adults, percentage (%) that arrived in the past 10 years, c) Percentage (%) of people of Asian descent employed in Science and Engineering fields. Bottom panel, left from right: d) Median Household Income, and e) Percentage (%) of Adults (age 25 and older) with a college degree or higher, f) Percentage (%) of Adults living in poverty. Detailed information was only given for the six largest Asian subgroups.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit">Data from the 2010 U.S. Census and the 2012 Pew Research Report "The Rise of Asian Americans.""</p>\n\n<p>And yet, that is not the full story either. <strong>The Model Minority Myth flattens the diverse Asian American population into a monolith.</strong> In reality, each Asian and Pacific Islander subgroup has a unique history and faces distinct challenges. Although some have arrived as highly skilled workers, many have also arrived as refugees, notably Vietnamese immigrants as a result of the U.S.-backed Vietnam War. Today, Asians are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. undocumented population<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>. A growing number of Asian immigrants are also arriving with minimal education and job training, one factor that has led to Asian Americans displacing Black Americans as the most economically divided racial or ethnic subgroup in the U.S.<sup><a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a></sup> These immigrants include my aunts, who have worked in Chinese restaurants, as home aides, and as Amazon warehouse workers. Even academic success is not guaranteed: two-fifths of Chinese Americans (either born or raised in the U.S.) do not graduate from college, and in the first year of college, Asian American and Black students have the highest enrollment rates in remedial education courses<sup><a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a></sup>. And despite the higher median income and education of Asian Americans as a group, they are underrepresented in leadership positions in government, corporate America, academia, and popular media<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, the Model Minority Myth denies the historical and ongoing racism that Asian Americans face.</strong> In truth, the “Forever Foreigner” trope never died, but continually resurfaces in response to American geopolitics. This includes the alarming rise of hate crimes against South Asian Americans, notably Sikh and Muslim Americans, since the 2001 September 11 attacks<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>, and assaults against a variety of Asian Americans in the age of the novel coronavirus<sup><a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a></sup>. Asian Americans are also the least likely group to seek and receive treatment for mental illnesses or report domestic violence<sup><a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a></sup>. The Model Minority Myth obscures the reality of who Asian Americans really are, the challenges they face in their daily lives, and encourages their silence about it<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The Model Minority Myth is a difficult thing to talk about among Asian Americans, perhaps because some feel that it benefits them, and because some have whole-heartedly embraced it. I thought I was a Model Minority for a long time, too—growing up in a wealthy suburb of the San Francisco Bay Area surrounded by successful Asian Americans, it was easy for me to assume that we had all gotten here by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. It was much more difficult for me to question those assumptions and educate myself about the tortured history of race and “success” in America. Clearly, the Model Minority Myth was never meant to be pro-Asian. Instead, it is used to justify white supremacy and minimize the continued effects of slavery on Black Americans. The racialization of Asian Americans is complex and nuanced, and needs to be viewed within the broader history of race in the U.S.—in fact, the constantly shifting perceptions of Asian Americans so clearly illustrate how race is a social construct, a blank screen onto which individuals with various political agendas project<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. Buying into the Model Minority Myth only reinforces false narratives of race and success, and thwarts the efforts of all groups to finally make the U.S. equitable for all.</p>\n\n<h4 id="notes-on-the-term-asian-american"><a name="✝">✝</a>:Notes on the term “Asian American”</h4>\n<p>There have been many terms the community has used to try and label themselves, including (but not limited to): Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI), Asian Pacific American (APA), and Asian Pacific Islander (API). These changing labels reflect the ongoing dialogues that these communities are having as they grapple with their identity, as well as the continually changing demographics of this community. For the purposes of this piece, I will use the term “Asian American” because: 1) The history of Pacific Islanders is heavily shaped by colonization, which cannot be explained in this short piece, and 2) Pew Research Center data on “Asian Americans” is referenced, which is defined as people who self-identify with one or more of the following Asian groups: Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Malaysian, Mongolian, Nepalese, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Thai, and Vietnamese.</p>\n\n<h4 id="suggested-additional-reading">Suggested Additional Reading</h4>\n<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks" target="_blank">Code Switch: “’Model Minority’ Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians and Blacks,” by Kat Chow</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0123-wu-chua-model-minority-chinese-20140123-story.html" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times: “Asian Americans and the ‘model minority’ myth,” by historian Ellen Wu</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13613324.2017.1377170" target="_blank">Journal of Race Ethnicity and Education: “Of models and myths: Asian(Americans) in STEM and the neoliberal racial project,” by Grace A.

My driver seems in a talkative mood.</p>\n\n<p>“So, what do you do?” he says.</p>\n\n<p>I shake my head to clear the fog after a long evening.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m a seismologist,” I respond, “I study earthquakes.”</p>\n\n<p>“Earthquakes?” he says. “So can you tell me when the Big One is coming?”</p>\n\n<p>The Big One. He’s talking about the massive earthquake that <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/science/back-future-san-andreas-fault" target="_blank">California is “overdue” for</a>. Whenever I tell people what I do, this is the one burning question they have. Knowing when the Big One is coming feels like it could give us some control over our lives—lives every Angeleno spends on the unpredictable and uncontrollable ground that lurks beneath our feet.</p>\n\n<p>California lies on the boundary between two giant tectonic plates. These blocks of the Earth’s crust are on the move, sliding about the same speed as your fingernails grow. But, along the 800-mile long San Andreas Fault where they meet, friction causes the plates to get stuck. As they try to slide past each other, the stuck plates bend, storing up energy like a coiled spring. When the pressure becomes too great, the fault slips; the plates move rapidly, violently shaking the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The San Andreas Fault runs from the Salton Sea in the south to well north of San Francisco. Each part of it produces big earthquakes, causing the ground to slip tens of feet, every one to two centuries on average. When the last Big One hit Northern California, in 1906, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" target="_blank">reduced San Francisco to rubble</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/science/back-future-san-andreas-fault?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">southern end of the fault hasn’t ruptured in roughly three hundred years</a>.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-01-19-the-big-one/san-andreas_notext.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">The San Andreas Fault at the Carrizo Plain, central California.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://ushalingappa.com/" target="_blank">Illustration by Usha Lingappa for Caltech Letters</a></p>\n\n<p>I study earthquakes, using supercomputers to simulate an event like the Big One. From the safety of my desk, I create ruptures that break a digital version of the San Andreas Fault to explore how the earthquakes start and what makes them stop. But even when I try to tame earthquakes in my computer, they’re still unruly beasts: fascinating, terrifying, and full of surprises. Centuries of studying the Earth has taught us that earthquakes are as inevitable as they are unpredictable. We don’t know when, but we do know the next Big One is coming.</p>\n\n<p>“I’m sorry to disappoint,” I say to my driver, “but they’re random. We can’t predict them. Although we know it’s not a question of if, but when.”</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it’s the thought of the next earthquake, or perhaps the winding of the freeway, but I start to feel nauseous. My fingers make for the window switch to let in some slightly fresher air. Despite the late hour, my driver wants to know more. “That sounds pretty scary! What’s going to happen?” he says.</p>\n\n<p>My driver’s question pushes my mind’s eye high above the ground, giving me a view of the whole of Southern California. The San Andreas Fault is a slice through the landscape, separating the San Gabriel Mountains from the Mojave desert. Crossing this scar in the ground is a thin vein that carries the blue lifeblood of our desert city: the Los Angeles Aqueduct, bringing us water from the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This aqueduct, and others that also cross the fault, are the source of <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Los-Angeles-water-supply-impacts-from-a-M7.8-San-Davis/7d74f0af647b1ee1aee7aeca0c0a3bcac756fbd9" target="_blank">over 70% of the city’s water</a>. One big slip of the San Andreas severs the city’s lifelines.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-01-19-the-big-one/saf_aqueduct.png" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">This map shows the three aqueducts that supply over 70% of LA’s water, all of which cross the San Andreas Fault. An earthquake on the San Andreas could sever these aqueducts.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Los-Angeles-water-supply-impacts-from-a-M7.8-San-Davis/7d74f0af647b1ee1aee7aeca0c0a3bcac756fbd9" target="_blank">C.A. Davis (2010)</a></p>\n\n<p>I imagine the Big One starting, miles underground. The fault breaks, and once broken it starts to slip, one side sliding relative to the other at several feet per second. As it moves, the San Andreas sends out seismic waves in all directions, shaking the ground and everything on top of it. In a matter of seconds, the fault slides 20 feet.</p>\n\n<p>The consequences are immediate. LA loses access to more than 70% of its water as seismic waves rupture gas mains and bring down power lines, sparking thousands of fires. Roads are broken, and cell towers overloaded. At the end of it all, the potential destruction to our city is immense: <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1150/" target="_blank">hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, families fleeing their ruined homes, and two thousand lives lost</a>. The U.S. hasn’t seen an earthquake this bad in over 100 years.</p>\n\n<div><img class="c-content__image" src="/media/posts/2021-01-19-the-big-one/la_map.jpg" alt="" /></div>\n<p class="c-content__image-caption">Vital roads, pipelines and aqueducts cross the San Andreas Fault just north of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p class="c-content__image-credit"><a href="https://ushalingappa.com/" target="_blank">Adapted for Caltech Letters by Usha Lingappa</a></p>\n\n<p>Such a bleak future seems unreal to the human mind, when we can turn on our tap and have clean water, and I can hail a ride on my phone within minutes.</p>\n\n<p>My car hits a bump, bringing me out of my head and crashing back into my seat. For a moment, I catch the driver’s concerned eyes in the rear-view mirror; he’s still waiting to hear what the Big One will do.</p>\n\n<p>I hesitate for a second, trying to order my thoughts. Even though I study earthquakes, my scientific work has given me only a tiny piece of a puzzle that’s immeasurably complex, ranging from geophysics to infrastructure safety to disaster planning. We know where the big faults are, and the kinds of earthquakes they’ve caused before, but we don’t know how close to breaking they are now. We know how to make buildings safer, but we don’t know which buildings will suffer the strongest shaking. Here and now, all I can do is translate a tangled web of knowns and unknowns into the clearest possible answer. But we need an answer that’s not just a tale of destruction, leaving us powerless in the face of disaster. Instead, we need to tell the story of the progress that we’ve made and the steps we, as individuals and as a society, can still take to get ready for The Big One.</p>\n\n<p>“There will be an earthquake, and it will hit us hard” I say, “but it’s what we do right now that determines just how bad that earthquake will be.” I recite the age-old words of earthquake safety: purchase supplies; have an emergency plan for meeting with loved ones; drop, cover, and hold on when the shaking starts. But I also tell him just how far we’ve come: a network of seismic sensors now watching the fault 24 hours a day, ready to <a href="https://www.caloes.ca.gov/cal-oes-divisions/earthquake-tsunami-volcano-programs/california-earthquake-early-warning-program" target="_blank">send out precious seconds of warning</a> when the Big One starts. The <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/faults?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con" target="_blank">better mapping of dangerous faults</a>, and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-quake-retrofit-20180104-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">strengthening of buildings</a> and pipelines.</p>\n\n<p>Science won’t let us predict every random geological event, but it can teach us how to understand and prepare for those events. The catastrophe that I imagined is only one possible path; as a society, we can avert disaster. Preparation lets us tame the fear that uncertainty creates in our minds, and tame the threat that earthquakes pose to our lives. Generations of research mean that we’ve never been more prepared for earthquakes.</p>\n\n<p>As our ride nears its end, I realize I’ve forgotten something, perhaps the most important thing we can do to get ready. Being prepared isn’t just a question of medical supplies and bottled water. “We need to get to know our neighbors.” I say. “Who lives nearby, who might need help after the quake. We can recover if we work together.”</p>\n\n<p>I thank my driver as I step out into the cool night air.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks later, I find myself in a bar in Palm Springs. As I sit down, a woman next to me greets me and asks: “So, what do you do?”</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>If you’d like to find out more about how you can get ready for earthquakes, visit <a href="https://www.earthquakecountry.org/" target="_blank">earthquakecountry.org</a></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Note: This story was originally written before the 2020 pandemic.

they dated for a year and got married, spending their honeymoon night at the Clark Hotel on Central Avenue.  Juliet describes the special experience of being able to visit the Clark Hotel in the 1980s.  </p><p>Juliet’s commitment to historic preservation intensified when she started working in downtown Los Angeles in the 1970s.  “I went over to see the Bunker Hill area, and learned that the Victorian-era homes had been bulldozed.  I felt sick.  That area should have been preserved… something should have been done,” she says, adding “It’s important – that’s a part of the history of Los Angeles.” </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1517" data-orig-width="2084"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s640x960/5c60bfc9f4e6bb94edd3e27155a9532e4267795f.jpg" data-orig-height="1517" data-orig-width="2084" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s75x75_c1/bca5a14dbbf5e22382bb898d1e3f2c162020c071.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s100x200/fdca08a257a654efb7666183008a56ef624a1e00.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s250x400/08e51bfa50b6a34f40ed0f73a37a3ec96a11bfc2.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s400x600/f4c23b2ef1599a01461c7bb3dad2219517f29542.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s500x750/c65ddb565f495b9bc1d7321e29fd4841a18c051d.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s540x810/40903bc4cd56e317a8fbc273945572f0c1a8e0b5.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s640x960/5c60bfc9f4e6bb94edd3e27155a9532e4267795f.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s1280x1920/a5545076b85ace097e3c57d3c3bbd3e4cbbf89fb.jpg 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/aa55e207536bf291137619f3293d7a6a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-4c/s2048x3072/fda34ac8dcbbee1af8d86fcf95729fb2169cc7be.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1322" data-orig-width="1270"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s640x960/3c1913cc2a3e612a9c13b7fe848fd7f6d16c9b27.png" data-orig-height="1322" data-orig-width="1270" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s75x75_c1/550332e4d6399589b0d262f89f746ed218d6f4da.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s100x200/d74d5d957378294039ecd366365ae03267bd81be.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s250x400/75fc645f827f7bd87fd9e0355fdb38a5a1ea20b6.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s400x600/8f16d428dbffe2829ac9c76ac61e58adf8d47467.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s500x750/fe4b143b64d799c051658bf2c302419cfc7d9e38.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s540x810/92145b65aeb3d6ec6a23d5933a3d58209993e41f.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s640x960/3c1913cc2a3e612a9c13b7fe848fd7f6d16c9b27.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/2a329e5f77e53a82e2be49ba765dca3a/e140b1a244c9b1e0-ee/s1280x1920/caf4be6d1b09c6cba49aeb82b625c149bac49ee3.png 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>Newspaper clippings of 1969&rsquo;s &ldquo;Negro History Week&rdquo; where 16-year-old Juliet was named Queen.</i></p></blockquote><p>With her passion for Los Angeles history, it was inevitable that Juliet would find her way to the Los Angeles Conservancy as a member and volunteer (her first assignment was the 2014 special tour We Heart Garden Apartments).  She supports the organization “to make a difference in preserving Los Angeles’ history.”  She loves to explore Los Angeles, and take friends and visitors to many places around town, with a special affection for historic locations.  She observes, “there’s so much to do and see in our own hometown!”   </p><p>One of Juliet’s favorite historic places to visit is Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hollyhock House.  She went to visit three times in a 7-year period before Covid.  She said every time she went, she saw something different, and just loved standing in the space and looking around to get the feeling of the place. </p><p>Two of her other favorite historic locations in L.A. are Union Station and the Farmers Market, both formative places in her childhood that she still loves to visit. She describes going to the Farmers Market in the early 1960s as an 11 year old.  Her mother “worked for a lady whose apartment overlooked the Farmers Market,” and one time her mom gave her five dollars and let her explore the shops on her own.  She remembers how exciting that was. “I bought a little box of pastel chalks for $4.95,” which she says she still has to this day. </p><p>She describes going to Union Station frequently with her parents when she was young, “starting in the 1950s; relatives were always coming and going.”  As a child, she would look through the window at the Fred Harvey restaurant – she wanted to go in but never did.  It was a real pleasure for her to volunteer when the L.A. Conservancy held an event to celebrate the grand opening of the Imperial Western Brewing Company in 2018, in the former Fred Harvey restaurant space, which had sat empty for decades.  She says, “My dream came true.  Over 60 years later, I’m walking through the door, sitting and eating inside.” </p><p><i><b>Our sincere thanks to Juliet for sharing so many wonderful memories and family photos.</b></i></p>',NULL,'','2023-03-13 16:29:15','L.A.

These community anchors have long been one of the focal points of the Conservancy’s work, from responding to threats of demolition to providing technical assistance. We saved the original McDonald’s from demolition in the ‘90s, brought funding for the rehabilitation of the Formosa Cafe’s Pacific Electric Red Car, and rallied to designate Norms on La Cienega, Tom Bergin’s on Fairfax, and Otomisan Japanese Restaurant in Boyle Heights as Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM). In late 2019, we proudly launched a Legacy Business initiative to raise awareness about and support for these important places in L.A. County. </p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we understood the immediate threat and unthinkable challenges facing longtime business owners. Thanks to Wells Fargo, we’ve been able to expand our legacy business initiative to include a grant program. This grant provides $5,000 to ten (10) eligible small businesses that have operated and contributed to their community’s history and/or identity for at least 20 years and have less than 25 full-time employees. </p><p>So far, the response has been overwhelming. Nearly 400 owners applied for the first round of grants, making the task of choosing just five winners almost seem impossible. Please join our Legacy Business Network and follow us on social media to learn more about our winners and to stay up-to-date on Round 2 of the L.A. Conservancy’s Legacy Business Grant Program! </p><p><i><b>Visit </b></i><i><b><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.laconservancy.org/grant" target="_blank">laconservancy.org/grant </a></b></i><i><b>to learn more.</b></i><b> </b></p>',NULL,'','2023-02-08 22:00:10','L.A.

Development Director Liz Leshin recently checked in with her. </p><p><b>LL: How did you learn about the L.A. Conservancy, and what compelled you to join?</b></p><p>SK: A few years ago, a friend and I were talking about Downtown LA and all the stunning buildings there, the theaters in particular, and she told me that her father-in-law (Herb Silverman) is a docent for the Conservancy-led tours. That was my initial introduction to the Conservancy.</p><!-- more --><p>I’ve also been exploring downtown a lot and recently started an Instagram account dedicated to Los Angeles Terrazzo (<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.instagram.com/losangelesterrazzo/" target="_blank">@losangelesterrazzo</a>), and when I post about the amazing terrazzo I find, I try to research the building and area, and nearly every time, I am led to the Conservancy website. It was probably my obsession with the old theaters, and the possibility of exploring inside of them that led me to join the Conservancy</p><p><b>LL: You participated in the Conservancy&rsquo;s Community Leadership Boot Camp this year; what did you get out of the experience</b>?</p><p>SK: I LOVED my Boot Camp experience! I learned so much – it’s hard to even encapsulate. I learned about all the amazing resources and research tools available. I know the process of landmarking a building and what it takes to do that. I know what city agencies control what, and I know that the Vista Hermosa neighborhood has way too many uncapped oil wells. I made friends too! Most importantly, I learned about what I can do as a citizen of Los Angeles to make my voice heard and help advocate to raise awareness of historic spaces.</p><p><b>LL: Which neighborhood do you live in?  And what do you think makes it distinct?</b></p><p>SK: I live in Eagle Rock. I love it for the community feel and I love the location - this unique little pocket between the rest of LA and Pasadena. It’s got two lovely main streets in Colorado Blvd and Eagle Rock Blvd that are filled with really special independent retail shops and restaurants that really seem to support each other. Of course we have our literal Eagle Rock.</p><p><b>LL: You also became a member of the Last Remaining Seats committee.  What attracted you to that, and what is your favorite part of LRS?</b></p><p>SK: Last Remaining Seats is such a special and magical series. I work in the music industry, but I LOVE film and old theaters – the glamour they hold, the golden age of cinema, and this is such a great merger of that.</p><p>I met Lia, the Conservancy&rsquo;s volunteer coordinator at the in-person Boot Camp meeting, and when we started chatting about the volunteer opportunities I learned that I could volunteer on this committee, so I did! It was great timing, and I can’t wait for the next season. I’ll be at every screening, and part of the appeal for me was really just being able to be inside these lovely spaces. A film I suggested will hopefully be shown, and I’m really excited for the entire potential slate, TBA!</p><p><b>LL: What case would you make to others for joining and supporting the L.A. Conservancy?</b></p><p>SK: If you love your city, it’s important to take an active role in its upkeep. No matter the cause, one voice CAN make a difference. It can be something as small as writing a letter. Los Angeles is unique, magical, diverse and HUGE. There is a lot of work to be done, and it’s so important to protect these spaces and neighborhoods. The saying “if these walls could talk” really could define preservation in Los Angeles, and I feel like the Conservancy is really working hard to make sure that the future of LA also includes the past, and they can’t do it without us! </p>',NULL,'','2023-01-11 20:52:20','L.A.

Conservancy member!  His blog<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/" target="_blank"> Etan Does L.A. </a>follows his journey to visit all of the L.A. County landmarks listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>We recently asked him to share his “L.A. story” with us and how the Conservancy’s resources have enriched his life and work.</p><p><i>Note: an edited version of this interview appeared in the </i><i><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.laconservancy.org/" target="_blank">L.A. Conservancy</a></i><i>&rsquo;s July/August 2022 newsletter.</i></p><!-- more --><p><b>As a lifelong Angeleno, tell us a bit about where you are from and what sparked your passion for Los Angeles history?</b></p><p>My family lived in Silver Lake in the early ‘80s, back before it was hip. My parents like to tell the story of the unstable neighbor next door who enjoyed throwing statues into our pool! We moved to Altadena when I was 4, where my parents still live. After college I moved into the infamous Alexander Ruler of the World apartments, right across from Paramount Studios – I was “lucky” enough to move in just a couple months before the owner started painting it dark magenta. Since then, I’ve lived in Echo Park, Highland Park, and now Valley Village.  </p><p>Whenever I moved to a new neighborhood, I would read a book or two about local history. But my passion for Los Angeles history really took off in September 2021, when I launched my <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.etandoesla.com/" target="_blank">Etan Does LA project</a> (more on that later). As I dug into the backstories of the LA landmarks I was visiting, it became clear very quickly that there were giant gaps in my knowledge of how this city became itself. I’ve been hooked ever since.  </p><p><b>How did your love of L.A. history and </b><i><b><a href="https://href.li/?http://www.laconservancy.org/lrs" target="_blank">Last Remaining Seats</a></b></i><b><i> </i>motivate you to join the L.A. Conservancy?</b> </p><p>It felt natural to join an organization that does so much important work educating people like me about L.A. history. The endless resources on your website and social media feeds have informed my blog, Etan Does LA, and helped to make connections for me that I might not have made on my own. For that alone, the cost of membership is far more than worth it! My first year of membership was a gift from my mom for my 40th birthday. Couldn’t have asked for a better present. </p><p>Last Remaining Seats was actually how I first heard of the L.A. Conservancy. Back in 2014 a good friend of mine invited me to an <i>Last Remaining Seats</i> screening of <i>Citizen Kane</i> at the Orpheum. I had never seen the film before, so to be able to see the genius cinematography and all that incredible visual framing on the big screen was an absolute privilege. Plus, I was seated in the balcony – so I quite literally had a different perspective of <i>Citizen Kane</i> than most people will ever get!  </p><p><b>Why do you think it’s important for folks to experience classic movies inside historic theatres?</b> </p><p>Going to a movie in a theatre is a wholly different experience than streaming it at home, no matter how immersive your system is. I love the idea of moviegoing as an <i>experience</i>, something you get dressed up for, something as exalted as seeing a play or a concert, something you talk about before and after the film is over. That experience is enhanced immensely by being in a theatre as dramatic and artful as what’s on screen. It encourages you to engage with the building and its history, and also gives you a sense of what moviegoing was like back before we all had 4k TVs.  </p><p><b>Tell us about your blog and what prompted you to start it.</b></p><p>My blog, <a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/" target="_blank">Etan Does LA</a>, documents my quixotic attempt to visit each of the Los Angeles landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places (there are around 600 of them). It started off in September 2021, a time when the pandemic had me feeling pretty disconnected from my city, and I was looking for a safe way to feel like a part of it again.  </p><p>I was setting off on a short bike ride to the<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/1-portal-of-the-folded-wings-shrine-to-aviation/" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/1-portal-of-the-folded-wings-shrine-to-aviation/" target="_blank">Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation</a> in Burbank, and figured I’d look up a bit of information about it first (fun classic movie fact: the Portal features ornate sculptures by <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.portalofthefoldedwings.net/PAGES/Giorgi.html" target="_blank">Federico Giorgi</a>, who designed the epic Babylonian sets in DW Griffith’s <i>Intolerance</i>). I noticed the Portal was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which got me thinking about all the other things that might be on the list. If a lifelong Angeleno like me has never heard of many of these places, I bet I’m not the only one, right?  </p><p>What started as a few photos and a few sentences of history for each site, posted on <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.instagram.com/etandoesla" target="_blank">my Instagram page</a>, has expanded to a website with written histories, videos, and photo galleries. I’ve visited eyepopping modernist homes and humble post offices, missions and bridges, fire stations and funeral homes, craftsman bungalows and Hollywood high-rises, churches and adobes, plus playgrounds, libraries, Civil War-era mountain passes and of course, historic theatres. Every single visit fills in a detail about Los Angeles history that I didn’t know, and more often than not, learning about one site will send me down a joyous research rabbit hole. Like, when you learn that Grammy-winning record producer Joe Henry owned <a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/93-lucretia-garfield-house-greene-greene/" target="_blank">Greene &amp; Greene’s Lucretia Garfield</a> home for over a decade, you want to know which albums he recorded there, yeah? And if you can hear anything craftsman-y on those records? </p><p><b>How is the Los Angeles Conservancy a resource for you, as well as Angelenos in general?</b> </p><p>I do a lot of research on L.A. landmarks for my blog posts and videos. The information you find online is often too poorly researched to be reliable, or so impenetrably dense with facts and figures that it’s hard to decide where to start. The L.A. Conservancy’s backgrounders on historic sites and architects are consistently the most accurate and concise that I’ve found. They’ve helped deepen my understanding of the importance of the buildings I visit, and they ground each site in aesthetic and social contexts. I reference your website all the time in my blog posts.  </p><p>It’s super important that Angelenos experience L.A.’s history as <i>living</i> history. Buildings change over time, and old ones continue to be relevant to different communities in different ways. So I value all the programs that the L.A. Conservancy offers to help people engage with historic sites – whether it’s your regular walking tours, Last Remaining Seats, or one-off events like the Griffith Park 125th anniversary celebration last year. I went to a couple stops on that, learned a ton, and met some fellow L.A. history buffs that I’ve kept in touch with.  </p><p>I also love how the Los Angeles Conservancy comes into all of this with a preservation mindset. That wasn’t necessarily the outlook I had when I embarked on my project. But I’ve come to understand how fragile history can be, even when it’s embedded in massive buildings of brick and steel! And the L.A. Conservancy plays such an active preservation role – not just through education and advocacy, but also by holding conservation easements. I recently posted about <a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/101-frank-lloyd-wrights-freeman-house/" target="_blank">Frank Lloyd Wright’s Harriet and Samuel Freeman House</a>, which was bought in February by a developer who we <i>hope</i> will invest in a complete restoration. The easement that L.A. Conservancy holds on that home is a vital way of preserving its integrity and holding the owner accountable, so that the public can learn from this building for generations to come.  </p><p><b>Do you have a favorite historic theatre in Los Angeles and/or a favorite Last Remaining Seats experience?</b> </p><p>It’s a tossup between the <a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/49-san-gabriel-mission-playhouse/" target="_blank">Mission Playhouse in San Gabriel</a>, and the Alex Theatre in Glendale. In addition to its swoonworthy architecture, the Mission Playhouse was built as a permanent home for a single production, the <i>Mission Play</i>, a three-hour epic about the history of the California missions, written by <i>LA Times</i> columnist, poet and politician John S. McGroarty. I love the idea of an entire building constructed to house a single work of art!  </p><p>The Alex Theatre just screams <i>classic</i> with every fiber of its Greek/Egyptian-inspired look, and that giant floral spire erupting from its marquee. I’ll admit it though, this is a nostalgic pick…my high school graduation was held at the Alex Theatre. I wore a skintight silver disco outfit and performed Chick Corea’s “Armando’s Rhumba” on piano onstage. The Alex hasn’t been the same since.  </p><p>As for my favorite<i> Last Remaining Seats</i> experience, I have to say that <i>Blade Runner</i> in July 2022 stands out. It’s not just a classic sci-fi film, it’s a classic <i>Los Angeles</i> sci-fi film. It was so fun to spot famous LA landmarks like Union Station, the Bradbury Building and the Million Dollar Theatre in the film, especially at a time when I’m thinking a lot about how we use and reuse old buildings. And I was sitting at the Orpheum Theatre, just blocks away from all those spots! Unforgettable. </p><p>**** </p><p><a href="https://href.li/?http://www.etandoesla.com/" target="_blank">Etan Does LA website</a> </p><p><a href="https://href.li/?http://www.instagram.com/etandoesla" target="_blank">Follow @etandoesla on Instagram</a> </p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fetanar&amp;t=YTRhM2VmZDZlYTFjNDliYzZhZmUyMWQ2NDA0YTEzZjJjNDgxYWMxYSw2ZTg2Njk3ZGQ1M2FjYWE5NGQ5YzM2NDg4YWNhOTQxMGRmZTdlOTQ2&amp;ts=1658868420" target="_blank">Follow Etan on Facebook</a>  </p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/user/Narfish1?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Subscribe to Etan Does LA on YouTube</a>  </p>',NULL,'','2022-07-26 17:34:02','L.A.

Conservancy</p></blockquote><p>Television City (TVC) is an iconic place in Los Angeles, both for its commanding presence and stature in the Fairfaix District at the southeast corner of Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, and for its undeniable lead role in making television history. As a place that helps define this city, and a touchtone to our roots dating to the early ‘50s, TVC also illustrates just how vulnerable our heritage can be as part of the ongoing surge in growth and new development throughout L.A. </p><p>The potential for loss is the reason the Conservancy had Television City designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM) in 2018. It is also why we have worked so hard for the past year to ensure proposed new development surrounding TVC is compatible and does not overwhelm this historic place. </p><!-- more --><p>In April, after nearly a year of continuously meeting and working through various aspects, the Conservancy and Hackman Capital Partners, owner of TVC, jointly announced a new, revised plan and win-win solution that provides a balance for preservation and new development at the site. </p><p>“Television City is one of the great Hollywood studio lots,” says Michael Hackman, Founder and CEO of Hackman Capital Partners. “We are committed to investing in this important historic resource while ensuring it remains a robust job creator and world-class studio for decades to come. We are pleased to have worked with the Conservancy to find a win-win solution that preserves and celebrates the historic building while putting forth a plan that enhances TVC’s production operations and expands its production capacity.” </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="900" data-orig-width="1600"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s640x960/0999580acc63374ee9d99a0ddf3833b3c2d40c01.png" data-orig-height="900" data-orig-width="1600" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s75x75_c1/66d961295c32bac0022d31a468ad9bb2a8aca050.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s100x200/ab2a52dce1c0b78016ebcf695b5d1553865e9c27.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s250x400/69c4c57168264bae49a96cc2f2cb87e845dffbf9.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s400x600/abbc779d9144c2c7c9d158d43263517bb80218d5.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s500x750/34757527f24daa4bc2e3209eae2921a6b27e9c9d.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s540x810/3c668da0badffe96b5711ef04ec41563cab6ccf6.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s640x960/0999580acc63374ee9d99a0ddf3833b3c2d40c01.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s1280x1920/9fca859af07002693b17de14b1be780e9eece480.png 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2f0b6bf572dac073c17ccbe7752f219/d63d5fc946584d70-9d/s2048x3072/5fa2e5fb15ce922ffd9e00d30997a668947b4c69.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>CBS Television City&rsquo;s iconic front entrance. Photo by Adrian Scott Fine/L.A. Conservancy</p></blockquote><p>The refined plan and solution emerging from our collaboration preserves historic TVC and allows for significant new development at this legendary studio property. A comprehensive framework for a state of-the-art modernization will preserve the historic complex and maintain the 430- foot Beverly Boulevard viewshed. </p><p>The new proposal for TVC results in the following modifications – all intended to reduce the proximity, bulk and mass of the intended new construction and impact on the historic TVC complex: </p><ul><li>Reduction of proposed new construction directly on top of the historic TVC, eliminating 84 percent of overall volume and 102 feet of height </li><li>Limitation to single volume rooftop addition with a maximum height of 36 feet, and set back 55 feet from existing TVC Stage Building north facade </li><li>Setbacks for proposed eastern (60 feet from TVS Service Building) and western (150 feet from TVC Service Building) production office buildings </li><li>Removal of proposed Flex Pavilion in front of existing TVC Service Building, and establishment of 60 feet no-build zone </li></ul><p>This proposed project is still in the early phases of the development and approval process. The Conservancy will remain involved and ultimately a part of the formal review process regarding the design and materiality of the proposed new construction. The Conservancy’s goal has been to preserve TVC, though not freezing it in time, but kept in a way where new development does not fundamentally harm this conic L.A. landmark. </p><p>Through compromise and working together with Hackman, we think this solution ensures the studio’s much-needed modernization while protecting this historic building and maintaining eligibility as a City of Los Angeles HCM. We are grateful to Hackman Capital Partners for not only listening, but also working hard with us to achieve a good balance. </p><p>After nearly a year of collaboration, the solution now moving forward significantly reworks a previous design concept released publicly in March 2021, a design concept where the Conservancy had raised strong concerns. Environmental review for the Television City 2050 Specific Plan (TVC 2050) is now underway and we anticipate the release of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) soon. </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="900" data-orig-width="1600"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s640x960/6a959b42e2ad61a34e975b10f12b0484609a9ed6.png" data-orig-height="900" data-orig-width="1600" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s75x75_c1/892fbbd0be62128db46651f85bde95a71815dcbd.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s100x200/8b55e57f4100176598a83c2b60c446c3de99cc8c.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s250x400/2cdfb85c5f0ff2c08b5b7b627eb823e79e934d44.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s400x600/160c262c60c2ca56855b6f5cfecde5911bd181d2.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s500x750/e57683a5ee85c3442f326158435347c348d0a4d5.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s540x810/545dbf61e44ea5f06a04ecd7463703abaa374750.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s640x960/6a959b42e2ad61a34e975b10f12b0484609a9ed6.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s1280x1920/ab66143f68a8690fa656e0f54faf3a70d1b52fd1.png 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/12f062499e0e38643add46bfc473e726/d63d5fc946584d70-42/s2048x3072/cad6742758882fa1dbac65dfdbffc53ece7db044.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>Newspaper clipping announcing the CBS Television City model</p></blockquote><h2>A Look Back</h2><p>In early 2018, the Conservancy started work to protect TVC by initiating the HCM process. This effort followed earlier news that CBS Corporation was interested in selling the twenty-five-acre property. Announcement of a potential sale raised widespread concern over the fate of the architecturally and culturally significant campus, which was identified as National Register-eligible in Los Angeles’ SurveyLA (a citywide inventory of potential historic places in L.A.). </p><p>Opened in 1952 and known as CBS Television City, it was the first large-scale facility in the United States designed specifically for television production. CBS hired the local architecture firm Pereira &amp; Luckman. Among the architects on the project team were acclaimed architects Gin Wong, James Langenheim, and Charles Stanton. The campus integrated soundstages, studios, editing rooms, offices, rehearsal halls, shops, and storage, all with expandability in mind. On the interior, flexibility was key then and now: studio walls and even some exterior walls can be moved and rearranged to accommodate the needs of specific productions.</p><p> For more than six decades and counting, Television City has been the portal for some of America’s most beloved television shows. From within its modern and custom designed stages, television broke new ground, from variety/sketch comedy television shows like The Carol Burnett Show to the life of Archie Bunker and the controversial issues of the day in All in the Family. Today, it is home to such popular newer productions like The James Corden Show as well as longtime shows such as The Price Is Right. </p><p>For more about the history of this preservation issue, please visit our <a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>',NULL,'','2022-05-11 16:57:10','L.A.

Why?</b></p><p><i>Evanne St. Charles: </i>I don’t think I could choose just one woman! I think it is the thousands of women who came to The Woman’s Building in search of belonging and purpose. Their ability to work collectively for change is what inspires me.</p><p><i>Lindsay Mulchay: </i>I not only learned about inspiring women but was lucky enough to get to know several, like the writer and activist Carolyn Weathers, who reminds me to lead with my heart.</p><p><i>Sian Winship: </i>Alice Stebbins Wells (1853-1957) was the first full-time uniformed policewoman in the country. What a game-changer! And Carol Downer (1933-present), founder of the Women&rsquo;s Self Help Clinic Movement, as an alternative to the male-dominated medical profession. What a visionary!</p><p><b>How has your experience studying sites of women&rsquo;s history shaped your personal life or identity?</b></p><p><i>Sian Winship: </i>I happened to be researching the Women&rsquo;s Rights Context during the #MeToo movement. It was shocking and disturbing to see how history repeats itself.</p><p><i>Lindsay Mulchay: </i>It affirms for me that organizing is based in relationships and that those relationships flourish in spaces that foster safety, self-expression, and community connection.</p><p><b>What aspect of The Woman’s Building’s history is timely to understand today?</b></p><p><i>Evanne St. Charles: </i>The Woman’s Building was an institution created by women, for women. Its goal was to give women – and underrepresented communities more broadly – a place where their voices could be heard. Organizations that lift up the voices of underrepresented peoples continue to be central to the creation of a more just and equitable society.</p><p><b>What aspect of women’s history is timely to understand today?</b></p><p><i>Lindsay Mulachy: </i>The strongest movements are intersectional – they cast a wide net and center the most marginalized.</p><p><i>Sian Winship: </i>We&rsquo;ve been taught that Northern California led the way. This is not true. California women would have had the right to vote in 1896 if it had solely been the votes of Southern Californians&hellip;</p><p>Many of the most important sites from Second Wave Feminism were not purpose-built buildings.

One of these projects was the Powell Library at UCLA which won a Los Angeles Conservancy Preservation Award.</p><!-- more --><p><b>Why is it important to you to support preservation?</b></p><p>For me, it began growing up in Carthay and attending Carthay Circle Elementary School. At that time, the Carthay Circle Theater was demolished by a wrecking ball. My early introduction to preservation was on the playground, watching a wrecking ball demolish the historic theater.</p><p>The earlier preservation awareness and neighborhood education begins, the better. I think there is a huge opportunity, through public education, to highlight neighborhoods where schools are located. This could include informing students how the adjacent neighborhoods were developed, designed by architects, built by contractors, etc. Public educators can speak about the architecture of the schools they teach in and the adjacent neighborhoods where the students and their parents live.</p><p>Supporting preservation coincides with the need for greater public education and awareness of relevant preservation issues. Through greater education and awareness, will hopefully inform more of the public to care more about the areas in which they live and work.</p><p><b>What compelled you to become a member of the Pillar Society?</b></p><p>Los Angeles Conservancy has been included in my estate planning for many years. Once the Pillar Society was created, joining became a very easy decision. The Pillar Society recognizes and makes public what I was already doing. Hopefully, the public recognition will incentivize and motivate others to do the same.</p><p><b>Why do you think others should consider becoming members of the Pillar Society?</b></p><p>See above.</p><p><b>You very generously provided a matching gift to the Conservancy&rsquo;s Preservation Advocacy Fund in 2021.  What motivated you to do this?</b></p><p>Supporting the matching gift initiative is a great way to leverage funds, which increases the effectiveness of the Los Angeles Conservancy’s Advocacy efforts.</p><p><b>You have been a Conservancy member since 1990, working your way up to being a Granite Cornerstone member; why do you feel membership support is important?</b></p><p>As a long-term Los Angeles Conservancy Member, my support has increased in multiple ways over the years, including LAC’s recent support of the nomination of the Carthay neighborhood as a National Register Historic District through the Carthay Neighborhoods National Register Nomination Fund.</p><p>As property values rise, the tension between development and preservation also increases, as does the need to support the LAC and other preservation groups.</p>',NULL,'','2022-03-03 17:00:30','L.A.

Photo by Gary Leonard.</i></p></blockquote><p>Happy thirtieth anniversary to Linda Dishman, the Conservancy’s president and CEO! Focused and fearless, Linda has been a force of leadership for the Conservancy and the historic preservation movement throughout California. </p><p>Linda joined the Conservancy as executive director in March 1992. Since then, the organization has grown to 5,000 members—the largest membership of a local historic preservation organization in the country—and our budget is now $3 million. </p><p>From all of us at the Conservancy, a heartfelt congratulations and thank you! We asked Linda to reflect on her time at the Conservancy. </p><!-- more --><p><b>What do you love about working at the Conservancy? </b></p><p>It’s the people! I have a poster on my wall that says, “People make history, people preserve it.” That really encapsulates why our work is so meaningful. We save historic buildings because they mean something to people.</p><p>The best part is when I talk to people and they [talk about] a building that has meaning to them. Sometimes it is a school they went to, a little neighborhood store they visited every Saturday with their grandmother, or the house where they grew up that holds their memories. And, sometimes we hear stories about buildings that we all know and celebrate, like City Hall and the Central Library.</p><p>We respect that people’s stories reside in many places throughout Los Angeles. They’re what makes Los Angeles so special! </p><p><br/></p><p><b>How has preservation changed in the last thirty years? </b></p><p>There is greater public awareness and appreciation for historic buildings and what they do for communities. We can point to many examples that showcase the value of historic preservation on a project. Take the Tower Theatre, for example. It was vacant for over thirty years. Then, Apple came in with a strong vision to adaptively reuse the space in a way that celebrated its historic character on par with its cutting-edge technology. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>How has the Conservancy changed since you started?</b></p><p>The Conservancy has more members and staff, more experience, and more great work under our belt! We’re doing more to celebrate the full story of Los Angeles, including nominations of culturally significant sites, community outreach, and a wildly successful legacy business campaign. I’m excited for us to expand this work further. The Conservancy also has more tools and has developed best practices we’re now sharing with the public through our Community Leadership Boot Camps. Win or lose, there is much to be learned from every advocacy effort.</p><p>Our work to specifically tell a broader, more inclusive story through our advocacy and educational work has grown the perception of what’s worth saving in truly meaningful ways. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>How has the Conservancy stayed the same? </b></p><p>We remain rooted in our values to find win-win preservation-minded solutions. When we’re working on advocacy issues, we focus on options that preserve the historic building and also meet the project’s end goals, whether it is adding housing units or turning a commercial building into office space. The Conservancy is eager to demonstrate how historic preservation can be a tool in helping Los Angeles address critical issues, like housing or climate change.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What was one of your greatest losses at the Conservancy?</b></p><p>It’s really tough to lose a building, especially a building you’ve worked a long time to try and save. That was certainly the situation with the demolition of the Ambassador Hotel in 2005 and 2006. We were sad. <i>I was sad.</i> We did everything possible to provide an alternative to demolition. We’d never had the capacity to do that before. We exhausted every resource and idea. By the time we lost, <i>we lost. </i>But we looked at the effort and thought: <i>how do we use this loss as we look to the future?  </i>We learned a lot.</p><p>It&rsquo;s interesting, people still tell me how sad they are about the loss of the Ambassador—even those who were not that supportive at the time.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What is one of your most memorable moments in a historic building?</b></p><p>In talking about the Ambassador Hotel, it brings back the memory of being in the pantry where Robert Kennedy was assassinated.</p><p>It was a place of great sadness and being there in person was very powerful. It really resonated as a sacred place. What happened in that pantry changed the direction of our country. The Conservancy wanted the pantry to be preserved for that reason, so students could understand the assassination in a broader context, understand the history of our nation, and be inspired.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What is something people may not know about you?</b></p><p>People think I’m from Los Angeles, but I actually grew up in Sacramento. My mother was from South Pasadena, so I was raised hearing stories of her going to the Broadway theatres, riding the streetcars downtown, and ice cream sundaes at Chatam’s in Westwood Village. She went to UCLA. Even before I came to L.A., I had a strong sense of the history of Los Angeles.</p><p>One of my most precious memories is when I was five and came down to Los Angeles with my mom. My grandmother took me to the Ambassador Hotel and we had lunch at the patio there. Maybe that’s why it was poignant when we lost the building.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What is one of your favorite preservation moments?</b></p><p>The evening when the Downey McDonald’s reopened. Saving the Downey McDonald’s was a really hard fight because we were up against one of the biggest corporations in America, who for a variety of reasons didn’t want this building to survive. Thankfully, they changed their trajectory and decided to restore the building. At the opening event, there was a big black-tie affair in the parking lot. The servers came out with platters covered by silver domes for each person. When they opened the silver dome, there was a Quarter Pounder with fries.

The same goes for the now-doomed Googie style Amphitheatre, despite being marked for preservation in the proposal that was selected by the City and County.</p><p>As a public-private venture between the City, County and the developer (AvalonBay and Abode Communities), preservation was supposed to be a priority, at least it was in the official Request for Proposals (RFP) process, stated as one of ten key aspects to be addressed.</p><p><i>So … what is happening here?</i></p><p>Preservation through adaptive reuse is readily achievable in this project, and can complement the proposed new mixed income housing. New buildings of the same footprint are to replace the branch City Hall and Courthouse. The existing Amphitheatre can be repurposed and kept.</p><p>It is easier to demolish everything and build subterranean parking over the entire site than build around the historic buildings. Yet easy does not equal better. Until someone in leadership steps forward and presses for an alternative that successfully marries the old with the new, this development team will continue to seek the easy way out. As a familiar pattern that keeps repeating itself across this city, L.A. can do and deserves better.</p><p>Please join the L.A.

Photo courtesy Mike Bravo</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Interview by M. Rosalind Sagara</i></b></p><p>The First Baptist Church of Venice and adjacent parking lots located at 671-685 and 686-688 East Westminster Avenue are among the last remaining significant historic resources associated with the history and development of Oakwood, an early African American neighborhood in Los Angeles. These properties tell the story of pioneering African Americans who financed and built an important center of spiritual, cultural, and social life in Venice.</p><p>In 2018, the Cultural Heritage Commission denied the Historic-Cultural Monument nomination of the church property. The community persisted and with newfound support from Councilmember Mike Bonin, a new application for landmark designation was considered by the Cultural Heritage Commission on June 3, 2021. The Commission unanimously recommended listing and the nomination now heads to the City Council’s Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee and then to the City Council for final approval.</p><p>Naomi Nightingale, Venice resident, community organizer, and recent graduate of the Conservancy’s Community Leadership Boot Camp, helped gather new information for the nomination. In addition, she has had a front-row seat to the nearly four-year journey the community has been on to landmark the church property. Naomi spoke to Neighborhood Outreach Manager M. Rosalind Sagara in June about what she’s learned about the landmarking process and her community through her work on this preservation issue.</p><!-- more --><p><b>RS:</b> When did you get involved in preserving the First Baptist Church of Venice?</p><p><b>NN:</b> In 2017 when I saw Laddie Williams sitting in front of the church. I stopped and asked her why she was there. I learned the church had been sold and it shocked me. I also learned there were some people who were members of the church who had filed a lawsuit to prevent the sale and to keep the church, but they were not successful. The judge ruled that the sale of church was legitimate; the court would not rescind the sale. So, at that point, the community decided we were going to fight to preserve it. Then owner Jay Penske had filed a permit for an adaptive reuse with the intent of making the church his personal home and the community was affronted and appalled by that.</p><p><b>RS: </b>How did you secure support for the nomination from the Council District and others?</p><p><b>NN: </b>I think Councilmember Bonin saw that the community was adamant, that we were relentless, and that our efforts for the church were coming from a place of history, significance, bonding, and ties, for our grandparents and other people that we knew. While we are talking about the church, we’re seeing the erasure of our history through the destruction of buildings and the removal, or the exodus of people and families. I think he thought we were not going to go away. We pressed our Councilmember, “What support have you given us? What recognition and acknowledgement of the contributions and the culture of this [African American] community have you given us?” I think from that point forward, there was a shift. He saw us as a formidable force in reference to the church and what we said made sense in terms of the historical significance of the church and the community.</p><p>We felt that not only the Councilmember, but developers, and other people in other parts of the community didn’t have an understanding about what the church meant to the African American community. To them, it was like “What’s the big deal?” These were people who actually lived here in the community, Caucasian people, who may not have really paid attention, or had no connection with what was going on. The more that we were able to put the word out, spread the news so to speak, and engage people about what the church meant and who Arthur Reese was, the more we found support. There had not been a lot of information out there about him except for he was the guy who did the amusement parks, or was the guy who helped with the decorations, but being a homeowner, a land owner, civically engaged, that was not information about Reese that people knew.</p><p><b>RS: </b>In your research for the nomination of the church was there a story that stood out to you?</p><p><b>NN:</b> I was ecstatic to learn about the church’s architect George Williams. It seemed that so much hung on who the builder or architect of the church was. It seemed that because people were not able to name him previously, there was less importance or significance to the church because Paul Williams, the architect of the congregation’s previous church, was so huge. When I discovered information about George Williams from the AIA and newspaper clippings, that brought absolute joy to my heart!</p><p><b>RS: </b>What has kept people motivated to stay involved over the years?</p><p><b>NN:</b> The real desire to not allow our history to be erased. That was at the top of the list. To take the church away and to make it into someone’s personal living room, bedroom, or living quarters was just sacrilegious. We just could not allow that to happen. To lose the church would be to lose so much more in terms of our history, the personalities of our community, the hard work that we knew, the stories that were told about our family members who lived on that street, people who went to that church, and people that we still know today. To us, even though the church was sold it was still a living, breathing, important piece of our lives. And there just wasn’t the will to let it go.</p><p><b>RS: </b>What activities did you organize to help keep people engaged?</p><p><b>NN:</b> We met on those church steps every single Sunday for almost four years. We passed out fliers and engaged people as they passed by. We invited other people. We had radio and T.V. appearances. This was early on when we were going before the Westside Commission and I think I was asked at the time what will you do, what’s next? “We’re not giving up.” I was raised with the idea that if you had the fire in your spirit, that meant you were still supposed to go. As long as there is any spark of possibility, then you don’t accept no. I didn’t know just like a lot of us did not know what the outcome was going to be, what the next step was going to be, but we all knew that whatever it was going to be, we were not going to stop.</p><p><b>RS: </b>Could you talk about how the Black Lives Matter Mural in front of the church came to be and how it’s related to the community’s effort to preserve the church?</p><p><b>NN:</b> When we met with Councilmember Bonin, we said we needed to not only preserve the church, but we needed to also have an imprint within the Oakwood community that also acknowledged the significance of the community. And we thought the Black Lives Matter mural would do that. We had a big rally there following George Floyd’s death and we had probably at least 400 people, or more out there. We held a march and that raised the importance of the church to the community and to lots of other people, White, Black, Brown. Not just in the Venice community, or the Oakwood community, but from outside, people from the beach, from Santa Monica, students from USC, and other parts of the city. The church was on the map of the Oakwood community as being the first African American church in the community and its longevity was known, but it helped us get widespread acknowledgment. People from Alabama were writing and inviting me to other meetings about rural communities in the South! I was able to get information about how other people are going about trying to save or resurrect their communities.</p><p><b>RS: </b>At the June 3rdCultural Heritage Commission meeting, Councilmember Bonin requested that the parking lots adjacent to the church and those across the street where the earlier church building had stood be included in the Historic-Cultural Monument nomination. Can you tell us more?</p><p><b>NN:</b> The City staff findings recommended the church for designation, but the parking lots were excluded because they believed they had no significance to the structure itself. We were not in agreement with that recommendation. From the beginning, we wanted the lots to be included. I was prepared to make a case for including both the adjacent lots and those across the street on the day of the hearing. Arthur Reese owned the lot where the previous church stood. The land was deeded to him. He donated the lot to the church and was a deacon there. The church was built on the land. And then across the street, that used to be a boat yard. The community purchased that land, some of them giving up their deeds or monies to help build collateral for the purchase of the land, and then the church was built. So how anyone could say there’s no connection or historical significance? To me it’s just a land grab and we’re not going to accept that, and I told them why. The people that established the Oakwood community, that worked it, made it what it is, that gave to the land, that brought their families here, all of that is part of the richness of the Oakwood community and land is wealth. And, so as the erasure of the community continues it means that the wealth that was built here is also being erased. For the community, there was never a separation between the seven lots. We always spoke in terms of the seven lot ties to the church’s history.</p><p><b>RS: </b>What’s next?</p><p>NN: I’m in the process of writing a plan for the future use of the church. I know the property is still owned by a private party, but I’m writing it anyway. It’s based on ideas that the community has talked about. I will present it to the community and we’ll see how it goes.</p>',NULL,'','2021-08-22 00:06:18','L.A. Conservancy Blog','',NULL,'2023-11-20 16:29:57','read');

The only child of Maria Rivas and Andres del Tiempo, her birth name was Concha Dolores del Tiempo. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Connie graduated from Manual Arts High School in 1947, attended Los Angeles City College, and went to work for Pacific Telephone. In 1951, she married William Humberger and moved to Glendale, where she resided until her death. She was predeceased by her husband, and is survived by her daughter, Andrea Humberger.</p><p>Connie began working for the Glendale Unified School District (GUSD) in the late 1960s. Fluent in Spanish, she taught English as a Second Language at Horace Mann Elementary School, and later worked with bilingual education programs.</p><p>Connie had a deep love for the city of Los Angeles and its built environment, especially City Hall and the downtown theatres. So, after leaving GUSD, she spent more than 20 years working for the L.A. Conservancy. She managed the Downtown Walking Tour program, and was a founding member of the Last Remaining Seats Committee.</p><p>Warm, positive, generous, and enthusiastic, Connie was known as the heart and soul of the Conservancy.  Several of her L.A. Conservancy co-workers and friends shared memories of Connie.</p><!-- more --><h2>L.A. Conservancy Colleagues</h2><p><b>Linda Dishman:</b>  Connie had an amazing ability to connect with everyone. She especially loved her volunteers. That said, she expected everyone to perform their assigned duties. One time on a tour, I was covering for someone as a line monitor at Connie’s site. It was great to meet and talk with members. Connie told me afterwards that I couldn’t be a line monitor again because too many people wanted to talk with me which distracted me from my assigned duties. </p><p>I learned a great deal from her and I am grateful for the many years we worked and laughed together. </p><p><b>Bruce Scottow: </b>A long time ago (&ldquo;a hundred years ago&rdquo; as Connie was often given to defining long-past events) I paid a visit to the Conservancy&rsquo;s downtown office to check out their library. I was doing some research work on historic buildings and heard their resources were excellent. A short time after settling in at the table, a woman came into the room, introduced herself as Connie. Well, my research came to a halt as over the next hour, we launched into stories about just everything under the sun. I recall that the receptionist had to ask us to &ldquo;keep it down,&rdquo; So began our 20-year friendship. </p><p>Within a short time, I became a volunteer with the Conservancy, helping as a walking tour docent, LRS volunteer, and special tours volunteer. No matter what my role, Connie made me feel welcomed and valued, as she did all volunteers. This was something that proved an essential lesson as I later replaced her as Volunteer Coordinator on her retirement. I &ldquo;channeled&rdquo; Connie dozens of times through my career at the Conservancy, but try as I might, I quickly knew that nobody could ever fill her shoes. She was unique and I miss her every day. </p><p><b>Annie Laskey:</b> I was hired at LAC in 2000 to run the Walking Tour program so that Connie could go to part time and focus on volunteers (although anyone who knew Connie knew that she never ever could do anything part time!). Stepping into a job that has been run for years by an adored, amazing, and smart woman is daunting – who could possibly replace Connie?!  I’ll never forget how she used every ounce of her loving, forceful nature to essentially tell all the docents, “Annie is taking over the program for me, you had better love her or you will answer to me!”  </p><p>She had the heart of a lion and the soul of a hostess:  along with advice, there were always flowers on the table and food for the guests.  I was lucky to be friends with her for 20 years, and never stopped being amazed by her energy and joy.  </p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1438" data-orig-width="3200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s640x960/4e5f8a01771b03638032e9133f60eb7c0b949936.png" data-orig-height="1438" data-orig-width="3200" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s75x75_c1/50d81eda153bf39b3f91c63257cea5a16cfb3d3d.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s100x200/dcfd9531c543eead2222668f8142a7d851b45673.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s250x400/0558e6af43862fa9a4f00bda571c3d6b714a344a.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s400x600/26fa9ba856a0ba269e35d94d31bafe5c9285b4c8.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s500x750/f66fccc2af8e63417c8462d8e571d73359573c2b.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s540x810/1756118ae921b4e30df2d5bf1c96362f38a3ab8a.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s640x960/4e5f8a01771b03638032e9133f60eb7c0b949936.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s1280x1920/925506b38ec545950edbde1961f771b78bfd5dc2.png 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ffa951df1b1d71bc7f1caaf2444c45e/94c255d99cbb53c5-e7/s2048x3072/a4f16431da9b873d1bff7439d662fb3bc287a7fb.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><i>Connie at a 1987 Volunteer party.

I’d send her photos when visiting family. Her favorite was pear salad with mayo and cheese, dyed red and green for Christmas. This delightful treat will always remind me of La Doña. </p><p><b>Trudi Sandmeier: </b>Connie was one of my heroes - a model of empathy, compassion, and understanding, she had a gift for seeing the special part of all of us. I learned a great deal about how to be a better human from her. Her vibrant personality will live on in my memory, but she will be profoundly missed.</p><p><b>Gregg Davidson:</b> I met Connie as a volunteer at the Lafayette Square house tour in 1987. That summer Connie was on the planning committee for the inaugural Last Remaining Seats series and from that point on we became dear friends for the rest of her life. No matter which LA landmark we discussed there would be a Connie anecdote or story connected to it.</p><p><b>Kevin Geary:</b> I had the privilege of working with Connie Humberger at the LAC for two years. Anyone who knew Connie can testify to how well organized she was&hellip;most of the time.</p><p>Once, Connie and I had to attend a community meeting to give people details about a possible tour in their neighborhood. I was not only new to the LAC, I was also new to LA. I had no idea where we were heading. Connie gave me the directions but also suggested I follow her in case she left out anything. Thank goodness I was able to follow closely without losing her! We ended up taking what seemed like five different freeways, and three of them were not even part of her directions! But we made it! Connie remained one of my closest friends for 25 years. I will miss her terribly.</p><h2>Conservancy Volunteers</h2><p><b>Rory Cunningham:</b> Connie and I met at the very first meeting of what became the Last Remaining Seats Committee at John Miller and Richard Mouck’s beautiful home. We subsequently served as co-chairs for the final night of the very first LRS at the Los Angeles Theatre in 1987. Her grace, charm and great humor endeared her to everyone who had the honor of knowing and/or working with her and it’s why she became such a revered friend of mine for more than 3 decades. </p><p><b>Christy McAvoy:</b> Friend, mentor, collaborator, teacher. Connie and I shared a deep appreciation for the value of educational experiences in preservation. The level of commitment and the extraordinary quality of the docent core is a living embodiment of her achievements. </p><p><b>Jan Westman:</b> I met Connie when I came to the Conservancy as a volunteer docent, she was always available whenever I needed help. We remained close friends after her retirement until her passing. I miss her greatly. </p><p><b>Tom Sutherland: </b> Connie Humberger was one of the brightest stars in the Conservancy Constellation. I worked with her many times over the last 25 years; every time was a pleasure, especially those with the LRS Committee. I shall miss her greatly in the days to come. </p><p><b>Kari Fowler</b>, Historic Resources Group<b>:</b> I looked forward to seeing Connie every year at the LA Conservancy luncheon so we could discuss our shared affection for <i>Spongebob Squarepants</i>. </p><p><b>Mary Ann Lovato: </b>I have had the utmost pleasure to know Connie Humberger for over 25 years.  She was my instructor for the Volunteer and Docent Program in 1995.  Connie was devoted to the L.A. Conservancy’s preservation efforts and highly valued each and every docent.  She was very knowledgeable of every building, neighborhood, boulevard, avenue, courtyard, et. al. in Los Angeles.  She loved Los Angeles and made a sincere effort to preserve its evolving history.  The L.A. Conservancy lost a true gem.  Connie Humberger will be dearly missed. </p><p><b>Ed Trosper:</b> Whatever the event, whether it was a hot day, a cold day, or a rainy day, when you heard Connie&rsquo;s laugh, you knew you were going to have fun. When holding court at an afterparty, it seemed there was always a group around her. She remembered every story of triumph or face plant, and would share them with a guffaw at the end. </p><p><b>Kevin Geary:</b> I had the privilege of working with Connie Humberger at the LAC for two years.

I am one of many who adored Miss Connie and it was an honor to know her.</p><p><b>Marcia Hanford:</b> In decades of warmly remembering details about every volunteer, Connie kept a watchful eye that clear expectations and working conditions were well managed for all events. Her bilingual skills were precious. At the time of the first Last Remaining Seats, the Broadway theatres featured mostly Spanish-speaking films, and some movie house staff could only communicate through Connie. She kept those wheels in motion, and the film reels turned on time. </p><p><b>Tom Gardner:</b> I have known and loved Connie since meeting her at the Conservancy about 35 years ago, she as the new Volunteer Coordinator, and I as an active volunteer, and we have socialized throughout the years.  Connie&rsquo;s Easter Party was always one of the highlights of our year.  We always enjoyed our outings together and our many phone calls (always filled with laughter even near the end). </p><p><b>Mary Alice Wollam and Bob Brennan: </b>Connie was curious, funny, vivacious, and loved Los Angeles, but I think her greatest talent was being a friend. Connie used that talent to offer the volunteers encouragement, a sounding board, sometimes under the most hilarious circumstances. I have a bucket of Connie stories from so many LAC tours and events, but what I cherish most is the years of friendship that she gave Bob and me. </p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Memorial gifts may be made to the </i></b><a href="https://href.li/?http://www.laconservancy.org/donate" target="_blank"><b><i>L.A.

The City identified Taix as an eligible historic place through its SurveyLA program, as did Holland Partner Group, through a study they commissioned. Everyone agreed it is historic. </p><p>Early schematics developed by Holland Partner Group retained a portion of Taix as part of their development plans. Yet, the project unveiled in May 2020 called for the building&rsquo;s demolition, replacing the historic restaurant building and surface parking lot with a planned, majority market-rate housing and retail development.</p><p>The L.A. Conservancy stands up for historic places and supports new housing and greater density where it makes sense—especially when it involves much-needed affordable housing. </p><p>What the City and the Holland Partner Group are offering, in this case, is a false choice, claiming we either save Taix or build housing. Through some creative design and a willingness to think outside the box, we can do both.

It also rejected Holland Partner Group&rsquo;s request to designate only signage and the bar top; essentially, Councilmember O''Farrell&rsquo;s modification. </p><p>Historic nominations are sometimes modified or reduced in scope, especially as part of the political process. We have never seen it done to this extreme, where a designated monument no longer represents a place but instead just architectural fragments.</p><p>The Conservancy and community partners are pressing for a win-win alternative, which we firmly believe is possible with creativity and collaboration. </p><p>The Holland Partner Group wants to gain approval for its project through the City&rsquo;s streamlined Sustainable Communities Project Exemption (SCPE) process. Their problem is this cannot happen if there is an adverse impact on a historic place through demolition. Calling the modified Taix nomination, essentially architectural salvage, a Historic-Cultural Monument does not give Holland or the City the ability to circumvent the process. </p><p>The Conservancy and community partners are concerned about the dangerous precedent this sets for future nominations. This power play opens the door for Historic-Cultural Monument nominations to be hijacked and manipulated for purposes other than heritage conservation, which devalues a program that until now has helped preserve well over 1,200 historic places throughout Los Angeles.</p><p>Would saving two signs and a counter from the Cinerama Dome or Grand Central Market be the same as preserving the places where people build lasting connections? </p><p><i><b>Of course not. </b></i></p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3136" data-orig-width="4181"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s640x960/32f5b2d6e00f37b743b24a319a49dd9433665fb5.png" data-orig-height="3136" data-orig-width="4181" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s75x75_c1/fd19b244bab786d58fedae0ace5dffe9319fbeec.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s100x200/d0fae6cd9665a0bed2a730b4fddd0a5199919062.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s250x400/be0f339c50f4528a1586f867a2f49346581ad67f.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s400x600/1f8107f3a81c57dea5363d8444e06e0a9430edeb.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s500x750/595f1d55e8483d98699c42fa575166789b0bd89a.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s540x810/a93a603b07721d66feeeec4630a5d7184c2eb285.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s640x960/32f5b2d6e00f37b743b24a319a49dd9433665fb5.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s1280x1920/48878f5442ae9283b261f3285d5058a2de45193b.png 1280w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/d97d7d460523e5fbe880b1be1cf07c0a/7030a24a5dd2a7f4-61/s2048x3072/b468133d6a867c897180cd19fe867958aa1f412a.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"/></figure></div><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><small><b><i>Would you call THIS historic preservation?</i></b></small></p></blockquote><p>Whether you support saving Taix or not, the issue is now much larger and consequential.

Weekly</a></i>, “Gintong Kasaysayan, Gintong Pamana” (“A Glorious History, A Golden Legacy”) in <a href="https://www.lanlt.org/unidad-park-community-garden" target="_blank">Historic Filipinotown’s Unidad Park</a> turned 25 years old last year. Commissioned by the Social and Public Art Resource Center (<a href="https://sparcinla.org/" target="_blank">SPARC</a>) and created by artist Eliseo Art Silva in 1995, the mural tells a story of the awakening of Filipino national and political consciousness, and pays tribute to Filipinos, both locally and nationally. <br/></p><p>In May, the L.A. Conservancy’s Neighborhood Outreach Manager M. Rosalind Sagara interviewed artist Eliseo Art Silva about the mural, Historic Filipinotown, and how the two contribute to our growing understanding and appreciation of Asian American &amp; Pacific Islander (AAPI) heritage in Los Angeles. </p><!-- more --><p><b>RS: What inspired Gintong Kasaysayan, Gintong Pamana?</b></p><p><b>ES: </b>Chapter eight of Jose Rizal&rsquo;s novel Noli Me Tangere is titled &ldquo;Recuerdos,&rdquo; and it depicts a scene wherein the main protagonist encounters a kind of inverted telescope which converges Europe and Manila in one scene. Rizal calls it &ldquo;The Spectre of Comparisons&rdquo;: a charged space where nationalism, art, and the imagination emerge from. It was the kind of space I wanted to recreate in the expansive “Great Wall of Pilipinotown&quot; so that ultimately, we can emerge both a Creative Economy and Ethnic Economy within the Filipino enclave of Los Angeles. At that time (1994-1995), the area was not yet designated as HiFi. Filipino leaders <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-27-me-17817-story.html" target="_blank">Uncle Roy Morales </a>and Joel Jacinto have said that the Filipino mural was integral to the successful designation of the district as Historic Filipinotown. </p><p><b>RS: How does the mural fit in to the story of Historic Filipinotown? </b></p><p><b>ES</b>: There were four murals in Filipinotown painted by Filipino Americans with a Filipino theme prior to “Gintong Kasaysayan,” and two more painted after, but only “Gintong Kasaysayan” has been preserved. Three of the murals were lost to demolition and the other three were painted over without protest or resistance. The other artists that painted Filipino murals within the neighborhood are Faustino Caigoy, Orlando Castillo, and Papo De Asis. </p><p>Since previous attempts to Filipinize Filipinotown were largely limited to Bahay Kubo (&ldquo;Nipa Hut&rdquo;) aesthetics and the mentality it generates of minimizing the achievements of pre-colonial Philippines as a major player of The Filipino Story, “Gintong Kasaysayan” shifts the Filipino perspective. From one largely shaped by the Americanization movement, designed to rid the Philippines of Filipinos, to one that takes The Filipino Story as the main protagonist. It elevates Filipinos as a major player in America’s cultural landscape so our own Filipino community can earn and deserve that equal seat at the table of power and influence. Why have a seat at the table if all that we bring to the table is the stories of foreigners in our country told &ldquo;on their behalf&rdquo;?  </p><p>What the “Gintong Kasaysayan” mural offers to the city is what the Filipino community can offer and why they deserve that equal seat at the table. What the mural provides is The Filipino Story. It challenges people to answer the question: What is &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; in Historic Filipinotown? </p><p>At times, it aims to make people uncomfortable that they do not know enough about the story of Filipinos in this country and city, along with making Filipinos uncomfortable that they themselves do not take their own Filipino Story seriously enough to make it the main event in their own lives and humanity.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1356" data-orig-height="1268" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/10394a1f90b15ea36299d866f575f7a3/24edd39e7594480e-47/s540x810/cfd343387f78024cc3f374519b4f0fa460c3d8dc.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1356" data-orig-height="1268"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>Festival of Philippine Arts and Culture, 2020</i></p></blockquote><p><b>RS: Has the mural encountered challenges over its lifetime and how have these been addressed? </b></p><p>ES: Yes, many challenges have surfaced throughout the more than 25 years that the mural was in public view in that area of the city. </p><p>First of all, the Filipino community had not held an annual event in front of the mural until I initiated the Larry Itliong Day celebration in 2015 at Unidad Park<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/larry-itliong-day-celebrated-honor-filipino-american-laborer-leader-n450046" target="_blank"></a>. Because “Gintong Kasaysayan” was largely ignored by our own community for most of its two decades in the neighborhood, there were several instances when we almost lost the mural or the cultural integrity of the site. </p><p>When I moved to the East Coast in 2000 and lived there for 15 years, the mural came to a point when the residents around the mural wanted to cover the it with a 15-foot-tall fence to accommodate 25 community garden beds which would have obstructed the entire length of the wall. Had I not happened to visit the site while the meetings were being conducted, that community garden would have completely covered the entire length of the mural. </p><p>My personal protest produced the current mural signage for the public to recognize the significance of the mural and the site to the City of Los Angeles and the Filipino community. There was also a time when the neighborhood came close to erecting a life-size full figure monument honoring Bishop Romero at the center of the dap-ay space. </p><p><i>(Author’s note: The dap-ay is circular in form and intended to create a communal gathering space. It is a character-defining feature of Unidad Park and is believed to be the first of its kind outside of the Philippines.) </i></p><p><b>RS: What is your favorite part of the mural? </b></p><p>ES: The shifts in meaning. I like the parts intended to be ambiguous, challenging and uncomfortable. </p><p><b>RS: How do murals link the past to the present? </b></p><p>ES:  I believe that murals are the best way to document communities. At its best, art and murals are not didactic, yet reveal core truths.

Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, and Dave Brubeck recorded here. Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Charlie Parker jammed here. But most importantly, a crucial chapter in jazz history played out here.  <br/></p><p>While cities like New Orleans and New York City are where jazz music was born and bred, Los Angeles was the beating heart of the West Coast Jazz scene. From the late 1920s to the 1950s not only was L.A.’s jazz scene influential to the art of jazz itself, it brought pride and power to L.A.’s Black community. </p><!-- more --><p>The epicenter of it all was the historic Central Avenue corridor, from Little Tokyo to Watts, with some jazz joints springing up as far away as Hollywood. Central Avenue was the economic and social center of a segregated Black community. A cultural mecca, the scene was constant and electric. As the only integrated section of L.A., people of all races and classes—from blue-collar workers to Hollywood stars—mingled together to watch, to dance, to drink, and&hellip;to listen. <br/></p><p>For #InternationalJazzDay, get ready to cut a rug while we take you on a tour of some key killer diller locations that played an important role in jazz history, from swinging Central Avenue to swanky Old Hollywood.

Originally built as the Hotel Somerville, the Dunbar played a key role in L.A.’s Black community for decades. Doctor John Somerville built the hotel for the first West Coast convention of the NAACP in 1928 and it provided first-class accommodations for African Americans in a segregated Los Angeles. At the heart of the Central Avenue jazz scene, many prominent jazz musicians stayed or performed there, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Bessie Smith. Other notable guests included Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Hern Jefferies, Langston Hughes, Joe Louis, Arthur B. Spingarn, and W. E. B. Du Bois. As the epicenter of Black L.A.’s social and cultural life, a number of jazz clubs and theaters sprang up along Central Avenue and the district began to flourish as a popular nightlife destination.  <br/></p><p><a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/dunbar-hotel" target="_blank">After a herculean restoration</a>, today the Dunbar Hotel provides affordable housing for seniors and offers a beautiful gathering space for the community. (More recently, the Dunbar also made a cameo appearance in 2019’s <i>My Name is Dolemite</i>.)</p><figure data-orig-width="1590" data-orig-height="1260" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee877bb04e4b5700f38a11070418eeb5/c40f8ceb7118de95-9b/s540x810/24bb8da0c86ab8a8c22e523c0cd30a470fdff25c.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1590" data-orig-height="1260"/></figure><h2>Club Alabam </h2><p>4215 Central Avenue </p><p>Perhaps the most famous club along <a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/issues/central-avenue" target="_blank">Central Avenue</a> was Club Alabam, known as the “Finest Harlem Cafe in America.” Hints of the Ambassador Hotel’s Cocoanut Grove (which was segregated at the time) could be seen with its rich furnishings and interior palm trees. Saxophonist Art Pepper recalled that “the bandstand was plush and gorgeous with curtains that glistened.” Club Alabam, which had an integrated audience like all of the clubs along the corridor, became the center of L.A.’s jazz scene boasting some of the finest jazz artists in the country. At its most glorious, wrote jazz historian Steven Isoardi, it was kind of a shining star, the premier spot on the Avenue. </p><p>Club Alabam may have been the star, but its neighbors were also just as popular: the Downbeat at 4201 S Central Avenue was a major hot spot and, at one point, was home to an all-star jazz band that included L.A. native, the legendary Charles Mingus. Further along, the Elks Hall at 4016 S Central Avenue was said to have been the biggest Black-owned building in Los Angeles. Able to fit from five to six hundred people, it had three floors, which offered flexibility for a wide variety of acts and events.  </p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/536cda5eb3b2bc3dfd18d5a196edc0d9/c40f8ceb7118de95-89/s540x810/f5ce4ea7e6ddfd159060f560023106649a0ae772.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>The Lincoln Theatre </h2><p>2300 Central Avenue </p><p>Opened in 1927, <a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/lincoln-theatre" target="_blank">the Lincoln Theater</a> was the largest of five theaters along the Central Avenue corridor that provided entertainment to the Black community. While the 1920s boasted the era of the grand movie palaces on Broadway, African Americans were segregated if allowed at all. The Lincoln, built between 1926 and 1927, was the first theatre built by African Americans for African Americans and was easily the most important. A beautiful example of Moorish Revival Architecture, the California Eagle called it, “the finest and most beautiful theater in the country built exclusively for race patronage.” </p><p>The Lincoln was a key venue in jazz history, and its stage welcomed icons like Lionel Hampton and Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis Jr. and so many more.

Anderson hailed from Gilroy, but called Los Angeles home for much of her life and lived at 724 E. 52nd Place from 1930 to 1945. During this time Anderson toured heavily with Ellington’s band, whom she sang with for a decade. </p><p>(You can even watch her with Duke’s band in the classic Marx Brothers film <i>A Day at the Races</i>, where she performs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di-a-jf1c6g" target="_blank"><b>“All God&rsquo;s Chillun Got Rhythm.”</b></a>) Anderson’s former home is listed in both the national and state historic registers as a contributor to the 52nd Place Historic District, which is also an HPOZ.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a99269bd57f88df51bcb488ebe6da1fc/c40f8ceb7118de95-64/s540x810/5f999a05088cebcf4679055cbce4b0391cd1eff8.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>The Tiffany Club </h2><p>3260 West 8th Street, Los Angeles</p><p>You’d never guess as you speed past the low-rise market at West 8th Street and Normandie Avenue that a litany of jazz greats once played there in the 1950s. Dave Brubeck, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Helen Forrest, Nat King Cole—the list goes on and on. <b>(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0SeNrs5LoIaI4hSu1coxk2?si=6a63817c6fbd4806" target="_blank">Chet Baker and Stan Getz’s set was recorded and definitely worth a listen</a>.)</b>   <br/></p><p>In 1952, the great Louis Armstrong headlined the club with an all-star band that included Earl “Fatha” Hines and Jack Teagarden. It was an integrated audience, as you can see in this famous photo taken in 1954 of Ella Fitzgerald and Marilyn Monroe at the Tiffany. Monroe was a huge fan of Fitzgerald and the two women became friends. Monroe actively promoted Ella by attending her performances, which guaranteed press coverage.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/76ce52bf4a571461d43adb7ae8c19392/c40f8ceb7118de95-b2/s540x810/1055ed2ce2625a3aa22b6f3ba183f00c7f37e5c2.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>Thomas Jefferson High School </h2><p>1319 E 41st Street, Los Angeles</p><p>Not all jazz greats hailed from the East Coast. Many were born right here in Los Angeles. Most notable, Charles Mingus and Buddy Collette, who both attended Jordan High School in Watts. (Mingus, in fact, grew up steps from the Watts Towers and often saw Simon Rodia as he worked on building his menagerie of glass and scraps.) But it is <a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/thomas-jefferson-high-school" target="_blank">Thomas Jefferson High Schoo</a>l in South Los Angeles that nurtured the talent for the largest number of future jazz artists. </p><p>Dexter Gordon and Don Cherry are perhaps its most famous graduates, but for many the real star was teacher Samuel R. Browne: the first Black music teacher in the Los Angeles public school system. After receiving advanced degrees from USC in music and education, he eventually took a job at Jefferson High School where, in 1936, he became the first Black teacher to integrate the school. He often accompanied his students to Central Avenue jazz clubs and, as part of their music education, took them to rehearsals where at any given time they’d see Lionel Hampton, Stan Kenton, or Duke Ellington at work. He’d also bring talent to the classroom—stars like Nat “King” Cole and Jimmie Lunceford—for recitals and master class seminars.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/da74f4513aba14581dd28313413e86cf/c40f8ceb7118de95-d4/s540x810/26bff37d22ee013bb2d0e335fecd8108eea55ba1.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>The Hollywood Bowl </h2><p>2301 N Highland Ave, Los Angeles</p><p>The enduring, much beloved L.A. icon has long been a friend to jazz musicians&hellip;even when the critics weren’t. (When Frank Sinatra made his Bowl debut in 1943 to sellout crowd of Bobby Soxers, the Times sneered about swing: “is it possible that there is no alternative in this country?”) In 1954, Louis Armstrong performed &ldquo;The Whippenproof Song&rdquo; on The Colgate Comedy Hour which became the first ever live telecast from the Bowl. Two years later, the Bowl hosted the jazz event of the decade: an all-star concert Jazz at the Hollywood Bowl. With <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3f5UQ9wDDRfWGmv8oV4t8S?si=b3d8b2a42d464565" target="_blank"><b>Louis Armstrong</b></a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/45MTMQGVBmByrxZNBn3LSX?si=01211e0fbda24ff1" target="_blank"><b>Ella Fitzgerald </b></a>headlining, the concert was an extraordinary who’s-who of jazz greats, among them Oscar Peterson, Roy Eldridge, Buddy Rich, and Art Tatum. </p><p>It’s hardly surprising that the Playboy Jazz Festival has called the Bowl home since 1979, making it one of the longest-running jazz festivals around.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c922e991491a4506a6843778b69f378b/c40f8ceb7118de95-82/s540x810/a18dd288c56d0d80e676659da136b197b9cd2239.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>The It Club </h2><p>4731 W. Washington Boulevard </p><p>The It Club (which was across the street from today’s Nate Holden Performing Arts Center) was owned by John T. McClain, a man who would go on to become an executive and huge force in the L.A. as one of the most powerful figures in the world of Black music. McClain’s father rubbed shoulders with ganger “Bugsy” Siegel and his mother, an accomplished pianist, appeared with Lena Horne in Hollywood during the ‘40s. </p><p>During the 1950s and ‘60s, it was common to see huge jazz stars play the It Club. Miles Davis and John Coltrane were returning guests, and jazz legend Thelonious Monk recorded here in 1964, resulting in the album<b> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2hsCzq4h6gb0TWFVCXaUsD?si=bf70d19559fc45a0" target="_blank">“Live at the It Club.”</a>  </b></p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/49fcf9ce96b35524dff25843e0fcffc8/c40f8ceb7118de95-ae/s540x810/82a90aaf9394bb5fd912e8f438a5506d6529d2e4.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>The Parker Room and Billy Berg’s </h2><p>1358 Vine Street, Hollywood </p><p>The Parker Room, which recently closed, opened in 2017 to pay homage to its famous history. During its heyday in the 1940s, Billy Berg’s was one of the hottest jazz joints in L.A. and the country. Its claim to fame was being the site of Charlie Parker’s first West Coast engagement. (Hence the name “The Parker Room.”) In 1949, Billie Holiday threw an extravagant New Year&rsquo;s Party in the club. <br/></p><p>But Billy Berg’s is also emblematic of a change in the L.A. jazz scene. In postwar L.A., Black musicians were making inroads at previously all-white clubs and theaters in places like Hollywood and downtown L.A. Jewish impresario Billy Berg became a prominent player in running integrated jazz joints. As KCET reports, in “less than twenty-five years, Berg came to own at least six different clubs in the Los Angeles area: Trouville, The Swing Club, Waldorf&rsquo;s Cellar, Club Capri, The 5-4 Ballroom and the most famous, Billy Berg&rsquo;s.” </p><p>Integrated Hollywood clubs also signaled a change in the tide. The scene on Central Avenue began to fade as white audiences no longer needed to head south to Central Avenue. Likewise, the desegregation of some jazz clubs in L.A. opened up more opportunities for Black musicians outside of Central Avenue. </p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/28af34b2403c5bb582e17539df935fd0/c40f8ceb7118de95-f2/s540x810/2acaa88d2b682646f93ccfc12189e0610b8061e5.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>Nat “King” Cole Residence</h2><p>423 S. Muirfield Road, Hancock Park </p><p>Nat “King” Cole was among the many jazz musicians who “jumped ship” in L.A. while on tour, choosing the city as home. Despite being one of the most successful and popular entertainers of the 20th century, Cole and his family still faced racism. Discriminatory housing covenants enforced by homeowners’ associations across L.A. made his celebrity status irrelevant. In 1948, when Cole and his family purchased this $85,000 property, they were the first Black family to move into exclusively white Hancock Park. </p><p>The Cole’s were met with an affidavit by an angry group of white homeowners claiming that 50-year-old covenants restricted homeownership to non-Caucasians. After they refused to move, an ambitious plan to oust them was launched, including threats to his family and their real estate agent. But the law was against the homeowners’ association: that very year, the Supreme Court Decision of Shelley v. Kraemer had deemed restrictive covenants unconstitutional. </p><p>The Cole family would continue to endure intimidating acts of overt racism from the neighborhood over the years, but they loved their home and weathered the storms. Cole would live here until his untimely passing in 1965 and in 2003, Hancock Park —an HPOZ—dedicated the post office at 265 South Western Avenue in his honor.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/edbf930ece729bbe122ba0f34d4b0e96/c40f8ceb7118de95-93/s540x810/0bd0ff6dc5ae5d3be25c48e21b0af4911fa8809f.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>Capitol Records </h2><p>1750 Vine Street, Hollywood </p><p>And any tour of L.A. jazz history wouldn’t be complete without a stop at the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood. The Capitol Records label was home to such legends like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole, which is why the label&rsquo;s headquarters in Hollywood—a cherished Historic-Cultural Monument—proudly celebrates its connections to jazz history with its gorgeous mural “Hollywood Jazz — 1945-1972&quot; on the south wall of the tower. <br/></p><p>Created by legendary L.A.-based muralist Richard Wyatt, Jr. in 1990, the mural was commissioned at the request of the Los Angeles Jazz Society, and in 2013, it received a loving restoration from Capitol Records. An ode to titans of jazz music, the mural is also as beautiful as it is personal. “Nat King Cole’s widow [Maria] asked me if I would show him wearing his favorite tie,” Wyatt recalled in 2013. <br/><br/></p><h2><b><i>** BONUS ** </i></b></h2><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7d1cfbe7a1c7bc0d3c399adfc11fc6e3/c40f8ceb7118de95-09/s540x810/cdb575849273abc01ac0a72577eb9cea6b971ceb.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><h2>The Lighthouse Café </h2><p>30 Pier Avenue, Hermosa Beach </p><p><i>Because we probably wouldn’t hear the end of it otherwise &hellip;</i></p><p>The last stop on our trek through Jazz Land is Hermosa Beach’s Lighthouse Cafe which figures prominently in Damien Chazelle’s <i>La La Land</i> (2016). Like it or loathe it, the film <i>La La Land</i> certainly did much to trigger interest not simply in L.A. locations, but the L.A. jazz scene. To its credit, the jazz club at the center of the film is an actual historic jazz club. The Lighthouse Café in Hermosa Beach has been in business since 1949, when an experimental Sunday jam session turned into a success.

Mason became a midwife and parlayed her earnings into real\nestate, establishing a homestead on what is present-day Broadway and Spring Street in 1866.\nShe continued to invest in land and accumulated a relatively large fortune, carving for herself a\nprominent place in the community.\n&ldquo;Aunt Biddy,&rdquo; as she was lovingly known, founded the First AME Church in her home, opened\nschools, and was a constant source of support to the growing settlement of Black Angelenos. </p><p>The \nLos Angeles of Mason’s day is all but gone, but you can follow her legacy and remarkable\nachievements at Biddy Mason Memorial Park.

The red tile roof and blue and yellow tiled domes make the building a visible\nlandmark on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles. </p><p>Out in Santa Monica, the Annenberg Community Beach House occupies part of what was\nMorgan’s spectacular estate for actress Marion Davies. Commissioned by Davies’ life partner\nW.R. Hearst, Morgan designed an estate befitting the major movie star: it was a mansion of 100-\nplus rooms, featuring an ornate marble swimming pool. As was the case with Hearst Castle to\nthe north, the Marion Davies Beach was a popular and exclusive destination for Old Hollywood’s\nbiggest stars. </p><p>The main mansion was demolished in 1956, but the Beach House thrives today as\na year-round public beach facility. </p><p><b>***</b></p><h2><b>Norma Merrik Sklarek (1926 - 2012): Architect </b></h2><figure data-orig-width="2240" data-orig-height="1260" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/cadae9f314db35d79dfff448e724563c/f302a3c884ee5510-27/s540x810/f6cff6592d84c5c87492e4f0e70e8e62f77a27b4.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="2240" data-orig-height="1260"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>The Pacific Design Center (1975). 📸: WikiCommons</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>Dubbed &ldquo;the Rosa Parks of architecture,&rdquo; Sklarek&rsquo;s courage, talent, and ambition led to a\ntrailblazing career that forged a place for herself in an industry dominated by men.

The papers touted it as an important addition to the Long Beach hospitality business.</p><figure data-orig-width="1960" data-orig-height="1312" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e63bb6c144a573e7738e50e5312d2e9c/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-95/s540x810/93ca1226d5a911fceb1eb7d26515050853108de3.png" data-orig-width="1960" data-orig-height="1312"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>The Edgewater Inn’s iconic Y-shaped supports.

Born in Gatun, Panama, Sealey immigrated to the United States in the 1920s, eventually settling in Los Angeles. While studying architecture at USC in 1939, he went to work for Paul R. Williams. Sealey left Williams’ practice in 1945 to open his own office where he specialized in Mid-Century Modern and Googie style buildings.  </p><p>Success came quickly for him. By August 1950, Sealey was profiled by Ebony magazine in an article called “Architect for the Wealthy.”  His notable projects included the East L.A. Department of Social Services (1967) and the expansion of the County USC Medical Center of 1968 - 76.<br/></p><p>And while he mainly worked in Los Angeles, his one project in Long Beach, the Seaport Marina/Edgewater, would be his most famous. Sadly, in later decades the Seaport Marina fell into disrepair. After years of threatened demolition, Sealey&rsquo;s historic hotel was finally destroyed in 2017.  </p><figure data-orig-width="1182" data-orig-height="840" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c903f5bd9ddea37b5475e5ab84b39739/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-f2/s540x810/632d34af615dc7a2fe64d782caee1c4d3b1bc5f4.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1182" data-orig-height="840"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>The Cockatoo Hotel (1958).

But after falling into disarray over the decades, it was sold to developers and demolished in 2004.

Vaughn (1917 - 2000)</a></b> was an award-winning Black architect and proponent of the postwar Garden City Movement and Modernist architecture. Vaughn helped to bring about the Mid-Century image for which Southern California would become known during a time that offered few opportunities to Black architects. </p><p>Vaughn received his bachelor of science in architecture from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1932 and briefly worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Resettlement Administration as a draftsman. In 1935, Howard University hired Vaughn to teach architectural drawing which led to an offer from Paul R. Williams to join his firm in L.A. as an “efficiency expert.”</p><p>Vaughn worked with Williams on such local landmarks including the Saks Fifth Avenue building and the grand MCA Headquarters in Beverly Hills, not to mention celebrity homes for the likes of Tyrone Power and Bill “Bojangles” Robinson.  </p><p>Vaughn also worked as a set designer on a number of feature films, working with legendary MGM art director Cedric Gibbons. <a href="http://lacitywatchdog.org/id13.html" target="_blank">It was during his time at MGM</a> that he met architect and fellow set designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth_Wharton" target="_blank"><b>Heth Wharton</b></a>.  The two became friends, and in the late 1940s they formed the agency, Wharton and Vaughn Associates. </p><figure data-orig-width="1278" data-orig-height="968" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a9ec6c8dfeed5bf7853877d9e7af67f3/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-87/s540x810/31fb8902cb0242221a2b300893e47f56584902c0.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1278" data-orig-height="968"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>Chase Knolls Garden Apartments (1948). <i>Located at </i>13401 Riverside Drive, Sherman Oaks.

(After a heated preservation battle spanning more than a decade, Lincoln Place thrives today with a mix of historic and new buildings.)</p><p>He was also an in-demand architect for local restaurants and bars that required his film industry-era expertise in mood and tone. He created the Mardi Gras Room in the Park Wilshire Hotel, Melody Cocktail Bar, Hi-Hat Club, Oyster House Restaurant, and other famous places. In total, Vaughn contributed forty-seven Mid-Century Modern structures to the Los Angeles landscape throughout his decades-long career.</p><p>                                  ——————————————— <br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>PAUL REVERE WILLIAMS</b></h2><figure data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="720" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8fb30b9ce5a7c6cdb5ce6147d19f6ca4/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-0e/s540x810/067b91d6e8b08aff6d8aad6c1cb6d314a5848969.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="720"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>The Beverly Hills Hotel (1912), 9641 Sunset Boulevard, Beverly Hills.

A native Angeleno, his barrier-breaking career spanned almost six decades. As the first Black member of the AIA, he designed more than 3,000 structures and mastered a range of architectural styles. He broke racial barriers, prevailing over racism to attend USC’s School of Engineering. </p><p>After working for a number of important L.A.-based architects, he began his own practice in 1923 and would go on to design everything from glamorous Hollywood estates to affordable homes, public housing, and a host of civic, commercial, and institutional buildings. Regardless of style or use, his work shared the common threads of elegant composition and perfect proportion. </p><p>Aptly nicknamed the “architect to the stars,” Williams’ navigated a multitude of architectural styles to fit the whims of a wealthy, glittery clientele. Whether it was Hollywood Regency (the Jay Paley house), Traditional (the Marlon Brando residence) Mid-Century Modern (the Frank Sinatra house), Georgia Revival (the Tyrone Power house), or French Normandy (Barbara Stanwyck’s estate), Williams deftly guided his clients through the process with the aid of a strong in-house design team, headed by his daughter Norma.</p><figure data-orig-width="970" data-orig-height="700" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/97fa4d5ee48abc342863148cf395f817/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-a6/s540x810/c31ef64d23313f554d6837fa10706f74d02e9e98.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="970" data-orig-height="700"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>The Frank Sinatra Residence (1956).

One such example is Seaview: a Mid-Century Modern tract community that Williams designed in 1960. Made to appeal to the breezy suburban lifestyle so popular in the early ‘60s, Williams’ homes were bursts of colorful greens, pinks, and blues, and the richly detailed interiors offered some 41 unique styles: from space-age light fixtures to stone fireplaces. True to the times, the Seaview HOA initially refused to allow Black residents even though the community’s architect was one of the most sought-after in the country.</p><figure data-orig-width="1772" data-orig-height="958" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/39db9c94e50fce25e59f075274c82b40/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-bd/s540x810/3717d7866dbf6770f0b70aa437a5fe517295e61f.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1772" data-orig-height="958"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>Seaview Housing Tract (1960), located in Rancho Palos Verdes Estates.

Michael J. Garris—a prominent L.A.-based electrical engineer—had worked with Williams on multiple projects over the years, during which the two colleagues became good friends. After purchasing an ambitious plot of land in much sought-after Trousdale, Garris commissioned Williams to build what would be his family home.</p><p>The result was a Mid-Century beauty reminiscent of some of Williams&rsquo; celebrity homes. The home remained in the Garris family for 50 years and stayed faithful to Williams&rsquo; original design, making it a living time capsule. </p><figure data-orig-width="1112" data-orig-height="896" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a98eba1f0134e2404aba0bc874f31a82/7a6a94ac4d9271e8-95/s540x810/6a6c58a529f6bac40be942bf49e571da02401fb6.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1112" data-orig-height="896"/></figure><p><i>The Garris Residence (1958).

The 1902 Barlow Sanatorium and Respiratory Hospital, for instance, provided patients with TB a slow recovery treatment centered on the clean, dry air of the West. Tucked in the Elysian Park neighborhood of Echo Park, Barlow continues today in its original location and historic bungalows, which are listed as an L.A.

Ten years later, the County opened a Poor Farm—later renamed Rancho Los Amigos.\n</p><p>\nThe poor farm system was based on the simple idea to offer people experiencing destitution access to work, housing, and medical care. Throughout the U.S. various state and county administrations assumed this role and responsibility, especially prior to the establishment of the Social Security safeguard.\n</p><p>\nWhile some are unfamiliar with poor farms, there are many others for whom ‘ending up on the poor farm’ has negative connotations. One reason is that poor farms shared the County’s responsibility for treating patients with psychiatric diagnoses, something they were ill-equipped to handle. Poor farms established themselves as early examples of sustainable, self-sufficient living, with residents—then referred to “inmates”—providing the labor to run the agricultural operations, raising livestock and growing food. In many ways, poor farms were early forms of the American welfare system.</p><p>\nWith its initial 124.4 acres of rural farmland, Rancho operated as a classic poor farm. As its medical operations and the number of people served grew, its agricultural roots and farming operation decreased. The farm became more of a convalescent hospital than a traditional county poor farm. In the early 1930s, the Poor Farm officially changed its name to Rancho Los Amigos (“ranch of the friends”).\n</p><figure data-orig-width="5248" data-orig-height="2952" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4a7a79873a48ee36c5cd8589fccc8e18/5f7c18cf037e3753-6b/s540x810/9f3e319004c41dc540c9351d728a89db540de7c7.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="5248" data-orig-height="2952"/></figure><p><b>\nContagious outbreaks, now and then </b></p><p>By the late 1940s and early ‘50s, the U.S. was experiencing a surge in polio outbreaks, including L.A. County. Like COVID-19, there was no known vaccine at the time for the infectious disease. Polio was also referred to as the “invisible enemy” with the virus spreading through person-to-person contact. Social distancing was employed, as were travel and commerce restrictions in hot zones. \n</p><p>\nThe difference between now and then is polio primarily affected the young, children who could catch the virus and ultimately experience death or paralysis and a lifetime of crutches, wheelchair, or being placed in an iron lung (respirator allowing them to breath). During the summer season polio flared up with swimming and wading pools feared especially as transmitters for the virus. Concerned parents pressed on civic leaders to drain or fill in the pools. Today you can still find remnants of this remedy. \n</p><p>\nTo address the growing epidemic Rancho adapted its focus in the mid-1940s and operation as a polio respiratory center, expanding to a northern campus and eventually becoming one of the leading post-polio respiratory centers in the world. By 1955 polio was finally addressed through a vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. Rancho would then slowly transform itself into a respected rehabilitation center.\n</p><p>\nThroughout its history, Rancho Los Amigos ebbed and flowed in terms of its operation, with a constant theme of overcrowding, expansion periods with new facilities, and evolving its focus and mission. It would grow to well over 500 acres in size and serve nearly 3,000 patients at its peak. By the late ‘40s, it was primarily operating as a hospital with minimal agricultural operations, prompting the selling off of the property. \n</p><figure data-orig-width="4472" data-orig-height="2752" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/3973e844d4f921ccc49fa5a9b746f710/5f7c18cf037e3753-32/s540x810/67e1bb06fe81a6653c7aaa73f383be34c63a8f5f.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4472" data-orig-height="2752"/></figure><p><b>\nPlanned demolition of a historic district </b></p><p> By the early 1990s Rancho’s south campus was whittled down to 74 acres and effectively abandoned with most of its 100+ buildings vacant. For well over a decade, the Conservancy has been working closely with various County representatives in regards to Rancho and its future, with numerous reuse and redevelopment proposals coming and going. During this time Rancho has been listed on the California Register and determined eligible as a national historic district.\n </p><p>\nWithout adequate security and maintenance Rancho has been allowed to deteriorate and buildings fall into accelerated disrepair. In recent years, contributing buildings within the historic district have been destroyed due to neglect, vandalism, and a recent spate of numerous arson fires.\n</p><p>\nThe current deteriorated conditions and neglect which have occurred under the County’s stewardship are now cited by the County as a health and safety concern and justification for the proposed demolition of the historic district. Despite not planning to redevelop the entire site or impact all the remaining historic buildings, the County is planning to virtually demolish it all. \n </p><figure data-orig-width="1553" data-orig-height="956" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/eb48cdee321413a4649058ce17eed9e3/5f7c18cf037e3753-a0/s540x810/0e9fb7c3574cabb50415535a5c83419b41e40c03.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1553" data-orig-height="956"/></figure><p>\nUnder a new proposal by the County, the historic district would be lost; 105 structures and resources, including 61 historic buildings. Even buildings not impacted by the proposed project are planned to be removed with no meaningful alternatives, a failure by the County to adhere to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Overall, the project would retain just five contributors to the current historic district: the 1926 Administration Staff building;1930 Casa Consuelo patient; 1913 water tower; 1909-26 Power Plant building; and a Moreton Bay fig tree.\n\n</p><p>We strongly believe there is a “win-win” scenario available to the County where both preservation and new construction is possible. The opportunity exists to modify the County’s plans by pairing new construction with adaptive reuse, and a potential public-private partnership. </p><p>Our job in preservation is to unpack and better understand our public health care past, and show how places like Rancho help make this story real and, if lost, so much more difficult to understand. If we do not stand up for the places and people that represent our public health care past and show us how we got here, we stand the risk of forgetting where we have been and how far we have come. </p><p>Rancho Los Amigos and all it represents to our public health care past and present is deserving of a better fate than demolition.<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/issues/rancho-los-amigos" target="_blank"> <b>Help us convince the County that we can do better. </b></a></p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2020-06-18 02:33:16','L.A.

They’ve found their way into our academic discussions, created questions on our homework assignments, and routinely make appearances in the fine print at the bottom of course syllabi.

As we all look back on Rotation, I imagine there are common themes and experiences we all can identify with. For many, if not all, of the returning students this was our first exposure to a “covid-free” Rotation, and this came with certain obligations to do the years of tradition and culture justice. As an Interhouse Committee, one of our primary concerns was to ensure that we did just so, but it can be difficult to recreate something for someone else that you’ve never experienced yourself. This struggle was amplified by a desire and impetus to make Rotation an inclusive and socially responsible event. Thus, many of us felt the stretching of mental gymnastics necessary to reconcile tradition with responsibility. I am incredibly proud of the ways in which student leaders across campus navigated these difficulties; you were empathetic and receptive to the changes that were being asked of you while advocating for the traditions that define the Caltech undergraduate community.',NULL,'','2023-10-31 00:00:00','California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)','',NULL,'2023-11-27 16:56:45','read');
