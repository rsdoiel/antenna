B Streptococcus vaginal colonisation throughout pregnancy is associated
with decreased Lactobacillus crispatus and increased Lactobacillus iners
abundance in the vaginal microbial community</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) asymptomatically colonises the vagina of
up to 40% of pregnant women and can transmit to neonates during birth,
causing neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, and significant
mortality. Vaginal GBS colonisation can be attributed to a range of host
and bacterial factors, which may include the composition of the vaginal
microbial community. There are few studies that have examined the
vaginal community composition in relation to GBS colonisation throughout
pregnancy. Here, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4) on vaginal
swabs from women at 24- and 36-weeks’ gestation, who were GBS
culture-negative or GBS culture-positive at either 24 weeks or 36 weeks’
gestation or at both timepoints. Vaginal swabs from 93 women were
analysed; 46 women were culture-negative, 11 women GBS culture-positive
at 24 weeks only, 21 women GBS culture-positive at 36 weeks only and 15
women GBS culture-positive at both timepoints on Brilliance GBS agar.
V3-V4 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing demonstrated that in women that
were GBS culture-positive at 36 weeks gestation only, G. vaginalis was
significantly more abundant at 24-weeks’ gestation despite a lack of
significant changes in community richness between the 24- and 36-week
samples. The vaginal microbial communities of women persistently
colonised with GBS, had a significantly higher abundance of
Lactobacillus iners, compared to other groups where L. crispatus, L.
gasseri or L. jensenii were dominant. We have characterised the vaginal
microbial community composition during pregnancy in relation to GBS
colonisation status, in a longitudinal study for the first time. The
most interesting finding was that in women that were persistently
colonised with GBS throughout pregnancy, there was a significant
increase in L. iners and significant reduction in L. crispatus
abundance. Given the lack of detail of the role that the vaginal
microbial community plays in GBS colonisation in the literature, it is
imperative that the relationship between L. iners and GBS in this unique
environmental niche is further investigated.</p>

id="risk-factors-and-predictive-model-for-nosocomial-infections-by-extensively-drug-resistant-acinetobacter-baumannii">Risk
factors and predictive model for nosocomial infections by extensively
drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundExtensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB)
has become a significant pathogen in hospital environments, particularly
in intensive care units (ICUs). XDRAB’s resistance to conventional
antimicrobial treatments and ability to survive on various surfaces pose
a substantial threat to patient health, often resulting in severe
infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream
infections (BSI).MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed clinical data from
559 patients with XDRAB infections admitted to Jinhua Central Hospital
between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients were randomly divided
into a training set (391 cases) and a testing set (168 cases). Variables
were selected using Lasso regression and logistic regression analysis,
and a predictive model was constructed and validated internally and
externally. Model performance and clinical utility were evaluated using
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, C-index, ROC curve, decision curve analysis
(DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC).ResultsLasso regression analysis
was used to screen 35 variables, selecting features through 10-fold
cross-validation. We chose lambda.1se=0.03450 (log(lambda.1se)=-3.367),
including 10 non-zero coefficient features. These features were then
included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, identifying 8
independent risk factors for XDRAB infection: ICU stay of 1-7 days
(OR=3.970, 95%CI=1.586-9.937), ICU stay &gt;7 days (OR=12.316,
95%CI=5.661-26.793), hypoproteinemia (OR=3.249, 95%CI=1.679-6.291),
glucocorticoid use (OR=2.371, 95%CI=1.231-4.564), urinary
catheterization (OR=2.148, 95%CI=1.120-4.120), mechanical ventilation
(OR=2.737, 95%CI=1.367-5.482), diabetes mellitus (OR=2.435,
95%CI=1.050-5.646), carbapenem use (OR=6.649, 95%CI=2.321-19.048), and
β-lactamase inhibitor use (OR=4.146, 95%CI=2.145-8.014). These 8 factors
were used to construct a predictive model visualized through a nomogram.
The model validation showed a C-index of 0.932 for the training set and
0.929 for the testing set, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-value of 0.47,
indicating good calibration. Furthermore, the DCA curve demonstrated
good clinical decision-making performance, and the CIC curve confirmed
the model’s reliable clinical impact.ConclusionRegression analysis
identified ICU stay duration, hypoproteinemia, glucocorticoid use,
urinary catheterization, mechanical ventilation, diabetes mellitus,
carbapenem use, and β-lactamase inhibitor use as independent risk
factors for XDRAB infection. The corresponding predictive model
demonstrated high accuracy and stability.</p>

id="toxoplasma-induced-behavior-changes---is-microbial-dysbiosis-the-missing-link">Toxoplasma-induced
behavior changes - is microbial dysbiosis the missing link?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is one of the most successful
intracellular protozoa in that it can infect the majority of mammalian
cell types during the acute phase of infection. Furthermore, it is able
to establish a chronic infection for the host’s entire lifespan by
developing an encysted parasite form, primarily in the muscles and brain
of the host, to avoid the host immune system. The infection affects one
third of the world population and poses an increased risk for people
with a suppressed immune system. Despite the dormant characteristics of
chronic T. gondii infection, there is much evidence suggesting that this
infection leads to specific behavior changes in both humans and rodents.
Although numerous hypotheses have been put forth, the exact mechanisms
underlying these behavior changes have yet to be understood. In recent
years, several studies revealed a strong connection between the gut
microbiome and the different organ systems that are affected in T.
gondii infection. While it is widely studied and accepted that acute T.
gondii infection can lead to a dramatic disruption of the host’s normal,
well-balanced microbial ecosystem (microbial dysbiosis), changes in the
gut microbiome during the chronic stage of infection has not been well
characterized. This review is intended to briefly inspect the different
hypotheses that attempt to explain the behavior changes during T. gondii
infection. Furthermore, this review proposes to consider the potential
link between gut microbial dysbiosis, and behavior changes in T. gondii
infection as a novel way to describe the underlying mechanism.</p>

of natural products on host cell autophagy induced by Influenza A virus
infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) can cause seasonal epidemics and global
pandemics, posing serious threats to public health, making a deeper
understanding of its biological characteristics and effective
countermeasure strategies essential. Autophagy not only maintains
cellular homeostasis but also plays an important role in host defense
against IAV infection. However, the relationship between IAV and
autophagy is complex, and effective antiviral drugs are not yet
available. Natural products have shown excellent potential in disease
control due to their diversity and multi-targeting. This review focuses
on the relationship between IAV and autophagy and discusses the
potential of targeting autophagic pathways for the development of new
antiviral therapies. Particularly, the use of plant extracts as
autophagy modulators has garnered attention due to their non-toxic
nature and cost-effectiveness, which provides strong support for the
development of future antiviral drugs that can help to inhibit viral
infections and slow down disease progression.</p>

regulation of dengue virus transmission and replication: insights into
vector activity and viral dynamics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Dengue fever, caused by dengue virus, poses a significant global
health challenge, particularly in tropical regions where Aedes aegypti
serves as the primary vector. The circadian clock in Aedes aegypti
governs key behavioral and physiological processes, including activity
patterns, feeding behaviors, and susceptibility to dengue virus
infection. This article explores the influence of circadian rhythms on
the mosquito’s ability to transmit dengue virus, emphasizing how the
circadian regulation of gene expression, immune responses, and lipid
metabolism in the mosquito vector creates temporal windows that affect
viral replication efficiency.</p>

microbiota transplantation in a patient with chronic diarrhea and
primary and secondary immunodeficiency (common variable immunodeficiency
and splenectomy)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The gut microbiota serves a crucial role in the development of host
immunity. Immunocompromised patients are particularly vulnerable to
dysbiosis not only by virtue of a defect in the immune system but also
due to increased susceptibility to infection and multiple courses of
antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation is by far the most
effective option for restoring gastrointestinal homeostasis. However, it
is contraindicated in patients with significant primary and secondary
immunodeficiencies. This article presents the case of a 59-year-old
patient with common variable immunodeficiency, after splenectomy at age
39 for primary immune thrombocytopenia, who manifested diarrhea of up to
10 stools per day accompanied by secondary malnutrition and cachexia.
The patient was admitted to the hospital on multiple occasions due to
this condition, with stool PCR tests confirming a HHV-5
(Cytomegalovirus, CMV) infection. Following the administration of
valganciclovir, the patient’s complaints diminished, although, upon
cessation of the drug, the symptoms recurred. In addition, the patient
had an intestinal infection with C. difficile etiology. Given that the
patient’s therapeutic options had been exhausted, after obtaining
informed consent from the patient and approval from the bioethics
committee to conduct a medical experiment, treatment of diarrhea was
undertaken by fecal microbiota transplantation with the certified
preparation Mbiotix HBI from the Human Biome Institute. The patient
underwent two transplants, with a one-week interval between them. The
initial procedure was performed using the endoscopic method, while the
subsequent was conducted using the capsule method. Following the
administration of the applied treatment, the patient’s symptoms were
successfully alleviated, and no adverse effects were observed. A
microbiological analysis of the intestinal microbiota was conducted
prior to and following transplantation via next-generation sequencing
(NGS). No recurrence of symptoms was observed during the two-year
follow-up period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fecal
microbiota transplantation in an adult patient with primary and
secondary immunodeficiency.</p>
