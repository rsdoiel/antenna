id="fungi-kcr-a-language-model-for-predicting-lysine-crotonylation-in-pathogenic-fungal-proteins">Fungi-Kcr:
a language model for predicting lysine crotonylation in pathogenic
fungal proteins</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLysine crotonylation (Kcr) is an important
post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins, playing a key role in
regulating various biological processes in pathogenic fungi. However,
the experimental identification of Kcr sites remains challenging due to
the high cost and time-consuming nature of mass spectrometry-based
techniques.MethodsTo address this limitation, we developed Fungi-Kcr, a
deep learning-based model designed to predict Kcr modification sites in
fungal proteins. The model integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), and word embedding to effectively
capture both local and long-range sequence
dependencies.ResultsComprehensive evaluations, including ten-fold
cross-validation and independent testing, demonstrate that Fungi-Kcr
achieves superior predictive performance compared to conventional
machine learning models. Moreover, our results indicate that a general
predictive model performs better than species-specific models.
DiscussionThe proposed model provides a valuable computational tool for
the large-scale identification of Kcr sites, contributing to a deeper
understanding of fungal pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

id="schmallenberg-virus-epidemiology-and-regional-control-strategies-diagnostics-vaccines-and-vector-management">Schmallenberg
virus epidemiology and regional control strategies: diagnostics,
vaccines, and vector management</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an emerging orthobunyavirus transmitted
by Culicoides midges. It poses a serious global health threat to
ruminants, especially during pregnancy, causing abortion, stillbirths,
and congenital malformations. Since its first outbreak in 2011, SBV has
spread across Europe and other regions. Its transmission has expanded
due to global climate change and increased animal trade, resulting in
recurrent outbreaks in endemic regions and a growing risk of
introduction into non-endemic areas. This situation highlights the
urgent need for improved control strategies. This review summarizes the
pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics of SBV and provides an
overview of recent advancements in diagnostic approaches, vaccine
development, and vector control. Diagnostic approaches, such as
serological assays and nucleic acid-based tests, have become the primary
tools for SBV detection. However, their applicability in clinical
settings still requires further optimization. In terms of vaccine
development, existing inactivated vaccines have limitations, including
the inability to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals.
This has driven the development of next-generation vaccines, such as
recombinant protein, viral vector, and mRNA-based platforms. For vector
control, integrated approaches combining chemical, ecological, and
biological strategies have been proposed to interrupt the transmission
of the virus by Culicoides midges. Additionally, this review emphasizes
the necessity of region-specific control strategies tailored to the
differing epidemiological contexts. In endemic regions, comprehensive
measures, including pathogen surveillance, vaccination programs, and
Culicoides control, are critical. In non-endemic regions, the focus
should be on enhancing border biosecurity, monitoring international
trade, and establishing early warning systems. These strategies not only
provide a scientific foundation for SBV control but also offer practical
guidance for managing the spread of similar vector-borne viruses
globally.</p>

clinical, and molecular analysis of human adenovirus infections in
hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Tianjin,
China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHuman Adenovirus (HAdV) is a significant pathogen for acute
respiratory infections(ARIs) in children. However, its epidemiological
patterns, serotype distribution changes, and molecular mechanisms
associated with severe pneumonia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic
require further elucidation through large-scale and molecular typing
studies.MethodsThis study used a retrospective cohort design to analyze
28060 respiratory specimens from Tianjin Children’s Hospital from March
2022 to March 2024. HAdV detection and typing were performed through
targeted high-throughput sequencing and PCR-based amplification of
Penton, Hexon, and Fiber genes for phylogenetic analysis. Additionally,
clinical data were compared to assess differences in clinical
presentations among pediatric patients infected with different HAdV
types.ResultsThe overall HAdV detection rate was 8.9% (2,484/28,060),
with significant male predominance (9.2% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.019) and
age-specific susceptibility peaking in school-aged children (10.4%, P
&lt; 0.001). Seasonal patterns demonstrated winter predominance (15.9%),
contrasting with other seasons (P &lt; 0.001). Genotyping of 1,914
positive specimens demonstrated HAdV-3 dominance (53.4%, 1,022),
followed by HAdV-7 (17.7%, 338), HAdV-2 (8.4%, 160), HAdV-1 (7.9%, 152),
and HAdV-21 (6.4%, 122). The diagnosis mainly included pneumonia,
bronchitis, adenopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections
(URTIs). Genotype-clinical correlations showed distinct patterns: HAdV-3
(55.6%) and HAdV-7 (20.9%) predominated in pneumonia cases, with HAdV-7
linked to severe pneumonia (P&lt;0.001). HAdV-3 (40.6%) and HAdV-2
(16.7%) were more common in adenopharyngitis, while HAdV-3 and HAdV-21
were more common in bronchitis (51.2% and 11.1%) and URTIs (31.9% and
19.1%). Molecular characterization revealed structural conservation in
the Penton protein of HAdV-C and identified Hexon as the most
polymorphic region with 85 variable sites, indicating divergent
evolutionary pressures across viral domains.ConclusionHAdV-3, HAdV-7,
HAdV-2, and HAdV-1 were the predominant HAdV types in children
hospitalized with ARIs in Tianjin. Moreover, not only the
epidemiological characteristics of different HAdV types vary, but there
are also certain differences in the clinical symptoms and outcomes of
children infected with different types of HAdV. Therefore, it is
essential to differentiate HAdV types for epidemiological surveillance
and clinical management purposes.</p>

characterization of Phialophora submersa, a new black yeast isolated
from freshwater sediments in Spain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Phialophora submersa is a recently described black yeast species
(Chaetothyriales), isolated from freshwater sediments in Catalonia
(Spain). It is closely related to P. americana and P. verrucosa, two
opportunistic pathogens known to cause subcutaneous infections in humans
and animals. This study investigates the pathogenic potential of P.
submersa, its in vitro susceptibility to clinically relevant antifungal
agents, and its response to various cellular stressors. Using a murine
macrophage (J774A.1) infection model, we evaluated phagocytosis,
intracellular survival, cell damage, and the expression of six
immune-related genes (TNF-α, CCL20, RELA, TP53, NLRP3, IL-1β), in
comparison with P. americana and P. verrucosa. The results showed that
P. submersa induced higher phagocytosis rates in murine macrophages than
the P. verrucosa, although lower than P. americana. Cell damage,
intracellular survival, and expression of the immune-related genes were
higher after macrophage infection with P. verrucosa than with P.
submersa and P. americana, which exhibited comparable profiles. All
three species displayed similar antifungal susceptibility profiles,
being susceptible to most azoles (except fluconazole), terbinafine, and
echinocandins (with reduced efficacy against P. verrucosa), but showed
moderate resistance to flucytosine, amphotericin B, and olorofim. The
resistance of P. submersa to stress was strain-dependent, with only one
strain exhibiting notable resistance to multiple stressors. This
research provides new insights into the biology of P. submersa,
including its potential as a human pathogen, and the molecular factors
that could drive an infection process.</p>

id="antibacterial-antifungal-and-antibiofilm-activities-of-biogenic-zinc-nanoparticles-against-pathogenic-microorganisms">Antibacterial,
antifungal, and antibiofilm activities of biogenic zinc nanoparticles
against pathogenic microorganisms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe increasing resistance to antimicrobial drugs has
prompted global efforts to combat pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The
World Health Organization’s recent report underscores the urgent need
for innovative antimicrobial strategies to address infections caused by
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida
tropicalis. This study presents a comparative evaluation of the effects
of biogenically synthesized zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, highlighting their effectiveness against both planktonic and
sessile forms of these tested pathogens.MethodsThe antimicrobial effects
were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, broth
microdilution, and time-kill assays. Biofilm formation and eradication
were evaluated through crystal violet staining, resazurin assays, and
colony-forming unit quantification. Additionally, the oxidative and
nitrosative stress toxicity mechanisms triggered by ZnNPs, particularly
those related to cellular stress, were investigated.ResultsThe results
demonstrated that ZnNPs exhibit concentration-dependent inhibitory
effects on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. ZnNPs inhibit
biofilm formation by up to 50% in E. coli and yeast species, and up to
80% in S. aureus.DiscussionThese antibiofilm activities were attributed
to disruptions in cellular stress metabolism, primarily driven by
nitrosative stress through enhanced production of reactive nitrogen
intermediates. ZnNPs synthesized through green methods offer significant
advantages due to their biocompatibility and potential biomedical
applications. These findings advance our understanding of ZnNPs in
combating biofilm-associated infections, offering promising strategies
to address pathogenic bacteria and fungi, which pose a critical threat
to global health.</p>
