<h2 id="decoding-the-multifaceted-interventions-between-human-sirtuin-2-and-dynamic-hepatitis-b-viral-proteins-to-confirm-their-roles-in-hbv-replication">Decoding the multifaceted interventions between human sirtuin 2 and dynamic hepatitis B viral proteins to confirm their roles in HBV replication</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The human sirtuin 2 gene (<italic>SIRT2</italic>) encodes a full-length Sirt2 protein (i.e., the Sirt2 isoform 1), which primarily functions as a cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase, and which promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication itself, or HBV X (HBx) protein-mediated transcriptional transactivation, enhances Sirt2.1 expression; therefore, Sirt2.1 itself is capable of positively increasing HBV transcription and replication. Sirt2.1 is linked to liver fibrosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and, consequently, augments the risk of HCC. The Sirt2.1 protein enhances the HBV replication cycle by activating the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)/β-catenin pathway. It also activates the transcription of the viral enhancer I/HBx promoter (EnI/Xp) and enhancer II/HBc promoter (EnII/Cp) by targeting the transcription factor p53. The Sirt2 isoform 2 (Sirt2.2) is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and the N-terminus is shorter by 37 amino acids than that of Sirt2.1. Despite the truncation of the N-terminal region, Sirt2.2 is still capable of enhancing HBV replication and activating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. The Sirt2 isoform 5 (Sirt2.5) is primarily localized to the nucleus, it lacks a nuclear export signal (NES), and the catalytic domain (CD) is truncated. Upon HBV replication, expression of the Sirt2 isoforms is also enhanced, which further upregulates the HBV replication, and, therefore, supports the vicious cycle of viral replication and progression of the disease. Sirt2 diversely affects HBV replication such that its isoform 1 intensely augments HBV replication and isoform 2 (despite of the truncated N-terminal region) moderately enhances HBV replication. Isoform 5, on the other hand, tends to protect the cell (for smooth long-term continued viral replication) from HBV-induced extreme damage or death via a discrete set of regulatory mechanisms impeding viral mRNAs, the hepatitis B core/capsid protein (HBc), core particles, replicative intermediate (RI) DNAs, and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels, and, consequently, limiting HBV replication. In contrast to Sirt2.1 and Sirt 2.2, the Sirt2.5-mediated HBV replication is independent of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling cascade. Sirt2.5 is recruited more at cccDNA than the recruitment of Sirt2.1 onto the cccDNA. This recruitment causes the deposition of more histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), including SETDB1, SUV39H1, EZH2, and PR-Set7, along with the respective corresponding transcriptional repressive markers such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me1 onto the HBV cccDNA. In HBV-replicating cells, Sirt2.5 can also make complexes with PR-Set7 and SETDB1. In addition, Sirt2.5 has the ability to turn off transcription from cccDNA through epigenetic modification via either direct or indirect interaction with HKMTs.

<h2 id="spatial-profiling-of-the-placental-chorioamniotic-membranes-reveals-upregulation-of-immune-checkpoint-proteins-during-group-b-streptococcus-infection-in-a-nonhuman-primate-model">Spatial profiling of the placental chorioamniotic membranes reveals upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins during Group B Streptococcus infection in a nonhuman primate model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, which is often complicated by intrauterine infection and inflammation. We have established a nonhuman primate model of Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>) infection-associated preterm birth. Immune checkpoints are modulators of the immune response by activating or suppressing leukocyte function and are understudied in preterm birth. The objective of this study was to spatially profile changes in immune protein expression at the maternal-fetal interface during a GBS infection with a focus on immune checkpoints.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Twelve nonhuman primates (pigtail macaques, <italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>) received a choriodecidual inoculation of either: 1) 1-5 X 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of hyperhemolytic/hypervirulent GBS (GBSΔ<italic>covR</italic>, N=4); 2) an isogenic/nonpigmented strain (GBS Δ<italic>covR</italic>Δ<italic>cylE</italic>, N=4); or, 3) saline (N=4). A Cesarean section was performed at preterm labor or 3 days after GBS infection or 7 days after saline inoculation. Nanostring GeoMx® Digital Spatial Profiling technology was used to segment protein expression within the amnion, chorion, and maternal decidua at the inoculation site using an immuno-oncology panel targeting 56 immunoproteins enriched in stimulatory and inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins or their protein ligands. Statistical analysis included R studio, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson and Spearman tests.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Both inhibitory and stimulatory immune checkpoint proteins were significantly upregulated within the chorioamniotic membranes and decidua (VISTA, LAG3, PD-1, CD40, GITR), as well as their ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2, CD40L; all p&lt;0.05). Immunostaining for VISTA revealed positive (VISTA+) cells, predominantly in the chorion and decidua. There were strong correlations between VISTA and amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (all p&lt;0.05), as well as maternal placental histopathology scores (p&lt;0.05).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Differential regulation of multiple immune checkpoint proteins in the decidua at the site of a GBS infection indicates a major perturbation in immunologic homeostasis that could benefit the host by restricting immune-driven pathologies or the pathogen by limiting immune surveillance. Protein expression of VISTA, an inhibitory immune checkpoint, was upregulated in the chorion and decidua after GBS infection. Investigating the impact of innate immune cell expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints may reveal new insights into placental host-pathogen interactions at the maternal-fetal interface.

<h2 id="exploring-the-intestinal-ecosystem-from-gut-microbiota-to-associations-with-subtypes-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease">Exploring the intestinal ecosystem: from gut microbiota to associations with subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
Significant differences have been discovered between subtypes of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The role of gut microbiota in promoting the onset of UC and CD is established, but conclusions regarding subtype-specific analyses remain limited.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study aims to explore the influence of gut microbiota on subtypes of UC and CD, offering novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of UC and CD.Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to examine the causal relationship between subtypes of UC and CD and gut microbiota composition. Gut microbiota data were sourced from the International Consortium MiBioGen, while UC and CD data were obtained from FINNGEN. Eligible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables. Multiple analytical approaches such as inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-RAPS were utilized. Sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran’s Q test, and leave-one-out analysis were conducted for quality control. Subsequently, we employed multivariable IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median, and LASSO regression methods to identify independently significant genera or families and conducted sensitivity analyses.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We have determined that <italic>Hungatella</italic>, <italic>Acidaminococcaceae</italic>, and 15 other microbial taxa act as protective factors for various CD and UC subtypes, while <italic>Terrisporobacter</italic>, <italic>Anaerostipes</italic>, and 23 other microbial taxa are associated with increased risk for different CD and UC subtypes. Furthermore, through multivariable MR analysis, we have identified significant genera or families with independent effects.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study confirms a causal relationship between dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the occurrence of CD and UC subtypes. Furthermore, it validates etiological distinctions among different subtypes of CD and UC. A novel approach to adjunctive therapy involving distinct UC or CD subtypes may involve the use of probiotics and represents a potential avenue for future treatments.

<h2 id="a-peroxidase-derived-ligand-that-induces-fusarium-graminearum-ste2-receptor-dependent-chemotropism">A peroxidase-derived ligand that induces Fusarium graminearum Ste2 receptor-dependent chemotropism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The fungal G protein-coupled receptors Ste2 and Ste3 are vital in mediating directional hyphal growth of the agricultural pathogen <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> towards wheat plants. This chemotropism is induced by a catalytic product of peroxidases secreted by the wheat. Currently, the identity of this product, and the substrate it is generated from, are not known.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods and results
</title>
<p>
We provide evidence that a peroxidase substrate is derived from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia and report a simple method to extract and purify the <italic>Fg</italic>Ste2-activating ligand for analyses by mass spectrometry. The mass spectra arising from t he ligand extract are characteristic of a 400 Da carbohydrate moiety. Consistent with this type of molecule, glycosidase treatment of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia prior to peroxidase treatment significantly reduced the amount of ligand extracted. Interestingly, availability of the peroxidase substrate appears to depend on the presence of both <italic>Fg</italic>Ste2 and <italic>Fg</italic>Ste3, as knockout of one or the other reduces the chemotropism-inducing effect of the extracts.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
While further characterization is necessary, identification of the <italic>F. graminearum</italic>-derived peroxidase substrate and the <italic>Fg</italic>Ste2-activating ligand will unearth deeper insights into the intricate mechanisms that underlie fungal pathogenesis in cereal crops, unveiling novel avenues for inhibitory interventions.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori, Hp) affects billions of people worldwide. However, the emerging resistance of Hp to antibiotics challenges the effectiveness of current treatments. Investigating the genotype-phenotype connection for Hp using next-generation sequencing could enhance our understanding of this resistance.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, we analyzed 52 Hp strains collected from various hospitals. The susceptibility of these strains to five antibiotics was assessed using the agar dilution assay. Whole-genome sequencing was then performed to screen the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genotypes of these Hp strains. To model the relationship between drug resistance and genotype, we employed univariate statistical tests, unsupervised machine learning, and supervised machine learning techniques, including the development of support vector machine models.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our models for predicting Amoxicillin resistance demonstrated 66% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while those for Clarithromycin resistance showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results outperformed the known resistance sites for Amoxicillin (A1834G) and Clarithromycin (A2147), which had sensitivities of 22.2% and 87%, and specificities of 100% and 96%, respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Our study demonstrates that predictive modeling using supervised learning algorithms with feature selection can yield diagnostic models with higher predictive power compared to models relying on single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites. This approach significantly contributes to enhancing the precision and effectiveness of antibiotic treatment strategies for Hp infections. The application of whole-genome sequencing for Hp presents a promising pathway for advancing personalized medicine in this context.

<h2 id="mendelian-randomization-analysis-to-investigate-the-gut-microbiome-in-oral-and-oropharyngeal-cancer">Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the gut microbiome in oral and oropharyngeal cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Evidence supports an observational association between the gut microbiome and susceptibility to extraintestinal cancers, but the causal relationship of this association remains unclear.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
To identify the specific causal gut microbiota of oral and oropharyngeal cancer, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of gut microbiota on oral and oropharyngeal cancer using a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted model. Gut microbiota across five different taxonomical levels from the MiBioGen genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as exposures. Oral cancer, oropharyngeal cancer and a combination of the two cancers defined from three separate data sources were used as the outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for disease per standard deviation (SD) higher abundance of microbiome.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results &amp; Conclusions
</title>
<p>
There was little evidence for a causal effect of gut microbiota on oral and oropharyngeal cancer when using a genome-wide p-value threshold for selecting instruments. Secondary analyses using a more lenient p-value threshold indicated that there were 90 causal relationships between 58 different microbial features but that sensitivity analyses suggested that these were possibly affected by violations of MR assumptions and were not consistent across MR methodologies or data sources and therefore are also to unlikely reflect causation. These findings provide new insights into gut microbiota-mediated oral and oropharyngeal cancers and warrant further investigation.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between gut microbiota and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We enrolled a total of 48 AIS patients, including 19 HTPR patients and 29 non-high on-treatment platelet reactivity (NHTPR) patients, along with 10 healthy controls. Clinical and laboratory data, as well as stool samples, were collected from all participants. The composition and function of gut microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Differences in the gut microbiota between the two groups were analyzed, and a diagnostic model based on the gut microbiota was established using random forest model.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
HTPR patients exhibited a decreased microbial richness compared to NHTPR patients. Additionally, the relative abundance of <italic>unidentified_Clostridia</italic> and <italic>Ralstonia</italic> was lower in HTPR patients. Significant differences in biological functions, such as toxoplasmosis, were observed between the two groups. The combination of <italic>Ralstonia, unidentified-Clostridia, Mailhella, Anaerofustis</italic>, and <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> showed excellent predictive ability for HTPR occurrence (AUC=0.896). When comparing AIS patients with healthy controls, alterations in the microbiota structure were observed in AIS patients, with imbalances in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. Significant differences in biological functions, such as oxidative phosphorylation, were noted between the two groups. The combination of <italic>Alloprevotella, Terrisporobacter, Streptococcus, Proteus</italic>, and <italic>unidentified_Bacteria</italic> exhibited strong predictive power for AIS occurrence (AUC=0.994).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
This study is the first to uncover the microbial characteristics of HTPR in AIS patients and demonstrate the predictive potential of specific bacterial combinations for HTPR occurrence.

<h2 id="regulatory-role-of-mss11-in-candida-glabrata-virulence-adhesion-and-biofilm-formation">Regulatory role of Mss11 in Candida glabrata virulence: adhesion and biofilm formation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Candida glabrata</italic> has emerged as a fungal pathogen with high infection and mortality rates, and its primary virulence factors are related to adhesion and biofilm formation. These virulence factors in <italic>C.glabrata</italic> are primarily mediated by epithelial adhesins (Epas), most of which are encoded in subtelomeric regions and regulated by subtelomeric silencing mechanisms. The transcription factor Mss11, known for its regulatory role in adhesion, biofilm formation, and filamentous growth in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, has also been implicated in the expression of <italic>EPA6</italic>, suggesting its potential influence on <italic>C.glabrata</italic> virulence. The present study aims to determine the regulatory role of Mss11 in the virulence of <italic>C. glabrata</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this work, a <italic>Δmss11</italic> null mutant and its complemented strain were constructed from a <italic>C.glabrata</italic> standard strain. The impact of the transcription factor Mss11 on the virulence of <italic>C.glabrata</italic> was investigated through a series of phenotypic experiments, including the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) test, adherence assay, biofilm assay, scanning electron microscopy and <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> virulence assay. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of Mss11.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
In <italic>C.glabrata</italic>, the loss of <italic>MSS11</italic> led to a significant reduction in several virulence factors including cell surface hydrophobicity, epithelial cell adhesion, and biofilm formation. These observations were consistent with the decreased virulence of the <italic>Δmss11</italic> mutant observed in the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> infection model. Further exploration demonstrated that Mss11 modulates <italic>C. glabrata</italic> virulence by regulating <italic>EPA1</italic> and <italic>EPA6</italic> expression. It binds to the upstream regions of <italic>EPA1</italic> and <italic>EPA6</italic>, as well as the promoter regions of the subtelomeric silencing-related genes <italic>SIR4</italic>, <italic>RIF1</italic>, and <italic>RAP1</italic>, indicating the dual regulatory role of Mss11.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Mss11 plays a crucial role in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> adhesion and biofilm formation, and thus has a broad influence on virulence. This regulation is achieved by regulating the expression of <italic>EPA1</italic> and <italic>EPA6</italic> through both promoter-specific regulation and subtelomeric silencing.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shows promising application for complicated infections that cannot be resolved by conventional microbiological tests (CMTs). The criteria for cfDNA sequencing are currently in need of agreement and standardization.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We performed a retrospective cohort observation of 653 patients who underwent plasma cfDNA mNGS, including 431 with suspected bloodstream infections (BSI) and 222 with other suspected systemic infections. Plasma mNGS and CMTs were performed simultaneously in clinical practice. The diagnostic efficacy of plasma mNGS and CMTs in the diagnosis of blood-borne and other systemic infections was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The sensitivity and specificity of the two methods were analyzed based on the final clinical outcome as the gold standard.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The mNGS test showed an overall positive rate of 72.3% (472/653) for detecting microorganisms in plasma cfDNA, with a range of 2 to 6 different microorganisms detected in 171 patient specimens. Patients with positive mNGS results were more immunocompromised and had a higher incidence of severe disease (P&lt;0·05). The sensitivity of mNGS was higher for BSI (93·5%) and other systemic infections (83·6%) compared to CMTs (37·7% and 14·3%, respectively). The mNGS detected DNA from a total of 735 microorganisms, with the number of microbial DNA reads ranging from 3 to 57,969, and a higher number of reads being associated with clinical infections (P&lt;0·05). Of the 472 patients with positive mNGS results, clinical management was positively affected in 203 (43%) cases. Negative mNGS results led to a modified clinical management regimen in 92 patients (14.1%). The study also developed a bacterial and fungal library for plasma mNGS and obtained comparisons of turnaround times and detailed processing procedures for rare pathogens.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study evaluates the clinical use and analytic approaches of mNGS in predicting bloodstream and local infections in clinical practice. Our results suggest that mNGS has higher positive predictive values (PPVs) for BSI and systemic infections compared to CMTs, and can positively affect clinical management in a significant number of patients. The standardized whole-process management procedure for plasma mNGS developed in this study will ensure improved pre-screening probabilities and yield clinically valuable data.

<h2 id="aspergillus-terreus-spondylodiscitis-following-acupuncture-and-acupotomy-in-an-immunocompetent-host-case-report-and-literature-review">Aspergillus terreus spondylodiscitis following acupuncture and acupotomy in an immunocompetent host: case report and literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> is a fungus responsible for various infections in human beings; however, spine involvement is uncommon. Herein, we report a case of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>terreus</italic> spondylodiscitis following acupuncture and acupotomy in an immunocompetent Chinese patient. Admission lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed infection at the L4/5 level without significant vertebral destruction. After unsuccessful symptomatic and anti-tuberculosis treatments, <italic>A. terreus</italic> was identified through culture, microscopy of isolate, histological examination and VITEK system. Intravenous voriconazole was then given; however, the patient’s spinal condition deteriorated rapidly, resulting in evident destruction of the L4/5 vertebral bodies. Surgeries including L4/5 intervertebral disc debridement, spinal canal decompression, posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with allogeneic fibula ring fusion cages, and posterior pedicle screw fixation were then performed. Imaging findings at one-month and six-month follow-up suggested that the patient was successfully treated. This case highlighted two important points: firstly, although acupuncture and acupotomy are generally regarded as safe conservative treatments for pain management, they can still lead to complications such as fungal spinal infection. Therefore, vigilance is necessary when considering these treatments; secondly, PLIF with allogeneic fibula ring fusion cages may be beneficial for <italic>A. terreus</italic> spondylodiscitis patients with spinal instability.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Recent reports have shown that wild crabs may be important hosts involved in the transmission and spread of the parasitic <italic>Hematodinium</italic> in cultured marine crustaceans. Therefore, monitoring the prevalence of <italic>Hematodinium</italic> infections in wild crabs is necessary to develop effective strategies for the prevention and control of <italic>Hematodinium</italic> disease. Here we report a wild crab species, <italic>Macrophthalmus</italic> (<italic>Macrophthalmus</italic>) <italic>abbreviatus</italic> Manning &amp; Holthuis, 1981, as a new natural host for <italic>Hematodinium</italic> sp. infection. It is one of the common wild crab species dwelling in the ponds or waterways connected to the polyculture ponds located on the coast of Rizhao or Weifang, Shandong Peninsula, China. According to the results of PCR detection and phylogenetic analysis targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region, these <italic>Hematodinium</italic> sp. isolates were identified as <italic>H. perezi</italic> and fell into the genotype II category within <italic>H. perezi</italic>. A high monthly prevalence of <italic>H. perezi</italic> infection was observed during the 2021–2022 field survey, ranging from 33.3% to 90.6% in <italic>M. abbreviatus</italic> originating from Weifang (n=304 wild crabs) and from 53.6% to 92.9% in those from Rizhao (n=42 wild crabs). Artificial inoculation infection experiments demonstrated that <italic>M. abbreviatus</italic> could be infected by <italic>H. perezi</italic>, and massive <italic>Hematodinium</italic> cells and typical histopathological changes were observed in the hepatopancreas and gill tissues of the infected crabs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <italic>M. abbreviatus</italic> as a new natural host for <italic>H. perezi</italic> infection. Results in the present study extend the known host spectrum for this emerging parasite pathogen, and also provide valuable information for epidemic surveillance of the <italic>Hematodinium</italic> disease as well.

<h2 id="urinary-microbiota-signatures-associated-with-different-types-of-urinary-diversion-a-comparative-study">Urinary microbiota signatures associated with different types of urinary diversion: a comparative study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion (UD) are gold standards for non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder (or Studer), ileal conduit (or Bricker) and cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) are mainstream UD types. Little is known about urinary microbiological changes after UD.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers and patients with bladder cancer who had received aforementioned UD procedures. Microbiomes of samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and microbial diversities, distributions and functions were investigated and compared across groups.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Highest urine microbial richness and diversity were observed in healthy controls, followed by Studer patients, especially those without hydronephrosis or residual urine, α-diversity indices of whom were remarkably higher than those of Bricker and CU groups. Studer UD type was the only independent factor favoring urine microbial diversity. The urine microflora structure of the Studer group was most similar to that of the healthy individuals while that of the CU group was least similar. Studer patients and healthy volunteers shared many similar urine microbial functions, while Bricker and CU groups exhibited opposite characteristics.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study first presented urinary microbial landscapes of UD patients and demonstrated the microbiological advantage of orthotopic neobladder. Microbiota might be a potential tool for optimization of UD management.

<h2 id="human-and-animal-exposure-to-newly-discovered-sand-fly-viruses-china">Human and animal exposure to newly discovered sand fly viruses, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The Hedi virus (HEDV) and Wuxiang virus (WUXV) are newly discovered Bunyaviruses transmitted by sandflies. The geographical distribution of isolation of these two viruses continues to expand and it has been reported that WUXV causes neurological symptoms and even death in suckling mice. However, little is known about the prevalence of the two viruses in mammalian infections.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In order to understand the infection status of HEDV and WUXV in humans and animals from regions where the viruses have been isolated, this study used Western blotting to detect the positive rates of HEDV and WUXV IgG antibodies in serum samples from febrile patients, dogs, and chickens in the forementioned regions.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The results showed that of the 29 human serum samples, 17.24% (5/29) tested positive for HEDV, while 68.96% (20/29) were positive for WUXV. In the 31 dog serum samples, 87.10% (27/31) were positive for HEDV and 70.97% (22/31) were positive for WUXV, while in the 36 chicken serum samples, 47.22% (17/36) were positive for HEDV, and 52.78% (19/36) were positive for WUXV.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
These findings suggest there are widespread infections of HEDV and WUXV in mammals (dogs, chickens) and humans from the regions where these viruses have been isolated. Moreover, the positive rate of HEDV infections was higher in local animals compared to that measured in human specimens. This is the first seroepidemiological study of these two sandfly-transmitted viruses. The findings of the study have practical implications for vector-borne viral infections and related zoonotic infections in China, as well as providing an important reference for studies on the relationship between sandfly-transmitted viruses and zoonotic infections outside of China.

<h2 id="transovarial-transmission-of-mosquito-borne-viruses-a-systematic-review">Transovarial transmission of mosquito-borne viruses: a systematic review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
A number of mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), such as dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) exert adverse health impacts on the global population. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the prime vectors responsible for the transmission of these viruses. The viruses have acquired a number of routes for successful transmission, including horizontal and vertical transmission. Transovarial transmission is a subset/type of vertical transmission adopted by mosquitoes for the transmission of viruses from females to their offspring through eggs/ovaries. It provides a mechanism for these MBVs to persist and maintain their lineage during adverse climatic conditions of extremely hot and cold temperatures, during the dry season, or in the absence of susceptible vertebrate host when horizontal transmission is not possible.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The publications discussed in this systematic review were searched for using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and websites such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using the search terms “transovarial transmission” and “mosquito-borne viruses” from 16 May 2023 to 20 September 2023.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 2,391 articles were searched, of which 123 were chosen for full text evaluation, and 60 were then included in the study after screening and removing duplicates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The present systematic review focuses on understanding the above diseases, their pathogenesis, epidemiology and host–parasite interactions. The factors affecting transovarial transmission, potential implications, mosquito antiviral defense mechanism, and the control strategies for these mosquito-borne viral diseases (MBVDs) are also be included in this review.

<h2 id="the-impact-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection-on-low-skeletal-muscle-mass-risk-in-chinese-women-over-40-a-cross-sectional-analysis">The impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on low skeletal muscle mass risk in Chinese women over 40: a cross-sectional analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Sarcopenia can lead to significant personal, social, and economic burdens. The diagnosis of sarcopenia heavily relies on the identification of Low Skeletal Muscle Mass (LSMM), which is an independent predictor of frailty, disability, and increased risk of death among seniors. Women have physiologically lower levels of skeletal muscle mass than men, and female sarcopenia appears to be more influenced by menopause. They also tend to have higher body fat levels than man, which increases the risk of sarcopenia obesity. On another front, it’s also recognized that humans are largely prone to <italic>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)</italic> infection, with global prevalence rates often surpassing 50%. Nevertheless, the interconnection between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM remains relatively unexplored. Hence, our study specifically targeted women as the research population and sought to explore several risk factors for LSMM. Additionally, we delved into the potential correlation between LSMM and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in women, hoping to gain insights into potential preventative measures or treatment options that may enhance the quality of life for women affected by sarcopenia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We conducted a cross-sectional study among women aged over 18 years undergoing physical examination. We performed 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for the assessment of LSMM. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection with LSMM.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
This study enrolled 1984 Chinese women who were undergoing health check-ups. A univariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal a direct correlation between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM among this female population (OR=1.149, 95% CI 0.904-1.459, <italic>p</italic>=0.257). Yet, upon dividing the participants into age-based subgroups, an evident link was observed between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM in women aged 40 or above (OR=1.381, 95%CI 1.032-1.848, <italic>p</italic>= 0.030). After adjusting for variables including Age, BMI, TP, ALK, Cre, this relationship remained statistically relevant (OR=1.514, 95%CI 1.085-2.113, <italic>p</italic>= 0.015).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Women who are over 40 years old and currently infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> have an increased risk of developing LSMM. Therefore, timely treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication is recommended for this group of women to reduce the occurrence of LSMM.

<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The in-depth studies reveal the interaction between the host and commensal microbiomes. Symbiotic bacteria influence in tumor initiation, progression, and response to treatment. Recently, intratumor bacteria have been a burgeoning research field. The tumor microenvironment is under vascular hyperplasia, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia, and immunosuppression. It might be attractive for bacterial growth and proliferation. As a component of the tumor microenvironment, intratumor bacteria influence tumor growth and metastasis, as well as the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay of intratumoral bacteria and the host might contribute to better approaches to treat tumors. In this review, we summarize current evidence about roles of intratumor bacteria in tumor initiation and anti-tumor therapy, and what is remained to be solved in this field.

<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
This study was performed to explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 on H. pylori infections of the stomach tissue in C57BL/6 mice.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, 40 specific-pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups, namely, the control, ZFM4 pretreatment) ZFM4 pretreatment before <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), model (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), triple therapy (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with triple therapy), and ZFM4 treatment groups (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with ZFM4). The preventive and therapeutic effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 were evaluated in <italic>H. pylori-</italic>infected C57BL/6 mice by assessing gastric tissue morphology, inflammatory cytokine levels, microbial composition, and microbial diversity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 was able to survive in low gastric pH and play a role in preventing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. This was evident from a reduction in both, the gastric inflammatory response and expression of inflammatory factors caused by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 could also inhibit the growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> via its beneficial impact on the gastric microbiota.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our findings suggest that <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 offers superior preventive effects against <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections when used alone. However, the therapeutic effect on established infections is weaker. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific dosage, duration, and other aspects of administration.
