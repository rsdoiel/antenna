id="exploring-trim-proteins-role-in-antiviral-defense-against-influenza-a-virus-and-respiratory-coronaviruses">Exploring
TRIM proteins’ role in antiviral defense against influenza A virus and
respiratory coronaviruses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, identified as E3 ubiquitin
ligases, participate in various viral infections through ubiquitylation,
ISGylation, and SUMOylation processes. Respiratory viruses, particularly
influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs), have
severely threatened public health with high morbidity and mortality,
causing incalculable losses. Research on the regulation of TRIM proteins
in respiratory virus infections is crucial for disease prevention and
control. This review introduces TRIM proteins, summarizes recent
discoveries regarding their roles and molecular mechanisms in IAV and
CoVs infections, discusses current research gaps, and explores potential
future trends in this rapidly developing field. It aims to enhance
understanding of virus–host interactions and inform the development of
new molecularly targeted therapies.</p>

id="pediatric-endocarditis---a-stone-left-after-the-pandemic-cascade">Pediatric
endocarditis - a stone left after the pandemic cascade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Infective endocarditis is a rare disease in children. The etiology is
mainly bacterial. However, viral infective endocarditis, possibly
related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
has also been reported. The pathophysiological principle of the
connection between the two entities seems to be attributed to the
transient immune deficiency of the body during the infection.
Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is reported in the literature as a direct
cardiopathic virus. Therefore, the new coronavirus seems to have the
ability to affect both the intact cardiac tissue and the previously
damaged one both during the acute episode and at a distance from it.
Consequently, we propose to review the main pathophysiological aspects
of pediatric cardiac damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The ultimate goal is
to deepen existing knowledge, broaden the horizon of understanding and
analysis regarding the systemic damage induced by viral infections, and
strengthen an information base from which to start a meta-analysis.
Next, we performed a non-systematized screening of the specialized
literature with reference to cases of endocarditis in the pediatric
population, reported in the period 2020–2023. From the total of articles
found, we chose to include in the review a number of 6 case reports,
including a number of 7 patients (5 children and 2 adolescents).
Analysis of reports suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could play a role
in the development of endocarditis, either directly through active
infection or indirectly through a post-infectious immune response. Also,
pre-existing conditions and complex medical history predispose to an
increased risk of developing a severe, complicated form of endocarditis.
Also, the lack of data on the vaccination history and the failure to
categorize the infection depending on the type of antibodies (IgM or
IgG) in some studies represent a major bias in the reports. The latter
make it difficult to evaluate the influence of vaccination and the
impact of acute versus chronic infection on the course of cases.</p>

id="long-term-stability-of-acquired-drug-resistance-and-resistance-associated-mutations-in-the-fungal-pathogen-nakaseomyces-glabratus-candida-glabrata">Long-term
stability of acquired drug resistance and resistance associated
mutations in the fungal pathogen Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida
glabrata)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The limited number of available antifungal drugs and the increasing
number of fungal isolates that show drug or multidrug resistance pose a
serious medical threat. Several yeast pathogens, such as Nakaseomyces
glabratus (Candida glabrata), show a remarkable ability to develop drug
resistance during treatment through the acquisition of genetic
mutations. However, how stable this resistance and the underlying
mutations are in non-selective conditions remains poorly characterized.
The stability of acquired drug resistance has fundamental implications
for our understanding of the appearance and spread of drug-resistant
outbreaks and for defining efficient strategies to combat them. Here, we
used an in vitro evolution approach to assess the stability under
optimal growth conditions of resistance phenotypes and
resistance-associated mutations that were previously acquired under
exposure to antifungals. Our results reveal a remarkable stability of
the resistant phenotype and the underlying mutations in a significant
number of evolved populations, which conserved their phenotype for at
least two months in the absence of drug-selective pressure. We observed
a higher stability of anidulafungin resistance over fluconazole
resistance, and of resistance-conferring point mutations as compared
with aneuploidies. In addition, we detected accumulation of novel
mutations in previously altered resistance-associated genes in
non-selective conditions, which suggest a possible compensatory role. We
conclude that acquired resistance, particularly to anidulafungin, is a
long-lasting phenotype, which has important implications for the
persistence and propagation of drug-resistant clinical outbreaks.</p>

id="fulminant-fatal-pneumonia-and-bacteremia-due-to-aeromonas-dhakensis-in-an-immunocompetent-man-a-case-report-and-literature-review">Fulminant
fatal pneumonia and bacteremia due to Aeromonas dhakensis in an
immunocompetent man: a case report and literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAeromonas dhakensis is associated with soft tissue
infection, bacteremia and gastroenteritis. Involvement of respiratory
system in adults is extremely rare. We report a case of fulminant
pneumonia and bacteremia due to A. dhakensis in a patient without
underlying diseases.Case presentationA 26-year-old man became ill
suddenly with pneumonia after swimming in a river. Despite intensive
support measures in the intensive care unit, he died 13 hours after
admission and 4 days after his first symptoms. Autopsy showed abundant
Gram-negative bacteria, massive inflammatory cell infiltration, edema,
necrosis and hemorrhage in lung tissue. A. dhakensis was isolated from
blood culture taken at admission and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
after intubation. Moreover, A. dhakensis was also detected in lung
tissue by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay. The
infection may have come from river water.ConclusionIn patients who
develop a fulminant pneumonia after contacting an aquatic environment,
A. dhakensis should be alerted and mNGS may aid in the detection of
aquatic pathogens by being more sensitive and specific versus
traditional bacterial culture.</p>

id="coumarin-derivatives-ameliorate-the-intestinal-inflammation-and-pathogenic-gut-microbiome-changes-in-the-model-of-infectious-colitis-through-antibacterial-activity">Coumarin
derivatives ameliorate the intestinal inflammation and pathogenic gut
microbiome changes in the model of infectious colitis through
antibacterial activity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Coumarin, a phenolic compound, is a secondary metabolite produced by
plants such as Tanga and Lime. Coumarin derivatives were prepared via
Pechmann condensation. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo
experiments to determine the antimicrobial and gut immune-regulatory
functions of coumarin derivatives. For the in vitro antimicrobial
activity assay, coumarin derivatives C1 and C2 were selected based on
their pathogen-killing activity against various pathogenic microbes. We
further demonstrated that the selected coumarin derivatives disrupted
bacterial cell membranes. Next, we examined the regulatory function of
the coumarin derivatives in gut inflammation using an infectious colitis
model. In an in vivo infectious colitis model, administration of
selected C1 coumarin derivatives reduced pathogen loads, the number of
inflammatory immune cells (Th1 cells and Th17 cells), and inflammatory
cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-1b) in the intestinal tissue after pathogen
infection. In addition, we found that the administration of C1 coumarin
derivatives minimized abnormal gut microbiome shift-driven pathogen
infection. Potential pathogenic gut microbes, such as Enterobacteriaceae
and Staphylococcaceae, were increased by pathogen infection. However,
this pathogenic microbial expansion was minimized and beneficial
bacteria, such as Ligilactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus, increased
with C1 coumarin derivative treatment. Functional gene enrichment
assessment revealed that the relative abundance of genes associated with
lipid and nucleotide metabolism was reduced by pathogen infection;
however, this phenomenon was not observed in C1 coumarin
derivative-treated animals. Collectively, our data suggest that C1
coumarin derivative is effective antibacterial agents that minimize
pathogen-induced gut inflammation and abnormal gut microbiome modulation
through their antibacterial activity.</p>
