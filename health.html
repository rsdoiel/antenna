comparison of two human papillomavirus vaccines for efficacy against
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and adenocarcinoma in
situ—population-based follow-up of two cluster-randomized trials</h2>

<p>IntroductionWe report head-to-head comparison of the bivalent and
quadrivalent HPV vaccine efficacies against immediate precursors of
cervical cancer from 15 years’ country-wide cancer registry follow-up of
phase III trial cohorts and an age-aligned cohort of unvaccinated
women.MethodsThese individually and/or clusterrandomized cohorts of
HPV6/11/16/18- and HPV16/18-vaccinated and unvaccinated women were
enrolled, respectively, in 2002, 2004, and 2003/2005. The trial cohorts
comprised initially 16- to 17-year-old HPV6/11/16/18-vaccinated FUTURE
II (NCT00092534) participants (866) and HPV16/18-vaccinated PATRICIA
(NCT00122681) and 012 trial (NCT00169494) participants (2,465), and
16,526 initially 16- to 19-year-old unvaccinated controls. After active
4-year clinical follow-up, passive, country-wide Finnish Cancer Registry
(FCR) follow-up for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3)
and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was based on consented use of unique
personal identifiers and started 6 months after the end of the FUTURE II
and PATRICIA trials in 2007 and 2009, and ended at the end of 2019. The
follow-up with altogether 229,020 follow-up years was age-aligned to
ensure that similarly aged cohorts were passively followed up for 15
years post=vaccination for the intention-to-treat analyses of vaccine
efficacy.ResultsOverall, we identified 5 and 16 CIN3 (no AIS) cases in
the HPV6/11/16/18 and HPV16/18 cohorts, respectively, during the
FCR-based follow-up. In the unvaccinated cohort, we identified 281 CIN3
cases, 20 AIS cases, and 13 cases with invasive cervical cancer. Vaccine
efficacies against CIN3+ were 68.4% and 64.5% for the quadrivalent and
the bivalent vaccines, respectively, with overlapping confidence
intervals.DiscussionLong-term follow-up of randomized, initially
adolescent HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts shows, in this
head-to-head setting, that the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines
are equally effective against immediate precursors of cervical
cancer.</p>

id="vaginal-microbiota-of-pregnant-women-with-ureaplasma-urealyticum-and-mycoplasma-hominis-infections">Vaginal
microbiota of pregnant women with Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma
hominis infections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe association between preterm birth and Mycoplasma
species such as Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum has been
extensively investigated. In a clinical setting, conventional diagnostic
methods for them involve culture methods for Mycoplasma spp. and
Ureaplasma spp., along with PCR tests. However, the clinical utility of
these tests remains controversial, highlighting the necessity for more
robust and reliable methods for identifying and understanding Mycoplasma
infections.ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the distribution of
microbiota in pregnant women with Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma
urealyticum infection by the comparison of conventional diagnostic
methods with vaginal microbial community analysis.Study DesignThis
prospective case–control study involved 228 Korean pregnant women and
utilized vaginal microbial community analysis, Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma
culture, and 12-multiplex PCR for sexually transmitted diseases.
Cross-correlation analysis in SPSS 27 compared the results of two
conventional methods with vaginal microbial community analysis. R
software generated box plots depicting the relative abundance of
microorganisms. Network analysis was conducted using
Cytoscape.ResultsPositive Ureaplasma urealyticum culture findings were
observed in 60.2% of patients, with 76.4% positive for Ureaplasma parvum
PCR and 13.2% positive for Ureaplasma urealyticum PCR. Mycoplasma
hominis culture was positive only in two patients, while Mycoplasma
hominis PCR was positive in eight women. Vaginal microbial community
analysis identified significant differences in relative abundances of
Gardnerella species type I and Fannyhessea vaginae between the
Ureaplasma urealyticum PCR positive and negative groups. Mycoplasma
hominis PCR positive patients exhibited significant differences in 11
bacterial species, including Gardnerella species I and Fannyhessea
vaginae.ConclusionThis study suggests that STD-PCR may be more accurate
than Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma culture for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma
hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infection. Also, the presence of
Gardnerella species I and Fannyhessea vaginae implies their potential
influences on Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis infections
based on results of vaginal microbial community analysis. Therefore,
vaginal microbial community analysis may give the more information of
their pathophysiology.</p>
