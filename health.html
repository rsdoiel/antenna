global proteome of Streptococcus pneumoniae EF3030 under
nutrient-defined in vitro conditions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionStreptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathobiont that
asymptomatically colonizes the upper respiratory tract but can cause
severe diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis, as well as
non-invasive infections like otitis media and sinusitis. It thrives in
the nutrient-limited environment of the nasopharynx and has evolved
mechanisms to manage host-induced stress and regulate protein levels
accordingly.MethodsTo investigate the molecular biology of S. pneumoniae
under in vitro and infection-relevant conditions, a suitable cultivation
medium is essential for reproducible experiments. We, therefore
optimized a chemically defined minimal medium that mimics the
nutrient-limited conditions of the human nasopharynx. This medium was
used to cultivate clinical isolates and other streptococcal species for
proteomic analysis.ResultThe optimized medium enhanced growth and
shortened the lag phase of S. pneumoniae and related species. Using this
medium, we analyzed the global proteome of the pneumococcal colonizing
strain EF3030 during its transition from early to late logarithmic
growth phase. Distinct changes in protein abundance were observed in
functional categories such as metabolism, amino acid synthesis, natural
competence, RNA and cell wall synthesis, protein degradation, and stress
responses. Notably, proteins involved in DNA uptake and processing—such
as choline-binding protein CbpD, competence factors ComGA and ComEA, and
ssDNA-binding proteins Dpr and DprA—were more abundant in the late log
phase.DiscussionThese findings highlight dynamic proteomic changes
associated with pneumococcal adaptation to nutrient-limited conditions
and provide insights into the biology of strain EF3030 during
colonization. The optimized medium offers a reproducible platform for
studying pneumococcal physiology and pathogenesis under defined
conditions.</p>

analysis of potential association between oral Haemophilus and sleep
disturbances in major depressive disorder patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe current study aimed to explore the specific oral
microbiota profiles in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with
sleep disturbances, and to evaluate the potential mechanisms by which
oral microbiota may be implicated in MDD.MethodThirty-eight MDD patients
experiencing sleep disturbances and thirty healthy controls (HCs) were
included. All MDD patients underwent a 14-day antidepressive treatment
regimen. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted, and 16S rRNA
sequencing was used to determine the abundance of oral
bacteria.ResultsOral genera Solobacterium, Granulicatella,
Campylobacter, and Haemophilus showed significant changes in their
relative abundances between the MDD and HC groups. Significant
correlations were found between the abundance of Haemophilus and
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and 24-item Hamilton Depression
Scale (HAMD-24) scores in MDD patients with sleep disturbances. In MDD
patients, lower relative abundances of oral Haemophilus prior to
treatment were negatively correlated with the changed rates of PSQI and
HAMD-24 scores after antidepressive treatment. The glial fibrillary
acidic protein as the mediator, affected the relationship between the
relative abundance of oral Haemophilus and sleep disturbances in MDD
patients.ConclusionOral Haemophilus dysbiosis may drive sleep
disturbances in MDD patients, possibly through its impact on
neuroinflammation.</p>

differences of SARS-CoV-2 lineages may arise from unique RNA replication
characteristics and nucleocapsid protein expression</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by the sequential
introduction and circulation of distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants, which
presented differences in transmission capacity and pathogenicity.
However, the relationship between these differences and the replicative
capacity of these variants remains to be determined. Our research aimed
to compare the biological traits of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.33,
and variants Zeta (P.2), Gamma (P.1/P.1.<em>), Delta
(B.1.617.2/AY.</em>), and Omicron (BA.1).MethodsWe employed three
different cellular models susceptible to viral infection to demonstrated
the differences in virus binding, entry and total RNA production through
RT-qPCR assay and viral infectious progeny by plaque assay. The RNA
replication was evaluated by dsRNA immunofluorescence and the viral
protein production by western blotting analysis. NGS and RT-qPCR
analysis were also used in competition experiments to verify the viral
variants dynamic in cell culture.ResultsWe found that the differences in
viral replication varied according to the cell type, with Omicron BA.1
exhibiting the lowest replication capacity in human pulmonary cells.
Additionally, we demonstrated the occurrence of nucleocapsid proteoforms
generated during infection and differences in size and number of sites
of viral RNA replication for each virus.ConclusionThese data suggest
that factors beyond the initial stages of virus entry influence the
efficiency of viral replication among different SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Thus, our study underscores the significance of RNA replication and the
role of nucleocapsid proteins in shaping the replicative characteristics
of SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>

as a therapeutic agent for ulcerative colitis: mechanisms of action and
modulation of the gut microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease driven
by gut dysbiosis, immune dysregulation, and oxidative stress, lacks
universally effective therapies. Fucoidan (FCD), a sulfated
polysaccharide derived from brown algae, has emerged as a multifaceted
therapeutic candidate due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and
immunomodulatory properties. This review synthesizes FCD’s mechanisms in
UC pathogenesis, emphasizing its suppression of NF-κB and MAPK signaling
pathways to reduce proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and
regulate TLR-mediated macrophage polarization. FCD enhances intestinal
barrier integrity via upregulation of tight junction proteins
(Claudin-1, ZO-1) and mucin MUC2 expression, while remodeling gut
microbial ecology through enrichment of SCFAs-producing bacteria (e.g.,
Ruminococcaceae) and suppression of pathogens (Escherichia coli, Candida
albicans). Preclinical studies highlight LMWF as a superior candidate,
demonstrating enhanced bioavailability and efficacy in mitigating
DSS-induced colitis. Despite its promise, challenges persist in
structural heterogeneity (source- and extraction-dependent), scalable
production of LMWF, and insufficient pharmacokinetic data. Emerging
strategies—including nanoparticle-based delivery systems and structural
modifications (cross-linking, covalent bonding)—aim to overcome
bioavailability limitations. This review underscores FCD’s potential as
a functional food or adjuvant therapy for UC, while advocating for
rigorous clinical validation to bridge translational gaps, Enrichment of
SCFAs-producing taxa and suppression of pathobionts (Escherichia coli,
Candida albicans), mediated through prebiotic fermentation. Suppression
of NF-κB activation via IκBα stabilization and inhibition of p65 nuclear
translocation, and downregulation of MAPK phosphorylation (ERK1/2, JNK,
p38), reducing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β). FCD can
be used as a potential treatment for UC.</p>

tomography-based radiomics prediction model for differentiating invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus are
important pathogens that cause fungal pulmonary infections. Because the
manifestations of P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) or invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis (IPA) are difficult to differentiate on computed
tomography (CT) images and the treatment of the two diseases is
different, correct imaging for diagnosis is highly significant. The
present study developed and validated the diagnostic performance of a
CT-based radiomics prediction model for differentiating IPA from
PJP.MethodsIn total, 97 patients, 51 with IPA and 46 with PJP, were
included in this study. Each patient underwent a non-enhanced chest CT
examination. All the patients were randomly divided into two cohorts,
training and validation, at a ratio of 7:3 using random seeds
automatically generated using the RadCloud platform. Image segmentation,
feature extraction, and radiomic feature selection were performed on the
RadCloud platform. The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually
segmented, including the consolidation area with the surrounding
ground-glass opacity (GGO) area and the consolidation area alone. Six
supervised-learning classifiers were used to develop a CT-based
radiomics prediction model, which was estimated using the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC),
sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. The radiomics score
was also calculated to compare the prediction
performance.ResultsClassifiers trained with the consolidation area and
surrounding GGO area as the ROI showed better prediction efficacy than
classifiers trained using only the consolidation area as the ROI. The
XGBoost model performed better than the other classifiers and radiomics
scores in the validation cohort, with an AUC of 0.808 (95% CI,
0.655–0.961).ConclusionsThis radiomics model can effectively assist in
the differential diagnosis of PJP and IPA. The consolidation area with
the surrounding GGO area was more suitable for ROI segmentation.</p>

review: single- and multidonor washed microbiota transplantation have
equivalent efficacy in the treatment of autism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious
neurodevelopmental disorder with no effective treatment. This study
explored the short-term clinical effects of washed microbiota
transplantation (WMT) with different numbers of donors on
autism.MethodsConsecutive ASD patients treated with two continuous WMT
courses from March 2020 to March 2022 at the First Affiliated Hospital
of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University were retrospectively assessed.
Basic information, aberrant behavior checklist (ABC) scores, childhood
autism rating scale (CARS) scores, sleep disturbance scale for children
(SDSC) scores, adverse reactions, and feces were
collected.ResultsForty-four patients were included (single-donor group:
17 patients; multidonor group: 27 patients). The CARS, ABC and SDSC
scores didn’t differ between the two groups before treatment. After two
courses, the scores for the 44 patients were lower than those at
baseline (P&lt;0.05), with no severe adverse reactions observed. After
the first course, the mean ABC (P=0.049) and SDSC (P=0.019) scores were
significantly different between the single-donor and multidonor groups,
but the difference disappeared after two courses. The alpha-diversity of
the faecal flora in the effective-group was greater than that in the
ineffective-group (Shannon index P=0.0018). Lactobacillus was the
predominant genus in the effective group, whereas Faecalibacterium,
Campylobacter, and Sphingomonas were predominant genera in the
ineffective group.ConclusionAfter two WMT courses, the symptoms of ASD
improved, with good short-term treatment efficacy. The ASD symptom
improvement did not differ between the single-donor and multidonor
groups. Changes in the alpha-diversity and abundance of the faecal
microbiota after WMT may be related to treatment efficacy.</p>

Enhances early diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and pathogen
verification in elderly BSI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infection (BSI) exhibits elevated mortality,
particularly among elderly patients manifesting atypical symptoms.
Although blood culture (BC) remains the diagnostic gold standard, its
limited sensitivity and prolonged turnaround time impede early
detection. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), a novel
pathogen detection method with superior sensitivity and rapid results,
demonstrates significant diagnostic and prognostic for BSI. However,
heightened sensitivity may increase false positive rates, with elderly
patients particularly susceptible to specimen contamination and
transient bacteremia.MethodsThis retrospective study employed clinical
judgment as the diagnostic reference. Patients were stratified into BSI
and non-BSI groups, with data collected on ddPCR and BC results, imaging
and laboratory findings, medication response, and discharge outcomes.
The diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic guidance efficacy of ddPCR and BC
were compared, and the clinical utility of ddPCR was evaluated for
prognostic assessment and false positive identification.ResultsThe
analysis encompassed 355 episodes from 280 elderly patients with
suspected BSI. ddPCR demonstrated significantly higher detection rates
compared to BC in BSI group (59.33% versus 20.57%). Combined
implementation increased detection to 65.07%. Regardless of clinical
judgment (59.61% versus 20.57%) or alternative microbiological tests
(90.63% versus 7.14%) served as the reference standards, ddPCR exhibited
superior sensitivity to BC. No significant differences emerged in
antibiotic adjustment rates or therapeutic efficacy between ddPCR and
BC. Elevated microbial species diversity correlated with unfavorable
discharge outcomes (P&lt;0.001, OR=2.122). Multiple follow-up ddPCR
monitoring revealed progressive increases in the number of species and
the copies of some (or all) species among patients with poor outcomes,
contrasting with decreasing trends in those with favorable outcomes.
When detecting Streptococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS),
Acinetobacter baumannii complex, and Candida, diagnostic thresholds of
132.55, 182.70/262.24, and 174.78 copies/mL, respectively, were
established to help differentiate false-positive results.ConclusionThe
combination of ddPCR with BC improves BSI diagnosis in elderly patients
and facilitates antibiotic treatment optimization. Moreover, ddPCR
demonstrates potential for prognostic evaluation and false-positive
discrimination. Nevertheless, these findings require further validation
through large-scale prospective studies employing predefined clinical
criteria.</p>

and antimicrobial activity of a novel lytic phage vB_SmaS_QH16 against
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: in vitro, in vivo, and biofilm
studies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundStenotrophomonas maltophilia, an important opportunistic
pathogen resistant to multiple antibiotics, necessitates alternative
therapies. Phages, with their high specificity and bacteriolytic
ability, are emerging as promising antibiotic alternatives. This study
aimed to isolate and characterize a novel lytic phage targeting S.
maltophilia and to evaluate its antibacterial potential.MethodsA novel
lytic phage, vB_SmaS_QH16, was isolated from hospital sewage using S.
maltophilia no.981 as the host. Phage morphology was analyzed using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and genome sequencing and
annotation were performed. Host range, efficiency of lysis (EOP),
optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI), one-step growth curves, and
physicochemical stability were also determined. Biofilm inhibition and
eradication were assessed using crystal violet staining, MTT assays, and
acridine orange fluorescence microscopy. Using Galleria mellonella and
mouse infection models, the in vivo anti-infective effects of phages
were evaluated.ResultsPhage vB_SmaS_QH16, a member of the class
Caudoviricetes, has a 43,500 bp genome with 64 open reading frames
(ORFs) and no virulence, antibiotic resistance, or lysogeny-related
genes. It exhibits a broad host range, lysing 47.95% (35/73) of tested
S. maltophilia strains. The optimal MOI was 0.01, with an average burst
size of 37.69 PFU/cell. The phage is stable at 4–50 °C and pH 3.0–11.0
but is highly sensitive to UV light. It effectively inhibits biofilm
formation and eradicates mature biofilms in a concentration-dependent
manner. In vitro, the phage significantly suppresses bacterial growth,
though resistant mutants emerge over time. In vivo, vB_SmaS_QH16
increases the survival rates of larvae and mice, with a higher MOI
offering better protection.ConclusionsPhage vB_SmaS_QH16 shows
therapeutic potential against S. maltophilia infections, characterized
by a broad host range, efficient lytic capability, and
biofilm-disrupting activity. Its stability and safety further support
its clinical application potential. Future research should explore its
biofilm disruption mechanisms and monitor resistance development.
Additionally, since its efficacy has been validated in mammalian models,
further studies can focus on advancing its clinical translation.</p>

and hematologicak responses to the third dose of an mRNA COVID-19
vaccine: a six-month longitudinal study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The deployment of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a major
landmark in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the activation
of adaptive immunity and its longevity after a booster dose warrant
further investigation. Moreover, the interplay between inflammation and
immune thrombosis after transfection needs further insights that could
help examine the vaccine’s potential for adverse events following
immunization (AEFIs). This study investigates the biochemical and
hematological responses to the third dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in
68 healthy participants who had previously received two doses of the
vaccine. Blood samples were collected at baseline (before vaccine dose;
D0), 48 hours post-vaccination (D2), and then at days 30, 60, 120, and
180 (D30, D60, D120, D180). The study focused on analyzing changes in
anti-SARS-COV-2 immunoglobulins (IgG and IgA), inflammatory biomarkers
(IL-6, IFN-γ, CRP, hs-CRP), coagulation factors (PT, APTT, D-dimers),
and blood cell counts (neutrophils, leukocytes, platelets) at D2
post-vaccination, and IgG and IgA at days 2, 30, 60, 120, and 180
post-vaccination. In this study, no clinical AEFIs were observed in any
of the recipients. Slight changes were observed in the levels of
inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers, and blood cells. Levels of CRP
and hs-CRP increased slightly but significantly, d-dimers were raised,
and PT and aPTT were prolonged significantly. A small but significant
decrease was observed in IFN-γ and mean lymphocyte counts, whereas no
change was observed in the levels of IL-6, neutrophils, and platelet
count at D2. Levels of IgG and IgA showed sustained increase over the
six-month period. These results collectively demonstrate that the third
dose of the mRNA vaccine elicits a rapid and sustained immune response
characterized by increased IgG and IgA levels. The changes observed in
inflammatory markers and coagulation factors after vaccination observed
shortly after vaccination require further investigations.</p>

of Zika virus and dengue virus infections in migrants in Italy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEstimating the burden of Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue
virus (DENV) infections in migrants is important to promote their health
status and recommend appropriate interventions. We aimed to estimate the
seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV in migrants from high endemic countries
attended at a referral center in Rome (Italy), arriving via the
Mediterranean from North and sub-Saharan Africa and South-East
Asia.MethodsSixty-four serum samples from migrants were tested for
anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM by ELISA. Serum
samples with detectable Ig were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA). For confirmatory testing and given the cross-reactivity of
antibodies between orthoflaviviruses, all positive IFA sera were tested
by virus neutralization test. ZIKV and DENV RNA were assessed by RT
Real-Time PCR. ResultsAll serum samples were negative for anti-ZIKV IgG,
while 12.50% (n=8/64) were positive for anti-ZIKV IgM by ELISA. IFA
showed that only 1 of 8 serum samples (12.50%) was positive for
anti-ZIKV IgM, but ZIKV RNA was undetectable. The seroprevalence of
anti-DENV IgG by ELISA was 59.37% (n=38/64), mostly confirmed by IFA
(97.36%, n=37/38). Furthermore, anti-DENV IgM were detected in 9 serum
samples (n=9/64, 14.06%) by ELISA, previously tested negative for
anti-DENV IgG. Of these, 2 sera were confirmed by IFA, but DENV RNA was
not detectable. Anti-DENV neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were detected
in 27% of anti-DENV IgG sera (n=10/37) tested by IFA. Multiple linear
regression analysis showed that sub-Saharan African origin was an
independent factor for the development of anti-DENV nAbs (p=0.009),
while age and gender had no effect. Sera negatives for anti-DENV nAbs
but with detectable anti-DENV IgG tested by IFA had nAbs to another
orthoflavivirus (n=25/27, 92.59%) such as West Nile virus (WNV)
(n=17/25, 68%), Yellow fever virus (YFV) (n=7/25, 28%) and Usutu virus
(USUV) (n=1/25, 4%). DiscussionA high prevalence of anti-orthoflavivirus
IgG, especially against DENV, was found in the migrant population
studied, but no infections were detected. With the recent outbreaks of
autochthonous DENV infections in Italy, the risk of secondary DENV
infection - and severe disease – could be high. Robust serological
surveillance, vaccination and prevention strategies for this vulnerable
group are needed.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health threat, with the
urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to improve control
and treatment outcomes. This study evaluates the performance of
MassARRAY technology for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and
identifying drug resistance, compared to traditional culture methods and
Xpert MTB/RIF. From July 2021 to February 2024, bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid (BALF) samples from 289 suspected pulmonary tuberculosis patients
at Henan Provincial Chest Hospital, China, were tested using MassARRAY,
Xpert MTB/RIF, and conventional culturing techniques. The performance of
each method was assessed for MTB detection, and the ability of MassARRAY
to identify drug resistance was compared with standard drug
susceptibility testing (DST). MassARRAY demonstrated a sensitivity of
96.5% and a specificity of 34.6% for MTB detection, outperforming the
Xpert MTB/RIF assay in sensitivity (94.7%) but showing lower
specificity. In detecting rifampicin resistance, MassARRAY achieved
concordance rates of 83.93% with Xpert MTB/RIF and 72.73% with DST.
Furthermore, MassARRAY successfully identified key genetic mutations
associated with drug resistance, such as rpoB 531 for rifampicin and
katG 315 for isoniazid. MassARRAY demonstrated high concordance with DST
for several drugs, including isoniazid, kanamycin, and streptomycin, but
exhibited limitations in detecting resistance to pyrazinamide,
clofazimine, cycloserine, and linezolid. Overall, MassARRAY provides a
rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput diagnostic platform for MTB
and drug resistance, particularly for first-line anti-tuberculosis
drugs. While limitations in specificity and resistance detection for
certain second-line drugs exist, its ability to rapidly provide
comprehensive resistance profiles makes it a valuable tool for TB
management.</p>

microbiota changes in postmenopausal women with low bone density linked
to serum amino acid metabolism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe gut microbiota (GM) has been linked to changes in bone
mineral density (BMD), potentially contributing to the development of
osteopenia or osteoporosis. Although the relationship between specific
bacterial taxa and bone remodeling has been documented in various
populations, data on the Mexican population remain limited. This study
aimed to analyze the changes in the taxonomic composition of GM
associated with low BMD (osteopenia/osteoporosis) and explore potential
mechanisms influencing bone metabolism in Mexican postmenopausal
women.MethodsBMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. GM
composition was analyzed through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in Mexican
postmenopausal women. Metabolic functions were predicted using PICRUSt2
based on KEGG pathways at hierarchy level 3. Serum amino acid (AA)
concentrations were measured in a sub-sample using tandem mass
spectrometry.ResultsOur findings indicated that beta diversity
significantly differed among BMD groups (p&lt;0.05). Women with low BMD
showed higher relative abundances of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides,
Barnesiella, Odoribacter, Sutterella, Butyricimonas, Coprobacter,
Angelakisiella, and Oscillibacter. Functional prediction revealed
differences in alanine, valine, leucine, and methionine-related
metabolic pathways. These findings were supported by lower serum
concentrations of valine, leucine, and methionine in the low BMD group
compared to the normal BMD group (p&lt;0.05).ConclusionThis study
provides evidence of the relationship between GM composition and AA
concentrations with changes in BMD. These findings highlight promising
areas for the development of potential therapeutic interventions</p>

stolonifera inhibits porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection by
disrupting nucleocapsid protein-p53 interaction</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute, highly contagious
intestinal disease caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV),
which has devastating effects on the global swine industry. Currently,
no effective therapeutic agents have been identified for treating PEDV
infections. Saxifraga stolonifera (S. stolonifera), valued in
traditional Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties,
remains poorly studied regarding its efficacy against PEDV. This study
demonstrated the dose-dependent inhibition of PEDV nucleocapsid
expression by S. stolonifera in vitro. S. stolonifera strongly inhibited
the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using the network
pharmacology, key components such as gallic acid, quercetin, coumarin,
and caffeic acid were identified. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
revealed that S. stolonifera mainly targeted pathways including p53,
MAPK, and TNF to exert anti-PEDV effects. S. stolonifera treatment
disrupted the interaction of PEDV N protein and p53. It also modulated
the p53-DREAM signaling pathway by reducing p53 and p21 protein levels,
while enhancing p130 (Ser672) phosphorylation, E2F4, and Cyclin A
protein expression levels. Molecular docking revealed stable hydrogen
bonding between the seven core components and the PEDV N protein, with
quercetin exhibiting the lowest binding energy. Amino acid sequence
analysis showed that quercetin and other components share conserved
binding sites with the PEDV N protein. These findings underscore the
potential of S. stolonifera as a natural antiviral agent against PEDV
infection.</p>

of phosphomotifs coupled to phosphoproteome and interactome unveils
potential human kinase substrate proteins in SARS-CoV-2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionViruses exploit host kinases to phosphorylate their
proteins, enabling viral replication and interference with host-cell
functions. Understanding phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 proteins
necessitates identifying viral phosphoproteins, their phosphosites, and
the host kinase–viral protein interactions critical for evading host
antiviral responses.MethodsEmploying the protein kinase substrate
sequence-preference motifs derived by Poll B G. et. al., 2024, we
performed kinase-substrate phosphomotif pattern analysis on the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identified major host kinases by analyzing
SARS-CoV-2 perturbed phosphoproteomes from various studies and cell
systems. These kinases were subjected to interactome analysis and
literature-based validation for the impact of kinase inhibitors on
infection. Further, conservation of viral phosphosites across SARS CoV-2
variants were also assessed.ResultsThe human kinome–substrate
phosphomotif analysis predicted 49 kinases capable of phosphorylating
639 phosphosites across 33 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. From these, 24 kinases
were also perturbed in SARS-CoV-2-infected phosphoproteomes. Literature
review identified seven kinases, including MAP2K1, whose inhibition may
reduce viral replication. MAP2K1 was found to target key viral
phosphosites, including N protein (S206, T198) and ORF9b (S50),
conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants. Docking analysis showed MAP2K1
forms stronger, closer interactions with N protein compared to SRPK1,
highlighting MAP2K1 as a potential host kinase for therapeutic targeting
in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Discussion and ConclusionsThis study presents a
framework for predicting human kinases of specific SARS-CoV-2 protein
phosphosites by integrating kinase specificity, virus–host interactions,
and post-translational modifications. MAP2K1 was identified as a key
host kinase, showing stronger interactions than SRPK1, and is proposed
as an antiviral drug target for repurposing in SARS-CoV-2
infections.</p>

papillomavirus infection and disease recurrence/persistence after
treatment for women of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
with coexisting vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCoexistent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and
vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) is problematic, posing
challenges for patient management. This study focused on the clinical
characteristics of coexistent CIN 2/3 and VaIN (all degrees), evaluating
the proclivity for disease recurrence/persistence at 6 months after
treatment.MethodsA retrospective case–control study of women treated for
coexistent CIN 2/3 and VaIN (CE group) was undertaken between January
2018 and December 2020. During the same period, women with CIN 2/3 only
were selected chronologically (1:2 ratio) for comparison (sCIN group). A
loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was the standard
treatment for CIN 2/3, performing electrofulguration of VaIN in tandem.
First follow-up visits at 6 months thereafter entailed testing for human
papillomavirus (HPV). Univariate and multivariate analyses served to
assess pertinent risk factors.ResultsThere were 91 CE group members,
each treated for coexistent CIN 2/3 and VaIN (VaIN 1, 35; VaIN 2/3, 56).
Age ≥50 years (OR = 3.362, 95% CI: 1.421–7.954) emerged as an
independent risk factor for coexistent disease. Positive margins and
persistent high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infection after treatment were more
common in the CE (vs. sCIN) group (p = 0.012 and p &lt; 0.001,
respectively), as was recurrent/persistent high-grade disease (17.6%
vs. 2.2%; p &lt; 0.001). In the CE group, persistent HR-HPV infection 6
months after treatment (OR = 21.320, 95% CI: 2.509–181.188) was the sole
independent risk factor for disease recurrence/persistence at 6
months.ConclusionsComprehensive vaginal wall examinations are warranted
for women with CIN 2/3, particularly those &gt;50 years old. Close
follow-up by HPV test is also indicated if CIN 2/3 and VaIN coexist,
given a heightened incidence of recurrent/persistent disease.</p>

with chronic kidney disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionRecent studies have underscored the role of interactions
between Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the gut microbiome (GM)
in mediating therapeutic effects. Jian-Pi-Yi-Shen Formula (JPYSF) has
shown efficacy in ameliorating chronic kidney disease (CKD) symptoms,
but its mechanisms via GM modulation remain unclear.MethodsIn this
study, 8-week-old rats were assigned to three groups after a two-week
acclimation: C (normal diet for six weeks), M (adenine diet for four
weeks then normal diet for two weeks), and T (same as M, with JPYSF
administered during the final three weeks). Fecal samples were collected
at three timepoints (T1: post-acclimation; T2: after three weeks on
respective diets; T3: after three weeks of JPYSF treatment) for
metagenomic sequencing. Serum creatinine (SCR) was measured at T2 and
T3. ResultsAt T2, adenine-fed rats showed elevated SCR (C:
28.4 ± 1.5 µmol/L; M: 189.6 ± 25.8µmol/L; T: 186.4 ± 32.5µmol/L;
p &lt; 0.001). By T3, SCR decreased more in T (86.0 ± 14.9µmol/L) than
in M (119.6 ± 16.3µmol/L; p = 0.012), with C remaining stable
(30.8 ± 4.4µmol/L). Adenine feeding induced significant GM shifts,
evidenced by increased Aitchison distance (p &lt; 0.01) and altered
co-abundance interaction groups (CIGs): CIG3, 6, 9, 10 increased; CIG1,
2, 4, 12 decreased (all p &lt; 0.05). After JPYSF treatment, only CIG4
significantly rebounded (T3 vs. M, p = 0.0079), and T3-T1 dissimilarity
was lower in T than M (p &lt; 0.05). SCR levels were significantly lower
in T than M after returning to a normal diet, suggesting a
renoprotective effect of JPYSF. Co-occurrence analysis linked SCR
positively with toxin-associated CIGs (CIG3, 6, 7, 9, 10) and pathways
(purine metabolism, toluene degradation), and negatively with
CIG4.DiscussionThese results demonstrate that JPYSF lowers SCR and
selectively modulates GM modules, particularly CIG4, which inversely
correlates with uremic toxin–producing pathways, suggesting improved
renal function and specific gut microbiota modulation in CKD rats.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Brucellosis is a recognized zoonotic disease caused by various
Brucella species with significant economic and animal welfare
ramifications worldwide. The spread of brucellosis from domestic
livestock and wild animals, as well as its emergence in new regions,
present novel epidemiological challenges. The consumption of
unpasteurized milk and dairy products from unsanitary farms in endemic
areas poses a serious risk to public health from brucellosis.
Determining the accurate prevalence of brucellosis, particularly in
regions with persistently high prevalence, basically requires careful
and frequent surveillance. Furthermore, transmission and detection of
the illness in non-endemic areas have become more complex due to global
human and animal migration as well as the trade in animal products. This
review presents an updated understanding of brucellosis, covering its
classification and taxonomy, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment
approaches, epidemiology, available control and prevention measures,
antimicrobial resistance and the role of metal uptake in bacterial
virulence. It highlights the consequences of brucellosis for global
health and underscores the need for continuous research, knowledge
sharing, and interdisciplinary cooperation for effective disease control
and prevention.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPeriprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a severe
complication following total joint arthroplasty, and the timeliness of
its diagnosis and treatment is crucial for patient recovery. Although
various biomarkers have been extensively evaluated and applied in
clinical practice, the diagnosis of PJI remains challenging. Therefore,
it is necessary to identify more precise biomarkers for the diagnosis of
PJI. This study aims to investigate the value of ratio-based biomarkers
using prealbumin (PA) for the diagnosis of PJI.MethodsThis study
compared the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (FIB), PA, CRP/PA (CPR), ESR/PA
(EPR), FIB/PA (FPR), and the combined ratio of CPR+EPR+FPR(CEF) in 180
patients with PJI and 105 patients with aseptic loosening (AL) who
presented at our department from January 2019 to December 2024. The
diagnostic efficacy of these markers in PJI diagnosis was assessed using
the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve.ResultsAmong these biomarkers, CPR has the highest AUC of
0.921 (95%CI 0.890-0.952), and it can distinguish PJI with a cut-off
value of 0.0366, a sensitivity of 76.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%. In
the diabetic subgroup, the combined biomarker CEF has an AUC of 0.951
for diagnosing PJI, with a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of
94.4%.ConclusionRatio-based markers based on PA show promise as valuable
new adjunctive diagnostic markers for PJI.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the upper
respiratory tract promotes disease progression and transmission, with
excessive inflammation contributing to severe lower respiratory tract
involvement. This study investigates the immunomodulatory effects of
Lactobacillus rhamnosus D3189 on viral kinetics and innate immune
responses in well-differentiated nasal epithelial cells
(WD-NECs).MethodsWD-NECs from healthy adult donors (N = 8) were cultured
in vitro, treated with L. rhamnosus D3189, and then infected with RSV
(strain RS4) 24 hours later. Viral replication and shedding were
assessed via RT-qPCR and plaque assays. Cytotoxicity and epithelial
integrity were evaluated using LDH release and transepithelial
electrical resistance (TEER). Inflammatory and antiviral responses were
investigated using multiplex immunoassays, AlphaLISA, and
ELISA.ResultsRSV infection induced robust viral replication and
shedding, disrupted epithelial barrier integrity, and triggered the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I/III interferons. L.
rhamnosus D3189 alone did not induce cytotoxicity or inflammation. While
it had no effect on viral replication, TEER, LDH release, or IFN-λ1/3
levels, D3189 significantly enhanced IFN-β production, reduced viral
shedding, and attenuated RSV-induced cytokine and chemokine
responses.DiscussionL. rhamnosus D3189 modulates the epithelial immune
response to RSV, reducing inflammation and viral shedding without
compromising epithelial integrity. These findings support its potential
as a novel strategy to limit RSV-associated infection and
transmission.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal
disease characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Chymase is a serine protease released by the mast cells and is highly
expressed in patients with UC. However, its role in disease pathogenesis
remains poorly understood. In mice, mast cell protease-4 (MCP-4) is
considered as the functional homolog of human chymase, sharing similar
enzymatic activity and biological roles.MethodsTo investigate the role
of MCP-4 in UC, we induced colitis in Mcpt-4-deficient (Mcpt-4∆Cre) and
littermate control (Mcpt-4fl/fl) mice using 2% dextran sulfate sodium
salt (DSS) for 8 days followed by 2 days of water. After sacrifice,
colon length was measured, and tissue samples were analyzed by histology
(H&amp;E and toluidine blue staining), qPCR, and protein assays. Colonic
contents were collected for microbiota and metabolomics
analysis.ResultsThe results show that the Mcpt-4-deficiency exacerbated
colitis, as reflected by the significantly greater weight loss, higher
histological scores, elevated levels of myeloperoxidase and most of
determined cytokines. Furthermore, the Mcpt-4∆Cre colitis mice displayed
a distinct shift in colonic microbiota composition, notably with
significantly increased abundance of bacteria (Akkermansia and
Turicibacter), associated with potentially worsened inflammation in
colitis models. In addition, metabolomic profiling revealed alterations
in colonic metabolites involved in key Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including NF-kappa B signaling, Th1 and Th2
cell differentiation.DiscussionThese findings reveal that the mouse
chymase MCPT-4 plays important roles in maintaining the intestinal
homeostasis during colitis, potentially through regulation of colonic
cytokines, microbial and metabolic networks.</p>

cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the regulation of pulmonary infections:
a systematic review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The lungs are constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and depend on
robust innate immune surveillance for protection. The cyclic GMP–AMP
synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling
pathway, a core component of the innate immune system, plays a pivotal
role in defending against respiratory infections caused by viruses,
bacteria, and mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to several chronic lung
diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Upon sensing
cytoplasmic DNA, cGAS activates the STING pathway, producing type I
interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive host immune
response. However, many pathogens have developed strategies to evade
detection or surpass cGAS-STING signaling. This systematic review
highlights the molecular mechanisms governing cGAS-STING activation, its
interaction with lung pathogens, and its potential as a therapeutic
agent in respiratory diseases.</p>

a high-throughput proteomics study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa face heightened
susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, with placental
sequestration driving adverse outcomes. The infection may lead to
pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) because of the sequestration of
Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placental
intervillous space. Although there are several tools for diagnosing
malaria infection during pregnancy, including blood smear microscopic
examination, rapid diagnostic tests, and PCR, there are no tools for
detecting placental infection and, by extension, any dysfunction
associated with PAM. Thus, PAM, specifically placental infection, can
only be confirmed via postnatal placental histopathology. Therefore,
there is an urgent need for specific plasma biomarkers of
PAM.MethodsHere, we used the high throughput proximity extension assay
to screen plasma from malaria-exposed pregnant women for differentially
expressed proteins that may serve as candidate biomarkers of Plasmodium
falciparum infection during pregnancy, with future potential to inform
diagnosis of PAM or adverse malaria outcomes. Such biomarkers may also
elucidate the pathophysiology of PAM.ResultsUsing proximity extension
assay (PEA), we identified elevated IgG Fc receptor IIb (FCGR2B) and
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in malaria-positive pregnancies, while neurturin
(NRTN) and IL-20 were downregulated.DiscussionIL-20 emerged as a top
candidate biomarker, warranting validation in large cohorts with
placental histopathology.</p>

<p>ObjectiveTo explore the role of free provision of disinfectant wipes
combined with bundle management in preventing Multi-Drug Resistant
Organism (MDRO) infections in the Respiratory and Intensive Care Unit
(RICU).MethodsThis study included patients admitted to the RICU between
January 2022 and June 2023 (control group) and from July 2023 to June
2024 (intervention group), all of whom met the inclusion criteria. The
control group received standard bundle management measures, while the
intervention group received unlimited use of disinfectant wipes combined
with bundle management. The MDRO discovery rates and hospital-acquired
infection incidence rates were compared between the two groups to assess
the impact of free disinfectant wipe provision on MDRO infection
prevention in the RICU.ResultsThere were no significant differences
between the two groups in terms of patient age and baseline
characteristics, except for Sex and the proportion of patients with
chronic respiratory diseases. Notably, the MDRO discovery rate, MDRO
infection rate, and hospital-acquired infection incidence were all
significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control
group (MDRO discovery rate: 35.2% vs 45.9%, P&lt;0.001; MDRO infection
rate: 0.8% vs 3.5%, P = 0.003; hospital-acquired infection rate: 1.5% vs
3.52%, P=0.030). However, the intervention group had more percentage of
patients receiving mechanical ventilation and longer ICU stay (P &lt;
0.05). Furthermore, in-hospital mortality was lower in the intervention
group (19.5% vs 13.5%, P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionThe combined intervention
of unlimited use of disinfectant wipes with bundle management
significantly reduced MDRO hospital-acquired infection rates and
in-hospital mortality in the RICU, demonstrating its effectiveness in
infection prevention.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionClostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses a
significant clinical burden due to its high recurrence rate and
life-threatening complications. While gut dysbiosis is central to CDI
pathogenesis, mechanisms underlying microbiota-mediated host defense
remain underexplored.MethodsThis study integrated summary-data-based
Mendelian randomization (SMR) of cis-expression quantitative trait loci
(cis-eQTLs) from blood, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon tissues with
CDI genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to identify host genes
influencing CDI susceptibility. Bayesian co-localization was employed to
validate relationships. Then a germ-free (GF) mice model colonized with
Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) was used to investigate LA-mediated
regulation of possible gene expression and phenotypic changes in the
host.ResultsSMR analysis identified 14 genes associated with CDI risk,
primarily clustered in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
region. Notably, THOC5 exhibited robust associations (PSMR &lt; 0.05 in
all tissues) and co-localization evidence (posterior probability =
82.6%). In GF mice, LA colonization significantly upregulated colonic
Thoc5 expression in two independent experiments (fold change =
5.19/5.00, P = 0.034/0.031). Subsequent immunofluorescence experiments
revealed that LA colonisation enhanced macrophage activation in the
colonic tissue.DiscussionThese findings reveal key host genes,
particularly THOC5, that influence susceptibility to CDI, providing new
targets for future prevention and treatment research. Additionally, the
study suggests a potential mechanism by which host intestinal LA
protects against CDI, highlighting the interaction between probiotics
and host transcriptional networks in CDI resistance. These insights
offer valuable directions for further investigation.</p>

and validation of a multidimensional predictive model for 28-day
mortality in ICU patients with bloodstream infections: a cohort
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of sepsis
and death in intensive care unit (ICU). Traditional severity scores,
including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Acute
Physiology Score III (APSIII), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II
(SAPS II), exhibit limitations in effectively predicting mortality among
BSI patients, primarily due to their reliance on a narrow range of
clinical variables. This study aimed to develop and validate a
comprehensive nomogram model for 28-day all-cause mortality prediction
in BSI patients.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using
data from 3,615 patients with positive blood cultures from the MIMIC-IV
database, divided into training (n=2,532) and validation (n=1,083)
cohorts. Through a two-step variable selection process combining LASSO
regression and Boruta algorithm, we identified 12 predictive variables
from 58 initial clinical parameters. The model’s performance was
evaluated using AUROC, net reclassification improvement (NRI),
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis
(DCA).ResultsThe nomogram demonstrated superior discrimination (AUROC:
0.760 vs. 0.671, P&lt;0.001 for SOFA; 0.760 vs. 0.705, P&lt;0.001 for
APSIII; 0.760 vs. 0.707, P&lt;0.001 for SAPS II) in the training cohort,
with consistent performance in the validation cohort (AUROC: 0.742). Key
predictors identified in our model included the need for mechanical
ventilation, the presence of malignancy, platelet count, and scores on
the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The model showed significant improvements
in NRI and IDI, with consistent net benefit across a wide range of
threshold probabilities in DCA.ConclusionsThis study developed and
validated a predictive model for 28-day mortality in BSI patients that
demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional severity
scores. By integrating clinical, laboratory, and treatment-related
variables, the model provides a more comprehensive approach to risk
stratification. These findings highlight its potential for improving
early identification of high-risk patients and guiding clinical
decision-making, though further prospective validation is needed to
confirm its generalizability.</p>

microbiome-biophysical association: a first integrative approach to
classifying Korean skin types and aging groups</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe field of human microbiome research is rapidly
expanding beyond the gut and into the facial skin care industry.
However, there is still no established criterion to define the objective
relationship between the microbiome and clinical trials for developing
personalized skin solutions that consider individual
diversity.ObjectivesIn this study, we conducted an integrated analysis
of skin measurements, clinical Baumann skin type indicator (BSTI)
surveys, and the skin microbiome of 950 Korean subjects to examine the
ideal skin microbiome-biophysical associations.MethodsBy utilizing four
skin biophysical parameters, we identified four distinct Korean Skin
Cutotypes (KSCs) and categorized the subjects into three aging groups:
the Young (under 34 years old), the Aging I group (35-50), and the Old
group (over 51). To unravel the intricate connection between the skin’s
microbiome and KSC types, we conducted DivCom clustering
analysis.ResultsThis endeavor successfully classified 726 out of 740
female skin microbiomes into three subclusters: DC1-sub1, DC1-sub2, and
DC2 with 15 core genera. To further amplify our findings, we harnessed
the potent capabilities of the CatBoost boosting algorithm and achieved
a reliable framework for predicting skin types based on microbial
composition with an impressive average accuracy of 0.96 AUC value. Our
study conclusively demonstrated that these 15 core genera could serve as
objective indicators, differentiating the microbial composition among
the aging groups.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the
complex relationship between the skin microbiome and biophysical
properties, and the findings provide a promising approach to advance the
field of skincare, cosmetics, and broader microbial research.</p>

characterization and antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm-forming
Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii from patients with erythema
migrans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBorrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading
causes of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in Europe. Persistent LB forms may
involve biofilms, potentially contributing to antibiotic
tolerance.MethodsWhole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted on 7 B.
afzelii and 5 B. garinii isolates from erythema migrans skin biopsies.
Biofilms were analyzed for extracellular DNA (eDNA) content and biomass.
A phenol red metabolic assay assessed the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC)
of amoxicillin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and
doxycycline.ResultsPhylogenetic analysis revealed B. afzelii and B.
garinii formed distinct clades, while B. burgdorferi B31 clustered
separately. Core genome analysis showed 38.9% of genes were shared
between B. afzelii and B. garinii, decreasing to 26.1% with B.
burgdorferi. The cloud genome expanded from 34.4% to 53.4% with the
addition of B. burgdorferi. No antimicrobial resistance genes were
detected. Surface adhesion gene profiles exhibited significant variation
across species, suggesting potential functional differences in host
adaptation. B. afzelii and B. garinii species exhibited biofilms, with
biomass correlating significantly with eDNA production. MIC values were
0.25 μg/mL (amoxicillin, ceftriaxone), 0.125 μg/mL (azithromycin), and
0.5 μg/mL (doxycycline), with no significant interspecies differences.
However, MBIC values were considerably higher: 2 μg/mL (amoxicillin,
azithromycin), 16 μg/mL (ceftriaxone), and 32 μg/mL
(doxycycline).ConclusionsBiofilms in B. afzelii and B. garinii
significantly reduce antibiotic efficacy, particularly ceftriaxone and
doxycycline. These in vitro findings highlight the need for targeted
therapeutic strategies and suggest biofilms may impact treatment
outcomes in LB.</p>

potential links between gut microbiome, clinical parameters, and
mortality in long-living male patients receiving multi-drug therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and aimsMultimorbidity and polypharmacy are common in
long-living patients and have been linked to alterations in gut
microbiota. However, the prognostic relevance of these microbiota
changes remains unclear in this population. We hypothesized that
clinical parameters and gut microbial profiles are associated with
survival outcomes. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the
relationships between intestinal microbiota, clinical variables, and
18-month mortality in long-living male patients undergoing multi-drug
therapy.Methods33 long-living male adults (mean age 94 ± 4 years) were
enrolled. Upon admission, clinical parameters and stool samples were
collected. The composition of intestinal microbiome was examined using
16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Subsequently, the patients were
categorized into death and no-death groups based on their survival
status after 18 months. Risk factors associated with 18-month mortality
in patients were evaluated.ResultsThe 18-month mortality rate was 48.5%.
In this exploratory analysis, higher CIRS-G scores and creatinine levels
were independently associated with mortality (HR: 1.323 and 1.007,
respectively). CIRS-G had high prognostic value (AUC = 0.967). IL-6
levels and renal/hepatic/pancreatic comorbidities were also elevated in
the death group. Notably, Erysipelatoclostridium was enriched in
survivors and Sutterella in non-survivors, with correlations to clinical
parameters.ConclusionsCIRS-G scores and serum creatinine levels
demonstrated potential predictability for prognostic value in
forecasting mortality among long-living male patients. Moreover, a
potential association between CIRS-G score and intestinal microbiome was
observed. These results underscore the intricate impact of comorbidities
and polypharmacy on intestinal microbiome composition and clinical
consequences. Clinically, the CIRS-G score could serve as a valuable
tool for identifying high-risk elderly patients who may benefit from
closer monitoring and individualized interventions. However, the small
sample size, monocentric design, and potential confounders limit
generalizability. These findings support further validation in larger
cohorts.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Endometriosis is widely recognized as a chronic, inflammatory, and
heterogeneous condition that can manifest in various anatomical
locations within females. It is marked by estrogen-driven cycles of
bleeding, cell proliferation, and fibrosis involving ectopic endometrial
glands and stroma cells located outside the uterus. The limited
understanding of its etiology and complex pathogenesis has created
obstacles in achieving early diagnosis and developing effective
treatments with minimal side effects. Consequently, endometriosis
requires more in-depth research to unravel its pathogenesis. The gut
microbiota, a key player in chronic diseases, significantly influences
bodily metabolism and immune regulation. Emerging evidence links the gut
microbiota to inflammation, estrogen metabolism, and immune
responses—key factors in the onset and progression of endometriosis.
This review examines the various mechanisms through which endometriosis
and the gut microbiota interact, aiming to inspire new strategies for
preventing and early treating endometriosis.</p>

impact of Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication therapies on gut
microbiota: a systematic review of microbial dysbiosis and its
implications in gastric carcinogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori is a globally prevalent bacterium
associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, including peptic
ulcers and gastric cancer. Growing interest has emerged in understanding
how H. pylori affects gut microbiota and whether eradication therapies
impact microbial balance, potentially influencing disease outcomes,
including cancer progression.MethodsA systematic review was conducted
across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using predefined
keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Quality assessment
was performed using the MINORS and Jadad scales.ResultsA total of 45
studies met the inclusion criteria, which evaluated microbial changes in
H. pylori -infected individuals before and after eradication therapies.
H. pylori infection resulted in significant alterations in gut and
gastric microbiota, with a notable increase in inflammation-associated
bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Streptococcus. In gastric cancer
patients, microbial diversity was reduced, with decreased levels of
Bifidobacterium and Actinobacteria, and increased levels of Prevotella
and Dialister, both associated with pro-inflammatory environments.
Eradication therapies generally worsened dysbiosis initially, but
probiotic supplementation promoted faster recovery of beneficial
bacteria, improving microbial balance and reducing cancer-related
dysbiosis.ConclusionH. pylori infection disrupts the gut microbiota,
with eradication therapies further altering microbial composition. The
restoration of microbial diversity is improved by probiotic
supplementation. Understanding the long-term impacts of these therapies
on gut health is essential for refining treatment strategies,
particularly in preventing H. pylori -associated diseases like gastric
cancer.</p>

id="innate-immune-role-of-il-6-in-influenza-a-virus-pathogenesis">Innate
immune role of IL-6 in influenza a virus pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine, is induced by infection
of influenza A virus (IAV), where it plays a pivotal role in immune
defense and the regulation of inflammation. IAV induces IL-6
transcription upon recognition by pattern recognition receptors, which
activate downstream signaling cascades, leading to the activation of
transcription factors. Activated transcription factors subsequently
regulate the expression of IL-6 in innate immune cells, such as
macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. IL-6 contributes to
antiviral immunity by promoting the recruitment of immune cells to sites
of infection and amplifying the inflammatory response. While optimal
IL-6 production is essential for effective anti-IAV immunity, excessive
IL-6 production can contribute to a dysregulated immune response,
leading to a cytokine storm. In this context, IL-6 signaling, in
coordination with other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and
IL-1β, not only enhances its own production but can also serve as a key
mediator of inflammation. This cascade can result in exaggerated immune
responses, causing tissue damage and potentially leading to severe
outcomes, including organ failure and death. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying cytokine storms presents important therapeutic
opportunities. However, the precise pathways responsible for excessive
IL-6 production and its dysregulation during IAV infection is not fully
understood. This review explores the reported mechanisms regulating IL-6
induction in response to IAV and its innate immune role in IAV
pathogenesis, highlighting existing research gaps in understanding
IAV-induced IL-6 production and its impact on immune modulation. A
deeper understanding of IAV-induced IL-6 production and signaling could
inform the development of targeted therapies to more effectively manage
influenza.</p>

the distinctive characteristics of gut microbiota across different horse
breeds and ages using metataxonomics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGut microbiota exerts a pivotal function in host nutrient
metabolism and maturation of the mucosal immunity. Analyzing the
reciprocal interaction between horses and gut microbiota constitutes a
crucial aspect of scientific feeding practices. This study aims to
investigate the differences in gut microbiota among Hequ horses,
Mongolian horses, and Thoroughbred horses, as well as between
Thoroughbred horses at two age stages.Methods and resultsPaired-end
sequencing with a read length of 2×250 bp targeting the V3-V4 region of
the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples was carried out. Subsequently,
differences in the diversity, composition, and metabolic pathways of the
gut microbiota among the groups were analyzed. The results showed that:
(1) Horse breeds were associated with variations in the gut microbiota.
Microbial diversity, the proportion of commensal bacteria from Bacillota
and Bacteroidota, and bacterial communities involved in dietary fiber
metabolisms were significantly higher in the gut of the Hequ horses than
in the gut of the Mongolian and Thoroughbred horses. The highest
Bacillota to Bacteroidota (B/B) ratio and enrichment of bacterial
communities involved in the metabolism of bile acids, lipids, and amino
acids in the gut of the Mongolian horses resulted in significantly
higher lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism than in the other two
breeds. The bacterial communities enriched in the gut of Thoroughbred
horses were primarily involved in carbohydrate metabolism, but the level
of energy metabolism was significantly lower than in Hequ horses. (2)
The results also showed an association between age and gut microbiota of
Thoroughbred horses. The alpha diversity, B/B ratio, and 83.33% of
metabolic pathways did not differ significantly between younger and
older Thoroughbred horses. However, there were significant differences
between the two age groups in beta diversity, composition of glycolytic
bacteria, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and energy metabolism of
gut microbiota.ConclusionsCollectively, these results point to an
association between the breed of horses or the age of Thoroughbred
horses with variations in gut microbiota. The current findings will
serve as a reference for improving feeding strategies for horses.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntibiotic resistance is a pressing global challenge,
complicating the treatment of infectious diseases caused by
multidrug-resistant microorganism. For centuries, medicinal plants have
been a cornerstone of natural remedies, offering bioactive compounds
with therapeutic potential.MethodsThe study investigate the
phytochemical screening and antibacterial efficay of Carica papaya leaf
extract, focusing on its impact against three Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens i.e., Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi, are major contributors to gastrointestinal
infections worldwide, often leading to severe inflammation and chronic
health complications. ResultsThe phytochemical screening revealed the
presence of phenols and flavonoids, which are key contributors to the
extract’s biological activity. GC-MC analysis identified 27 bioactive
compounds, with phytol emerging as a prominent constituent, detected at
a peak retention time of 18.712 minutes. Antibacterial assays
demonstrated significant efficacy, with inhibitory zones ranging from 10
to 20 mm against the tested pathogens. Molecular docking further
highlighted phytol’s strong binding affinities to crucial bacterial
proteins, including DNA gyrase (E. coli), Vacuolating cytotoxin A (H.
pylori) from, and Dihydrofolate reductase (Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhi). Notably, phytol exhibited the highest binding energy (-6.64
kcal/mol) with DHFR, indicating a robust interaction that underscores
its potential as a targeted antibacterial agent against Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi.DiscussionThese findings position phytol as a
promising lead compound for developing novel antibacterial therapies.
Its strong activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens suggests
potential for further exploration, though additional research is needed
to assess its role in resistance modulation or prevention.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), including postoperative
delirium, preoperatively cognitive impairment, postoperative cognitive
dysfunction, and delayed neurocognitive recovery, represent common
complications following anesthesia and surgery, especially in the
elderly. As the global population ages, PND is receiving increasing
attention due to its prolonged the hospitalization, reduced quality of
life and elevated mortality rate. A growing body of evidence has been
suggested that the gut-brain axis, a communication system between the
gut microbiota and the neuroinflammation, plays a critical role in the
development and progression of cognitive impairment. Perioperative
interventions, including anesthesia, surgical stress, result in gut
microbiota dysbiosis and subsequently trigger neuroinflammation.
Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanistic
associations between the gut microbiota and the neuroinflammation during
PND progression. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge on the
mechanistic interplay between gut microbiota dysbiosis and
neuroinflammation in PND pathogenesis, which provide reasonable and
novel therapeutic approaches targeting the gut-brain axis for PND.</p>
