microbiome characteristics of women with hypothyroidism during early
pregnancy detected by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun
metagenomic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the correlation between
microbiota dysbiosis and hypothyroidism in early pregnancy by 16S rRNA
amplicon sequencing combined with metagenomic sequencing.MethodsSixty
pregnant women (30 with hypothyroidism and 30 normal controls) were
recruited for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and 6 patients from each
group were randomly selected for metagenomic sequencing to assess the
gut microbiome profile.ResultsThe 16S rRNA results showed that
beta-diversity in the hypothyroidism group was decreased. The relative
abundances of the Prevotella and Paraprevotella genera increased in the
hypothyroidism group, and Blautia predominated in the controls. The
metagenomics results revealed that Prevotella_stercorea_CAG_629,
Prevotella_hominis, Prevotella_sp_AM34_19LB, etc. were enriched in the
hypothyroidism group at the species level. Functional analysis revealed
that the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate synthase pdxT subunit module was
decreased, and the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) transporter and
phospholipase/carboxylesterase modules were strongly enriched in the
hypothyroidism group. Hypothyroidism patients had increased C-reactive
protein (CRP), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α levels. The pyridoxal 5’-phosphate synthase pdxT subunit,
the SCFA transporter, and the phospholipase/carboxylesterase module were
associated with different Prevotella species.ConclusionIn early
pregnancy, women with hypothyroidism exhibit microbiota dysbiosis, and
Prevotella may affect the metabolism of glutamate, SCFA, and
phospholipases, which could be involved in the development of
hypothyroidism during pregnancy.</p>

respiratory tract microbiome and lung cancer risk prediction in patients
with diffuse lung parenchymal lesions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveIn clinical practice, imaging manifestations of diffuse lung
parenchymal lesions are common and indicative of various diseases,
making differential diagnosis difficult. Some of these lesions are
eventually diagnosed as lung cancer.MethodsBecause respiratory
microorganisms play an important role in lung cancer development, we
searched for microbial markers that could predict the risk of lung
cancer by retrospectively analyzing the lower respiratory tract (LRT)
microbiome of 158 patients who were hospitalized in the First Affiliated
Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (March 2021–March 2023) with
diffuse lung parenchymal lesions. The final diagnosis was lung cancer in
21 cases, lung infection in 93 cases, and other conditions (other than
malignancy and infections) in 44 cases. The patient’s clinical
characteristics and the results of metagenomic next-generation
sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were
analyzed.ResultsBody mass index (BMI) and LRT microbial diversity
(Shannon, Simpson, species richness, and Choa1 index) were significantly
lower (P&lt; 0.001, respectively) and Lactobacillus acidophilus relative
abundance in the LRT was significantly higher (P&lt; 0.001) in patients
with lung cancer. The relative abundance of L. acidophilus in BALF
combined with BMI was a good predictor of lung cancer risk (area under
the curve = 0.985, accuracy = 98.46%, sensitivity = 95.24%, and
specificity = 100.00%; P&lt; 0.001).ConclusionOur study showed that an
imbalance in the component ratio of the microbial community, diminished
microbial diversity, and the presence of specific microbial markers in
the LRT predicted lung cancer risk in patients with imaging
manifestations of diffuse lung parenchymal lesions.</p>

and genetic polymorphism analysis of rodents infected with Echinococcus
in Ili Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAlveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a life-threatening
disease in humans caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus
multilocularis. Domestic animals, dogs, foxes, and small mammals
constitute the circular chain of AE. To evaluate the infection,
distribution, and genetic polymorphism of AE in the Ili Prefecture
(Nilka, Xinyuan and Zhaosu), we conducted this survey.MethodsIn June and
July 2018, 267 small mammals were captured using water-infusion and
mousetrap methods. Combined pathogenic and molecular biological methods
were used to observe the histopathology of Echinococcus carried by
rodents, amplify the mitochondrial nad1 gene of the pathogen, and
investigate the genotype and haplotype diversity of Echinococcus in
rodents in Ili Prefecture.ResultsMorphological identification revealed
that these captured small mammals belonged to three species, with
Microtus gregalis being the dominant species (183/267). Pathological and
molecular biological results confirmed that E. multilocularis was the
pathogen of echinococcosis in small mammals, with an infection rate of
15.73% (42/267). Among the three areas sampled, the highest infection
rate of rodents was 25.45% (14/55) in Nilka County. However, there was
no significant difference in the infection rates between regions (χ2 =
5.119, p &gt; 0.05). Of the three captured rodent species, M. gregalis
had the highest infection rate of 17.49% (32/183), but there was no
significant difference in infection rates between the rodent species (χ2
= 1.364, p &gt; 0.05). Phylogenetic analyses showed that the nad1 gene
sequences obtained in this study clustered in the same clade as isolates
from China. These isolates contained 21 haplotypes (Hap_1-21); Hap_2 was
the most common haplotype (9/42). Furthermore, haplotype diversity
(0.925 ± 0.027) and nucleotide diversity (0.01139 ± 0.00119) were higher
in the Ili Prefecture than in other regions, indicating that population
differentiation was high. Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests were negative (p
&gt; 0.10), indicating that the population had expanded. The low
fixation index (Fst) ranged from 0.00000 to 0.16945, indicating that the
degree of genetic differentiation was different among different
populations.DiscussionIn summary, Ili Prefecture is a high incidence
area of AE, and Microtus spp. may play an important role in the
transmission of AE in this area. The results of this study provide basic
data for further study of the molecular epidemiology, genetic
differences, and control of E. multilocularis in the Ili Prefecture,
Xinjiang.</p>

in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in non-neutropenic patients
with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic
value of IL-17 detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
plasma samples from nonneutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis.MethodsWe retrospectively collected data on
non-neutropenic patients who were suspected to have IPA admitted to the
Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between March 2020 to
January 2023. IL-17 and GM were measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays.ResultsA total of 281 patients were enrolled in
this study, of which 62 had proven or probable IPA and the remaining 219
patients were controls. The plasma and BALF IL-17 levels were
significantly higher in the IPA group compared with the control group.
The plasma GM, plasma IL17, BALF GM, and BALF IL17 assays had
sensitivities of 56.5%, 72.6%, 68.7%, and 81.2%, respectively, and
specificities of 87.7%, 69.4%, 91.9%, and 72.6%, respectively. The
sensitivity of IL17 in plasma and BALF was higher than that of GM.
Plasma GM in combination with IL-17 increases the sensitivity but does
not decrease the diagnostic specificity of GM testing. The diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of BALF GM combined with IL-17 for IPA in
non-neutropenic patients were greater than 80% and there was a
significant increase in sensitivity compared with BALF
GM.ConclusionsPlasma and BALF IL-17 levels were significantly higher in
non-neutropenic patients with IPA. The sensitivity of plasma and BLAF
IL-17 for diagnosing IPA in non-neutropenic patients was superior to
that of GM. Combined detection of lavage fluid GM and IL17 significantly
improves the diagnosis of IPA in non-neutropenic patients. The combined
detection of GM and IL-17 in plasma also contributes to the diagnosis of
IPA in patients who cannot tolerate invasive procedures.</p>

on the effects of intestinal flora on gouty arthritis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Gouty arthritis (GA), a metabolic and immunologic disease, primarily
affects joints. Dysbiosis of intestinal flora is an important cause of
GA. The metabolic disorders of intestinal flora leading to GA and immune
disorders might play an important role in patients with hyperuricemia
and established GA. However, the exact mechanisms, through which the
dysbiosis of intestinal flora causes the development of GA, are not
fully understood yet. Moreover, several therapies commonly used to treat
GA might alter the intestinal flora, suggesting that modulation of the
intestinal flora might help prevent or treat GA. Therefore, a better
understanding of the changes in the intestinal flora of GA patients
might facilitate the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches. The current review article discusses the effects of
intestinal flora dysbiosis on the pathogenesis of GA and the
cross-regulatory effects between gut flora and drugs for treating GA.
This article also highlights the modulatory effects of gut flora by
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to lower uric acid levels and relieve
joint pain as well as provides a summary and outlook, which might help
guide future research efforts.</p>

high functional cure rate was induced by pegylated interferon alpha-2b
treatment in postpartum hepatitis B e antigen-negative women with
chronic hepatitis B virus infection: an exploratory study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and aimsLimited data have been reported on achieving
functional cure using pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) alpha-2b treatment
for postpartum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative women with chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study was to assess the
effectiveness and safety of Peg-IFN alpha-2b in HBV postpartum women
without HBeAg and identify factors linked to the functional
cure.MethodsA total of 150 HBeAg-negative postpartum women were
retrospectively recruited.47 patients received Peg-IFN alpha-2b
[Peg-IFN(+) group] and 103 patients did not [Peg-IFN(-) group].
Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the baseline
imbalance between the two groups. The patients were followed for at
least 48 weeks. The primary endpoints were hepatitis B surface
antigen(HBsAg) loss and HBsAg seroconversion at 48 weeks. Logistic
regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with HBsAg
loss at 48 weeks.ResultsAt week 48,the HBsAg loss and seroconversion
rate in Peg-IFN(+) group were 51.06%(24/47) and 40.43%(19/47),
respectively. Even after PSM, Peg-IFN(+) group still showed higher HBsAg
loss rate (50.00% vs 7.14%,p&lt;0.001) and higher HBsAg seroconversion
rate (38.10% vs 2.38%,p&lt;0.001). Baseline HBsAg levels (Odds Ratio
[OR]: 0.051, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.003-0.273, P=0.010), HBsAg
at week 24 (OR:0.214, 95%CI:0.033-0.616, P=0.022), HBsAg decline at week
24 (OR:4.682, 95%CI: 1.624-30.198, P=0.022) and postpartum flare
(OR:21.181, 95%CI:1.872-633.801, P=0.030) were significantly associated
with HBsAg loss at week 48 after Peg-IFN alpha-2b therapy. Furthermore,
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that the use of
baseline HBsAg&lt;182 IU/mL, HBsAg at week24 &lt; 4 IU/mL and HBsAg
decline at week24&gt;12IU/mL were good predictors of HBsAg loss. No
serious adverse events were reported.ConclusionPeg-IFN alpha-2b
treatment could achieve a high rate of HBsAg loss and seroconversion in
HBeAg-negative postpartum women with reliable safety, particularly for
patients experience postpartum flare and have low baseline HBsAg
levels.</p>

id="real-time-fluorescent-multiple-cross-displacement-amplification-for-rapid-and-sensitive-mycoplasma-pneumoniae-detection">Real-time
fluorescent multiple cross displacement amplification for rapid and
sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a significant pathogen responsible for
community-acquired pneumonia, predominantly affecting children and
adolescents. Here, we devised a rapid method for M. pneumoniae that
combined multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) with real-time
fluorescence technology. A set of ten primers, which were specifically
designed for M. pneumoniae detection, were employed in a real-time
fluorescence MCDA reaction. Of these, one primer incorporated a
restriction endonuclease recognition sequence, a fluorophore, and a
quencher, facilitating real-time fluorescence detection. The real-time
(RT)-MCDA reactions were monitored in a simple real-time fluorescence
instrument and conducted under optimised conditions (64°C for 40 min).
The detection limit of the M. pneumoniae RT-MCDA assay for genomic DNA
extracted from M. pneumoniae culture was down to 43 fg/µl. This assay
accurately identified M. pneumoniae strains without cross-reacting with
other bacteria. To validate its practical application, we tested the M.
pneumoniae RT-MCDA assay using genomic DNA extracted from clinical
samples. The assay’s detection capability proved comparable with
real-time PCR, MCDA-based biosensor detection, and visual inspection
under blue light. The entire process, including rapid DNA extraction and
real-time MCDA detection, was completed within 1 h. Overall, the M.
pneumoniae RT-MCDA assay reported here is a simple and effective
diagnostic tool for rapid M. pneumoniae detection, which holds
significant potential for point-of-care testing and in resource-limited
regions.</p>

LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b detection platform</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is the major cause of
respiratory infections that threaten the health of children and
adolescents worldwide. Therefore, an early, simple, and accurate
detection approach for MP is critical to prevent outbreaks of MP-induced
community-acquired pneumonia.MethodsHere, we explored a simple and
accurate method for MP identification that combines loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) with the CRISPR/Cas12b assay in a
one-pot reaction.ResultsIn the current study, the whole reaction was
completed within 1 h at a constant temperature of 57°C. The limit of
detection of this assay was 33.7 copies per reaction. The specificity of
the LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b method was 100%, without any cross-reactivity
with other pathogens. Overall, 272 clinical samples were used to
evaluate the clinical performance of LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b. Compared with
the gold standard results from real-time PCR, the present method
provided a sensitivity of 88.11% (126/143), specificity of 100%
(129/129), and consistency of 93.75% (255/272).DiscussionTaken together,
our preliminary results illustrate that the LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b method is
a simple and reliable tool for MP diagnosis that can be performed in
resource-limited regions.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGut microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and
development of sepsis. However, the causal effects between the gut
microbiota and sepsis, and whether circulating inflammatory proteins act
as mediators, remain unclear.MethodsGut microbiota, circulating
inflammatory proteins, and four sepsis-related outcomes were identified
from large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) summary data.
Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) was the primary statistical method.
Additionally, we investigated whether circulating inflammatory proteins
play a mediating role in the pathway from gut microbiota to the four
sepsis-related outcomes.ResultsThere were 14 positive and 15 negative
causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and four
sepsis-related outcomes. Additionally, eight positive and four negative
causal effects were observed between circulating inflammatory proteins
and the four sepsis-related outcomes. Circulating inflammatory proteins
do not act as mediators.ConclusionsGut microbiota and circulating
inflammatory proteins were causally associated with the four
sepsis-related outcomes. However, circulating inflammatory proteins did
not appear to mediate the pathway from gut microbiota to the four
sepsis-related outcomes.</p>

factors related to low-level viraemia in chronic hepatitis B patients
receiving entecavir treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAbout 20% of on-treatment patients with chronic hepatitis B
(CHB) experienced low-level viraemia (LLV), which is associated with
persistent low-grade inflammation, fibrosis progression, and increased
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the high-risk
factors related to LLV.MethodsIn this retrospective study, patients
receiving entecavir (ETV) treatment from January 2018 to January 2023
were enrolled, and were divided into a LLV (HBV DNA 20-2000 IU/mL)
cohort and a complete virological response (CVR) (HBV DNA &lt; 20 IU/mL)
cohort according to the virological response at week 48 posttreatment.
Treatment baseline characteristics were retrieved from electronic
medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was
performed.ResultsTotally, 1653 patients were enrolled, male patients
accounted for 73.0%; the median age was 44 years; the mean HBV DNA level
was 5.9 Log10 IU/ml. Among them, 472 (28.6%) experienced LLV.
Multivariate analysis showed that HBeAg positivity (OR = 2.650, 95% CI:
2.000-3.511, p &lt; 0.001), HBV DNA ≥ 6.0 Log10 IU/mL (OR = 1.370, 95%

3.410-5.866, p &lt; 0.001), cirrhosis (OR = 1.650, 95% CI: 1.234-2.207,
P = 0.001), LSM ≥ 13.0 kPa (OR = 1.644, 95% CI: 1.203-2.246, p = 0.002),
and PLT &lt; 100×109/L (OR = 1.450, 95% CI: 1.094-1.922, p = 0.010) at
baseline were related to the development of LLV.ConclusionsHigh HBV
DNA/HBsAg quantification/LSM, low PLT, HBeAg positivity, and liver
cirrhosis were high-risk factors associated with LLV in patients
receiving entecavir treatment.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPsoriasis is one of the most common autoimmune skin
diseases. Increasing evidence shows that alterations in the diversity
and function of microbiota can participate in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis through various pathways and mechanisms.ObjectiveTo review the
connection between microbial changes and psoriasis, how
microbial-targeted therapy can be used to treat psoriasis, as well as
the potential of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota
transplantation, diet, and Traditional Chinese Medicine as supplementary
and adjunctive therapies.MethodsLiterature related to the relationship
between psoriasis and gut microbiota was searched in PubMed and
CNKI.ResultsAdjunct therapies such as dietary interventions, traditional
Chinese medicine, and probiotics can enhance gut microbiota abundance
and diversity in patients with psoriasis. These therapies stimulate
immune mediators including IL-23, IL-17, IL-22, and modulate gamma
interferon (IFN-γ) along with the NF-kB pathway, thereby suppressing the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating systemic
inflammatory conditions.ConclusionThis article discusses the direction
of future research and clinical treatment of psoriasis from the
perspective of intestinal microbiota and the mechanism of traditional
Chinese medicine, so as to provide clinicians with more comprehensive
diagnosis and treatment options and bring greater hope to patients with
psoriasis.</p>

<p>IntroductionCandida species, opportunistic yeast, are the second most
common cause of female vulvovaginal candidiasis. This study aimed to
evaluate the antifungal susceptibility profile of the
isolated Candida species in pregnant women in Hajjah governorate,
Yemen.MethodsA hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among
396 pregnant women attending Authority AL-Gumhorri Hospital Hajjah
between February and July 2023. Vaginal swabs were collected,
and Candida species were isolated and identified based on the standard
laboratory method. Furthermore, the antifungal drug susceptibility
of Candida species was determined by the Kirby-Bauer technique.Results
and discussionThe prevalence of vaginal Candida infection among pregnant
women was 61.4%. Candida albicans was the most predominant species
(59.26%), followed by Candida krusei(13.58%), Candida Tropicalis
(11.12%), Candida Grabata (9.87%), and Candida dubliniensis (6.17%). The
highest rate of Candida infections was among women aged 24–30 years
(71.9%) who finished primary school (77.8%), with the third trimester
(80%), multigravida (66.1%), and recurrent infection (67.7%) showing
significant differences (P &lt; 0.05). The Candida albicans isolates
were resistant to clotrimazole and itraconazole at 34.7% and 23.6%,
respectively.In addition, the resistance of Candida krusei, Candida
tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Candida dublinensis isolates to
fluconazole, voriconazole, voriconazole, and nystatin was 57.6%, 63%,
43.8%, and 60%, respectively. Additionally, approximately 46.2% of
isolated Candida albicans exhibited one kind of antifungal drug
resistance, whereas 38.7% of isolated non-albicans exhibited resistance
to three different antifungal agents. According to the above findings,
Candida infection is highly prevalent in Yemen and quite widespread.
Interventions in health education are advised to increase women’s
knowledge of vaginitis and its prevention. The antifungal susceptibility
test may also be helpful in determining the best medication for each
patient.</p>

of metagenomic next-generation sequencing and targeted metagenomic
next-generation sequencing in diagnosing pulmonary infections in
immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology
has been widely used to diagnose various infections. Based on the most
common pathogen profiles, targeted mNGS (tNGS) using multiplex PCR has
been developed to detect pathogens with predesigned primers in the
panel, significantly improving sensitivity and reducing economic burden
on patients. However, there are few studies on summarizing pathogen
profiles of pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and
immunocompromised patients in Jilin Province of China on large
scale.MethodsFrom January 2021 to December 2023, bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid (BALF) or sputum samples from 546 immunocompetent and
immunocompromised patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia
were collected. Pathogen profiles in those patients on whom mNGS was
performed were summarized. Additionally, we also evaluated the
performance of tNGS in diagnosing pulmonary infections.ResultsCombined
with results of mNGS and culture, we found that the most common
bacterial pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
and Acinetobacter baumannii in both immunocompromised and
immunocompetent patients with high detection rates of Staphylococcus
aureus and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. For fungal pathogens,
Pneumocystis jirovecii was commonly detected in patients, while fungal
infections in immunocompetent patients were mainly caused by Candida
albicans. Most of viral infections in patients were caused by Human
betaherpesvirus 5 and Human gammaherpesvirus 4. It is worth noting that,
compared with immunocompetent patients (34.9%, 76/218), more mixed
infections were found in immunocompromised patients (37.8%, 14/37).
Additionally, taking final comprehensive clinical diagnoses as reference
standard, total coincidence rate of BALF tNGS (81.4%, 48/59) was much
higher than that of BALF mNGS (40.0%, 112/280).ConclusionsOur findings
supplemented and classified the pathogen profiles of pulmonary
infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in Jilin
Province of China. Most importantly, our findings can accelerate the
development and design of tNGS specifically used for regional pulmonary
infections.</p>

3D human trophoblast culture to explore T. cruzi infection in the
placenta</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHuman trophoblastic cell lines, such as BeWo, are
commonly used in 2D models to study placental Trypanosoma cruzi
infections. However, these models do not accurately represent natural
infections. Three-dimensional (3D) microtissue cultures offer a more
physiologically relevant in vitro model, mimicking tissue
microarchitecture and providing an environment closer to natural
infections. These 3D cultures exhibit functions such as cell
proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and gene expression that
resemble in vivo conditions.MethodsWe developed a 3D culture model using
the human trophoblastic cell line BeWo and nonadherent agarose molds
from the MicroTissues® 3D Petri Dish® system. Both small (12–256) and
large (12–81) models were tested with varying initial cell numbers. We
measured the diameter of the 3D cultures and evaluated cell viability
using Trypan Blue dye. Trophoblast functionality was assessed by
measuring β-hCG production via ELISA. Cell fusion was evaluated using
confocal microscopy, with Phalloidin or ZO-1 marking cell edges and DAPI
staining nuclei. T. cruzi infection was assessed by microscopy and
quantitative PCR, targeting the EF1-α gene for T. cruzi and GAPDH for
BeWo cells, using three parasite strains: VD (isolated from a congenital
Chagas disease infant and classified as Tc VI), and K98 and Pan4
(unrelated to congenital infection and classified as Tc
I).ResultsSeeding 1000 BeWo cells per microwell in the large model
resulted in comparable cellular viability to 2D cultures, with a
theoretical diameter of 408.68 ± 12.65 μm observed at 5 days.
Functionality, assessed through β-hCG production, exceeded levels in 2D
cultures at both 3 and 5 days. T. cruzi infection was confirmed by qPCR
and microscopy, showing parasite presence inside the cells for all three
tested strains. The distribution and progression of the infection varied
with each strain.DiscussionThis innovative 3D model offers a simple yet
effective approach for generating viable and functional cultures
susceptible to T. cruzi infection, presenting significant potential for
studying the placental microenvironment.</p>

retrospective cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is
prevalent in East Asia. However, the use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the
treatment of SFTS remains controversial.MethodsIn this retrospective
cohort study, we collected the data from patients with SFTS at Wuhan
Union Hospital to evaluate the effect of GC therapy. Mortality and
secondary infections were compared as outcomes. After searching public
databases, we also included articles that examined GC use in patients
with SFTS for meta-analysis.ResultsPatients treated with GC had higher
fatality rates (21.1% vs. 11.9%, respectively; P=0.006) and a longer
length of stay (10.6 ± 5.1 vs. 9.5 ± 4.2, respectively; P=0.033). In
cohorts adjusted using propensity score matching and inverse probability
of treatment weighting, no significant differences in fatality rates and
length of stay were observed. A meta-analysis of 4243 SFTS patient
revealed that those treated with GCs had significantly higher mortality
(OR=3.46, 95% CI =2.12-5.64, P&lt;0.00001) and secondary infection rate
(OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.45-2.67, P&lt;0.0001).DiscussionGC should be used
cautiously when treating SFTS. No significant differences were
identified in terms of mortality and secondary infection rates between
patients with SFTS treated with or without GC.</p>

cinnamoyl hydroxamates as potential quorum sensing inhibitors against
Pseudomonas aeruginosa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen that
causes various infectious diseases through the regulation of quorum
sensing (QS). The strategy of interfering with the QS systems of P.
aeruginosa, coupled with a reduction in the dosage of conventional
antibiotics, presents a potential solution to treating infection and
mitigating antibiotic resistance. In this study, seven cinnamoyl
hydroxamates were synthesized to evaluate their inhibitory effects on QS
of P. aeruginosa. Among these cinnamic acid derivatives, we found
cinnamoyl hydroxamic acid (CHA) and 3-methoxy-cinnamoyl hydroxamic acid
(MCHA) were the two most effective candidates. Furtherly, the effect of
CHA and MCHA on the production of virulence factors and biofilm of P.
aeruginosa were evaluated. Ultimately, our study may offer promising
potential for treating P. aeruginosa infections and reducing its
virulence.MethodsThe disc diffusion test were conducted to evaluate
inhibitory effects on QS of seven cinnamoyl hydroxamates. The influence
of CHA and MCHA on the production of virulence and flagellar motility of
P. aeruginosa was furtherly explored. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
experiment were conducted to evaluate the suppression of CHA and MCHA on
the formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. RT-qPCR was used to detect rhlI,
lasA, lasB, rhlA, rhlB, and oprL genes in P. aeruginosa. In silico
docking study was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of CHA
and MCHA. The synergistic effects of CHA with gentamicin were detected
on biofilm cell dispersal.ResultAfter treatment of CHA or MCHA, the
production of multiple virulence factors, including pyocyanin,
proteases, rhamnolipid, and siderophore, and swimming and swarming
motilities in P. aeruginosa were inhibited significantly. And our
results showed CHA and MCHA could eliminate the formed biofilm of P.
aeruginosa. RT-qPCR revealed that CHA and MCHA inhibited the expression
of QS related genes in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking indicated that
CHA and MCHA primarily inhibited the RhlI/R system in P. aeruginosa by
competing with the cognate signaling molecule C4-HSL.Additionally, CHA
exhibited potent synergistic effects with gentamicin on biofilm cell
dispersal.DiscussionP. aeruginosa is one of the most clinically and
epidemiologically important bacteria and a primary cause of
catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated
pneumonia. This study aims to explore whether cinnamoyl hydroxamates
have inhibitory effects on QS. And our results indicate that CHA and
MCHA, as two novel QSIs, offer promising potential for treating P.
aeruginosa infections and reducing its virulence.</p>

extracellular vesicles in zoonotic helminth biology: implications for
diagnosis, therapeutic and delivery</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key intercellular
communication and pathogenesis mediators. Parasitic organisms’
helminths, cause widespread infections with significant health impacts
worldwide. Recent research has shed light on the role of EVs in the
lifecycle, immune evasion, and disease progression of these parasitic
organisms. These tiny membrane-bound organelles including microvesicles
and exosomes, facilitate the transfer of proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and
microRNAs between cells. EVs have been isolated from various bodily
fluids, offering a potential diagnostic and therapeutic avenue for
combating infectious agents. According to recent research, EVs from
helminths hold great promise in the diagnosis of parasitic infections
due to their specificity, early detection capabilities, accessibility,
and the potential for staging and monitoring infections, promote
intercellular communication, and are a viable therapeutic tool for the
treatment of infectious agents. Exploring host-parasite interactions has
identified promising new targets for diagnostic, therapy, and vaccine
development against helminths. This literature review delves into EVS’s
origin, nature, biogenesis, and composition in these parasitic
organisms. It also highlights the proteins and miRNAs involved in EV
release, providing a comprehensive summary of the latest findings on the
significance of EVs in the biology of helminths, promising targets for
therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers.</p>

the link between gut microbiota and brain tumor risk: a new perspective
from Mendelian randomization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecent studies have shown that gut microbiota may be
related to the occurrence of brain tumors, but direct evidence is
lacking. This study used the Mendelian randomization study (MR) method
to explore the potential causal link between gut microbiota and brain
tumors.MethodWe analyzed the genome-wide association data between 211
gut microbiota taxa and brain tumors, using the largest existing gut
microbiota Genome-Wide Association Studies meta-analysis data (n=13266)
and combining it with brain tumor data in the IEU OpenGWAS database. We
use inverse-variance weighted analysis, supplemented by methods such as
Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, weighted median estimator,
simple mode, and weighted mode, to assess causality. In addition, we
also conducted the Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test,
Cochran’s Q test, and Mendelian randomization Steiger directionality
test to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Quality control includes
sensitivity analysis, horizontal gene pleiotropy test, heterogeneity
test, and MR Steiger directionality test.ResultOur study found that
specific gut microbial taxa, such as order Lactobacillales and family
Clostridiaceae1, were positively correlated with the occurrence of brain
tumors, while genus Defluviitaleaceae UCG011 and genus Flavonifractor
were negatively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors. The
Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test showed that our analysis
was not affected by pleiotropy (P&gt;0.05).ConclusionThis study reveals
for the first time the potential causal relationship between gut
microbiota and brain tumors, providing a new perspective for the
prevention and treatment of early brain tumors. These findings may help
develop new clinical intervention strategies and point the way for
future research.</p>

<p>Fosfomycin (FOS) is an effective antibiotic against
multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, but its effectiveness is reducing.
Little is known on the current prevalence of FosA enzymes in low-risk
pathogens, such as Citrobacter freundii. The aim of the study was the
molecular characterization of a carbapenemase- and FosA-producing C.
freundii collected in Italy. AK867, collected in 2023, showed an XDR
profile, retaining susceptibility only to colistin. AK867 showed a FOS
MIC &gt;128 mg/L by ADM. Based on WGS, AK867 belonged to ST116 and owned
a wide resistome, including fosA3, blaKPC-2, and blaVIM-1. fosA3 was
carried by a conjugative pKPC-CAV1312 plasmid of 320,480 bp, on a novel
composite transposon (12,907 bp). FosA3 transposon shared similarities
with other fosA3-harboring pKPC-CAV1312 plasmids among Citrobacter spp.
We report the first case of FosA3 production in clinical
carbapenemase-producing C. freundii ST116. The incidence of FosA3
enzymes is increasing among Enterobacterales, affecting even
low-virulence pathogens, as C. freundii.</p>

Huzhou, China, 2020-2023</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to explore the
genetic diversity, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance
determinants of string test-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) over a
4-year surveillance period in Huzhou, China.MethodsIn total, 632
clinical isolates were collected via hospital surveillance from 2020 to
2023; 100 were positive in the string test and these 100 strains were
subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using an agar dilution
method followed by WGS.ResultsThe resistance rates to cefotaxime
(77.0%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67.0%), and nalidixic acid
(64.0%) were high. Multilocus sequence typing revealed high genetic
diversity; there were 33 sequence types (STs) and 15 capsular serotypes.
The most common ST was ST23 (16.0%) and the most common capsular
serotype was K1 (22.5%). Virulome analysis revealed among-strain
differences in virulence factors that affected bacterial adherence,
efflux pump action, iron uptake, nutritional factors, metabolic
regulation, the secretion system, and toxin production. The Kleborate
strain-specific virulence scores of all 100 string test-positive KPs
were derived: 28 strains scored 5, 28 scored 4, 21 scored 3, 12 scored
1, and 11 scored 0. All 77 strains with scores of 3 to 5 contained the
iucA gene. The phylogeny based on whole-genome single nucleotide
polymorphisms (wgSNPs) indicated high clonality; the string
test-positive KP strains were grouped into six clades. Closely related
isolates in each genetic cluster usually shared STs.ConclusionThe
present study highlights the significance of the KP iucA gene in terms
of hypervirulence and the diverse genotypes of string test-positive KP
strains isolated in Huzhou hospitals.</p>

of a multienzyme isothermal and lateral flow dipstick combination assay
for the rapid detection of goose astrovirus II</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGoose astrovirus (GAstV) is a newly emerging pathogen
that is currently widespread among geese, causing visceral gout and
leading to substantial gosling mortalities, posing a severe threat to
the waterfowl industry. GAstV II is the predominant epidemic strain,
characterized by its high morbidity and mortality rate. Consequently,
there is an urgent necessity to develop an effective diagnostic approach
to control the dissemination of GAstV II, particularly in clinical farms
with limited laboratory resources.MethodsIn this study, a novel
multi-enzyme isothermal rapid amplification (MIRA) and lateral flow
dipstick (LFD) combined assay was developed. Different primers designed
specific targeting a highly conserved region within the viral RdRp gene
for the detection of GAstV II. Primers optimized and MIRA-LFD assay
analyzed its performance regarding limits of detection, specificity, and
efficiency of detection.ResultsThe developed MIRA amplification is
conducted at a constant temperature and accomplished within 10 minutes.
Subsequent naked-eye observation of the LFD strips merely takes 5
minutes. The established MIRA-LFD method exhibits high specificity, with
no cross-reaction with other pathogens and attains a detection
sensitivity of 1 copy/μl, which is consistent with the reverse
transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. Further evaluation with
clinical samples indicates that the accuracy of this MIRA-LFD method
correlates well with RT-qPCR for the detection of GAstV II. ConclusionIn
summary, the convenience, sensitivity, and rapidity of this newly
developed detection method offer a significant advantage for on-site
diagnosis of GAstV II.</p>
