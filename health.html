id="a-novel-approach-to-designing-viral-precision-vaccines-applied-to-sars-cov-2">A
novel approach to designing viral precision vaccines applied to
SARS-CoV-2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Efficient precision vaccines against several highly pathogenic zoonotic
viruses are currently lacking. Proteolytic activation is instrumental
for a number of these viruses to gain host-cell entry and develop
infectivity. For SARS-CoV-2, this process is enhanced by the insertion
of a furin cleavage site at the junction of the spike protein S1/S2
subunits upstream of the metalloprotease TMPRSS2 common proteolytic
site. Here, we describe a new approach based on specific epitopes
selection from the region involved in proteolytic activation and
infectivity for the engineering of precision candidate vaccinating
antigens. This approach was developed through its application to the
design of SARS-CoV-2 cross-variant candidates vaccinating antigens. It
includes an <italic>in silico</italic> structural analysis of the viral
region involved in infectivity, the identification of conserved
immunogenic epitopes and the selection of those eliciting specific
immune responses in infected people. The following step consists of
engineering vaccinating antigens that carry the selected epitopes and
mimic their 3D native structure. Using this approach, we demonstrated
through a Covid-19 patient-centered study of a 500 patients’ cohort,
that the epitopes selected from SARS-CoV-2 protein S1/S2 junction
elicited a neutralizing antibody response significantly associated with
mild and asymptomatic COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), which strongly suggests
protective immunity. Engineered antigens containing the SARS-CoV-2
selected epitopes and mimicking the native epitopes 3D structure
generated neutralizing antibody response in mice. Our data show the
potential of this combined computational and experimental approach for
designing precision vaccines against viruses whose pathogenicity is
contingent upon proteolytic activation.

and application of one-step multiplex Real-Time PCR for detection of
three main pathogens associated with bovine neonatal diarrhea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) is one of the most common diseases in
calves, causing huge economic and productivity losses to the bovine
industry worldwide. The main pathogens include bovine rotavirus (BRV),
bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)
K99. Since multiple infectious agents can be involved in calf diarrhea,
detecting each causative agent by traditional methods is laborious and
expensive.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, we developed a one-step multiplex Real-Time PCR assay to
simultaneously detect BRV, BCoV, and E. coli K99+. The assay performance
on field samples was evaluated on 1100 rectal swabs of diseased cattle
with diarrhea symptoms and compared with the conventional gel-based
RT-PCR assay detect BRV, BCoV, and E. coli K99+.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The established assay could specifically detect the target pathogens
without cross-reactivity with other pathogens. A single real-time PCR
can detect ~1 copy/µL for each pathogen, and multiplex real-time PCR has
a detection limit of 10 copies/µL. Reproducibility as measured by
standard deviation and coefficient of variation were desirable. The
triple real-time PCR method established in this study was compared with
gel-based PT-PCR. Both methods are reasonably consistent, while the
real-time PCR assay was more sensitive and could rapidly distinguish
these three pathogens in one tube. Analysis of surveillance data showed
that BRV and BCoV are major enteric viral pathogens accounting for
calves’ diarrhea in China.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The established assay has excellent specificity and sensitivity and was
suitable for clinical application. The robustness and high-throughput
performance of the developed assay make it a powerful tool in diagnostic
applications and calf diarrhea research. ​

id="enterovirus-a71-infection-induced-dry-eye-like-symptoms-by-damaging-the-lacrimal-glands">Enterovirus
A71 infection-induced dry eye-like symptoms by damaging the lacrimal
glands</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
To determine the effects of EV-A71 (Enterovirus A71) infection on ocular
surface and its mechanism.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
AG6 mice aged two to three weeks were randomly divided into control and
EV-A71 infected groups. Slit-lamp observation, fluorescein staining, and
phenol red thread test were used to assess symptoms of ocular surface at
4 dpi (days post infection). The pathological changes of cornea and
lacrimal gland were observed by H&amp;E staining, PAS staining, TUNEL
assay, IHC staining and qRT-PCR. Corneas and lacrimal glands from mice
were obtained and processed for RNA sequencing analysis. Newly diagnosed
HFMD patients caused by EV-A71 were recruited and ensured they met the
inclusion criteria. Ocular surface parameters (TMH and NIKBUT) were
measured using the OCULUS Keratograph 5M. Tear samples were taken to
examine Cxcl1 and IL-6 levels through the ELISA method.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Mice studies revealed that EV-A71 infection caused tear film
instability, decreased tear secretions, decreased in lacrimal gland
size, and distinct goblet cell loss. It also resulted in increased large
vacuoles within acinar cells and structural damage in lacrimal gland.
Apart from minor damage to the epidermis, there was no obvious
inflammatory changes or apoptosis in the cornea. However, there were
significant inflammatory injury and apoptosis in the lacrimal gland.
RNA-seq analysis showed IL-17 and NF-κB signaling pathways were
activated in the lacrimal glands of mice infected with EV-A71. In HFMD
patients, the THM was in a low range and NITBUT was significantly
shorter than the control group by Oculus Keratograph 5M. ELISA assay
showed a higher tear Cxcl1 and IL-6 level in them.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
EV-A71 infection affected lacrimal gland structure and function and
induced dry eye-like symptoms.

id="francisella-tularensis-specific-antibody-levels-in-sera-from-swedish-patients-with-suspected-tularemia-during-a-13-year-period">Francisella
tularensis-specific antibody levels in sera from Swedish patients with
suspected tularemia during a 13-year period</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
For a majority of tularemia patients, serology is the basis for the
diagnosis. The aim of this study was to perform an analysis of the
samples analyzed at a Swedish reference laboratory for the presence of
Francisella tularensis-specific antibody levels in sera from individuals
with suspected tularemia. Annual and monthly variations of the total
number of samples and proportions of positive samples were analyzed, as
well as the influence of age and gender.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We performed a retrospective analysis of the presence of F.
tularensis-specific antibodies in serological samples from patients with
suspected tularemia analyzed during the period 2010 - 2022 at the
University Hospital of Umeå in Sweden, a national reference laboratory,
by use of various statistical methods. In total, some 15,100 serum
samples had been analyzed for the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies by
ELISA during the 13-year period.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Overall, there were higher number of samples with IgG positive or
borderline titers, 2,522 and 921, respectively, than with IgM positive
or borderline titers, 1,802 and 409, respectively. Repeated samples were
obtained from some 1,930 individuals and approximately a third of the
cases, which were initially seronegative, had seroconverted when
resampled. Peak number of monthly samples were recorded in August and
September, &gt; 3,000. Annual numbers varied greatly and peak numbers
were observed in 2015 and 2019, 1,832 and 2,250, respectively, whereas
some other years the numbers were 700 – 800. There was also much
variation in the annual and monthly percentages of positive samples and
they varied between less than 10% to greater than 20%. The highest
percentages of positive samples were recorded in September and October.
IgG and IgM titers declined with age and these differences were highly
significant for IgG titers, with decreasing average titers for each
20-year interval.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Collectively, the data demonstrate the marked annual and seasonal
variations in tularemia sampling occurring in Sweden. Also, the
proportion of positive samples increased during months and years with
peak number of samples. Another notable finding was that average
antibody titers decreased with increased age.
