alleviates zinc-induced nephrotoxicity via the gut-kidney axis in
swine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionZinc (Zn) is an essential trace element in animals, but
excessive intake can lead to renal toxicity damage. Thus, the
exploration of effective natural antagonists to reduce the toxicity
caused by Zn has become a major scientific problem.MethodsHere, we found
that hesperidin could effectively alleviate the renal toxicity induced
by Zn in pigs by using hematoxylin-eosin staining, transmission electron
microscope, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence quantitative PCR, and
microfloral DNA sequencing.ResultsThe results showed that hesperidin
could effectively attenuate the pathological injury in kidney, and
reduce autophagy and apoptosis induced by Zn, which evidenced by the
downregulation of LC3, ATG5, Bak1, Bax, Caspase-3 and upregulation of
p62 and Bcl2. Additionally, hesperidin could reverse colon injury and
the decrease of ZO-1 protein expression. Interestingly, hesperidin
restored the intestinal flora structure disturbed by Zn, and
significantly reduced the abundance of Tenericutes (phylum level) and
Christensenella (genus level).DiscussionThus, altered intestinal flora
and intestinal barrier function constitute the gut-kidney axis, which is
involved in hesperidin alleviating Zn-induced nephrotoxicity. Our study
provides theoretical basis and practical significance of hesperidin for
the prevention and treatment of Zn-induced nephrotoxicity through
gut-kidney axis.</p>

clone Escherichia coli ST615 as a vector and reservoir for dissemination
of crucial antimicrobial resistance genes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>There is scarce information concerning the role of sporadic clones in
the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) within the
nosocomial niche. We confirmed that the clinical Escherichia coli M19736
ST615 strain, one of the first isolates of Latin America that harbors a
plasmid with an mcr-1 gene, could receive crucial ARG by transformation
and conjugation using as donors critical plasmids that harbor
blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, blaNDM-5, blaNDM-1, or aadB genes. Escherichia
coli M19736 acquired blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, blaNDM-5, blaNDM-1, and aadB
genes, being only blaNDM-1 maintained at 100% on the 10th day of
subculture. In addition, when the evolved MDR-E. coli M19736 acquired
sequentially blaCTX-M-15 and blaNDM-1 genes, the maintenance pattern of
the plasmids changed. In addition, when the evolved XDR-E. coli M19736
acquired in an ulterior step the paadB plasmid, a different pattern of
the plasmid’s maintenance was found. Interestingly, the evolved E. coli
M19736 strains disseminated simultaneously the acquired conjugative
plasmids in different combinations though selection was ceftazidime in
all cases. Finally, we isolated and characterized the extracellular
vesicles (EVs) from the native and evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 strains.
Interestingly, EVs from the evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 harbored
blaCTX-M-15 though the pDCAG1-CTX-M-15 was previously lost as shown by
WGS and experiments, suggesting that EV could be a relevant reservoir of
ARG for susceptible bacteria. These results evidenced the genetic
plasticity of a sporadic clone of E. coli such as ST615 that could play
a relevant transitional link in the clinical dynamics and evolution to
multidrug/extensively/pandrug-resistant phenotypes of superbugs within
the nosocomial niche by acting simultaneously as a vector and reservoir
of multiple ARGs which later could be disseminated.</p>

the bar: genus-specific nested PCR improves detection and lineage
identification of avian haemosporidian parasites</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Avian haemosporidian parasites are useful model organisms to study
the ecology and evolution of parasite-host interactions due to their
global distribution and extensive biodiversity. Detection of these
parasites has evolved from microscopic examination to PCR-based methods,
with the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene serving as barcoding region.
However, standard PCR protocols used for screening and identification
purposes have limitations in detecting mixed infections and generating
phylogenetically informative data due to short amplicon lengths. To
address these issues, we developed a novel genus-specific nested PCR
protocol targeting avian haemosporidian parasites. The protocol
underwent rigorous testing utilizing a large dataset comprising blood
samples from Malagasy birds of three distinct Passeriformes families.
Furthermore, validation was done by examining smaller datasets in two
other laboratories employing divergent master mixes and different bird
species. Comparative analyses were conducted between the outcomes of the
novel PCR protocol and those obtained through the widely used standard
nested PCR method. The novel protocol enables specific identification of
Plasmodium, Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus), and Leucocytozoon
parasites. The analyses demonstrated comparable sensitivity to the
standard nested PCR with notable improvements in detecting mixed
infections. In addition, phylogenetic resolution is improved by
amplification of longer fragments, leading to a better understanding of
the haemosporidian biodiversity and evolution. Overall, the novel
protocol represents a valuable addition to avian haemosporidian
detection methodologies, facilitating comprehensive studies on parasite
ecology, epidemiology, and evolution.</p>

of IFNAR2 and TYK2 transcripts’ prognostic role in COVID-19 patients: a
retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and objectivesThis study aimed to investigate the possible
prognostic significance of interferon alpha–beta receptor subunit 2
(IFNAR2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expressions.MethodsWe conducted a
retrospective study including COVID-19 adult patients. All blood samples
were collected before any interventions. The expressions of IFNAR2 and
TYK2 were assessed using real-time PCR in venous blood samples of 54
cases and 56 controls. The transcript quantities of IFNAR2 and TYK2
genes were assessed using a Delta-Ct method.ResultsOur findings show no
significant differences in gene expression levels for IFNAR2 and TYK2
between patients who required oxygen (O2) therapy and those who did not
(p-value = 0.732 and p-value = 0.629, respectively). Likewise, there
were no significant differences in IFNAR2 and TYK2 expressions between
patients hospitalized for less than 7 days and those hospitalized for 7
days or more (p-value = 0.455 and p-value = 0.626, respectively). We
also observed a weak correlation between IFNAR2 expression and CRP
(p-value = 0.045, r = 0.192). There was a negative correlation between
the expression levels of IFNAR2 and TYK2 transcripts in COVID-19
patients (p-value = 0.044; partial correlation coefficient = -0.283).
Additionally, IFNAR2 and TYK2 were significantly downregulated in the
COVID-19 group compared to healthy subjects (p-value = 0.002 and p-value
= 0.028, respectively). However, neither IFNAR2 nor TYK2 expression was
significantly different between the case subgroups based on COVID-19
severity. The IFNAR2 ΔΔCt (B = -0.184, 95% CI: -0.524–0.157, p-value =
0.275) and the TYK2 ΔΔCt (B = 0.114, 95% CI: -0.268–0.496, p-value =
0.543) were not found to be significant predictors of hospitalization
duration. The area under the curve (AUC) for IFNAR2 expression is 0.655
(p-value = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.554–0.757), suggesting its poor
discriminative value.ConclusionWe were unable to comment definitively on
the prognostic power of IFNAR2 and TYK2 expressions in COVID-19
patients, and larger-scale studies are needed. The principal limitations
of this study included the lack of longitudinal analysis and limited
sample size.</p>

and risk factors of active tuberculosis among older individuals with
latent tuberculosis infection: a cohort study in two high-epidemic sites
in eastern China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe influencing factors of the process from latent
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to the onset of active tuberculosis (TB)
remain unknown among different population groups, especially among older
individuals in high-incidence areas. This study aimed to investigate the
development of active TB among older adults with LTBI and identify
groups in greatest need of improved prevention and control strategies
for TB.MethodsIn 2021, we implemented an investigation among older
individuals (≥ 65 years old) in two towns in Zhejiang Province with the
highest incidence of TB. All participants underwent assessment using
standardized questionnaires, physical examinations, interferon-gamma
release assays, and chest radiography. All the participants with
suspected TB based on the clinical symptoms or abnormal chest
radiography results, as well as those with LTBI, were referred for
diagnostic investigation in accordance with the national guidelines.
Those with an initial diagnosis of TB were then excluded, whereas those
with LTBI were included in a follow-up at baseline. Incident patients
with active TB were identified from the Chinese Tuberculosis Management
Information System, and a multivariate Cox regression model was used to
estimate the incidence and risk of TB among those with LTBI.ResultsIn
total, 667 participants with LTBI were followed up for 1,315.3
person-years, revealing a disease density of 1,292.5 individuals/100,000
person-years (17/1,315.3). For those with LTBI, chest radiograph
abnormalities had adjusted hazard ratios for active TB of 4.9
(1.6–15.3).ConclusionsThe presence of abnormal chest radiography
findings increased the risk of active TB among older individuals with
LTBI in high-epidemic sites in eastern China.</p>
