HRF-dependent ferroptosis pathway to promote tick acquisition of Babesia
microti</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>B. microti is a tick-transmitted zoonotic erythrocytic intracellular
parasite. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death
that affects pathogen replication in the host. Currently, there is
limited research concerning the effect of tick ferroptosis on Babesia
infection and the underlying mechanism of action. The present study used
a B. microti -mouse- Haemaphysalis longicornis infection model in which
nymphs fed on the blood of B. microti-infected mice. The midgut divalent
iron (p&lt;0.01) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p&lt;0.05) levels
were significantly elevated in infected ticks, and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) showed that mitochondrial ridges were absent or
decreased in size. Downregulation of ferritin 1 and glutathione
peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in ticks infected with B. microti suggests that
these changes promote ferroptosis. In vivo studies demonstrated that the
ferroptosis promoter Erastin increased B. microti load (p&lt;0.05),
while the inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 effectively decreased load
(p&lt;0.01). Tick histamine-releasing factor (HRF), a protein related to
the antioxidant system, was downregulated in infected nymphs compared
with uninfected nymphs (p&lt;0.05), and interference with HRF promoted
tick acquisition of B. microti (p&lt;0.001). Transcriptomic analyses
showed that HRF interference promotes tick ferroptosis by downregulating
ferritin 1 and GPX4. Meanwhile, interference with tick HRF molecules
showed increased divalent iron and ROS and decreased mitochondrial
ridges compared with controls. These findings highlight the critical
role of tick HRF molecules in regulating ferroptosis and acquisition of
B. microti, thereby providing important insights for a deeper
understanding of the tick-Babesia interaction.</p>

role of intestinal homeostasis in sevoflurane-induced myelin development
and cognitive impairment in neonatal mice</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundInhalational anesthetic sevoflurane is commonly used in
pediatric anesthesia. Multiple exposures to sevoflurane in early
postnatal life have been associated with long-term abnormalities in
myelin development and cognitive and memory impairments, although the
underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Disruption of gut
microbiota is recognized as an important contributor to neurological
diseases. Here, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying the
abnormal myelin development induced by multiple sevoflurane exposures in
neonatal rats by analyzing gut homeostasis.MethodsSix-day-old (P6)
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 hours per day for
three consecutive days. Mice exposed to a mixture of 60% nitrogen and
oxygen under the same conditions and duration served as controls.
Behavioral tests were conducted between P32 and P42. At P9 (24 hours
after the last sevoflurane exposure) and P42 (after the completion of
behavioral tests), intestinal and brain examinations were performed to
investigate the effects of sevoflurane exposure during the lactation and
adolescent periods on gut homeostasis and myelin development in mice.
Subsequently, the ameliorative effects of butyrate supplementation on
sevoflurane-induced abnormalities in myelin development and cognitive
and memory impairments were observed.ResultsAfter repeated exposure to
sevoflurane, neonatal mice developed persistent gut microbiota imbalance
accompanied by a decrease in short-chain fatty acids. Short-term
intestinal inflammation emerged, with damage to the mucus layer and
barrier function. In the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, the
expression of genes and transcription factors related to oligodendrocyte
differentiation and myelin development was significantly affected, and
these changes persisted even after the exposure ended. There was a
reduction in proteins associated with oligodendrocytes and myelin
formation, which had a certain impact on memory and cognitive behavior.
This study also explored the potential connections between microbiota,
metabolism, the gut, the brain, and behavior. Timely supplementation
with butyrate could effectively reverse these changes, indicating that
gut homeostasis is crucial for brain neurodevelopment.ConclusionMultiple
exposures to sevoflurane in neonatal mice disrupt gut homeostasis and
affect oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development in the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, inducing cognitive and memory
impairments. Supplementation with butyrate can alleviate these
changes.</p>

of the primary antibiofilm substance and mechanism employed by
Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741 to inhibit biofilm of Streptococcus
mutans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLactobacillus salivarius serves as a probiotic
potentially capable of preventing dental caries both in vitro and in
vivo. This study focused on understanding the key antibiofilm agents and
the mechanisms of action of the Lactobacilli supernatant against
Streptococcus mutans.MethodsStreptococcus mutans biofilm was constructed
and the cell-free supernatant of Lactobacillus salivarius was added.
After the biofilm was collected, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were then performed
to get gene information. The influence of temperature, pH and other
factors on the supernatant were measured and non-targeted metabolome
analysis was performed to analyze the effective components.ResultsThe
findings indicated that the supernatant derived from Lactobacillus
salivarius could inhibit the biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans
at different times. Through transcriptome analysis, we discovered that
the cell-free supernatant reduced biofilm formation, by suppressing
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems along with two
ATP-binding cassette transporters, rather than directly affecting the
genes that code for glucosyltransferases; additionally, the supernatant
was observed to diminish the expression of genes linked to two-component
systems, polyketides/non-ribosomal peptides, acid stress response,
quorum sensing, and exopolysaccharide formation. Non-targeted LC-MS/MS
analysis was employed to discover a variety of potential active
compounds present in the cellular filtrate of Lactobacillus salivarius
that hinder the growth of S. mutans, including phenyllactic acid,
sorbitol, and honokiol.DiscussionIn summary, our findings support the
evaluation of Lactobacillus salivarius as a promising oral probiotic
aimed at hindering the formation of biofilms by cariogenic pathogens and
the development of dental caries.</p>

a novel aminoglycoside acetyltransferase gene identified from an animal
isolate Brucella intermedia DW0551</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antimicrobials is
becoming increasingly severe due to their use as commonly prescribed
antibiotics. The discovery of new molecular mechanisms of aminoglycoside
resistance is critical for the effective treatment of bacterial
infections.MethodsBacteria in goose feces were isolated by plate
streaking. The identification and characterization of a novel resistance
gene from the bacterial genome involved various techniques, including
molecular cloning, drug susceptibility testing, protein expression and
purification, and enzyme kinetic analysis. Additionally, whole-genome
sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed.ResultsBrucella
intermedia DW0551, isolated from goose feces, was resistant to 35
antibiotics, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
particularly high for most aminoglycoside antibiotics. The novel
aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6’)-Iaq encoded by B. intermedia
DW0551 conferred resistance to netilmicin, sisomicin, amikacin,
kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and ribostamycin. The amino acid
sequence of AAC(6’)-Iaq shared the highest identity (52.63%) with the
functionally characterized aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6’)-If.
AAC(6’)-Iaq contained all the conserved sites of the acetyltransferase
family NAT_SF. The enzyme exhibited strong affinity and catalytic
activity toward netilmicin and sisomicin. The mobile genetic element
(MGE) was not found in the flanking regions of the aac(6’)-Iaq and
aac(6’)-Iaq-like genes.ConclusionIn this work, a novel aminoglycoside
acetyltransferase gene, designated aac(6’)-Iaq, which conferred
resistance to a variety of aminoglycoside antimicrobials, was identified
in an animal Brucella intermedia isolate. Identification of new
antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria isolated from animals could
aid in the treatment of animal and human infectious diseases caused by
related bacterial species.</p>

id="gut-microbiota-an-emerging-target-connecting-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-and-insulin-resistance">Gut
microbiota: an emerging target connecting polycystic ovarian syndrome
and insulin resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly heterogeneous metabolic
disorder, with oligomenorrhea and hirsutism as patients’ primary
complaints. Hyperinsulinemia is a crucial pathophysiological mechanism
in the development of PCOS, with 50-70% of patients exhibiting insulin
resistance (IR). This condition not only exacerbates ovulatory
dysfunction but also leads to various adverse metabolic outcomes, such
as dyslipidemia and diabetes, and increases the risk of cardiovascular
events both before and after menopause. Gut microbiota is a microbial
community within the host that possesses significant metabolic potential
and is shaped by external environmental factors, the neuro-immune
network, and metabolism. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota
dysbiosis is closely related to the development and progression of PCOS.
Despite the growing recognition of the potential role of gut microbiota
in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS, its clinical application
remains in its infancy. Currently, most clinical guidelines and expert
consensus still emphasize traditional therapeutic approaches, such as
hormonal treatments, lifestyle modifications, and insulin sensitizers.
However, accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota may
influence the metabolic and reproductive health of PCOS patients through
various mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the role of gut microbiota
between PCOS and IR is essential. This review describes the changes in
the gut microbiota of IR-PCOS patients, examines the potential
mechanisms by which the gut microbiota contributes to IR in PCOS
patients, and updates the evidence supporting the gut microbiota as a
potential metabolic regulatory target in IR-PCOS. In summary, gut
microbiota dysbiosis may be involved in the development and progression
of IR in PCOS patients, and improving gut microbiota may offer metabolic
stability benefits.</p>

the immunological nonresponse to antiretroviral therapy in people living
with HIV: a machine learning-based multicenter large-scale study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAlthough highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has
greatly enhanced the prognosis for people living with HIV (PLWH), some
individuals fail to achieve adequate immune reconstitution, known as
immunological nonresponse (INR), which is linked to poor prognosis and
higher mortality. However, the early prediction and intervention of INR
remains challenging in South China.MethodsThis study included 1,577 PLWH
who underwent at least two years of HAART and clinical follow-up between
2017 and 2022 at two major tertiary hospitals in South China. We
utilized logistic multivariate regression to identify independent
predictors of INR and employed restricted cubic splines (RCS) for
nonlinear analysis. We also developed several machine-learning models,
assessing their performance using internal and external datasets to
generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration
curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was
further interpreted using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)
values.ResultsIndependent predictors of INR included baseline, 6-month
and 12-month CD4+ T cell counts, baseline hemoglobin, and 6-month
hemoglobin levels. RCS analysis highlighted significant nonlinear
relationships between baseline CD4+ T cells, 12-month CD4+ T cells and
baseline hemoglobin with INR. The Random Forest model demonstrated
superior predictive accuracy, with ROC areas of 0.866, 0.943, and 0.897
across the datasets. Calibration was robust, with Brier scores of 0.136,
0.102, and 0.126. SHAP values indicated that early CD4+T cell counts and
CD4/CD8 ratio were crucial in predicting INR.ConclusionsThis study
introduces the random forest model to predict incomplete immune
reconstitution in PLWH, which can significantly assist clinicians in the
early prediction and intervention of INR among PLWH.</p>

of FosA13, a novel fosfomycin glutathione transferase identified in a
Morganella morganii isolate from poultry</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundM. morganii is a species of the genus Morganella in the
family Enterobacteriaceae. This species primarily causes infections of
postoperative wounds and the urinary tract. Some isolates of M. morganii
exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics due to multidrug resistance
traits, complicating clinical treatment; thus, there is a growing need
to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of this pathogen.MethodsA total
of 658 bacterial strains were isolated from anal fecal swabs from
poultry and livestock and from the surrounding environment in Wenzhou,
China, via plate streaking. The full genome sequences of the bacteria
were obtained via next-generation sequencing platforms. The standard
agar dilution method was employed to determine the minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) of various antimicrobial agents. The resistance
gene (fosA13) of the isolate was identified using the Comprehensive
Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and confirmed via molecular
cloning. The FosA13 protein encoded by the novel resistance gene fosA13
was expressed with the vector pCold I, and its enzyme kinetics
parameters were characterized. The genetic background and evolutionary
process of the sequence of this novel resistance gene were analyzed by
means of bioinformatics methods.ResultsIn this study, we identified a
new chromosomally encoded fosfomycin resistance gene, designated fosA13,
from the M. morganii isolate DW0548, which was isolated from poultry on
a farm in Wenzhou, China. Compared with the control strain
(pUCP19/DH5α), the recombinant strain carrying fosA13
(pUCP19-fosA13/DH5α) presented a fourfold increase in the MIC value for
fosfomycin. The enzyme kinetics data of FosA13 revealed effective
inactivation of fosfomycin, with a kcat/Km of (1.50 ± 0.02)×104 M-1·s-1.
Among functionally characterized resistance proteins, FosA13 presented
the highest amino acid (aa) homology (55.6%) with FosA. FosA13 also
contained essential functional residues of FosA proteins. The isolate M.
morganii DW0548 presented high MIC values (≥ 8 μg/mL) for 5 classes of
antimicrobials, namely, aminoglycosides, β-lactams, quinolones,
tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, but only two functionally
characteristic antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been
identified in the complete genome: a β-lactam resistance gene
(blaDHA-16) and a phenol resistance gene (catII). These findings
indicate that in addition to the novel resistance gene identified in
this work, other uncharacterized resistance mechanisms might exist in M.
morganii DW0548.ConclusionA novel chromosomal fosfomycin resistance
gene, fosA13, was identified in an animal M. morganii isolate, and its
enzymatic parameters were characterized. This protein shares the highest
aa identity of 55.6% with the functionally characterized protein FosA
and has all the essential functional residues of FosA proteins.
Exploring more antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of this pathogen
would help clinicians choose effective drugs to treat infectious
diseases in animal husbandry and clinical practice and facilitate the
development of methods to prevent the spread of resistance between
bacteria of different species.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection

<p>Apple trees [Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae)] are one of the
important temperate fruit crops in China. In comparison to other
temperate fruits, such as grapes and pears, fungal studies (in Yunnan)
associated with M. domestica are fewer in number. In the present study,
we investigated fungi associated with M. domestica in Qujing City,
Yunnan Province, China. Samples were collected from apple gardens in
different locations. Single spore isolation was carried out to isolate
saprobic fungi, while the surface sterilization method was carried out
to isolate endophytic fungi. Molecular analyses were carried out to
determine the phylogenetic placement of the new collections. Based on
the combined methods of morphology and phylogeny, Cytospora qujingensis
sp. nov. and Hypoxylon malongense sp. nov. are introduced as novel
saprobic and endophytic taxa, respectively. Moreover, Aureobasidium
pullulans and Cytospora schulzeri are reported as new geological records
from southwestern China. Allocryptovalsa castaneae is reported on M.
domestica in China for the first time. The checklist of fungi associated

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe impact of the hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype in
ST11-KL47 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp)
pathogenicity warrants investigation for public health risk
assessment.MethodsWe analyzed 230 clinical ST11-KL47 CRKp to identify
the key factor in mucoviscosity acquisition via comparative genomic
analysis. Sedimentation value served as the objective index to quantify
HMV. The virulence in vivo was assessed using Galleria mellonella and
mouse infection models. We employed genome engineering, capsular
polysaccharides (CPS) quantification, and visualization to explore the
role of Wzc mutation in CPS biosynthesis and HMV. The biological impact
of Wzc-mediated HMV was investigated through competitive growth
analysis, biofilm formation, serum resistance, anti-phagocytic ability,
and adhesion assays. Transcriptomic analysis and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) were utilized to explore the relationship between
polysaccharide composition, physical distribution, and changes in
virulence.ResultsThe Wzc mutations are identified as the key to
mucoviscosity acquisition. Unexpectedly, Wzc-mediated HMV CRKp exhibits
reduced pathogenicity versus non-mucoviscosity (NMV) strains in
different animal models, with competitive disadvantage, decreased
biofilm formation, serum resistance, and adhesion, yet higher
anti-phagocytic ability in vitro. CPS extraction and visualization of
genome-engineered strains verify the Wzc mutations mediate HMV by
standardizing CPS chain length and overproducing cell-free extracellular
polysaccharides (cell-free EPS). Transcriptomic results,
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) quantification, and SEM collectively indicate
a downregulation of LPS synthesis and the masking of LPS in HMV
strains.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the Wzc-induced HMV
attenuates ST11-KL47 CRKp virulence by modifying the exopolysaccharide
composition and physical distribution.</p>

microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide and the kidney diseases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite, is a co-metabolite
produced by both gut microbiota and livers, originating from foods rich
in choline or carnitine. Emerging evidence suggests that TMAO may play a
role in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases, including acute
kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Research has demonstrated that
heightened levels of TMAO are correlated with a heightened likelihood of
kidney disease advancement and cardiovascular incidents among
individuals with chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, TMAO has been
observed to stimulate inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in
animal models of kidney disease. Mechanistically, TMAO may contribute to
kidney disease pathogenesis by inhibiting autophagy, activating the
NLRP3 inflammasome, and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore,
targeting TMAO may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of kidney diseases. Future studies are needed to further
investigate the role of TMAO in kidney disease pathogenesis and to
develop TMAO-targeted therapies for the prevention and treatment of
kidney diseases.</p>

epidemiology and public health implications of zoonotic monophasic
Salmonella Typhimurium ST34</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMonophasic Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type 34 (mSTM
ST34) has emerged as a significant global health threat, but our
understanding of its genomic epidemiology and potential public health
implications in international and regional contexts remains limited.
This study aims to fill this crucial gap by assessing the genomic
epidemiology of multidrug resistance (MDR) mSTM ST34, as well as its
clinical characteristics and virulence.MethodsTo achieve the objectives
of this study, we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of mSTM
ST34 isolates. We obtained a global dataset comprising 13,844 strains
from public databases, along with 339 strains from a regional
surveillance collection in Zhejiang Province, China. This dataset aims
to provide in-depth insights into antimicrobial resistance, mobile
genetic elements, and pathogenicity. Additionally, we meticulously
assessed the association between phenotypic profiles and clinical
presentations.ResultsOur findings revealed that the prevalence of mSTM
ST34 has surpassed that of the previously dominant ST19. In addition, we
observed an increase in the detection of the IncQ1 plasmid, which is
responsible for disseminating MDR. The prevalence of mSTM ST34 carriage
was exceptionally high among children (≤12 years old) and elderly
individuals (≥65 years old), with 92.6% of the isolates exhibiting MDR,
including resistance to frontline antimicrobials such as
third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the
human mSTM ST34 strain demonstrates a remarkable capacity for biofilm
formation, which increases its virulence in animal models and
complicates therapeutic interventions.ConclusionsmSTM ST34 has surpassed
the previously dominant ST19, and its ability to transmit across
multi-species increases its potential for further human transmission.
This study addresses critical gaps in our understanding of mSTM ST34
prevalence, highlighting the importance of whole genome sequencing in
surveilling zoonotic pathogens.</p>

microbiota changes among NMIBC patients during BCG therapy: comparing
BCG responders and non-responders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The gold standard for treating high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder
cancer involves the transurethral removal of cancerous tissue followed
by BCG immunotherapy. So far, there is no reliable biomarker for
predicting BCG efficacy and identifying patients who will or will not
respond to BCG treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that urinary
microbiota may play a crucial role in BCG efficacy. This study aimed to
explore (i) changes in urinary microbiota during the six induction
cycles of BCG and (ii) its potential predictive role in determining the
outcome of BCG treatment. To this end, catheterized urine samples were
collected before each of the six BCG doses and bacterial composition was
analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patient inclusion criteria were
male gender, no previous history of urothelial cancer, no other
malignancies, no active infection, and no antibiotic usage for at least
20 days before the first BCG dose. We observed a significant decrease in
biodiversity, measured by the Shannon Index, during the first week of
therapy in 10 out of 12 patients (p=0.021). Additionally, differences in
microbiota composition before the start of BCG therapy were noted
between responders and non-responders to BCG therapy. Non-responders
exhibited a 12 times higher abundance of genus Aureispira (p&lt;0.001),
and, at the species level, a 27-fold lower abundance of Negativicoccus
succinivorans (p&lt;0.001). Throughout the treatment, the abundance of
the genus Aureispira decreased, showing an eightfold reduction by the
end of therapy among non-responders (p&lt;0.001). Our findings suggest
that urinary microbiota plays an active role before and during the
course of BCG therapy. However, this is a preliminary study, and further
research involving larger patient cohorts is needed.</p>

gut microbiome features characterize Fasciola hepatica infection and
predict triclabendazole treatment outcomes in Peruvian patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundFasciola hepatica, a globally distributed helminth, causes
fasciolosis, a disease with significant health and economic impacts.
Variability in triclabendazole (TCBZ) efficacy and emerging resistance
are remaining challenges. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome
influences host-helminth interactions and is associated with
anthelmintic effects, but its association with human F. hepatica
infection and TCBZ efficacy is not well understood.MethodsIn this study,
we investigated the relationship between Fasciola hepatica infection and
the gut microbiome through metagenomic shotgun sequencing of 30 infected
and 60 age- and sex-matched uninfected individuals from Peru.
Additionally, we performed a longitudinal analysis to evaluate
microbiome dynamics in relation to TCBZ treatment response.Results and
discussionInfection was associated with specific microbial taxonomic and
functional features, including higher abundance of Negativibacillus
sp900547015, Blautia A sp000285855, and Prevotella sp002299635 species,
and enrichment of microbial pathways linked to survival under stress and
depletion of pathways for microbial growth. Unexpectedly, we identified
that responders to TCBZ treatment (who cleared infection) harbored many
microbiome features significantly different relative to non-responders,
both before and after treatment. Specifically, the microbiomes of
responders had a higher abundance Firmicutes A and Bacteroides species
as well as phospholipid synthesis and glucuronidation pathways, while
non-responders had higher abundance of Actinobacteria species including
several from the Parolsenella and Bifidobacterium genera, and
Bifidobacterium shunt and amino acid biosynthesis
pathways.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the impact of helminth
infection on gut microbiome and suggest a potential role of gut
microbiota in modulating TCBZ efficacy, offering novel insights into F.
hepatica-microbiome interactions and paving the way for
microbiome-informed treatment approaches.</p>

microbiome is associated with radiotherapy response in lung cancer
patients with brain metastases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeTo investigate the gut microbiome of lung cancer patients with
brain metastases undergoing radiotherapy, identify key microorganisms
associated with radiotherapy response, and evaluate their potential as
biomarkers.Methods and materialsThis study enrolled 55 newly diagnosed
lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Fecal samples were collected
before radiotherapy and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the
gut microbiome’s composition and function. Patients were categorized
into response (n=28) and non-response (n=27) groups based on treatment
efficacy, and α-diversity, β-diversity, and functional pathways were
compared between them. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size was used
to identify microbial features associated with treatment efficacy.
Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive
capacity of clinical and microbial factors for treatment
outcomes.ResultsNo significant difference in α-diversity was observed
between the groups (P &gt; 0.05), but β-diversity differed significantly
(P = 0.036). Twelve characteristic microorganisms were identified in the
response group, including g_ Oscillibacter and g_ Blautia, and nine in
the non-response group, such as f_ Desulfovibrionaceae and g_ Megamonas.
Metabolic pathways associated with treatment response included ketone
body metabolism and pathways related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Multivariate analysis identified g_Flavonifractor (odds ratio [OR] =
6.680, P = 0.004), g_Negativibacillus (OR = 3.862, P = 0.014),
C-reactive protein (OR = 1.054, P = 0.017), and systemic inflammation
response index (OR = 1.367, P = 0.043) as independent predictors of
radiotherapy response. The nomogram and microbiome models achieved area
under the curve (AUC) values of 0.935 and 0.866, respectively,
demonstrating excellent predictive performance. Decision curve analysis
further confirmed these models provided significant net benefits across
risk thresholds.ConclusionsThe composition and functional
characteristics of the gut microbiome in lung cancer patients with brain
metastases prior to radiotherapy are associated with therapeutic
response and possess potential as predictive biomarkers. Further studies
are warranted to validate these findings.</p>
