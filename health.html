CRISPR/cas13a-assisted precise and portable test for Brucella nucleic
acid detection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionBrucella infection in humans or animals can lead to
brucellosis, which has the potential to significantly impact both the
economy and public health. Currently, molecular biological methods for
diagnosing brucellosis are either complex or have low sensitivity, and
it is difficult to apply them in real-life settings in the field.
Therefore, this study aims to establish a rapid and convenient nucleic
acid-based molecular biology method for on-site rapid detection of
Brucella and early clinical screening of brucellosis. MethodsBased on
the conserved sequence of the Brucella Bcsp31 gene, we designed CRISPR
RNA (crRNA) and RAA primers. We developed a fluorescence detection
method and a paper strip detection method by integrating RAA
amplification with CRISPR/Cas13a detection. We applied these methods to
analyze 100 samples of suspected brucellosis-infected milk, 123 samples
of human whole blood, and 100 samples of sheep vaginal swabs in order to
validate their practical utility.ResultsThe RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a Brucella
fluorescence detection method and the strip test method had detection
limits of 100 copies/μL and 101 copies/μL, respectively, and both
methods had a specificity of 100%. The positivity rate of the
RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a fluorescence detection method for the milk, human
whole blood, and sheep vaginal swab samples was 93% (93/100), 82.12%
(101/123), and 91% (91/100), respectively; the strip test method, 87%
(87/100), 64.23% (79/123), and 76% (76/100), respectively.ConclusionIn
this study, we have developed a RAA-CRISPR detection method based on the
Brucella BCSP31 gene, with potential applications in the identification
of Brucella nucleic acid and implications for clinical diagnosis of
brucellosis.</p>

id="brad-m-reveals-differences-in-microbial-communities-between-modic-changes-and-disc-herniation">2bRAD-M
reveals differences in microbial communities between Modic changes and
disc herniation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundModic changes are caused by various factors, such as
degenerative processes, inflammation, biomechanical, genetic, and
metabolic factors, infection, and smoking. Bacteria have been identified
in human intervertebral discs by 16S rRNA sequencing; however, the low
microbial biomass in intervertebral disc tissue limits species-level
analyses using this approach. In this study, we employed 2bRAD-M (2b
Restriction Site Associated DNA sequencing for Microbiome), a new
sequencing technology capable of accurately characterizing bacteria,
fungi, and archaea in samples with low microbial biomass at
species-level resolution.MethodsWe surveyed 20 intervertebral disc (IVD)
samples, including 10 IVD samples with Modic changes and 10 herniated
disc samples. 2bRAD-M was performed to explore whether microbial
differences existed between Modic change and herniated disc
samples.ResultsIn total, 332 microbial species were identified,
including 75 species shared between the two groups. Enrichment for
Escherichia_coli, Cupriavidus_pauculus, and Bradyrhizobium_denitrificans
was observed in the Modic change group, while Afipia_broomeae,
Phyllobacterium_calauticae, Tardiphaga_sp002256345,
Mesorhizobium_sp004136315, Afipia_sp000497575, Burkholderia_contaminans,
and Afipia_sp017474385 were more abundant in the herniated disc group.
Additionally, 19 discriminatory taxa were determined by linear
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). In a random forest model for
partitioning the two groups, the species with the highest variable
importance were Afipia_broomeae, Phyllobacterium_calauticae, and
Escherichia_coli. Moreover, a newly constructed random forest model
based on an optimal marker set consisting of eight highly abundant
species successfully distinguished between the Modic change and
herniated disc groups, with an accuracy of 81.0%. A functional
annotation analysis showed that differentially abundant taxa between the
Modic change and herniated disc groups could be assigned to 4093 COGs
(Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and 342 related signaling
pathways.ConclusionThis study represents the first application of
2bRAD-M to Modic changes and disc herniation, revealing significant
differences in microbial taxa between the two groups. These results
suggest that microbial dysbiosis in the intervertebral disc is
associated with Modic changes and provide candidate targets for further
studies of the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of
Modic changes.</p>

KvarM versus conventional antibiotics: comparative effectiveness in
treating Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in murine intestinal
models</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial
species poses a critical threat by reducing the efficacy of antibiotics
and complicating infection treatment. Bacteriocins, such as klebicin
KvarM, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics
due to their targeted antimicrobial activity. In this study, we
evaluated the therapeutic potential of Eudragit-coated klebicin KvarM in
a mouse model of Klebsiella pneumoniae intestinal colonization,
assessing both its antimicrobial effectiveness and impact on commensal
gut microbiota.MethodsAntimicrobial activity of KvarM in comparison to
conventional antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin was tested in murine
models for K. pneumoniae gastrointestinal (GI) tract infection. The
haemolysin gene (khe) was chosen as the qualitative marker for
Klebsiella genus identification, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of V1-V2
hypervariable region was performed for analyses of gut
microbiota.ResultsOur results demonstrated that KvarM was highly
effective in reducing K. pneumoniae colonization, showing the same
efficacy as ciprofloxacin. Following K. pneumoniae inoculation,
administration of KvarM resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial
load indicating a 99% effectiveness. Furthermore, microbiome analysis of
the gut microbiota revealed that KvarM therapy showed no significant
changes in microbial composition compared with commensal microbiota
composition, whereas administration of ciprofloxacin led to a
significant decrease in microbial diversity.DiscussionThese findings
demonstrate that klebicin KvarM therapy is highly effective for treating
intestinal K. pneumoniae infections and it does not affect the integrity
of the gut microbiota.</p>

id="the-effect-of-glycocholic-acid-on-the-growth-membrane-permeability-conjugation-and-antibiotic-susceptibility-of-enterobacteriaceae">The
Effect of glycocholic acid on the growth, membrane permeability,
conjugation and antibiotic susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGlycocholic acid (GCA) is a steroid acid and one of the
main glycine-conjugated bile components in mammalian bile, which is
involved in the emulsification and absorption of fats and sterols. It is
long-known that the amphipathic nature of bile acids enables them to
interact with the lipid membrane of Gram-positive bacteria and act as
potent antimicrobial compounds. Nevertheless, Gram-negative
Enterobacteriaceae species inhabiting the intestinal tract of mammals
are considered to be more bile-resistant compared to Gram-positive
bacteria and are thought to tolerate high bile
concentrations.ResultsHere, we show that 1-2% of GCA inhibit the growth
of Enterobacteriaceae species, including E. coli, Salmonella enterica.
Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter spp., and Raoultella spp. during their late
logarithmic phase in liquid culture, but not in solid media. Despite
their lipopolysaccharide membrane layer, we demonstrate that, in liquid,
GCA increases permeability, changes the surface of the
Enterobacteriaceae membrane, and compromises its integrity. These
changes result in leakage of cytoplasmic proteins and enhancement of
their susceptibility to antibiotics. Moreover, GCA significantly reduces
bacterial motility, the frequency of bacterial conjugation and
horizontal acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. These phenotypes
are associated with repression of flagellin (fliC) transcription and a
sharp decrease in the occurrence of conjugative pili in the presence of
glycocholic acid, respectively.DiscussionOverall, these findings broaden
the current understanding about bile resistance of Gram-negative
bacteria and suggest that GCA can be used to inhibit bacterial growth,
augment the activity of antimicrobial compounds and diminish acquisition
and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes by conjugation.</p>

plasmids in edema disease: Insights from whole-genome analysis of
porcine O139:H1 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
strains</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This study investigates the plasmid sequences of porcine O139:H1
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) responsible for Edema
Disease (ED). Whole-genome analysis reveals significant similarities
between these strains and known plasmids, notably pW1316-2, which
harbors key virulence genes like hemolysin (hlyA, hlyB) and adhesion
factors (aidA-I, faeE). These genes contribute to the cytotoxicity and
host colonization associated with ED. Additionally, similarities to
plasmids from Shigella flexneri 2a highlight potential associations in
virulence gene regulation, particularly via the Hha-H-NS complex. The
identification of sequences resembling plasmid pB71 raises serious
concerns about the emergence of highly pathogenic strains, as it
includes tetracycline resistance genes (tetA, tetC, tetR). This research
emphasizes the role of plasmid-like sequences in ED pathogenesis,
indicating important implications for swine industry management and
public health.</p>

burden, subtype, risk factors and etiological analysis of enteric
infections from 1990-2021: population based study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundEnteric infections represent a prevalent global health
issue and contribute significantly to the global disease burden. This
study aims to investigate the patterns and trends of enteric infections
from 1990 to 2021, providing valuable insights for health policy
formulation, medical resource allocation, and the optimization of
patient management plans.MethodsWe analyzed the Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) 2021 for 21 regions and 204 countries to understand better the
health burden using prevalence, incidence, mortality, and
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), subtype, risk factors, and
etiology. We tested correlations with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI),
and using decomposition analysis to dissect the reasons behind changes
in epidemiological indicators of the disease.ResultsIn 2021, the
age-standardized rates of prevalence, incidence, deaths, and DALYs per
100,000 population for enteric infections were 879.58, 577.21, 17.83,
and 1020.15, respectively. Compared to 1990, these rates exhibited
-0.18, -0.12, -0.73, and -0.72 changes. Gender and age analyses revealed
a higher burden among females, those under 15 years old, and the
elderly. Regions with low SDI had higher epidemiological indicators. The
burden of Typhoid fever declines in high-development regions. Unsafe
water sources were identified as the primary risk factor globally in
both 1990 and 2021. Rotavirus was the leading cause of deaths and
DALYs.ConclusionThis study highlights the complex epidemiological
landscape of enteric infections, revealing variations in burden, risk
factors, and etiological characteristics across age, gender, and
geographical regions. It underscores the urgent need for healthcare
professionals and policymakers to develop innovative prevention and
healthcare strategies based on the current and evolving burden of
enteric infections, to alleviate the global disease burden.</p>

study of biliary microbiota and identification of bacterial species
associated with pigmented gallstone formation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPigmented gallstone disease (PGS) is prevalent in China.
Biliary microbiota is certified to be related to the PGS
formation.MethodsWe performed 16S sequencing on both bile and gallstone
samples in 16 patients with gallstone disease. We analyzed the microbial
composition of the biliary tract and identified crucial bacteria related
to the formation of PGS.ResultsBiliary tract bacterial composition
analysis showed heterogeneity of dominated genus among individuals and
correlation in bacterial composition between bile and gallstones. We
screened 10 prevalent genera with significant abundance in the bile and
gallstones. Actinomyces, Streptococcus, and Achromobacter had a
significantly higher abundance in gallstones than in bile (P &lt; 0.05).
Furthermore, we identified 32 species that harbored uidA, pldA, and plc
genes that encoded β-glucuronidase or phospholipase. Finally, we
observed an enriched membrane transport for bile resistance through
biliary microbiota.Conclusionβ-glucuronidase-producing Streptococcus
spp., including Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus agalactiae,
and Parabacteroides merdae, harbored both uidA and pldA genes and were
found to be crucial bacterial species in PGS formation.</p>

between hematological inflammatory markers and latent TB infection:
insights from NHANES 2011–2012 and transcriptomic data</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundLatent tuberculosis infection affects about one-quarter of
the global population and can progress to active tuberculosis.
Hematological inflammatory markers, such as the systemic
immune-inflammation index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio,
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, reflect
systemic inflammation and immune status but are understudied in latent
tuberculosis infection. This study investigates the association between
these markers and latent tuberculosis infection in a nationally
representative sample.MethodsData from 7,042 participants in the
2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and
transcriptomic data from the GSE19491 dataset were analyzed. Latent
tuberculosis infection was identified using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold
assay. Hematological parameters were measured via complete blood counts,
and inflammatory markers were calculated through these parameters.
Statistical analyses included linear regression adjusted for confounders
and subgroup analyses. Transcriptomic analyses involved immune cell
profiling, gene set enrichment, and immune checkpoint gene
expression.ResultsIndividuals with latent tuberculosis infection had
significantly lower systemic immune-inflammation index,
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and
monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio. These associations remained significant
after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, and
hypertension. Transcriptomic analyses revealed heightened activation of
memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, increased cytolytic activity, and
upregulated T-cell co-inhibition pathways, alongside differential
expression of immune checkpoint genes in individuals with latent
tuberculosis infection.ConclusionsA lower systemic immune-inflammation
index and other related hematological inflammatory markers independently
correlate with latent tuberculosis infection. These findings underscore
the potential significance of hematological inflammatory markers in
identifying and understanding latent tuberculosis infection. Further
exploration of these markers may enhance diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies of tuberculosis.</p>

analysis reveals link between adolescent acne and altered facial skin
microbiome induced by negative emotional states</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe skin microbiome is integral to maintaining skin
homeostasis and is involved in the pathogenesis of acne. Emerging
evidence supporting the ‘brain-skin axis’ suggests that psychological
stress may exacerbate acne. Both negative emotional states and acne are
highly prevalent among adolescents. Although research has begun to
explore this relationship, the role of the skin microbiome in
adolescents experiencing emotional disturbances and acne remains poorly
understood.Methods166 adolescents aged 15–18 were divided into four
distinct groups based on their emotional health and acne severity: no
acne or negative emotions (NC), acne without negative emotions (NS),
negative emotions without acne (YC), and acne with negative emotions
(YS). Skin samples were collected from each participant’s forehead and
analyzed using high-throughput sequencing techniques, followed by
comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to evaluate the microbial
composition and diversity across the different groups.ResultsAdolescents
with both acne and negative emotions exhibited significantly higher acne
severity (IGA 2.675 ± 0.090) compared to the group with acne but without
negative emotions (IGA 1.952 ± 0.136). Distinct microbial community
patterns emerged among the groups, with acne-affected individuals
displaying increased α-diversity. Additionally, negative emotions were
associated with heightened β-diversity differences between acne-affected
individuals. The predominant bacterial phyla identified were Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria, with Acinetobacter
being more abundant, and Roseomonas and Cutibacterium being less
prevalent in adolescents experiencing negative emotions.ConclusionThis
study revealed that the bacterial biomarkers of the disease change when
acne is accompanied by negative emotions. Cutibacterium, Acinetobacter,
and Roseomonas may be key contributors to acne exacerbation. These
findings underscore the importance of considering both emotional and
microbiological factors in the management of adolescent acne,
particularly within the context of the brain-skin connection.</p>

host humoral innate immune response to the smooth-to-rough adaptation of
Mycobacterium abscessus in chronic infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycobacterium abscessus is a nontuberculous mycobacterium emerging as
a significant pathogen in individuals with chronic lung diseases,
including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Current therapeutics have poor efficacy. Strategies of bacterial control
based on host defenses are appealing; however, antimycobacterial
immunity remains poorly understood and is further complicated by the
appearance of smooth and rough morphotypes, which elicit distinct host
responses. We investigated the role of serum components in
neutrophil-mediated clearance of M. abscessus morphotypes. M. abscessus
opsonization with complement enhanced bacterial killing compared to
complement-deficient opsonization. Killing of rough isolates was less
reliant on complement. Complement C3 and mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2)
were deposited on M. abscessus morphotypes in distinct patterns, with a
greater association of MBL2 on rough M. abscessus. Killing was dependent
on C3; however, depletion and competition experiments indicate that
canonical complement activation pathways are not involved.
Complement-mediated killing relied on natural IgG and IgM for smooth
morphotypes and on IgG for rough morphotypes. Both morphotypes were
recognized by complement receptor 3 in a carbohydrate- and
calcium-dependent manner. These findings indicate a role for
noncanonical C3 activation pathways for M. abscessus clearance by
neutrophils and link smooth-to-rough adaptation to complement
activation.</p>

and phylogenetic analyses of Bipolaris species associated with Poales
and Asparagales host plants in Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bipolaris species exhibit various ecological roles, including plant
pathogens, epiphytes, saprophytes, or endophytes, primarily associated
with poaceous hosts, including cultivated cereals. Iran is known for its
diverse climates and rich flora, which serve as a hotspot for fungal
diversity. In this study, to determine the species diversity of
Bipolaris associated with members of the Poales and Asparagales plant
orders, samples with leaf and stem lesion symptoms were collected from
these plants across various locations in Iran between 2010 and 2022.
Based on the morphological characteristics and multi-locus phylogeny
(ITS−rDNA, GAPDH, and TEF1), nine Bipolaris species were identified:
Bipolaris avrinica sp. nov., Bipolaris azarbaijanica sp. nov., Bipolaris
banihashemii sp. nov., Bipolaris hedjaroudei sp. nov., Bipolaris
hemerocallidis sp. nov., Bipolaris iranica sp. nov., Bipolaris persica
sp. nov., Bipolaris crotonis, and Bipolaris salkadehensis. B. crotonis
represents a new record for Iran’s funga, while B. salkadehensis has
been documented on several new hosts globally. The study provides
detailed morphological descriptions and illustrations of all identified
species, along with insights into their habitats, distributions, and
phylogenetic relationships within the Bipolaris genus. This study also
emphasizes the need for further research into fungal biodiversity in

but non-cultivable state in oral microbiota: a critical review of an
underexplored microbial survival strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The viable but non-cultivable (VBNC) state and persister cells, two
dormancy phenomena in bacteria, differ in various aspects. The entry of
bacteria into the VBNC state as a survival strategy under stressful
conditions has gained increasing attention in recent years, largely due
to the higher tolerance of VBNC cells to antibiotics and antimicrobials
resulting from their low metabolic activity. The oral cavity favors
biofilm growth in dental hard tissues, resulting in tooth decay and
periodontitis. Despite advances in VBNC state detection in the food
industry and environment, the entry capability of oral bacteria into the
VBNC state remains poorly documented. Furthermore, the VBNC state has
recently been observed in oral pathogens, including Porphyromonas
gingivalis, which shows potential relevance in chronic systemic
infections, Enterococcus faecalis, an important taxon in endodontic
infections, and Helicobacter pylori, which exhibits transient presence
in the oral cavity. Further research could create opportunities to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to control oral pathogens. The
inability of conventional culture-based methods to identify VBNC
bacteria and the metabolic reactivation of dormant cells to restore
susceptibility to therapies highlights a notable gap in anti-VBNC state
strategies. The lack of targeted approaches tested for efficacy against
VBNC bacteria underscores the need to develop novel detection methods.
This review discusses the VBNC state, its importance in public health,
and diagnostic techniques, with a special focus on the VBNC state in
oral bacteria.</p>

id="beyond-antibiotics-exploring-multifaceted-approaches-to-combat-bacterial-resistance-in-the-modern-era-a-comprehensive-review">Beyond
antibiotics: exploring multifaceted approaches to combat bacterial
resistance in the modern era: a comprehensive review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antibiotics represent one of the most significant medical
breakthroughs of the twentieth century, playing a critical role in
combating bacterial infections. However, the rapid emergence of
antibiotic resistance has become a major global health crisis,
significantly complicating treatment protocols. This paper provides a
narrative review of the current state of antibiotic resistance,
synthesizing findings from primary research and comprehensive review
articles to examine the various mechanisms bacteria employ to counteract
antibiotics. One of the primary sources of antibiotic resistance is the
improper use of antibiotics in the livestock industry. The emergence of
drug-resistant microorganisms from human activities and industrial
livestock production has presented significant environmental and public
health concerns. Today, resistant nosocomial infections occur following
long-term hospitalization of patients, causing the death of many people,
so there is an urgent need for alternative treatments. In response to
this crisis, non-antibiotic therapeutic strategies have been proposed,
including bacteriophages, probiotics, postbiotics, synbiotics, fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT), nanoparticles (NPs), antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs), antibodies, traditional medicines, and the
toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. While these approaches offer innovative
solutions for addressing bacterial infections and preserving the
efficacy of antimicrobial therapies, challenges such as safety,
cost-effectiveness, regulatory hurdles, and large-scale implementation
remain. This review examines the potential and limitations of these
strategies, offering a balanced perspective on their role in managing
bacterial infections and mitigating the broader impact of antibiotic
resistance.</p>

proteomic landscape of Toxoplasma gondii extracellular vesicles across
diverse host cell types</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as powerful
tools used by pathogens to manipulate host cells, delivering molecular
cargo that rewires cellular processes and the immune response.
Toxoplasma gondii, a globally distributed parasite capable of infecting
nearly all nucleated animal cells, uses this strategy to thrive in
diverse host species and tissue environments.MethodsHere, we reveal the
adaptability of T. gondii EVs through proteomic analysis of vesicles
released from tachyzoites cultured in four different host cell types:
human fibroblasts, green monkey kidney epithelial cells, mouse myoblasts
and porcine intestinal epithelial cells.ResultsA core set of 1,244
proteins was consistently identified across TgEVs, defining a conserved
signature. Beyond this conserved cargo, host-cell specific variation
revealed how T. gondii fine-tunes EV content to exploit different
cellular environments. Functional enrichment analyses revealed roles for
TgEVs in targeting host protein synthesis and stress response pathways,
with implications for immune evasion and infection
spread.DiscussionThese findings provide insight into the potential role
of EVs in host-pathogen interactions and help us understand the adaptive
strategies used by T. gondii to survive and spread.</p>

acid suppresses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection by inhibiting
viral entry and viral main protease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has resulted in significant
economic losses in the global swine industry, making the development of
effective therapeutic approaches a pressing need. In this study, we
found that chebulinic acid significantly restrained PEDV replication in
CCL-81 and LLC-PK1 cells, demonstrated by reductions in viral genome,
viral protein, and titer. Molecular docking analysis made it clear that
chebulinic acid might bind the key amino acids of binding pocket and the
active center of PEDV main protease. Subsequent in vitro experiments
confirmed the inhibitory effects of chebulinic acid on PEDV main
protease, with an IC50 value of 61.53 ± 2.12 μM determined through a
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Additional
investigations demonstrated that chebulinic acid could inhibit the
attachment and penetration processes of PEDV infection. Overall, our
results provide experimental evidence supporting the inhibitory effects
of chebulinic acid on PEDV infection by targeting viral entry and the
inhibitory effects on main protease. The results of this study offer
potential for creating new treatments for porcine epidemic diarrhea.</p>

genomic comparison of gut significantly enriched microbes in obese
individuals pre- and post-bariatric surgery across diverse
locations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionObesity, a pressing global health issue, is intricately
associated with distinct gut microbiota profiles. Bariatric surgeries,
such as Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG), Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG),
and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), induce substantial weight loss and
reshape gut microbiota composition and functionality, yet their
comparative impacts remain underexplored.MethodsThis study integrated
four published metagenomic datasets, encompassing 500 samples, and
employed a unified bioinformatics workflow for analysis. We assessed gut
microbiota α-diversity, identified species biomarkers using three
differential analysis approaches, and constructed high-quality
Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). Comparative genomic, functional
profiling and KEGG pathway analyses were performed, alongside estimation
of microbial growth rates via Peak-to-Trough Ratios (PTRs).ResultsRYGB
exhibited the most pronounced enhancement of gut microbiota α-diversity
compared to LSG and SG. Cross-cohort analysis identified 39 species
biomarkers: 27 enriched in the non-obesity group (NonOB_Enrich) and 12
in the obesity group (OB_Enrich). Among the MAGs, 177 were NonOB_Enrich
and 14 were OB_Enrich. NonOB_Enrich MAGs displayed enriched carbohydrate
degradation profiles (e.g., GH105, GH2, GH23, GH43, and GT0 families)
and higher gene diversity in fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary
metabolite pathways, alongside significant enrichment in amino acid
metabolism (KEGG analysis). Post-surgery, Akkermansia muciniphila and
Bacteroides uniformis showed elevated growth rates based on
PTRs.DiscussionThese findings underscore RYGB’s superior impact on gut
microbiota diversity and highlight distinct microbial functional
adaptations linked to weight loss, offering insights for targeted
therapeutic strategies.</p>

cord blood level of interleukins used as a predictor of early-onset
neonatal sepsis: a comprehensive review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Neonatal sepsis (NS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
both preterm and term infants; early-onset NS (EONS) occurs in newborns
within the first 72 h of life. Cytokines are messengers with low
molecular weight that are produced by macrophages and lymphocytes in
response to antigenic stimulations or products of inflammation.
Different interleukins (IL) have higher values in EONS, when detected
from peripheral venous blood. This review aims to analyze if the
cytokines determined from the umbilical cord blood (UCB) of newborns may
help in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of EONS in newborns originating
from pregnancies with maternal–fetal infectious risk. Three databases,
namely, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for original
research articles that assessed the relationship between interleukins
and EONS. The search results retrieved a number of 18 articles that
complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Some studies report
that neonates with EONS had higher umbilical plasma levels of cytokines
such as IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, and IL-27. However, results are
controversial, as many authors failed to establish the cut-off values of
cytokines detected from UCB that may predict EONS. The main limitations
of the current studies remain the small study samples, the heterogeneous
population, and the lack of stratification of the studied population
according to gestational age (GA). The cytokines that seem to be more
accurate in the early diagnosis of EONS, as reported by the majority of
the studies, are IL-6 and IL-8. The level of these cytokines may guide
clinicians in the careful administration of antibiotics, thus aiding in
the overall reduction of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

and validation of a clinical prediction model for pneumonia - associated
bloodstream infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeThe aim of this study was to develop a valuable clinical
prediction model for pneumonia-associated bloodstream infections
(PABSIs).Patients and methodsThe study retrospectively collected
clinical data of pneumonia patients at the First Medical Centre of the
Chinese People’s Liberation Army General Hospital from 2019 to 2024.
Patients who met the definition of pneumonia-associated bloodstream
infections (PABSIs) were selected as the main research subjects. A
prediction model for the probability of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in
pneumonia patients was constructed using a combination of LASSO
regression and logistic regression. The performance of the model was
verified using several indicators, including receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, decision curve analysis
(DCA) and cross validation.ResultsA total of 423 patients with confirmed
pneumonia were included in the study, in accordance with the Inclusion
Criteria and Exclusion Criteria. Of the patients included in the study,
73 developed a related bloodstream infection (BSI). A prediction model
was constructed based on six predictors: long-term antibiotic use,
invasive mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, urinary
catheterization, vasoactive drugs, and central venous catheter
placement. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the training set and
validation set were 0.83 and 0.80, respectively, and the calibration
curve demonstrated satisfactory agreement between the two.ConclusionThis
study has successfully constructed a prediction model for bloodstream
infections associated with pneumonia cases, which has good stability and
predictability and can help guide clinical work.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of death in
children, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is the main pathogen of CAP in
children in China. Although Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is
usually a self-limiting disease, many children develop multiple
complications due to drug resistance or untimely diagnosis and
treatment, and may even progress to severe MPP or refractory MPP with a
poor prognosis. It is important to explore the value of biomarkers that
can be used in clinical practice to assess the severity of pneumonia and
assist in clinical decision making. In this article, we searched the
literature in the last four years to review the roles of various types
of biomarkers in MPP and the associated clinical predictive models, with
the aim of helping pediatricians to understand the evaluation indexes
related to MPP in children other than microbiology.</p>

gut microbiota promotes the progression of chronic kidney disease in 5/6
nephrectomy mice by Bacillus pumilus gavage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundOur previous study identified differences in the gut
microbiota between patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
healthy individuals. We observed that antibiotic-treated mice exhibited
symptoms similar to those of patients with CKD after receiving a gut
microbiota transplant from patients with CKD. Bacillus pumilus (B.
pumilus), an alien microorganism to both human and mouse gut microbiota,
possesses antibiotic properties that can alter the microbial community
structure. Therefore, this study aimed to explore how changes in the gut
microbiota structure induced by the oral gavage of B. pumilus affect the
progression of CKD. We sought to identify the gut microbes and metabolic
pathways associated with CKD to lay the groundwork for future clinical
probiotic applications in patients with CKD.MethodsWe constructed
sham-operated and 5/6 nephrectomy mice as the sham control (SC) and CKD
models, respectively. CKD models were divided into a control group (CG)
and an intervention group (IG). After 16 weeks of normal feeding, the IG
were treated with B. pumilus by oral gavage, while SC and CG were
treated with PBS once daily, 5 days per week, for 7 weeks. Fecal samples
were collected for 16s rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis, kidneys
were harvested for histological examination, and the colon was used for
RT-PCR analysis.ResultsB. pumilus intervention exacerbated gut microbial
homeostasis in CKD mice and increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen
levels, further aggravating kidney damage. 16s rRNA and metabolomic
analysis revealed that Parvibacter and Enterorhabdus were probiotics
related to kidney function, while Odoribacter was associated with kidney
injury. Metabolomic analysis showed that glycerophospholipid and lysine
metabolism were upregulated in CKD model mice, correlating with kidney
damage.ConclusionThis study shows that changes in the gut microbiota can
affect the kidneys through gut metabolism, confirming that the lack of
probiotics and the proliferation of harmful bacteria leading to gut
microbiota dysbiosis are drivers of CKD progression. Our findings
provide a basis for clinical interventions using gut microbes and offer
a reference for targeted probiotic therapy.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika
represent a major burden on global public health. To fight against these
arboviruses, vector control strategies are a priority. One existing
strategy is based on the use of an endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia,
which reduces the transmission of arboviruses by the mosquito Aedes
aegypti via a pathogen blocking effect. Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti
disrupts several pathways of the host’s metabolism. Trehalose is a
carbohydrate circulating mainly in insect hemolymph and plays a role in
numerous mechanisms as energy source or stress recovery molecule and in
chitin synthesis. This study explores the importance of trehalose in the
interactions between Wolbachia and Ae. aegypti, and attempts to
understand the pathogen blocking effect.</p>

analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPrimary subcutaneous mycoses are a heterogeneous group of
fungal infections caused by pathogenic or opportunistic organisms. In
recent years, cases have steadily increased in Shanghai, an area where
the disease was previously uncommon. This study aimed to summarize
clinical experiences with primary subcutaneous mycoses in Shanghai, to
optimize their management.MethodA retrospective analysis was conducted
at Shanghai Dermatology Hospital from January 2018 to March 2023 and
enrolled 33 patients with confirmed primary subcutaneous mycoses. Their
medical histories, clinical features, histopathological findings,
etiological characteristics, drug sensitivity tests, therapeutic
regimens, and follow-up data were recorded.ResultsIdentification of
pathogens from skin tissue cultures revealed distinct colonial
morphologies across diverse mycological species. The isolates included
yeast (45.5%), mold (30.3%), and dimorphic fungi (24.2%). The most
common species were C. parapsilosis (n = 8, 24.2%), T. rubrum (n = 5,
15.2%), and S. schenckii (n = 8, 24.2%). Thirty-two patients received
systemic antifungal treatment based on the results of the drug
sensitivity test, whereas one patient was treated with complete surgical
resection, owing to a single plaque. Post-treatment surveillance was
important for the effective management of the condition.ConclusionThis
study highlights the considerable diversity among fungal species
implicated in primary cutaneous mycoses and underscores the complexities
involved in their accurate diagnosis and management. Correcting
unhealthy lifestyles, boosting immunity, and completely removing and
avoiding re-exposure to the pathogenic fungi can effectively reduce the
risk of relapse in primary subcutaneous mycoses. Our findings provide
valuable insights into primary subcutaneous mycoses and may contribute
to improved patient prognoses.</p>

the receptors for Mycoplasma penetrans P35 lipoprotein and
characterization of its functional binding domains</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycoplasma penetrans, a prokaryotic microorganism initially isolated
from the urine of a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), possesses a distinctive elongated flask-like shape and a tip-like
structure. This unique morphology has been shown to facilitate its
ability to invade cells both in vitro and in vivo. The adhesion of M.
penetrans to host cells relies on lipid-associated membrane proteins
(LAMPs), especially P35 lipoprotein, which is exposed on the mycoplasmal
surface. In this study, modified Virus Overlay Protein Binding Assay
(VOPBA) was employed to identify P35-interacting proteins from membrane
protein extracts of SV40-immortalized human uroepithelial (SV-HUC-1)
cells. Through recombinant protein binding assays, siRNA-mediated
knockdown, ELISA, Far-Western blot, and inhibition experiments, the
binding mechanisms and functional domains were further elucidated.
Results demonstrated that the P35 lipoprotein interacts with γ-actin
(ACTG1). Recombinant P35 specifically bound to both recombinant and
endogenous ACTG1 on the host cell membrane. ACTG1 partially inhibited
the adhesion of P35 and M. penetrans to host cells. In SV-HUC-1 cells
transfected with ACTG1-siRNA, adhesion of P35 and M. penetrans was
significantly reduced. Further studies identified the functional domains
responsible for binding between P35 and ACTG1 at amino acid residues
35-42 and 179-186. These findings suggest that ACTG1 on the host cell
membrane may act as a receptor for the P35 lipoprotein, facilitating the
adhesion of M. penetrans to host cells. The identified critical binding
regions of P35 represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions
against M. penetrans infections.</p>
