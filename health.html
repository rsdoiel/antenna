RNA GadY in Escherichia coli enhances conjugation system of IncP-1 by
targeting SdiA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Plasmid-mediated conjugation is a common mechanism for most bacteria
to transfer antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The conjugative transfer
of ARGs is emerging as a major threat to human beings. Although several
transfer-related factors are known to regulate this process, small RNAs
(sRNAs)-based regulatory roles remain to be clarified. Here, the
Hfq-binding sRNA GadY in donor strain Escherichia coli (E. coli) SM10λπ
was identified as a new regulator for bacterial conjugation. Two
conjugation models established in our previous studies were used, which
SM10λπ carrying a chromosomally integrated IncP-1α plasmid RP4 and a
mobilizable plasmid pUCP24T served as donor cells, and P. aeruginosa
PAO1 or E. coli EC600 as the recipients. GadY was found to promote
SM10λπ-PAO1 conjugation by base-pairing with its target mRNA SdiA, an
orphan LuxR-type receptor that responds to exogenous N-acylated
homoserine lactones (AHLs). However, SM10λπ-EC600 conjugation was not
affected due to EC600 lacking AHLs synthase. It indicates that the
effects of GadY on conjugation depended on AHLs-SdiA signalling. Further
study found GadY bound SdiA to negatively regulate the global RP4
repressors KorA and KorB. When under ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin
treatment, GadY expression in donor strain was enhanced, and it
positively regulated quinolone-induced SM10λπ-PAO1 conjugation. Thus,
our study provides a novel role for sRNA GadY in regulating
plasmid-mediated conjugation, which helps us better understand bacterial
conjugation to counter antibiotic resistance.</p>

and pathogenicity of Vibrio alginolyticus SWS causing high mortality in
mud crab (Scylla serrata) aquaculture in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionVibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped
bacterium belonging to the family of Vibrionaceae, a common pathogen in
aquaculture animals, However, studies on its impact on Scylla serrata
(mud crabs) are limited. In this study, we isolated V. alginolyticus SWS
from dead mud crab during a disease outbreak in a Hong Kong aquaculture
farm, which caused up to 70% mortality during summer.MethodsExperimental
infection and histopathology were used to investigate the pathogenicity
of V. alginolyticus SWS in S. serrata and validate Koch’s postulates.
Comprehensive whole-genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and biochemical characterization
were also performed. ResultsOur findings showed that V. alginolyticus
SWS caused high mortality (75%) in S. serrata with infected individuals
exhibiting inactivity, loss of appetite, decolored and darkened
hepatopancreas, gills, and opaque muscle in the claw. Histopathological
analysis revealed tissue damage and degeneration in the hepatopancreas,
gills, and claw muscle suggesting direct and indirect impacts of V.
alginolyticus SWS infection.ConclusionsThis study provides a
comprehensive characterization of V. alginolyticus SWS as an emerging
pathogen in S. serrata aquaculture. Our findings underscore the
importance of ongoing surveillance, early detection, and the development
of targeted disease management strategies to mitigate the economic
impact of vibriosis outbreaks in mud crab aquaculture.</p>

id="role-of-cuticular-genes-in-the-insect-antimicrobial-immune-response">Role
of cuticular genes in the insect antimicrobial immune response</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Insects are established models for understanding host-pathogen
interactions and innate immune mechanisms. The innate immune system in
insects is highly efficient in recognizing and opposing pathogens that
cause detrimental effects during infection. The cuticular layer which
covers the superficial layer of the insect body participates in host
defense and wound healing by inducing innate immune responses. Previous
studies have started to address the involvement of cuticular genes in
conferring resistance to insect pathogens, particularly those that
infect by disrupting the insect cuticle. For example, the cuticular gene
Transglutaminase (TG) in Drosophila melanogaster plays a structural role
in cuticle formation and blood coagulation and also possesses immune
properties against pathogenic infection. However, more information is
becoming available about the immune function of other cuticular gene
families in insects. In this review, we aim to highlight the recent
advances in insect cuticular immunity and address the necessity of
pursuing further research to fill the existing gaps in this important
field of insect immunology. This information will lead to novel
strategies for the efficient management of agricultural insect pests and
vectors of plant and human disease.</p>

expression of immune response genes in patients with chronic Chagas
disease is shifted toward the levels observed in healthy subjects as a
result of treatment with Benznidazole</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionChagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite
infection, is a potentially life-threatening neglected tropical disease
with a worldwide distribution. During the chronic phase of the disease,
there exists a fragile balance between the host immune response and
parasite replication that keeps patients in a clinically-silent
asymptomatic stage for years or even decades. However, in 40% of
patients, the disease progresses to clinical manifestations mainly
affecting and compromising the cardiac system. Treatment is recommended
in the chronic phase, although there are no early markers of its
effectiveness. The aim of this study is to identify differential
expression changes in genes involved in the immune response in
antigen-restimulated PBMC from chronic patients with Chagas disease due
to benznidazole treatment.MethodsThus, high-throughput real-time qPCR
analysis has been performed to simultaneously determine global changes
in the expression of 106 genes involved in the immune response in
asymptomatic (IND) and early cardiac manifestations (CCC I) Chagas
disease patients pre- and post-treatment with benznidazole.Results and
discussionThe results revealed that 7 out of the 106 analyzed genes were
differentially expressed (4 up- and 3 downregulated) after treatment in
IND patients and 15 out of 106 (3 up- and 12 downregulated) after
treatment of early cardiac Chagas disease patients. Particularly in CCC
I patients, regulation of the expression level of some of these genes
towards a level similar to that of healthy subjects suggests a
beneficial effect of treatment and supports recommendation of
benznidazole administration to early cardiac Chagas disease patients.
The data obtained also demonstrated that both in asymptomatic patients
and in early cardiac chronic patients, after treatment with benznidazole
there is a negative regulation of the proinflammatory and cytotoxic
responses triggered as a consequence of T. cruzi infection and the
persistence of the parasite. This downregulation of the immune response
likely prevents marked tissue damage and healing in early cardiac
patients, suggesting its positive effect in controlling the
pathology.</p>

of IL-8 secretion induced by PEDV infection via NF-κB signaling
pathway</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is associated with severe
enteritis, which contributes to high mortality in piglets. The aim of
this study was to describe molecular mechanisms associated with
proinflammatory cytokine(s) production during PEDV infection. We showed
that infection of porcine intestine epithelial cell clone J2 (IPEC-J2)
with PEDV induces a gradual increase in interleukin 8 (IL-8) production
at different time points, as well as infection of Vero E6 with PEDV. The
secretion of IL-8 in these two cell lines infected with PEDV is related
to the activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, the cells expressing PEDV M or
E protein can induce the upregulation of IL-8. These findings suggest
that the IL-8 production can be the initiator of inflammatory response
by the host cells upon PEDV infection.</p>

atresia: the role of gut microbiome, and microbial metabolites</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease
affecting both the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, potentially
leading to chronic cholestasis and biliary cirrhosis. Despite its
prevalence, the exact mechanisms behind BA development remain
incompletely understood. Recent research suggests that the gut
microbiota and its metabolites may play significant roles in BA
development. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the changing
characteristics of gut microbiota and their metabolites at different
stages of BA in children. It discusses their influence on the host’s
inflammatory response, immune system, and bile acid metabolism. The
review also explores the potential of gut microbiota and metabolites as
a therapeutic target for BA, with interventions like butyrate and gut
microbiota preparations showing promise in alleviating BA symptoms.
While progress has been made, further research is necessary to untangle
the complex interactions between gut microbiota and BA, paving the way
for more effective prevention and treatment strategies for this
challenging condition.</p>

and phenotypic characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in
a Japanese tertiary care hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This study aimed to investigate the bacterial characteristics of
pneumococcal isolates obtained from a tertiary care hospital in Japan.
We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility, possession of macrolide
resistance genes, pneumococcal serogroup/serotype, and sequence type
(ST) of pneumococcal isolates from patients aged 15 years or older
between 2011 and 2020 at Nagasaki University Hospital. Of the 73
isolates analyzed, 86.3% showed resistance to macrolides, and 28.8%,
46.6%, and 11.0% harbored mefA, ermB, and both, respectively. Of the
isolates possessing ermB, 97.6% showed high levels of macrolide
resistance [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, &gt; 16
µg/mL]. Solithromycin (MIC range, 0.03–0.25 µg/mL), regardless of the
presence of macrolide resistance genes, and lascufloxacin (MIC range,
0.06–0.5 µg/mL) showed potent in vitro activity against pneumococci.
Serotype 19A was the most prevalent (six isolates), followed by
serotypes 10A, 15A, and 15B/C (five isolates each). Four serotypes (11A,
19A, 22F, and 23B) and five STs (36, 99, 433, 558, and 3111) were
significantly correlated with the presence of macrolide resistance
genes. All four isolates with serotype 11A/ST99 and three isolates with
serotype 19A/ST3111 harbored both mefA and ermB. No macrolide resistance
genes were detected in either of the two isolates with serotype
22F/ST433, while all ten isolates with serogroup 15 (serotypes 15A and
15B/C, five isolates each) possessed ermB alone. Our study revealed the
bacterial characteristics of the pneumococcal isolates obtained from our
hospital. In vitro activity of solithromycin and lascufloxacin against
these isolates was confirmed.</p>

composition-based deep learning predicts oncogenic potential of
HPVs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) account for more than 30% of cancer
cases, with definite identification of the oncogenic role of viral E6
and E7 genes. However, the identification of high-risk HPV genotypes has
largely relied on lagged biological exploration and clinical
observation, with types unclassified and oncogenicity unknown for many
HPVs. In the present study, we retrieved and cleaned HPV sequence
records with high quality and analyzed their genomic compositional
traits of dinucleotide (DNT) and DNT representation (DCR) to overview
the distribution difference among various types of HPVs. Then, a deep
learning model was built to predict the oncogenic potential of all HPVs
based on E6 and E7 genes. Our results showed that the main three groups
of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma HPVs were clearly separated between/among
types in the DCR trait for either E6 or E7 coding sequence (CDS) and
were clustered within the same group. Moreover, the DCR data of either
E6 or E7 were learnable with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
Either CNN classifier predicted accurately the oncogenicity label of
high and low oncogenic HPVs. In summary, the compositional traits of HPV
oncogenicity-related genes E6 and E7 were much different between the
high and low oncogenic HPVs, and the compositional trait of the
DCR-based deep learning classifier predicted the oncogenic phenotype
accurately of HPVs. The trained predictor in this study will facilitate
the identification of HPV oncogenicity, particularly for those HPVs
without clear genotype or phenotype.</p>
