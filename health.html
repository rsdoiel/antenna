id="a-short-term-clinical-evaluation-of-immediate-implant-placement-in-periodontitis-patients">A
short-term clinical evaluation of immediate implant placement in
periodontitis patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundWith the advancement of oral implant technology, immediate
implant placement is believed to be feasible for periodontitis patients.
However, there is a lack of high-quality clinical studies regarding this
approach. This study aimed to observe the short-term implant survival
rate and conditions of peri-implant tissues in periodontitis patients
who received immediate implants without systematic periodontal
treatment.MethodsThis retrospective study included 95 patients and 234
implants treated at the Stomatological Hospital of Jinan University from
June 2017 to December 2022. Patients were classified according to the
2018 AAP/EFP periodontal classification system, with Stage determined by
CBCT-assessed marginal bone loss (MBL) and Grade estimated based on
annual bone loss rate, smoking status, and diabetes history. Immediate
implant placement was performed following atraumatic tooth extraction,
with bone defects augmented using Bio-Oss bone graft and covered with
Bio-Gide collagen membrane as needed. Patients were followed up for 12
months, during which implant survival, modified sulcus bleeding index
(mSBI), modified plaque index (mPLI), marginal bone loss (MBL), and
peri-implant probing depth (PPD) were assessed.ResultsA total of 95
patients (234 implants) were included, with a mean age of 58.59 years.
The distribution of Stage II-IV and Grade A-C periodontitis was
recorded. Preoperative assessments showed a significant increase in
P-PDD, CAL, and MBL with greater disease severity (p &lt; 0.001).
One-year follow-up data indicated an implant survival rate of 97.86%,
with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealing significantly lower
survival rates in Stage IV and Grade C patients (p &lt; 0.05).
Postoperative soft tissue health assessment showed significant
differences in mSBI and mPLI between stages (p = 0.002, p = 0.007) but
not grades (p &gt; 0.05). PPD did not differ significantly among groups
(p &gt; 0.05), whereas MBL was significantly higher in Stage IV than in
Stage II and III (p &lt; 0.001), though no significant differences were
observed across grades (p &gt; 0.05). Clinical and radiographic
evaluations demonstrated favorable implant outcomes, with most patients
reporting high satisfaction. These findings reinforce the viability of
immediate implant placement in periodontitis patients, demonstrating
high short-term success rates across different disease severities. While
disease severity and progression rate may influence clinical outcomes,
appropriate case selection, meticulous surgical techniques, and
comprehensive postoperative care can lead to predictable and favorable
implant success, even in patients with periodontitis.</p>

rates of Helicobacter pylori infection and antibiotic resistance in the
eastern coast of China: a single center study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori), linked to gastric cancer,
lacks regional data on infection rates, resistance, and risks in
Dongying, China.MethodsA pilot study (N = 314) using non-invasive string
tests and qPCR assessed H. pylori prevalence and antibiotic resistance.
Logistic regression identified risk factors from survey data.ResultsThe
H. pylori infection rate in Dongying was 24.84% (78/314, 95% CI:
20.06%-29.62%). Of the infected individuals, 60.25% (47/78, 95% CI:
49.40%-71.12%) and 46.15% (36/78, 95% CI: 35.09%-57.22%) showed
resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin,
respectively.ConclusionsThis pilot study provides preliminary data with
valuable insights for preventing the transmission of H. pylori infection
among the urban population in the East Coast region of China and offers
guidance for the personalized treatment of drug-resistant H. pylori
infections.</p>

id="development-and-application-of-a-dual-lamp-lfd-assay-for-the-simultaneous-detection-of-streptococcus-suis-and-glaesserella-parasuis">Development
and application of a dual LAMP-LFD assay for the simultaneous detection
of Streptococcus suis and Glaesserella parasuis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionStreptococcus suis (S. suis) and Glaesserella parasuis
(G. parasuis) are prevalent pathogens in pig populations and are often
associated with co-infections, leading to substantial economic losses in
the swine industry. However, there is currently a shortage of rapid
detection methods. In this study, a dual loop-mediated isothermal
amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (LAMP-LFD) assay was
developed for the simultaneous and convenient detection of S. suis and
G. parasuis.MethodsThe assay utilized primers targeting the conserved
regions of the gdh gene of S. suis and the infB gene of G. parasuis.
Optimal primer sets were identified, and reaction conditions, including
temperature, time, and primer concentration ratios, were optimized using
single-variable control method. The LAMP-LFD assay was established with
biotin and digoxin or biotin and 6-FAM-labeled FIP/BIP primers, combined
with LFD.ResultsThe assay was most effective at a reaction temperature
of 62°C, a primer concentration ratio of 1:4, and a reaction time of 40
minutes. The minimum detection limits were 22 and 18 copies/μL for
recombinant plasmids and 19 and 20 CFU for bacterial samples of S. suis
and G. parasuis, respectively. The assay showed no cross-reactivity with
other pathogens and exhibited high adaptability across various thermal
platforms, including PCR instruments, metal baths, and water baths.
Clinical testing of 106 samples revealed positive rates of 11.32%
(12/106) for S. suis, 25.47% (27/106) for G. parasuis, and 2.83% (3/106)
for mixed infections.DiscussionThis simple, rapid, specific, and
sensitive dual LAMP-LFD assay provides robust technical support for the
prevention and control of swine streptococcosis and Glässer’s
disease.</p>

id="exploring-urinary-microbiome-insights-into-neurogenic-bladder-and-improving-management-of-urinary-tract-infections">Exploring
urinary microbiome: insights into neurogenic bladder and improving
management of urinary tract infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The traditional view of sterile urine has been challenged by
advancements in next-generation sequencing, revealing that the urinary
microbiome significantly influences individual health and various
urinary system diseases. Urinary tract infections in patients with
neurogenic bladder are highly prevalent, recurrent, and lifelong. If
frequent urinary tract infections are not adequately managed, they may
ultimately lead to chronic renal failure. The excessive use of
antibiotics to prevent and treat urinary tract infections may lead to
increased bacterial resistance, limiting future therapeutic options.
This review summarizes commonly used microbiome research techniques and
urine collection methods, compiles current studies on the urinary
microbiome in neurogenic bladder patients, and discusses the potential
implications of urinary microbiome composition for preventing,
diagnosing, and treating urinary tract infections. By summarizing
current research findings, we aim to enhance understanding of the
urinary microbiome in neurogenic bladder patients and promote the
standardization and clinical translation of microbiome research.</p>

id="the-diagnostic-value-of-third-generation-nanopore-sequencing-in-non-tuberculous-mycobacterial-infections">The
diagnostic value of third-generation nanopore sequencing in
non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of
nanopore sequencing technology in non-tuberculous mycobacterial
pulmonary disease (NTMPD) and compare it with traditional culture
methods.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 225 suspected
NTMPD patients admitted to the Fourth People’s Hospital of Nanning City
from January 2022 to July 2024. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), kappa
coefficient, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) of nanopore sequencing, culture, and combined diagnostic methods
were compared to evaluate their diagnostic performance. In addition,
patients were divided into different groups to investigate the detection
of NTMPD by nanopore sequencing technology under different pathogen
concentrations, in cases of concurrent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)
infection, and among the elderly (aged &gt; 60 years).ResultsAmong 139
NTMPD samples, nanopore sequencing detected positives in 113 cases, with
a sensitivity of 81.3%, PPV of 99.1%, NPV of 76.6%, kappa coefficient of
0.759, and AUC of 0.901, demonstrating high specificity (98.8%)
comparable to culture. The combined diagnostic approach significantly
improved the sensitivity (90.6%), NPV (98.4%), kappa coefficient
(0.862), and AUC (0.942) of NTMPD diagnosis. Nanopore sequencing showed
superior diagnostic value in samples with various bacterial
concentrations and in cases of concurrent MTB
infection.ConclusionThird-generation nanopore sequencing technology
serves as a rapid and effective diagnostic tool, which may profoundly
impact the current diagnosis of NTMPD.</p>

and host factors: key players in human metapneumovirus infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a significant global pathogen that
causes acute respiratory tract infections, especially in infants, young
children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Despite its
increasing prevalence, there are currently no vaccines or effective
treatments available for hMPV. The pathogenesis of hMPV infection is a
complex process involving a multitude of host factors and viral
receptors. These interactions determine the virus ability to enter host
cells, replicate, and evade the immune response. This review is the
first to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding
of host–virus interactions in hMPV pathogenesis. By elucidating these
mechanisms, we can identify potential targets for antiviral drugs and
improve the management of hMPV infections.</p>

id="emergence-and-evolution-of-rare-st592-blandm-1-positive-carbapenem-resistant-hypervirulent-klebsiella-pneumoniae-in-china">Emergence
and evolution of rare ST592 blaNDM-1-positive carbapenem-resistant
hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to characterize the genomes of two rare
ST592 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and to explore their evolution into
carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (CR-hvKp).MethodsThe
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using a VITEK 2
compact system. Conjugation experiments were conducted using film
matings. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using the Illumina
and Nanopore platforms. The antimicrobial resistance determinants were
identified using the ABRicate program in the ResFinder database.
Insertion sequences were identified using ISFinder and the bacterial
virulence factors identified using the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB).
The K and O loci were examined using Kleborate. Multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) and replicon type identification were performed by the
Center for Genomic Epidemiology. Conjugation-related elements were
predicted using oriTfinder. The plasmid structure was visualized using
Circos, and a possible evolutionary model was constructed using
BioRender.ResultsIsolates KPZM6 and KPZM16 were identified as ST592 and
KL57, respectively, and were collected from the same department. The
antimicrobial susceptibility testing data revealed that KPZM16 possesses
an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) profile, whereas KPZM6 is a
susceptible K. pneumoniae. The hybrid assembly showed that both KPZM6
and KPZM16 have one pLVPK-like virulence plasmid carrying the rmpA,
rmpA2, and iucABCD-iutA gene clusters. However, strain KPZM16 harbors
one IncN plasmid carrying the carbapenem resistance genes blaNDM-1,
dfrA14, and qnrS1. The results of the conjugation experiments
demonstrated that the plasmid could be transferred to the recipient
strain. It is possible that the NDM-1-producing plasmid was transferred
from KPZM6 to KPZM16 via conjugation, leading to the formation of
CR-hvKp.ConclusionsThis is the first study in which complete genomic
characterization of the rare NDM-1-producing ST592 K. pneumoniae
clinical isolate was performed. This study provides a possible
evolutionary hypothesis for the formation of CR-hvKp via conjugation.
Early detection is recommended to avoid the extensive spread of this
clone.</p>

of PvVir14-derived peptides to improve the serological diagnosis of
Plasmodium vivax infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMalaria, caused by Plasmodium vivax, remains a major
global health problem, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.
This study aimed to investigate the potential of PvVir14-derived
peptides to improve diagnostic accuracy for P. vivax
infections.MethodsThe reactivity of specific PvVir14-derived peptides
against sera from acutely infected individuals from endemic and
non-endemic areas experiencing a P. vivax malaria outbreak was assessed,
as well as their sensitivity, specificity, and
immunodominance.ResultsAmong the eight tested peptides (H08, K09, I03,
G08, F08, H04, L06, and N04), H08, G08, and L06 showed significantly
higher IgG reactivity in sera from individuals living in endemic areas,
mainly within those with multiple malaria episodes. After a P. vivax
outbreak in a non-endemic area, H08 and G08 had the highest IgM
frequencies, however, sensitivity and specificity analyses indicated
that L06 was the most effective peptide for identifying infected
individuals. Depletion ELISA confirmed the immunodominance of L06, G08,
and H08 and showed a significant reduction in IgG reactivity to PvVir14.
The peptides L06, G08, and H08, showed high sensitivity and specificity
as diagnostic tools for P. vivax malaria.ConclusionsThese peptides can
improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in endemic areas, providing
better support to malaria control and management programs.</p>

normalization of microbiota dysbiosis in condyloma acuminatum patients
following treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCondyloma acuminatum (CA) is the most common sexually
transmitted disease and the presence of microbiota dysbiosis has been
observed to promote the progress of the disease. However, the explicit
characteristics of microbiota dysbiosis in CA patients have not been
well elucidated yet.MethodsWe recruited 40 CA patients who received QYXJ
(an in-hospital prescription that has been used to treat CA for many
years) treatment and 40 healthy controls (HC) in the current study.
Before and after two weeks QYXJ administration, the skin microbiome of
each patient was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ResultsHere,
we found increased relative abundances of Staphylococcus and
Lactobacillus, whereas a decreased Escherichia in CA patients relative
to healthy controls (HC). Moreover, we also observed significant alpha
and beta diversity differences between the CA and HC groups, and QYXJ
treatment effectivity attenuated these alterations of genus level and
microbial diversity in patients with CA. Importantly, further microbial
interaction and function analyses revealed the significantly enriched
relative abundance of Caldivirga and Streptococcus in microbial
community, decreased complexity of microbial interactions and
downregulated metabolic pathways in CA patients, including membrane
transport, lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. Remarkably,
QYXJ administration partially restored these microbiota dysbiosis, which
subsequently shifts microbiomes of patients with CA towards healthy-like
microbiota. ConclusionThis study further confirmed the changes of skin
microbiome in CA pathogenesis and firstly revealed the protective
effects of QYXJ in microbiota dysbiosis resolution, suggesting its
potential role as a novel method for CA treatment.</p>
