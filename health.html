of early EHDV2-Ibaraki infection steps in bovine cells by endosome
alkalinization or ikarugamycin, but not by blockage of individual
endocytic pathways</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), an orbivirus, is the
etiological factor of a fatal hemorrhagic disease of wild ruminants. A
subset of EHDV serotypes, including the Ibaraki strain of EHDV2
(EHDV2-Ibaraki), infect and cause disease in cattle, thus posing a
potential threat to livestock. As a member of the Sedoreoviridae family,
the EHDV particle is devoid of a membrane envelope and is predicted to
employ endocytic pathways for infection. However, the degree of
dependence of EHDV2-Ibaraki on specific internalization pathways while
infecting bovine cells (its natural host) is unknown. The endosome
alkalinizing agent ammonium chloride blocked EHDV2-Ibaraki infection of
Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells with dependence on its time of
addition, suggesting the criticality of endosomal pH for the completion
of early stages of infection. Treatment of cells within the
alkalinization-sensitive window (i.e., before endosomal processing) with
inhibitors of actin polymerization, macropinocytosis (amiloride), or
dynamin GTPase activity (dynasore or dynole), or with the
cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, failed to reduce
EHDV2-Ibaraki infection. In contrast, in this same treatment time frame,
ikarugamycin potently inhibited infection. Moreover, ikarugamycin
inhibited interferon induction in infected cells and induced the
accumulation of enlarged Rab7- and lamtor4-decorated vacuoles,
suggesting its ability to block viral processing and modify
late-endosome compartments. Notably, ikarugamycin treatment at initial
infection stages, augmented the infection of MDBK cells with the
vesicular stomatitis virus while inhibiting infection with bluetongue
virus serotype 8. Together, our results point to differential antiviral
effects of ikarugamycin on viruses dependent on distinct sets of
endosomes for entry/processing.</p>

next-generation sequencing assists in the diagnosis of visceral
leishmaniasis in non-endemic areas of China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLeishmaniasis, a protozoan disease caused by infection by
Leishmania, is a critical issue in Asia, South America, East Africa, and
North Africa. With 12 million cases globally, leishmaniasis is one of
the most serious neglected tropical diseases worldwide. Direct
identification of infected tissues is currently the primary method of
diagnosis; however, the low sensitivity and inconvenience of microscopic
examination in detecting amastigotes, parasitic manifestations of
Leishmania, leads to the possibility of misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis,
and underdiagnosis.MethodsWith the development of metagenomic
nextgeneration sequencing (mNGS) technology for pathogen identification,
it is possible to detect specific nucleic acid sequences characteristic
of Leishmania parasites, which opens new avenues for the more accurate
diagnosis of leishmaniasis. In this study, we report two cases of
leishmaniasis from Henan Province, China, in which Leishmania parasites
were identified using mNGS technology, massively expediting diagnosis
and treatment.ResultsOur report demonstrates that the mNGS method is
applicable to peripheral blood samples (PB), which are far more readily
available in clinical settings, in addition to bone marrow aspirate
samples (BM), which are traditionally used for diagnosis of visceral
leishmaniasis.ConclusionOur report validates the efficacy of mNGS
technology as a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis for
leishmaniasis.</p>

new perspectives about the onset of neurological and cognitive deficits
in cerebral malaria: exploring cellular and neurochemical
mechanisms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cerebral malaria is the most severe and lethal complication caused by
Plasmodium falciparum infection, leading to critical neurological
impairments and long-term cognitive, behavioral, and neurological
sequelae in survivors, particularly affecting children under the age of
five. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the neurological
syndrome associated to cerebral malaria condition, including vascular
occlusion and sequestration, cytokine storm or inflammatory response, or
a combination of these mechanisms and despite extensive research and a
growing range of scientific information, the precise pathophysiological
mechanism remains poorly understood. In this sense, this review aims to
explore the neurological impairment in cerebral malaria and elucidate
novel mechanisms to explain the severity of this disease. Recent
evidence implicates glutamate and glutamatergic pathways in the onset of
cerebral malaria, alongside the impairments in the metabolic activity of
other molecules such as dopamine and kynurenic acid. These
neurotransmitters pathways may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis
of cerebral malaria, potentially interacting with other molecular
players. By enhancing our understanding in the pathophysiology of
cerebral malaria, this article seeks to explore new hypotheses regarding
the involvement of neurotransmitters and their interactions with other
molecular targets, thereby contributing to the overall pathology of
cerebral malaria.</p>

and frequency of genetic mutations in three insecticide targets in field
populations of Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Mianyang City, Sichuan
Province, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an important mosquito borne infectious
disease which is mainly transmitted by Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles
(1901) in China. At present, vector control remains an important means
to prevent and control vector-borne diseases including JE. The
development of insecticide resistance has seriously threatened the
effectiveness of insecticide-based vector control programmes. Therefore,
understanding insecticide resistance in the target pest is essential to
inform evidence-based vector control. In Mianyang City of Sichuan
Province of China, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus is the dominant mosquito
species, and JE has been documented in this city. Unfortunately, there
is little information on the status and underlying mechanisms of
insecticide resistance in field populations of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus,
the main JE vector in this region. In the study, a total of 314 adults
of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, collected from 6 sites across Mianyang City,
were inspected for resistance-conferring mutations in three genes
encoding voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), Gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) receptor Rdl subunit (Rdl), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by
DNA Sanger sequencing. The results showed that the classical L1014F
mutation in VGSC was distributed in all the 6 populations at varying
frequencies from 16.98% to 27.78%, and the frequency of F455W mutation
in AChE was extremely high (97.06%-100%). Notably, the conserved
mutations A296S and V327I previously reported in the Rdl of some other
species of mosquitoes were discovered in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus for the
first time. The frequency of the resistant Rdl 296S allele was 62.04% to
94.00%, while the V327I mutation was present at a much lower frequency
ranging from 0.93% to 1.8%. Overall, the prevalent co-existence of
resistance-conferring mutations in multiple insecticide target proteins
in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus populations in Mianyang City indicates a
worrying status of insecticide resistance, and suggests that it is
highly required to monitor the phenotypic resistance of Cx.
tritaeniorhynchus on a regular basis.</p>

bacterial meningitis in southern China: analysis of 838 cases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis work aims to study the clinical features and risk
factors of children with bacterial meningitis (BM) in southern
China.MethodsClinical data of children with BM between 2012 and 2018
from one national center were analyzed retrospectively.ResultsA total of
838 patients (male/female = 1.8:1) were enrolled, with 90.6% under 1
year old. Common symptoms included fever, seizure, lethargy, vomiting,
anorexia, poor feeding, and irritability. Most patients initially
exhibited typical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes of BM, including
elevated white blood cell count, increased protein levels, and decreased
glucose concentration. Some initially atypical cases showed typical
changes after about 1 week. Furthermore, 38.7% of the patients had
positive bacterial cultures of blood or CSF, with Streptococcus
agalactiae, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae commonly
seen. Moreover, 92.0% of the patients were graded five Glasgow outcome
scale (GOS) points at discharge. Differences in symptoms, pathogens, CSF
results, brain MRI, and GOS points were observed across age groups
(neonate [29 days, 12 months) and aged â¥12 months). Fatality rate was
1.9%, and 10.7% of survivors had neurological sequelae. Recurrent BM was
rare (1.6%) but notable in patients with CSF fistula or
immunodeficiency. Risk factors for intensive care unit admission, brain
parenchymal involvement, subdural effusion, and hearing impairment were
identified.ConclusionMost pediatric BM patients in southern China were
under 1 year old, with more distribution in male patients and some
age-related differences in clinical features and outcomes. Recurrent BM
is rare but more likely in patients with conditions such as CSF fistula
or immunodeficiency. Most patients have favorable outcomes, with a low
fatality rate and around 10% of the survivors experiencing neurological
sequelae. Several clinical risk factors were identified.</p>

short ncRNA modulates gene expression and affects stress response and
parasite differentiation in Leishmania braziliensis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The protozoan parasite Leishmania spp. is a causative agent of
leishmaniasis, a disease that affects millions of people in more than 80
countries worldwide. Apart from its medical relevance, this organism has
a genetic organization that is unique among eukaryotes. Studies of the
mechanisms regulating gene expression in Leishmania led us to
investigate noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) as regulatory elements. We
previously identified differentially expressed (DE) ncRNAs in Leishmania
braziliensis with potential roles in the parasite biology and
development. Herein, we present a functional analysis of one such DE
ncRNA, the 147-nucleotide-long transcript ncRNA97, which is
preferentially expressed in amastigotes, the replicative form within
mammalian phagocytes. By RT-qPCR the ncRNA97 was detected in greater
quantities in the nucleus under physiological conditions and in the
cytoplasm under nutritional stress. Interestingly, the transcript is
protected at the 5â end but is not processed by the canonical
trypanosomatid trans-splicing mechanism, according to the RNA
circularization assay. ncRNA97 knockout (KO) and addback (AB)
transfectants were generated and subjected to phenotypic analysis, which
revealed that the lack of ncRNA97 impairs the starvation response and
differentiation to the infective form. Comparative transcriptomics of
ncRNA97KO and parental cells revealed that transcripts encoding
amastigote-specific proteins were affected. This pioneering work
demonstrates that ncRNAs contribute to the developmental regulatory
mechanisms of Leishmania.</p>

microbiota interacting with vitamin D but not anandamide might
contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia: a preliminary study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPreeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific multisystem
disorder and a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality
globally. Despite numerous studies highlighting the potential roles of
gut microbiota, anandamide (AEA), and Vitamin D (VitD) in PE, none have
established them as reliable biomarkers for predicting disease onset.
Moreover, their interactions in late-stage pregnancy women remain poorly
understood.MethodsThirty-four preeclamptic patients (called PE group)
and thirty-nine matched healthy late-pregnant women (called LP group)
were involved in this case-control study. Fecal samples, which were used
to acquire the diversity and composition of gut microbiota, were
analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plasma AEA concentrations and
serum VitD levels were determined by high-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS),
respectively.ResultsIn this study, Î² diversity but not Î± diversity
significantly differed between the LP and PE groups. Compared with the
LP group, the relative abundances of Prevotella,
Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, and Dorea were increased dramatically in
the PE group, whereas the relative abundances of Subdoligranulum,
Parabacteroides, Bacteroides were significantly decreased in the PE
group. Furthermore, women with PE had a substantially lower plasma level
of AEA and a marked decrease in serum VitD compared to normal
late-pregnant women. Lastly, although the serum level of AEA was not
significantly correlated with VitD or any of the top 6 marker genera,
VitD was significantly negatively correlated with the relative abundance
of Dorea, a novel finding in this context.DiscussionThe gut microbiota
profile of the PE group was significantly different from that of the LP
group. Although no significant correlations were identified between the
plasma AEA levels and serum VitD levels or any of the top 6 identified
marker genera, a significant negative correlation was observed between
VitD and Dorea, indicating VitD and gut microbiota have the potential to
be combined targets for early diagnosis and management of PE.</p>

evolution: cryptic species and phenotypic noise with a particular focus
on fungal systematics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The evolution of a species can be understood in the context of two
major conceptsâthe cryptic species concept and the phenotypic noise
concept. The former represents morphologically indistinguishable but
genetically distinct evolutionary lineages, while the latter represents
the phenotypic variations of an isogenic population. Although the
concept of cryptic species currently represents a general topic, its
effect on other aspects of biology, such as biodiversity, ecology,
evolutionary biology, and taxonomy, is still unclear. In particular,
cryptic species cause complications and prevent the development of a
clear taxonomy. The phenotypic noise concept or phenotypic plasticity
generally refers to the various expressions of phenotypes in different
environments. Hence, the cryptic species concept refers to genetic
variations, while the phenotypic noises concept is about non-genetic
variations. Although both concepts are opposites, they each contribute
significantly to the evolutionary process of an organism. Despite the
extensive research studies and publications discussing those two
concepts in separate accounts, a concise account that combines and
compares both concepts are generally lacking. Nevertheless, these are
essential to understand the evolutionary process clearly. This review
addresses the available literature on this topic, intending to provide a
general and overall discussion on both the cryptic species concept and
the phenotypic noise concept and their effect on evolution, ecology,
biodiversity, and taxonomy with a special focus on fungal systematics.
hence, several fungal case studies representing the two concepts are
presented, compared, and discussed for a better understanding.</p>

spectrometry to identify Brucella melitensis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Two factors frequently impede accurate bacterial identification using
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS): inadequate bacterial abundance in real
samples and bacterial combinations. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis and
libraries for bacterial identification, time-consuming culture
procedures are necessary to achieve sufficient concentration and
isolation of a single bacterium. When dealing with hazardous bacteria
like Brucella, which are more difficult to handle and cure, this problem
becomes even more crucial. To overcome these obstacles, Fe3O4 magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs) linked with Brucella-specific antibodies and
MALDI-TOF MS analysis have been used to create a quick and accurate
technique for direct bacterial separation and identification in complex
samples. This method allows MNPs to immune-selectively collect Brucella
cells, which are then deactivated and ready for MALDI-TOF MS analysis by
a formic acid/acetonitrile wash. Rabbits were used to manufacture
brucella antibodies, which have effectively adsorbed onto the
MNPsâprotein A. Any particular Brucella bacteria found in the media
might be absorbed by this MNPsâprotein Aâantibody immunoprobe. The
concentration of Brucella bacterial cells increases the protein
spectrumâs visibility by a factor of 103, making it possible to quickly
identify Brucella spp. without first growing them in cultural
conditions. This method has been successfully used to achieve a limit of
detection (LOD) of 50 CFU/mL in an aqueous medium and genuine
sampleâmilk. The diagnostic time for this harmful bacterium is greatly
decreased because the entire procedure from bacterial isolation to
species identification is finished in less than 60 min. High sensitivity
and specificity are demonstrated by the immunoassayâMS approach, as the
spectral pattern it produces matches well-known databases like SPECLUST
and Ribopeaks.</p>

cross-section study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThe reappearance of monkeypox in non-endemic countries has
preceded critical public health concerns. The publicâs adherence to
preventative measures is influenced by their understanding of the
infectious monkeypox virus (Mpox), attitude toward it, and perceptions
of it. We conducted this study to evaluate the general populationâs
knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of Mpox in Pakistan.MethodsFrom
August 15 to August 30, 2022, 3465 participants in this cross-sectional
study provided information via an online survey. The survey has 37
questions divided into four categories: sociodemographic, knowledge,
attitude, and perceptions of Mpox. Statistical analyses were performed
in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3 and the Pandas, Matplotlib, and stats
libraries.ResultsThe chi-square test and regression analysis evaluated
factors related to Mpox knowledge, attitude, and perception of three
thousand four hundred sixty-five participants. Among the participants,
about 79.51% (2755) were male, and 32.99% (1143) had post-graduation
level education. About 521(99.24) participants with post-graduation
education have positive knowledge with a p-value of 0.0001.
Approximately 66.78% (2314) of participants answered that Mpox is
prevalent in African countries. Almost 85.69% (2969) stated that a virus
causes Mpox, and more than 72.18% (2501) said that Mpox spreads through
contaminated surfaces. About 60.52% (2097) of participants answered that
antivirals are required in treating Mpox patients. Around more than half
of the participants, 52.64% (1824), believe that those who receive the
chickenpox vaccination are protected against Mpox. Itâs interesting to
note that most research participants felt favorably about Mpox. Around
90.22% (3126) of participants believed Mpox would be effectively
eradicated. Most participants, 86.7% (3004), believe that people should
care more about one another nowadays, and 81.36% (2819) believe visiting
areas with a Mpox outbreak is risky. About 83.95% (2909) answered that
during interaction with the Mpox patient, theyâd dress in the
appropriate personal protective clothing, like masks, gloves, and gowns.
At the same time, 77.66% (2691) responded that they would perform hand
hygiene after touching the patientsâ surroundings, like beds, tables,
doors, etc.ConclusionsMaximum research participants showed good
attitudes and knowledge about Mpox. However, it is essential to start
and execute a planned planning framework for public health awareness to
avoid the occurrence and spread of Mpox in Pakistan.</p>

beta-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by targeting
metallo-beta-lactamase VIM-1: a one-microsecond molecular dynamics
simulation study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is a Gram-negative
opportunistic pathogen with a high resistance to beta-lactam
antibiotics, mainly due to the production of metallo-beta-lactamase
VIM-1 (MBL-VIM-1) enzyme. This study aimed to identify new inhibitors
targeting MBL-VIM-1 to restore the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics.
Extensive screening of natural compounds from the COCONUT database was
performed to identify the structural analogs of the existing inhibitor
of the MBL-VIM-1 protein. The virtual screening process selected four
top-performing compounds (CNP0390322, CNP03905695, CNP0079056, and
CNP0338283) that exhibited promising docking scores. These compounds
were then subjected to re-docking and one-microsecond molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations to assess their binding stability and interactions
within the MBL-VIM-1 active site. Finally, post-MD simulation
calculations were employed to estimate the interaction strengths and
compare the efficacy of these compounds against the reference inhibitor.
The findings highlighted that these four potent MBL-VIM-1 inhibitors
show superior binding affinity and stability, suggesting their potential
to combat antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. The identified
compounds offer a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutics to
restore the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics against resistant
bacterial strains. Therefore, further in vitro and in vivo studies are
warranted to validate their potential.</p>

asperellum M2RT4 in the control of Trialeurodes vaporariorum vector of
tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV) and tomato chlorosis virus
(ToCV) through seeds inoculation. TICV and ToCVâs disease incidence,
severity and the yield were also evaluated. All the fungal endophytes
successfully colonized all the tomato plant parts, but the highest root
colonization was observed in H. lixii F3ST1 compared to the T.
asperellum M2RT4 in both seasons. The number of nymphs was significantly
lower in the endophytically colonized tomato plants than the control
treatments in all the seasons and at both sites. However, the lowest
number of nymphs was recorded in H. lixii F3ST1 compared to T.
asperellum M2RT4. On the other hand, the TICV and ToCV disease incidence
and severity rates were lower in endophytically colonized tomato crops
compared to the control plots. This could be attributed to the reduction
in the virus replication and lower feeding ability of T. vaporariorum
that was characterized by less excretion of honeydew causing sooty mold.
However, no significant difference was observed in ToCV disease severity
rates among the treatments and across the seasons. The yield was
significantly higher in endophyte plots than the control treatments in
both sites and across the two seasons. This study demonstrates that H.
lixii F3ST1 and T. asperellum M2RT4 endophytically colonized tomato
plants and conferred systemic resistance against T. vaporariorum vector,
and significantly reduced the transmission of TICV and ToCV,
contributing to high reduction of both diseasesâ incidence and severity
in the field. However, further studies are warranted to confirm these
results at large scale trials.</p>

vaginal microbiota in healthy Japanese women: a combined relative and
quantitative analyses</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis cross-sectional study aimed to characterize the
viable vaginal microbiota and identify host factors influencing this
microbiota by employing a combination of relative and quantitative
analyses.MethodsTwenty-four vaginal fluid samples were collected from
healthy adult Japanese women for analysis. Vaginal fluid pH was measured
using a portable pH meter. DNA was extracted from the vaginal fluid, and
the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences in the V3-V4 regions were analyzed
to identify bacterial species. Additionally, the vaginal fluid was
cultured on four types of selective agar plates. The predominant species
in the growing colonies were identified using colony polymerase chain
reaction, and the colonies were counted.ResultsThe vaginal microbiota
was classified into four categories based on the characterization of the
dominant bacterial population: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus
iners, Lactobacillus gasseri, and a diversity group. The predominant
bacterial species were consistent across methods; however, the levels of
the viable population varied significantly. Body mass index had a
significant influence on the total number of viable bacteria and vaginal
pH, while age only affected vaginal pH.ConclusionsOur findings indicate
that the vaginal microbiome of healthy Japanese women is not only highly
diverse but also affected by host factors such as BMI and age.</p>

of the rpoEc-chrR-chrA operon in superoxide tolerance and Î²-lactam
susceptibility of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe rpoE-chrR pair is a regulatory system used by
photosynthetic microorganisms to overcome singlet oxygen stress. rpoE
and chrR encode the sigma factor ÏE and anti-sigma factor ChrR,
respectively. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an opportunistic pathogen,
is a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterium. Although it is not a
photosynthetic microorganism, a rpoE-chrR homolog (smlt2377-smlt2378)
was found in the S. maltophilia genome. In this study, we aimed to
assess the significance of ÏEc-ChrR pair in oxidative stress alleviation
and antibiotic susceptibility of S. maltophilia KJ.MethodsReverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the
presence of operon. The contribution of rpoEc-chrR-chrA operon to
oxidative stress alleviation and antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated
using mutant constructs and stress-tolerance assays. RNA-seq
transcriptome assay of wild-type KJ, KJÎChrR (chrR mutant), and
KJÎChrRÎRpoEc (chrR/rpoEc double mutant) was performed to reveal the ÏEc
regulon.ResultsThe rpoEc-chrR pair and downstream chrA formed an operon.
Inactivation of chrR upregulated the expression of rpoEc-chrR-chrA
operon in an ÏEc- and ChrA-dependent manner. ÏEc activation contributed
to superoxide tolerance and increased Î²-lactam susceptibility but did
not affect the tolerance to singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.
Transcriptome analysis revealed that expression of the nine-gene
cluster, smlt2375-smlt2367, was significantly upregulated in KJÎChrR and
reverted to the wild-type level in KJÎChrRÎRpoEc. smlt2375-smlt2367
cluster was located upstream of the rpoEc-chrR-chrA operon and
divergently transcribed, seeming to be involved in membrane lipid
modification. Deletion of smlt2375-smlt2367 cluster from the chromosome
of KJÎChrR reverted the superoxide tolerance and Î²-lactam susceptibility
to the wild-type level.DiscussionThe rpoEc-chrR pair of S. maltophilia
was involved in superoxide tolerance and Î²-lactam susceptibility.
Notably, a novel regulatory circuit involving rpoEc-chrR-chrA operon and
smlt2375-smlt2367 cluster was revealed.</p>

factors associated with mortality and pathogen characteristics of
bloodstream infection-induced severe sepsis in the pediatric intensive
care unit: a retrospective cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infection (BSI)-induced severe sepsis is a
common cause of mortality, frequently resulting in septic shock and
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study aimed to analyze
mortality risk factors and summarize pathogen characteristics associated
with BSI-induced severe sepsis in the pediatric intensive care unit
(PICU).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary
pediatric hospital between January 2015 and December 2023, encompassing
children with BSI-induced severe sepsis in the PICU. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory parameters, pathogen characteristics, and
drug resistance profiles of the patients were collected. Clinical and
laboratory indicators along with pathogen characteristics were
summarized. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify
independent risk factors associated with 28-day mortality.ResultsA total
of 192 patients with bloodstream infection (BSI)-induced severe sepsis
were identified, with a 28-day in-hospital mortality rate of 36.98%
(71/192). The incidence of septic shock (42.1% vs.Â 69%, P &lt; 0.001)
and AKI (14% vs.Â 31%, P = 0.005) was significantly lower in the survival
group compared to the non-survival group. In multivariate analysis,
independent risk factors for 28-day mortality were the pediatric
sequential organ failure assessment (pSOFA) score (OR 1.176; 95% CI:
1.046-1.321, p = 0.007) and the P/F value (OR 0.994; 95% CI:
0.991-0.997, P &lt; 0.001). Double organism growth was detected in 8
cultures, and a total of 200 pathogenic bacteria were isolated from all
blood cultures. Of these, 110 strains (55.0%) were Gram-negative
bacteria, 88 strains (44.0%) were gram-positive bacteria, and 2 strains
(1.0%) were Candida albicans. The most commonly isolated pathogens were
Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and
Escherichia coli. The detection rate of carbapenem resistance (CR) in
Acinetobacter baumannii (66.7%) was higher than that in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (15.4%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum
cephalosporin resistance (ECR) and fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR) in
Escherichia coli (E. coli) were higher than those in Klebsiella
pneumoniae.ConclusionIn the PICU, higher mortality was observed in
children with BSI-induced severe sepsis who presented with elevated
pSOFA scores and low P/F values. Acinetobacter baumannii exhibited the
highest levels of CR and FQR, while Escherichia coli demonstrated the
highest level of ECR.</p>

between uterine microbiota and pregnancy outcomes of embryo transfer in
overweight and obese women</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveCurrently, it has been reported that uterine microbiota
affected pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technology, but
little was known in obese women. Thus, this study aims to explore how
body weight affects pregnancy outcomes by comparing the differences in
uterine microbiota between women of normal weight and those with obesity
or overweight.MethodsThe study included 45 embryo transfer cycles.
Patients were divided into two groups based on body mass index (BMI):
normal-weight group, BMI â¤23.9 kg/mÂ² (Con group, n=31) and
obesity/overweight group, BMI &gt;23.9 kg/mÂ² (OwOb group, n=14).
Microbial samples were collected from the catheter tips and analyzed
using RNA Ribosomal 16S.ResultsIn 45 women, the Î²-human chorionic
gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) positivity rate and clinical pregnancy rate 10-12
days after embryo transfer were higher in the Con group. At the genus
level, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the Con group was 2.2
times higher than that in the OwOb group. The Alpha diversity in the
OwOb group was significantly higher than in the Con group (p=0.028).
After regrouping based on Î²-hCG results 10-12 days post-transfer, in the
Con-negative group (the group with negative Î²-hCG in the Con group,
n=16) the relative abundances of pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella
(p&lt;0.001), Parasutterella (p=0.004), Dialister (p=0.01), and
Gardnerella (p=0.029) were significantly higher than in the Con-positive
group (the group with positive Î²-hCG in the Con group,
n=15).ConclusionOverweight and obese women possess a distinct uterine
microbiota, characterized by a lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus
and an increased relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria, along with
specific genera strongly associated with obesity. In individuals with
higher BMI, pathogenic bacteria are more likely to impair endometrial
receptivity, ultimately leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Therefore, modulating the uterine microbiota in overweight/obese women
may improve assisted reproductive technology success rates.</p>

3 is linked to worse liver disease progression in hepatitis C patients
even after SVR following DAA therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and aimsHCV genotype (GT) 3 is associated with rapid liver
disease progression. However, the liver disease progression and its risk
factors in patients with HCV GT 3 infection after sustained virological
response (SVR) following direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) remain unclear.
Therefore, we aimed to investigate the liver disease progression of
patients with GT 3 after SVR.MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort
study of patients with HCV infection who achieved SVR by DAAs. The
clinical outcome was overall liver disease progression (OLDP), defined
as newly diagnosed compensated liver cirrhosis, decompensated liver
cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of OLDP was
evaluated by KaplanâMeier analysis. Cox regression analysis identified
the risk factors for OLDP.ResultsA total of 409 patients (46.9% GT3)
were followed for 43.7 (32.9, 58.7) months. The incidence of OLDP was
higher in patients with GT 3 (4.63/100PY) than non-GT 3 (0.60/100PY; P
&lt; 0.001). According to Cox multivariate analysis, GT 3 was
significantly associated with OLDP (HR 6.41, 95% CI 1.82 - 22.56;
P=0.004). The predictors of OLDP in patients with GT 3 were HCV
recurrence (HR 12.15, 95% CI 3.18 - 46.46; P &lt; 0.001) and FIB-4 &gt;
3.25 (HR 16.40, 95% CI 1.03 - 39.81; P = 0.046) at
baseline.ConclusionHCV GT 3-infected patients remain at a higher risk of
OLDP even after achieving SVR by DAAs, especially patients with advanced
liver fibrosis and at high risk for reinfection or virological late
relapse.</p>

and simple detection of Candida albicans using closed dumbbell-mediated
isothermal amplification</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCandida albicans, a human fungal pathogen, multiplies to
invade body cells and causes fungal diseases in the condition of
insufficient bodyâs immune function. Early detection of C. albicans is
required to guide appropriate prevention and treatment.MethodsThe
purpose of this study was to establish a C. albicans assay based on
newly developed closed dumbbell-mediated isothermal amplification (CDA)
to achieve rapid and simple point of care diagnostic. The CDA technique
was carried out by specific primers targeting at the conserved C.
albicans ITS2 gene. All primers were selected and evaluated by real-time
fluorescence monitoring and endpoint visual judgement indicated by
hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB). Optimal primers and accelerate primers (out
primers and loop primers) were designed and selected after confirmation
of the fundamental CDA primers to achieve more efficient CDA reaction
for C. albicans detection (CA-OL-CDA).ResultsAfter establishment of the
assay, 9 non-Candida albicans strains, including 3 Candida species were
tested to negative by adopting the established CA-OL-CDA assay,
indicated high specificity. The limit of detection of Candida albicans
DNA by CA-OL-CDA assay was 6.2Ã10-6 ng/Î¼L of DNA (10 copies/Î¼L), 10-fold
more sensitive than real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).DiscussionThe
CA-OL-CDA assay exhibited advantages of high specificity, sensitivity,
simpler and more efficient operation. In addition, the CA-OL-CDA method
holds potential in on-site detection for C. albicans using color shift
by adopting the reaction mixture based on HNB.</p>

blood microbiome of Mastomys rodents: implications for disease
spill-over at the animal-human interface within the Bushbuckridge-East
community, South Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The Bushbuckridge-East community in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa
is bordered by nature reserves, including the Manyeleti Game Reserve.
Murid rodents are prevalent in both Manyeleti and communal rangelands
adjoining the community households. Although rodents are reservoir hosts
for a broad range of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens, the
rodent microbial diversity and transmission of zoonotic agents to humans
in the community is understudied. In this study we investigated
bacterial diversity in wild and commensal rodents sampled from different
habitats. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from DNA extracted from the
blood of 24 wild Mastomys and one Steatomys sp. and subjected to PacBio
circular consensus sequencing. As Bartonella species were dominant in
the blood microbiome, gltA gene characterization was performed to
delineate species. Rodents sampled from peri-urban and communal
rangelands had higher proportions of Bartonella spp. [Hlalakahle
(77.7%), Gottenburg (47.8%), Tlhavekisa (83.8%)] compared to those from
the protected habitat (43.8%). Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and
Coxiella burnetii were detected at &lt;1% of the sequence reads.
Conventional PCR and sequencing validated the detection of Bartonella
spp. with the first confirmation of Bartonella mastomydis infection in
Mastomys in South Africa. Additionally, 317 mites, 90 fleas, 10 ticks
and eight lice were collected from the rodents, providing evidence of
possible vectors of the organisms detected. The detection of zoonotic
agents in rodents in Bushbuckridge-East community, together with prior
serological confirmation of Bartonella and Coxiella in non-malarial
acute febrile patients from this community, highlights the possible
risks that commensal rodents pose to human health.</p>

Zhishi Daozhi decoction on constipation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundConstipation is a common digestive system disorder, which
is closely related to the intestinal flora. Zhishi Daozhi decoction
(ZDD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription used to treat
constipation caused by indigestion. This study is to evaluate the
efficacy of ZDD in treating constipation and to elucidate the underlying
mechanism.MethodsIn this study, Kunming mice were administered a
high-protein diet (HFHPD) and loperamide hydrochloride injections to
induce constipation. The mice then received varying doses (2.4, 4.7, and
9.4 mg/kg) of ZDD for seven days. Following the sampling process, we
measured fecal microbial activity. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and aquaporin-3 (AQP3) were
quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Changes in the gut
microbiota were evaluated through 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Additionally, we investigated the correlation between specific
microbiota features and the levels of 5-HT, VIP, and AQP3.ResultsThe
fecal surface of the mice in the model group (CMM) was rough and dry.
The stool of mice in the low-dose ZDD group (CLD), medium-dose ZDD group
(CMD), and high-dose ZDD group (CHD) exhibited a smoother texture,
closely resembling that of the normal group (CNM). 5-HT levels in the
CMM group were significantly lower than in the CNM, CLD, and CHD. VIP
levels in the CMD were lower than in the other four groups, and AQP3
levels in CMM showed a decreasing trend. The fecal microbial activity of
the CMM group was significantly higher than that of the other groups.
Diversity analysis indicated that CMD and CHD treatments were more
effective in restoring the intestinal microbiota structure. Potential
pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium, Aerococcus, Jeotgalicoccus,
and Staphylococcus were enriched in CMM. In contrast, beneficial
bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, Bacillaceae, and Bacillus were more
prevalent in the CLD, CMD, and CHD. Correlation analysis revealed that
Streptococcus and Enterococcus were positively correlated with VIP,
while Succinivibrio showed a negative correlation with
5-HT.ConclusionsConstipation induced by HFHPD and loperamide
hydrochloride disrupts the structure of the intestinal microbiota. ZDD
appears to alleviate constipation, potentially through mechanisms linked
to the brain-gut axis and its interaction with the intestinal
microbiota. Among the treatment groups, the medium dose of ZDD
demonstrated the most effective results.</p>

sepsis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSepsis is a risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) in
neonates, for which no effective treatment exists. The phosphodiesterase
inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX) has demonstrated renal protection from
ischemia and inflammation in adult rodents. We hypothesized that
addition of PTX to antibiotics may attenuate immune and histological AKI
in a murine neonatal sepsis model.MethodsPostnatal (PN) day 1 C57BL/6J
mice were injected with E. coli K1 strain at 105 colony forming units
per gram weight or saline control. After 1.5 hours, septic pups randomly
received saline, gentamicin or cefotaxime, with/without PTX. 5.5h after
sepsis initiation, kidneys and blood were harvested for measurements of
biomarkers of inflammation and kidney injury. Renal sections from PN7
mice were used for histology and immunofluorescence. Linear mixed effect
models were employed to fit the outcomes including interaction between
treatment group and sex.ResultsSeptic mice demonstrated robust
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and biomarkers of
tubular injury in renal tissue, which were attenuated in response to
combined PTX and antibiotics (gentamicin or cefotaxime): chemokines
(p&lt;0.001), plasma (p&lt;0.01) and tissue IL-6 (p&lt;0.05), plasma TNF
(p&lt;0.001), NGAL (p&lt;0.01), CXCL10 (p&lt;0.01), osteopontin
(p&lt;0.05), and VEGF (p&lt;0.05), with a trend for KIM-1 (tissue
concentration: p=0.21, fluorescence area: p=0.12). Interactions between
treatment and sex were present for several cytokines and kidney injury
biomarkers. Immunofluorescence findings for the tubular injury markers
(NGAL and KIM-1) were consistent with biomarker expression in tissue
lysates.ConclusionNeonatal E. coli sepsis leads to increased expression
of renal tissue inflammation and injury biomarkers consistent with AKI,
which may be attenuated with PTX combined with antibiotic treatment.</p>

indole-mediated stress response</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Indole, a crucial bacterial signaling molecule, plays a fundamental
role in regulating various physiological processes within bacteria,
including growth, acid tolerance, biofilm development, motility, and
other cellular functions. Its regulatory influence extends beyond
indole-producing bacteria, significantly impacting the physiological
activities in non-indole-producing species. In this study, we
demonstrate that indole enhances the pathogenicity and viability of
Klebsiella pneumoniae using the Galleria mellonella infection model and
serum killing assay. Concurrently, indole has varying effects on biofilm
formation in K. pneumoniae, with some strains showing enhanced biofilm
formation ability. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms,
transcriptome analysis revealed that indole exposure in K. pneumoniae
led to the upregulation of genes associated with pili formation and iron
acquisition systems, while simultaneously inducing oxidative stress
responses. Additionally, our analysis uncovered extensive metabolic
remodeling. Specifically, we observed significant upregulation of genes
involved in simple carbohydrate utilization pathways, including those
responsible for galactose, mannose, and maltose metabolism, as well as
enhanced expression of genes associated with pyrimidine biosynthesis.
These findings collectively indicate that indole enhances the intestinal
colonization and pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae primarily by modulation
of fimbriae expression and metabolic pathway regulation.</p>

<p>BackgroundIntracranial imaging abnormalities are commonly observed in
patients suffering from HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, both
before and during the treatment period. This study aims to analyze the
prevalence, origins, radiological characteristics, treatments, and
prognosis of intracranial lesions in patients with HIV-associated
cryptococcal meningitis, thereby providing references for future
clinical decision-making.MethodsThe clinical data of patients diagnosed
with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and admitted to the Shanghai
Public Health Clinical Centre between 2013 and 2019 were collected.
Logistic regression analysis was subsequently conducted to identify
potential risk factors associated with the development of intracranial
lesions in this patient group.ResultsOf 211 patients analyzed, 64.5%
(136/211) had intracranial lesions during treatment and follow-up.
Initial cranial imaging showed 60% had lesions pre-treatment. Throughout
treatment, 32.7% (52/159) developed new or worsened lesions. Mortality
rates at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 2 years for those with detected lesions
were 3%, 7.6%, and 13.2%, respectively. Lesions were primarily caused by
Cryptococcus (70.5%) and Mycobacterium (24.3%). Lacunar infarcts,
especially in the basal ganglia, were the most common type. Patients
aged 50 years or older, and those presenting with altered mental status
upon admission, were found to be more likely to have intracranial
lesions at baseline, with adjusted odds ratios of 5.364 (95% CI:
1.468-19.591, P=0.011) and 7.970 (95% CI: 2.241-28.337, P=0.001),
respectively. Patients with lesion progression showed higher levels of
IFN-Î³, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1Ra, IL-1Î², GM-CSF, Eotaxin, and Basic FGF
in cerebrospinal fluid after four weeks of
treatment.ConclusionIntracranial lesions in HIV-associated cryptococcal
meningitis patients are mostly due to Cryptococcus and Mycobacterium
infections. They often appear as lacunar infarcts, predominantly in the
basal ganglia, and can worsen with treatment initiation, possibly due to
higher baseline cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

the associations of gut microbiota with inflammatory and the early
hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage: from change to potential
therapeutic objectives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAlthough a great deal of research has explored the
possibility of a systemic inflammatory response and dysbiosis of the gut
microbiota after an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the relationships
between gut microbiota and blood inflammatory indicators as well as
their role in the hematoma expansion following an early-stage
mild-to-moderate ICH (emICH) remain unknown. This study analyzes these
changes and associations in order to predict and prevent hematoma
expansion after emICH.MethodsThe study included 100 participants, with
70 individuals diagnosed with emICH (30 with hematoma expansion and 40
without hematoma expansion, referred to as the HE and NE groups) and 30
healthy controls matched in terms of age and gender (HC). We used 16S
rRNA gene sequencing to explore the gut microbial structure and its
underlying associations with blood inflammatory parameters in the HE
group.ResultsOur findings showed a significant decrease in the diversity
and even distribution of microorganisms in the HE group when compared to
the HC and NE groups. The composition of the gut microbiota experienced
notable alterations in the emICH group, especially in HE. These changes
included a rise in the number of gram-negative pro-inflammatory bacteria
and a decline in the level of probiotics. Furthermore, we observed
strong positive connections between bacteria enriched in the HE group
and levels of systemic inflammation. Several microbial biomarkers
(e.g.Â Escherichia_Shigella, Enterobacter, and Porphyromonas) were
revealed in disparateiating HE from HC and NE. Analysis of the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) exposed disturbances in
essential physiological pathways, especially those related to
inflammation (such as the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway), in the
HE group.ConclusionsOur exploration indicated that individuals with
emICH, especially those with HE, demonstrate notably different
host-microbe interactions when compared to healthy individuals. We
deduced that emICH could rapidly trigger the dysbiosis of intestinal
flora, and the disturbed microbiota could, in turn, exacerbate
inflammatory response and increase the risk of hematoma expansion. Our
comprehensive research revealed the potential of intestinal flora as a
potent diagnostic tool, emphasizing its significance as a preventive
target for HE.</p>

years retrospective analysis of epidemiology, antifungal resistance and
a nomogram model for 30-day mortality in nosocomial candidemia
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe incidence of nosocomial candidemia has increased in
recently years, however, the epidemiological data remain insufficient in
China.MethodsA total of 234 candidemia patients were included from
Xiamen University Zhong Shan hospital between January 2006 and October
2024. Incidence, species proportion, distribution, antifungal drug
resistance of candidemia was analyzed. A nomogram model for 30-day
morbidity of candidemia was determined using the least absolute
shrinkage and logistic regression analysis.ResultsThe incidence of
candidemia increased in recent years (2020: 0.025%, 2021: 0.029%,
2023:0.022%). The dominant species of candidemia were Candida albicans
(n=99,42.31%), Candida parapsilosis (n=47,20.09%), Candida tropicalis
(n=43,18.38%), Candida glabrata (n=31,13.25%). Departments with a higher
detection of candidemia included intensive care unit (n=55), emergency
department (n=24) and hepatobiliary surgery (n=22). Candida tropicalis
performed the highest resistance to azole (fluconazole: 55.81%,
voriconazole:55.00% and itraconazole:58.14%). The resistance of Candida
albicans to fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole were 32.32%,
23.53% and 31.31%. The mortality rate of 30-day discharge for candidemia
reached 52.99%. 205 cases of candidemia patients from January 2006 to
December 2023 were included as the training set, while 29 cases of
candidiasis patients from January to October 2004 were included as the
validation set. Five independent factors included Candida albicans,
decreased albumin, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, solid tumor and
septic shock were adopted in a nomogram for 30-days mortality of
candidemia. In the training set, the area under curve was 0.866 (95%CI:
0.817-0.916), the optimal cutoff value was 0.617, the sensitivity was
80% and the specificity was 80.4%. In the validation set, the area under
curve was 0.808 (95%CI:0.737-0.970), the optimal cutoff value was 0.543.
The sensitivity was 72.7% and the specificity was 83.3%.ConclusionThe
incidence of nosocomial candidemia has risen in recent years. Candida
albicans remains the primary species, with the highest incidence is
intensive care unit. Candida tropicalis exhibits the highest resistance
rate to azole drugs. A nomogram predicting 30-day mortality discharge
for candidemia patients has been constructed, and the independent risk
factors including Candida albicans, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome,
septic shock, solid tumors, and decreased albumin.</p>
