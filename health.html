id="the-cooperation-between-orf-virus-and-staphylococcus-aureus-leads-to-intractable-lesions-in-skin-infection">The
cooperation between orf virus and Staphylococcus aureus leads to
intractable lesions in skin infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
A large amount of evidence shows that different kinds of microorganisms
can jointly cope with environmental pressures including cell hosts. For
example, in many cases, it has been found that secondary or mixed
infection of animals caused by ORFV (an epitheliophilic Parapoxvirus)
and bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus) shows a
mutual aid mode that indirectly leads to the deterioration of the
disease. However, the lack of research on the co-pathogenic mechanism,
including how to hijack and destroy the cell host in the pathological
microenvironment, has hindered the in-depth understanding of the
pathogenic process and consequences of this complex infection and the
development of clinical treatment methods. Here, we summarized the
current strategies of trapping cell hosts together, based on the
previously defined ORFV-Host (O-H) system. The opportunistic invasion of
<italic>S. aureus</italic> destroyed the delicate dynamic balance of the
O-H, thus aggravating tissue damage through bacterial products (mediated
by Agr), even causing sepsis or inducing cytokine storms. In fact, the
virus products from its adaptive regulatory system (VARS) weaken the
immune attacks and block molecular pathways, so that <italic>S.
aureus</italic> can settle there more smoothly, and the toxins can
penetrate into local tissues more quickly. This paper focuses on the
main challenges faced by cell hosts in dealing with mixed infection,
which provides a starting point for us to deal with this disease in the
future.

id="probiotics-for-functional-constipation-in-children-an-overview-of-overlapping-systematic-reviews">Probiotics
for functional constipation in children: an overview of overlapping
systematic reviews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analysis (MAs) aimed
to systematically collate, appraise and synthesize evidence of
probiotics for functional constipation (FC) in children.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
SRs/MAs of probiotics for FC in children were systematic identified by
searching Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of science.
Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) were unitized by two reviewers independently to assess the
methodological quality, reporting quality, and quality of evidence,
respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Seven SRs/MAs met the eligibility criteria and were included in this
study. According to AMSTAR-2, a very low methodological quality
assessment was given to the included SRs/MAs due to the limitations of
items 2, 4 and 7. For the PRISMA statement, the overall quality of
reporting was unsatisfactory due to the lack of reporting on protocol,
risk of bias across studies, synthesis of results, and additional
analysis. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence for outcomes was
rated as very low to moderate.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Probiotics may be beneficial in improving FC in children. Because of
limitations and inconsistent conclusions, further rigorous, normative
and comprehensive SRs/MAs are needed to provide robust evidence for
definitive conclusions.

id="anti-obesity-effects-by-parasitic-nematode-trichinella-spiralis-total-lysates">Anti-obesity
effects by parasitic nematode (Trichinella spiralis) total lysates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Obesity is an inducible factor for the cause of chronic diseases and is
described by an increase in the size and number of adipocytes that
differentiate from precursor cells (preadipocytes). Parasitic helminths
are the strongest natural trigger of type 2 immune system, and several
studies have showed that helminth infections are inversely correlated
with metabolic syndromes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methodology/Principal findings
</title>
<p>
To investigate whether helminth-derived molecules have therapeutic
effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, we isolated total
lysates from <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> muscle larvae. We
then checked the anti-obesity effect after intraperitoneal
administration and intraoral administration of total lysate from
<italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae in a diet-induced obesity
model. <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysates protect against
obesity by inhibiting the proinflammatory response and/or enhancing M2
macrophages. In addition, we determined the effects of total lysates
from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae on anti-obesity
activities in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by investigating the expression
levels of key adipogenic regulators, including peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding
protein alpha (C/EBPα) and adipocyte protein 2 (aP2). Oil Red O staining
showed that the total lysates from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle
larvae decreased the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by
decreasing the number of lipid droplets. In addition, the production
levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α were
examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). <italic>T.
spiralis</italic> total lysates decreased intracellular lipid
accumulation and suppressed the expression levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα and
aP2.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion/Significance
</title>
<p>
These results show that <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysate
significantly suppresses the symptoms of obesity in a diet- induced
obesity model and 3T3-L1 cell differentiation and suggest that it has
potential for novel anti-obesity therapeutics.

staphylococcal small-colony variants in cardiac implantable electronic
device infections: clinical characteristics, management, and genomic
insights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
Staphylococcal small-colony variants (SCVs) are common in cardiac
implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. This is the first
retrospective and multi-case study on CIED infections due to
staphylococcal SCVs, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the
clinical management of CIED and device-related infections caused by
staphylococcal SCVs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Ninety patients with culture positive CIED infections were enrolled
between 2021 and 2022. We compared the demographic and clinical
characteristics of patients with and without SCVs and performed genomic
studies on SCVs isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Compared to patients without SCVs, those with SCVs had a longer primary
pacemaker implantation time and were more likely to have a history of
device replacement and infection. They showed upregulated inflammatory
indicators, especially higher NEUT% (52.6 vs. 26.8%, <italic>P</italic>
= 0.032) and they had longer hospital stays (median 13 vs. 12 days,
<italic>P</italic> = 0.012). Comparative genomics analysis was performed
on <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> wild-type and SCVs. Some
genes were identified, including <italic>aap</italic>, genes encoding
adhesin, CHAP domain-containing protein, LPXTG cell wall anchor
domain-containing protein, and YSIRK-type signal peptide-containing
protein.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Staphylococcal SCVs affect the clinical characteristics of CIED
infections. The process of staphylococcal SCVs adherence, biofilm
formation, and interaction with neutrophils play a vital role.

vitro antibacterial activity of antiretroviral drugs on key commensal
bacteria from the human microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy in HIV-infected
patients. However, people living with HIV under antiretroviral therapy
are at higher risks of developing chronic complications and acquiring
multidrug resistant bacteria than healthy population. These factors have
been associated with shifts in gut microbiome composition and immune
activation. It is unclear how antiretroviral drugs affect gut microbiota
composition, but it has been observed that antiretroviral treatment is
not able to fully restore gut health after HIV infection. Additionally,
some antiretroviral drugs have shown antibacterial activity suggesting
that these drugs could have a direct impact on the human microbiome
composition.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We determined the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of 16
antiretroviral drugs against a set of key clinically relevant and human
commensal bacterial strains.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our results demonstrate that 5 antiretroviral drugs have <italic>in
vitro</italic> antibacterial activity against gut and vaginal human
commensal bacteria. Zidovudine has antibacterial activity against
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella
pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, abacavir
against <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, efavirenz against
<italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and
bictegravir against <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and <italic>G.
vaginalis</italic>. Moreover, we describe for the first time that
elvitegravir has antibacterial activity against <italic>G.
vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and, most importantly,
against vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and
methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains
with MIC values of 4-16 and 4 µg/mL, respectively showing high level of
effectiveness against the tested multidrug-resistant bacteria.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Our results underscore that some antiretroviral drugs may influence the
human microbiota composition. In addition, we report the potential use
of elvitegravir to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria
warranting the need of clinical studies to repurpose this antiretroviral
drug.

id="chronic-blue-light-emitting-diode-exposure-harvests-gut-dysbiosis-related-to-cholesterol-dysregulation">Chronic
blue light-emitting diode exposure harvests gut dysbiosis related to
cholesterol dysregulation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Night shift workers have been associated with circadian dysregulation
and metabolic disorders, which are tightly coevolved with gut
microbiota. The chronic impacts of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting
at night on gut microbiota and serum lipids were investigated. Male
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to blue or white LED lighting at Zeitgeber
time 13.5-14 (ZT; ZT0 is the onset of “lights on” and ZT12 is the
“lights off” onset under 12-hour light, 12-hour dark schedule). After 33
weeks, only the high irradiance (7.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of blue LED light
reduced the alpha diversity of gut microbiota. The high irradiance of
white LED light and the low irradiance (3.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of both
lights did not change microbial alpha diversity. However, the low
irradiance, but not the high one, of both blue and white LED
illuminations significantly increased serum total cholesterol (TCHO),
but not triglyceride (TG). There was no significant difference of
microbial abundance between two lights. The ratio of beneficial to
harmful bacteria decreased at a low irradiance but increased at a high
irradiance of blue light. Notably, this ratio was negatively correlated
with serum TCHO but positively correlated with bile acid biosynthesis
pathway. Therefore, chronic blue LED lighting at a high irradiance may
harvest gut dysbiosis in association with decreased alpha diversity and
the ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria to specifically dysregulates
TCHO metabolism in mice. Night shift workers are recommended to be avoid
of blue LED lighting for a long and lasting time.

detection of Seneca Valley virus by one-tube RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a
assay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Senecavirus A (SVA) is a highly contagious virus that causes vesicular
disease in pigs. At present, laboratory detection methods, such as virus
isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), required precision
instruments and qualified personnel, making them unsuitable for
point-of-care tests (POCT). Fortunately, the emergence of CRISPR/Cas
system has provided new opportunities for fast and efficient pathogen
detection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study successfully developed a precise and sensitive detection
platform for diagnosing SVA by combining the CRISPR system with
recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The minimum detection limit of the assay was 10 copies of the SVA
genome. Meanwhile, the assay demonstrated high specificity. To validate
the effectiveness of this system, we tested 85 swine clinical samples
and found that the fluorescence method had a 100% coincidence rate
compared to RT-qPCR.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Overall, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay established in our study is a
highly effective method for detecting SVA and holds great potential for
practical applications in the resource-limited settings.

id="ghrelin-regulating-liver-activity-and-its-potential-effects-on-liver-fibrosis-and-echinococcosis">Ghrelin
regulating liver activity and its potential effects on liver fibrosis
and Echinococcosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Ghrelin widely exists in the central nervous system and peripheral
organs, and has biological activities such as maintaining energy
homeostasis, regulating lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, immune
response, gastrointestinal physiological activities, cognition, memory,
circadian rhythm and reward effects. In many benign liver diseases, it
may play a hepatoprotective role against steatosis, chronic
inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic
reticulum stress and apoptosis, and improve liver cell autophagy and
immune response to improve disease progression. However, the role of
Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> is currently unclear.
This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which
Ghrelin regulates liver growth metabolism, immune-inflammation,
fibrogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis, as well as its protective
effects in liver fibrosis diseases, and further proposes the role of
Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> infection. During the
infectious process, it may promote the parasitism and survival of
parasites on the host by improving the immune-inflammatory
microenvironment and fibrosis state, thereby accelerating disease
progression. However, there is currently a lack of targeted <italic>in
vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence for
this viewpoint.

cross displacement amplification combined with nanoparticle-based
lateral flow biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of Epstein-Barr
virus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly dangerous virus that is globally
prevalent and closely linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer
(NPC). Plasma EBV DNA analysis is an effective strategy for early
detection, prognostication and monitoring of treatment response of NPC.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Here, we present a novel molecular diagnostic technique termed
EBV-MCDA-LFB, which integrates multiple cross displacement amplification
(MCDA) with nanoparticle-based lateral flow (LFB) to enable simple,
rapid and specific detection of EBV. In the EBV-MCDA-LFB system, a set
of 10 primers was designed for rapidly amplifying the highly conserved
tandem repeat BamHI-W region of the EBV genome. Subsequently, the LFB
facilitate direct assay reading, eliminating the use of extra
instruments and reagents.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The outcomes showed that the 65°C within 40 minutes was the optimal
reaction setting for the EBV-MCDA system. The sensitivity of
EBV-MCDA-LFB assay reached 7 copies per reaction when using EBV
recombinant plasmid, and it showed 100% specificity without any
cross-reactivity with other pathogens. The feasibility of the
EBV-MCDA-LFB method for EBV detection was successfully validated by 49
clinical plasma samples. The complete detection process, consisting of
rapid template extraction (15 minutes), MCDA reaction (65°C for 40
minutes), and LFB result reading (2 minutes), can be finalized within a
60-minutes duration.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
EBV-MCDA-LFB assay designed here is a fast, extremely sensitive and
specific technique for detecting EBV in field and at the point-of-care
(PoC), which is especially beneficial for countries and regions with a
high prevalence of the disease and limited economic resources.

critical role of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions in sepsis: new
synergistic approaches employing organ-on-chip, omics, immune cell
phenotyping and in silico modeling to identify new therapeutics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Sepsis is a global health concern accounting for more than 1 in 5 deaths
worldwide. Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction
caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can develop
from bacterial (gram negative or gram positive), fungal or viral (such
as COVID) infections. However, therapeutics developed in animal models
and traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> sepsis models have had little
success in clinical trials, as these models have failed to fully
replicate the underlying pathophysiology and heterogeneity of the
disease. The current understanding is that the host response to sepsis
is highly diverse among patients, and this heterogeneity impacts immune
function and response to infection. Phenotyping immune function and
classifying sepsis patients into specific endotypes is needed to develop
a personalized treatment approach. Neutrophil-endothelium interactions
play a critical role in sepsis progression, and increased neutrophil
influx and endothelial barrier disruption have important roles in the
early course of organ damage. Understanding the mechanism of
neutrophil-endothelium interactions and how immune function impacts this
interaction can help us better manage the disease and lead to the
discovery of new diagnostic and prognosis tools for effective
treatments. In this review, we will discuss the latest research
exploring how <italic>in silico</italic> modeling of a synergistic
combination of new organ-on-chip models incorporating human
cells/tissue, omics analysis and clinical data from sepsis patients will
allow us to identify relevant signaling pathways and characterize
specific immune phenotypes in patients. Emerging technologies such as
machine learning can then be leveraged to identify druggable therapeutic
targets and relate them to immune phenotypes and underlying infectious
agents. This synergistic approach can lead to the development of new
therapeutics and the identification of FDA approved drugs that can be
repurposed for the treatment of sepsis.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most widely prevalent herpes virus
worldwide, and the herpetic encephalitis and genital herpes caused by
HSV infection have caused serious harm to human health all over the
world. Although many anti-HSV drugs such as nucleoside analogues have
been ap-proved for clinical use during the past few decades, important
issues, such as drug resistance, toxicity, and high cost of drugs,
remain unresolved. Recently, the studies on the anti-HSV activities of
marine natural products, such as marine polysaccharides, marine peptides
and microbial secondary metabolites are attracting more and more
attention all over the world. This review discusses the recent progress
in research on the anti-HSV activities of these natural compounds
obtained from marine organisms, relating to their structural features
and the structure-activity relationships. In addition, the recent
findings on the different anti-HSV mechanisms and molecular targets of
marine compounds and their potential for therapeutic application will
also be summarized in detail.
