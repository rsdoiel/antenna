id="identification-of-an-aeromonas-hydrophila-strain-as-a-new-mosquito-pathogen">Identification
of an Aeromonas hydrophila strain as a new mosquito pathogen</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The gut microbiome plays a major role in promoting organismal
homeostasis. Mosquito microbiota influences various aspects of host
physiology such as immunity, development and vector competence. Most
studies addressing mosquito microbiota consist of microbial diversity
profiling and rarely investigate the effects of individual bacteria on
host physiology. This remains an important gap of knowledge, especially
since not all naturally occurring gut microbes are passive commensals.
Here, we identify a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas hydrophila that
causes mortality to both Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes
upon ingestion. In addition, we show that A. hydrophila breaches the gut
epithelium and gains access to the hemolymph. Parallel to gut damage, we
detect a significant increase in the number of proliferative cells in
the midguts of A. hydrophila fed mosquitoes. Moreover, we find that this
bacterium induces a local immune response in the gut leading to the
production of anti-microbial peptides. Finally, whole genome sequencing
of the isolated strain revealed that it possesses an arsenal of
virulence and resistance genes, which provides mechanistic insights into
its mosquitocidal activity. This study reports a novel mosquito pathogen
and highlights how a bacterial species inhabiting the gut can impact the
host’s survival and homeostasis.</p>

disrupt bone homeostasis via dual regulation of osteogenesis and
osteoclastogenesis through exosomal miR-146a-5p/TRAF6 signaling</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGingipains are virulence factors released by Porphyromonas
gingivalis that contribute to periodontal destruction by disrupting bone
metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the dual effects of gingipains
on bone metabolism by examining their impact on osteogenesis and
osteoclastogenesis, hypothesizing that gingipains regulate these
processes via direct and exosomal pathways involving microRNA
signaling.MethodsClinical samples of gingival crevicular fluid,
subgingival plaque, and gingival tissues were collected from 15 patients
with stage III-IV periodontitis and 15 healthy controls. The effects of
gingipains on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and RAW264.7
macrophages were assessed using cell proliferation assays, qPCR, western
blot, microarray analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. A rat
periodontitis model was used to validate the findings in
vivo.ResultsPeriodontitis patients exhibited elevated levels of lysine-
and arginine-specific gingipains, C5a, and RANKL (p &lt; 0.05).
Gingipains inhibited BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation
in a dose-dependent manner while promoting osteoclastogenesis in
RAW264.7 macrophages through BMSCs-derived exosomes. Gingipains reduced
the levels of miR-146a-5p in exosomes, which enhanced osteoclast
differentiation through the miR-146a-5p/TRAF6 signaling pathway. Animal
models confirmed that gingipains aggravated alveolar bone loss, which
was mitigated by miR-146a-5p overexpression.ConclusionGingipains disrupt
bone metabolism by inhibiting BMSCs osteogenesis and promoting
osteoclastogenesis through communication via exosomes. Targeting
miR-146a-5p offers a potential therapeutic approach to counter
gingipain-induced periodontal destruction.</p>

and enteric nervous system crosstalk in diabetic gastroenteropathy:
bridging mechanistic insights to microbiome-based therapies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus has emerged as a global public health crisis, with
over half of patients experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that
exacerbate glucose fluctuations and impair quality of life. While prior
research on the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE)
focused primarily on autonomic neuropathy, particularly involving the
vagus nerve, recent studies have shifted toward the impairment of the
enteric nervous system (ENS). As the largest autonomous neural network
governing GI motility independent of central control, structural and
functional abnormalities of the ENS constitute the fundamental
pathological basis for DGE. This review first delineates gut microbial
alterations in diabetes and mechanisms by which dysbiosis compromises
the integrity of the ENS. Second, we analyze how microbiota-derived
metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, tryptophan), gut
hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, ghrelin), and neurotransmitters
(acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide) multitarget
the ENS—collectively establishing the “microbiota-ENS axis” as the
central hub for GI sensorimotor control. Finally, we provide an overview
of preclinical and clinical evidence for microbiome-targeted therapies
(probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation) in
alleviating DGE symptoms and repairing ENS while outlining translational
challenges and future research priorities.</p>

and therapeutic perspectives of mitochondrial dysfunction of macrophages
in periodontitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis is a global inflammatory oral disease, and
plaque-induced host excessive immune response is recognized as a major
cause of its pathogenesis. In recent years, the relevance of
mitochondrial dysfunction to periodontitis has been increasingly
investigated, particularly with respect to macrophages, the key immune
cells in the periodontal immune microenvironment. Mitochondrial
dysfunction drives macrophage M1 polarization and osteoclast
differentiation through mechanisms such as metabolic reprogramming,
reactive oxygen species release, abnormal mitophagy, abnormal
mitochondrial biogenesis and damaged mitochondrial dynamic. In addition,
mitochondrial transfer in the periodontitis setting has been reported in
several researches. In this review, we highlight the impact of
mitochondrial dysfunction on macrophages in the periodontitis setting
and summarize emerging therapeutic strategies for targeting mitochondria
in periodontitis, including antioxidants, modulators of metabolic
reprogramming, nanomaterials and photodynamic therapy.</p>

performance and clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation
sequencing in suspected central nervous system infections: a prospective
comparative study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of
metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in patients with suspected
central nervous system (CNS) infections.Methodsprospective study was
conducted from December 2019 to January 2024, enrolling 110 patients
with suspected CNS infections. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were
subjected to mNGS, conventional biochemistry, and culture. Clinical
features and outcomes were compared between patients confirmed with CNS
infections and those without.ResultsOf the enrolled patients, 69 were
diagnosed with CNS infections. mNGS identified pathogens in 62 cases
(77.11%), including 54 clinically confirmed true positives (49.09%),
significantly surpassing traditional CSF culture (6.36%). mNGS reported
results within 24 hours, considerably shorter than the 72~120 hours
required for culture. Compared to the non-infection group, patients with
CNS infections had significantly higher ICU admission(ICUA) rates,
prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and elevated rates
of antibiotic adjustment and mNGS positivity (P&lt;0.05). CSF turbidity,
cell count, and protein levels were significantly elevated, while
glucose and chloride levels were reduced. Logistic regression identified
mNGS, CSF protein, and glucose levels as independent predictors of CNS
infection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated
superior diagnostic accuracy for continuous CSF variables over binary
ones, with mNGS showing robust performance [area under the curve (AUC) =
0.794].ConclusionmNGS offers rapid and accurate pathogen detection,
outperforming conventional methods in sensitivity and turnaround time,
and provides valuable guidance for individualized antimicrobial
treatment in CNS infections.</p>

id="the-relationship-between-immune-cell-infiltration-and-necroptosis-gene-expression-in-sepsis-an-analysis-using-single-cell-transcriptomic-data">The
relationship between immune cell infiltration and necroptosis gene
expression in sepsis: an analysis using single-cell transcriptomic
data</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a
dysregulated host response to infection. It remains a significant
medical challenge due to its high mortality rates and requires a deeper
understanding of its underlying mechanisms. This study aims to elucidate
the differential expression of necroptosis-related genes in sepsis and
their impact on immune characteristics.MethodsWe obtained gene
expression profiles and single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
were identified using the limma package, and functional enrichment
analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler package for Gene
Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) were conducted to explore pathway enrichments. Immune
cell infiltration differences between sepsis (SE) and healthy control
(HC) groups were quantified using the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. Differential marker genes between SE and HC
groups were identified by single-cell data analysis using the Seurat and
SingleR packages.ResultsOur results revealed 849 necroptosis-related
DEGs, with 843 upregulated and 16 downregulated in the SE group. Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression identified
22 key DEGs, including CTSS, MAPK8, and MPRIP. Among these, 157
necroptosis-related DEGs were consistently identified between SE and HC
groups. GO analysis indicated significant enrichment in biological
processes such as the regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways and IκB
kinase/NF-κB signaling. KEGG pathway analysis revealed involvement in
necroptosis, apoptosis, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. GSVA
demonstrated that Wnt signaling was upregulated in the SE group.
Significant differences in immune cell infiltration were observed
between sepsis and healthy control groups, particularly in activated B
cells and CD4 T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 33,287
cells categorized into 26 clusters, with neutrophils predominating. Key
necroptosis genes such as CTSS, TXN, MYH9, FPR1, FMR1, and MPRIP
exhibited differential expression patterns across various immune cell
types.ConclusionsOur integrated bioinformatics approach provides
insights into the role of necroptosis-related genes in sepsis
pathogenesis and their influence on immune responses. These findings
improve our understanding of sepsis mechanisms and may guide future
therapeutic strategies targeting necroptosis pathways.</p>

id="ferroptosis-and-mitochondrial-ros-are-central-to-sars-cov-2-induced-hepatocyte-death">Ferroptosis
and mitochondrial ROS are central to SARS-CoV-2-induced hepatocyte
death</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAlthough COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract,
liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The
mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly
understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative
stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we
investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the
Huh7.5 cell model.MethodsHuh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either
the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral
replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection,
and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed
through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and
mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death
(apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal
microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways
was probed using chemical inhibitors.ResultsBoth SARS-CoV-2 variants
efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics.
Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and
lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant
mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the
protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker
and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated
post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS
scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the
role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life
cycle.ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid
metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor
to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis
may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify
mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic
targets.</p>

id="correlation-of-intestinal-bacteria-fungi-and-dietary-nutrient-intake-in-nafld-patients-with-spleen-deficiency-syndrome">Correlation
of intestinal bacteria, fungi and dietary nutrient intake in NAFLD
patients with spleen deficiency syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSpleen deficiency syndrome (SDS) is one of the primary
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes in Non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD). Diet influences NAFLD and SDS through the
intestinal microbiota. The current study aimed to investigate the
interrelationships of intestinal bacteria, fungi and dietary nutrient
intake in NAFLD patients with SDS.MethodsThe NAFLD TCM Patient Reported
Outcome (PRO) Scale was administered to evaluate the TCM clinical
symptoms of NAFLD patients. The Spleen Deficiency PRO Scale and Food
Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were employed to respectively diagnose
spleen deficiency syndrome and assess dietary nutrient intake,
energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII), and dietary
diversity scores (DDS) in NAFLD patients. Subsequently, stool samples
were collected for 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 region sequencing to analyze
the interrelationships among target intestinal bacteria, fungi, and
dietary nutrient intake.ResultsThe NAFLD TCM PRO Scale indicated that
the average score for symptoms related to SDS in NAFLD patients was 4.13
± 0.40. Compared with NAFLD patients without SDS, those with SDS had
insufficient dietary nutrient intake of diet-derived antioxidants such
as carotene and folic acid, stronger pro-inflammatory effects of food,
and reduced dietary diversity (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, sufficient
dietary diversity was identified as a protective factor against SDS in
NAFLD (OR: 0.424; 95% CI: 0.309, 0.583; P &lt; 0.001). 16S rRNA gene and
ITS2 region sequencing results showed that Collinsella (LDA = 3.947, P =
0.046) and Rhizopus (LDA = 3.196, P = 0.01) were enriched in NAFLD
patients with SDS, whereas Intestinimonas was markedly increased in
NAFLD patients without SDS (LDA = 2.015, P = 0.02). Correlation analysis
demonstrated that Gemmiger and Rhizopus were significantly positively
correlated (r = 0.778, P &lt; 0.001), as were Candida and Segatella (r =
0.569, P &lt; 0.001). Intestinimonas was positively correlated with the
intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients such as dietary
fiber, vitamin C, and iron (0.2 &lt; r &lt; 0.5, P &lt; 0.05), while
niacin intake was negatively correlated with Rhizopus abundance (r =
-0.39, P = 0.025).ConclusionSymptoms related to SDS are common in
patients with NAFLD. The independent and interactive effects of
intestinal bacteria and fungi might have collectively influenced the
immune function and inflammation levels in NAFLD patients with SDS.
These processes were likely associated with the intake of antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory nutrients, as well as niacin.</p>

id="respiratory-diseases-and-the-gut-microbiota-an-updated-review">Respiratory
diseases and the gut microbiota: an updated review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The gut microbiota constitutes a vital ecosystem within the human
body playing a pivotal role in immune regulation and metabolic
homeostasis. Emerging research underscores a sophisticated interplay
between the gut and lungs, termed the “gut-lung axis.” Gut microbes
exert influence over pulmonary immunity and metabolism via immune
mediators (e.g., cytokines and interleukins), metabolites (e.g.,
short-chain fatty acids) and direct microbial translocation. Dysbiosis
of the gut microbiota has been implicated in a spectrum of respiratory
diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), acute lung injury (ALI), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH), acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) and
tuberculosis (TB). Although multi-omics technologies have elucidated
certain mechanisms underlying the gut-lung axis, numerous pathways
remain to be fully delineated. This review synthesizes current knowledge
on the role of gut microbiota and their metabolites in respiratory
diseases and assesses their therapeutic potential. Future investigations
should prioritize strategies to restore and maintain microbial
homeostasis, such as dietary modifications, probiotic supplementation
and fecal microbiota transplantation to pioneer novel preventive and
therapeutic approaches. These summaries of advances in gut microbiology
research promise better management and exploration of therapeutic
strategies for respiratory diseases.</p>

<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the risk factors for all-cause mortality of
previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients complicated by
hypertension and construct a predictive model.MethodsWe retrospectively
analyzed the clinical data of inpatients with previously untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by hypertension from 2019 to 2021 in
Changsha Central Hospital. Patients’ survival status and cardiovascular
events were collected through telephone follow-up. LASSO regression was
utilized to screen predictive variables, and binary logistic regression
identified mortality risk factors. A predictive nomogram model was
developed using R software, and its precision and reliability were
verified.ResultsAmong the 1,014 patients, there were 100 (9.86%) deaths
and 82 (8.09%) cardiovascular events. LASSO regression screened out 13
predictive variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed
that smoking history, sputum bacteriology, pleural effusion, coronary
heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were independent risk factors.
Based on the training set data, a nomogram prognostic model was
developed, showing an AUC of 0.712 (95% CI: 0.777-0.847), with 50.0%
sensitivity and 84.3% specificity. The model’s fit was confirmed through
internal and external validations.ConclusionThe prediction model
constructed in this study has high predictive ability and satisfactory
clinical efficacy, and can provide an effective individualized
prediction tool for assessing all-cause mortality risk in patients with
previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by
hypertension.</p>

id="evolution-dissemination-and-genetic-dynamics-of-the-carbapenem-resistance-gene-blandm-in-china">Evolution,
dissemination, and genetic dynamics of the carbapenem resistance gene
blaNDM in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBlaNDM, which encodes a metallo-β-lactamase that can
hydrolyze most β-lactam antibiotics, has become a serious public health
concern in China. It is crucial to investigate the evolution,
dissemination, and genetic dynamics of blaNDM to develop potential
strategies to control the proliferation of blaNDM.MethodsIn this study,
we collected 1021 blaNDM-positive isolates, which features 67 new
genomes from our laboratory and 954 genomes from NCBI. Through
epidemiological big data analysis, phylogenetic tree-based geographic
transmission analysis, and upstream-downstream genetic clustering
evolution analysis, we systematically analyzed the evolution,
dissemination, and genetic dynamics of blaNDM-positive
bacteria.ResultsAnalysis results indicate that blaNDM-5 is gradually
supplanting blaNDM-1 in China and Acinetobacter has been replaced as the
primary blaNDM-harboring genus by the Enterobacter, Escherichia, and
Klebsiella, which are both within the Enterobacteriaceae family and more
easily transmitted among humans. Furthermore, blaNDM-positive bacteria
exhibit a distinct livestock-environment-human transmission cycle, while
the phylogenetic diversity of blaNDM and tet(X)-co-carrying genera is
progressively expanding with concomitantly enhanced resistance
phenotypes. Currently, the predominant blaNDM-positive bacterial strains
have likely disseminated from southwest China to coastal regions. We
further identified multiple transposon structures beyond Tn125 that may
facilitate blaNDM transfer.ConclusionsThe diversity of the blaNDM and
its carrier bacterial strains is continuously increasing, and its
transmission range is also expanding. Of greater concern,
super-resistant strains co-harboring blaNDM and tet(X) genes exhibit
high potential for imminent emergence in human populations. Considering
that the blaNDM-carrier bacteria are increasingly adapted to inter-human
spread, the analysis results above can provide methodological and data
support for epidemiological surveillance, tracing, and early warning
alerts.</p>

id="deletion-of-the-e3-ubiquitin-ligase-lrsam1-fosters-intracellular-staphylococcus-aureus-survival">Deletion
of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 fosters intracellular Staphylococcus
aureus survival</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIntracellular invasion and persistence of Staphylococcus
aureus can lead to chronic infection and is an effective strategy for
the pathogen to evade the host immune response and antibiotic therapy.
Selective ubiquitination of bacterial surfaces via E3 ubiquitin ligases
is a mechanism by which host cells combat intracellular bacteria and
target them for autophagosomal degradation. However, knowledge of the E3
ligases involved in intracellular recognition of S. aureus is still very
limited.MethodsWe studied A549 lung epithelial cells during S. aureus
infection, focusing on the role of the E3 ligase leucine rich repeat and
sterile alpha motif containing 1 (LRSAM1). We used the CRISPR-Cas9
system to generate LRSAM1-deficient A549 cells and monitored
intracellular bacterial survival, activation of host cellular signalling
pathways related to cytokine production, and host cell death during S.
aureus infection.ResultsIn LRSAM1-deficient host cells we observed a
significant increase in intracellular bacterial load, which was
accompanied by an increased host cell death and elevated secretion of
the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Despite induced selective autophagy,
LRSAM1 knockout host cells were incapable of lowering and eliminating
the pathogen, which seems to be caused by the reduced ubiquitination of
the bacterial surface.ConclusionThe results indicate a significant role
of LRSAM1 in the clearance of intracellular S. aureus. This contributes
to a deeper understanding of the host cellular responses to S. aureus
infection and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic
strategies to combat intracellularly persistent S. aureus.</p>

role in regulating the cell wall of C. neoformans. However, the specific
mechanisms by which Puf4 regulates metabolism and virulence remain
unclear.MethodsIn this study, we systematically investigated the role of
Puf4 in the metabolism and virulence of C. neoformans using RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq), biochemical analysis, and in vivo animal
experiments.ResultsColony-spotting assay assays show that Puf4 affects
the cell membrane and oxidative stress. RNA-seq analysis revealed that
Puf4 was enriched in key metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate
metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. Biochemical
analysis revealed that Puf4 overexpression led to significant increases
in both total carbohydrate and glycogen content. Additionally, the
Puf4-overexpressing strain showed elevated ROS levels, and reduced
resistance to antimycin A, indicating decreased oxidative stress
tolerance. Notably, Puf4 overexpression resulted in reduced capsule size
and decreased L-DOPA production, accompanied by downregulated expression
of the capsule-associated gene CAP10 and the melanin biosynthesis gene
LAC1. In vivo animal experiments further confirmed that the virulence of
the Puf4-overexpressing strain was significantly
attenuated.DiscussionThese findings suggest that Puf4 may serve as a
regulator linking metabolic status and pathogenic potential in C.
neoformans, although the underlying mechanisms require further
elucidation.</p>

and molecular phylogeny of Dothideomycetes fungi associated with
Dracaena plants</h2>

<p>Dracaena species are widely recognized for their exceptional drought
tolerance, making them ideal candidates for sustainable landscaping and
ecological restoration in arid regions. Limestone outcrops hosting
Dracaena are unique ecosystems characterized by extreme environmental
conditions such as nutrient-poor substrates. Thus, they provide valuable
opportunities for studying fungal diversity and their adaptations.
Despite their ecological importance, knowledge concerning fungal
communities associated with limestone-inhabiting Dracaena species
remains limited, particularly within the diverse biogeographic contexts
of Thailand. Microfungal samples were collected from dead wood and
leaves of Dracaena species across seven provinces in Thailand (Chiang
Rai, Kanchanaburi, Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Ratchaburi, Songkhla, and
Tak). Fungal taxa were identified and characterized through detailed
morphological examinations combined with multi-gene phylogenetic
analyses using Actin (act), Internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the large
subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (LSU), translation elongation fac-tor
1-alpha (tef1-α), and beta-tubulin (tub) gene regions. This study
documents eleven fungal taxa isolated from Dracaena substrates,
belonging to seven families across five fungal orders. Three new species
viz. Cladosporium dracaenae, C. dracaenicola and Torula dracaenae were
described, and eight new host records were established (Bipolaris
coffeana, Curvularia lunata, Lasiodiplodia bruguierae, L. lignicola, L.
thailandica, Longididymella clematidis, Ochroconis musae and Zasmidium
citrigriseum). Species de-scriptions, color photographic plates,
phylogenetic trees and updated taxonomic notes are provided for all
isolated taxa. The findings advance the current understanding of
microfungal diversity associated with limestone outcrop habitats and
Dracaena species, contributing to broader ecological and conservation
efforts. By revealing novel fungal species and previously undocumented
host-fungus interactions, this study underscores the rich but
underexplored fungal biodiversity of limestone ecosystems in
Thailand.</p>

of pathogen detection performance between metagenomic next-generation
sequencing and conventional culture in organ preservation fluids and
recipient wound drainage fluids</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPrompt identification and management of donor-derived
infections post-kidney transplantation are critical. This study aims to
assess the effectiveness of metagenomic next-generation sequencing
(mNGS) in detecting pathogens within donor organ preservation fluids and
recipient wound drainage fluids, with a comparison made against
conventional culture methods.MethodsThis study involved 141 kidney
transplant patients (May 1st, 2020 to Jan 31st, 2024). Donor organ
preservation fluids and recipient wound drainage fluids were collected
and analyzed by mNGS and conventional culture. Pathogen detection
differences between mNGS and culture were evaluated. The antibiotic
adjustment and infectious complications of the recipients were
recorded.ResultsFor organ preservation fluids, the positive rate of
convention culture were lower than that of mNGS (24.8% (35/141) vs 47.5%
(67/141), p&lt;0.05). For recipient wound drainage fluids, the
positivity rate of convention culture were lower than that of mNGS (2.1%
(3/141) vs 27.0% (38/141), p&lt;0.05). Compared to traditional
culture-based methods, mNGS demonstrated a significantly higher positive
detection rate for the combination of ESKAPE pathogens and/or fungi
(28.4% (40/141) vs 16.3% (23/141) p&lt; 0.05). Of the pathogens detected
through convention culture, mNGS was capable of detecting 79.2% (19/24)
of combinations comprising Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting
bacteria, yet it detected only 22.2% (2/9) of Gram-positive bacteria,
and 55.6% (5/9) of fungi. Certain clinically atypical pathogens, mainly
Mycobacterium, Clostridium tetanus, and parasites, can solely be
detected via mNGS. The rehospitalization rate due to infections was
13.5% (19/141), while the donor-derived infection rate amounted to 2.8%
(4/141). Guided by mNGS and bacterial culture results, adjustments were
made to antibiotic administration, with no severe vascular complications
arising.ConclusionsBy employing mNGS to analyze drainage fluids and
organ preservation fluids, highly pathogenic and atypical pathogenic
microorganisms can be rapidly identified with high throughput. While
limitations exist in detecting fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, mNGS
are need to be jointly applied with conventional culture under current
conditions.</p>
