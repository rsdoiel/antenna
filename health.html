characteristics of BTLA/HVEM axis expression on Tregs and its impact on
the expansion and attributes of Tregs in patients with active pulmonary
tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) remains one of the deadliest
infectious diseases. Understanding PTB immunity is of potential value
for exploring immunotherapy for treating chemotherapy-resistant PTB.
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key players that impair
immune responses to Mycobacteria tuberculosis (MTB). Currently, the
intrinsic factors governing Treg expansion and influencing the
immunosuppressive attributes of Tregs in PTB patients are far from
clear.MethodsHere, we employed flow cytometry to determine the frequency
of Tregs and the expression of B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and
its ligand, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), on Tregs in patients with
active PTB. Furthermore, the expression of conventional T cells and of
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) on Tregs
in patients with active PTB was determined. We then examined the
characteristics of BTLA/HVEM expression and its correlation with Treg
frequency and PD-L1 and PD-1 expression on Tregs in PTB
patients.ResultsThe frequency of Tregs was increased in PTB patients and
it had a relevance to PTB progression. Intriguingly, the axis of
cosignal molecules, BTLA and HVEM, were both downregulated on the Tregs
of PTB patients compared with healthy controls (HCs), which was the
opposite of their upregulation on conventional T cells. Unexpectedly,
their expression levels were positively correlated with the frequency of
Tregs, respectively. These seemingly contradictory results may be
interpreted as follows: the downregulation of BTLA and HVEM may
alleviate BTLA/HVEM cis-interaction-mediated coinhibitory signals
pressing on naïve Tregs, helping their activation, while the BTLA/HVEM
axis on effector Tregs induces a costimulatory signal, promoting their
expansion. Certainly, the mechanism underlying such complex effects
remains to be explored. Additionally, PD-L1 and PD-1, regarded as two of
the markers characterizing the immunosuppressive attributes and
differentiation potential of Tregs, were upregulated on the Tregs of PTB
patients. Further analysis revealed that the expression levels of BTLA
and HVEM were positively correlated with the frequency of PD-1+Tregs and
PD-L1+Tregs, respectively.ConclusionOur study illuminated distinct
characteristics of BTLA/HVEM axis expression on Tregs and uncovered its
impact on the expansion and attributes of Tregs in patients with active
PTB. Therefore, blockade of the BTLA/HVEM axis may be a promising
potential pathway to reduce Treg expansion for the improvement of
anti-MTB immune responses.</p>

precision tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Infectious diseases represent a significant global health challenge,
with bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasitic protozoa being significant
causative agents. The shared symptoms among diseases and the emergence
of new pathogen variations make diagnosis and treatment complex.
Conventional diagnostic methods are laborious and intricate,
underscoring the need for rapid, accurate techniques. Aptamer-based
technologies offer a promising solution, as they are cost-effective,
sensitive, specific, and convenient for molecular disease diagnosis.
Aptamers, which are single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences, serve as
nucleotide equivalents of monoclonal antibodies, displaying high
specificity and affinity for target molecules. They are structurally
robust, allowing for long-term storage without substantial activity
loss. Aptamers find applications in diverse fields such as drug
screening, material science, and environmental monitoring. In
biomedicine, they are extensively studied for biomarker detection,
diagnostics, imaging, and targeted therapy. This comprehensive review
focuses on the utility of aptamers in managing infectious diseases,
particularly in the realms of diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>

gut to bone: deciphering the impact of gut microbiota on osteoporosis
pathogenesis and management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by decreased bone mineral density
(BMD) and increased fracture risk, poses a significant global health
burden. Recent research has shed light on the bidirectional relationship
between gut microbiota (GM) and bone health, presenting a novel avenue
for understanding OP pathogenesis and developing targeted therapeutic
interventions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the
GM-bone axis, exploring the impact of GM on OP development and
management. We elucidate established risk factors and pathogenesis of
OP, delve into the diversity and functional changes of GM in OP.
Furthermore, we examine experimental evidence and clinical observations
linking alterations in GM composition or function with variations in BMD
and fracture risk. Mechanistic insights into microbial mediators of bone
health, such as microbial metabolites and products, are discussed.
Therapeutic implications, including GM-targeted interventions and
dietary strategies, are also explored. Finally, we identify future
research directions and challenges in translating these findings into
clinical practice.</p>

insights into UTIs: from pathophysiology to precision diagnosis and
management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common infectious
disease, predominantly impacting women with 150 million individuals
affected globally. It increases the socio-economic burden of society and
is mainly caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., and Staphylococcus spp. The severity of
the infection correlates with the host factors varying from acute to
chronic infections. Even with a high incidence rate, the diagnosis is
mainly based on the symptoms, dipstick analysis, and culture analysis,
which are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and lacking sensitivity and
specificity. During this period, medical professionals prescribe
empirical antibiotics, which may increase the antimicrobial resistance
rate. Timely and precise UTI diagnosis is essential for addressing
antibiotic resistance and improving overall quality of life. In response
to these challenges, new techniques are emerging. The review provides a
comprehensive overview of the global burden of UTIs, associated risk
factors, implicated organisms, traditional and innovative diagnostic
methods, and approaches to UTI treatment and prevention.</p>

real time PCR for distinction between Pneumocystis jirovecii
infection/colonization in hospitalized patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIdentification of the opportunistic fungus Pneumocystis
jirovecii in respiratory specimens presents challenges, particularly in
differentiating between colonization and active infection. The present
study assessed a probe-based real time PCR (qPCR) diagnostic
effectiveness in patients with diverse underlying conditions,
particularly those with COVID-19 and pulmonary insufficiency.MethodsTo
set up the qPCR, clinical samples from 281 patients with respiratory
ailments were tested. Subsequently, a descriptive study was conducted on
112 patients with pulmonary insufficiency with and without COVID-19
suspected of P. jirovecii infection. All specimens were subjected to DNA
extraction followed by nested PCR and qPCR targeting the mitochondrial
large subunit (mtLSU)-rRNA gene.ResultsBased on nested PCR and qPCR, P.
jirovecii was identified in 40 out of 281 patients, with slight
variations in positive samples observed across dilutions. Three patients
who tested positive in nested PCR yielded negative results in
probe-based qPCR. Conversely, three patients who tested positive in
probe-based qPCR yielded negative results in nested PCR. Considering
nested PCR as the golden standard, probe-based qPCR demonstrated good
diagnostic performance, with 92.5% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity.
Based on cycle threshold (Ct) values, the positive cases were
categorized: ≤32 as infection, &gt;35 as colonization, and a grey zone
between these values (32 &lt; X ≤ 35). The analysis of 112 PCP-suspected
patients revealed a prevalence ranging from 6.25% (nested PCR) to 7%
(probe-based qPCR).ConclusionsThis study suggested Ct values to
differentiate Pneumocystis pneumonia/colonization in immunocompromised
patients. To further augment the diagnostic sensitivity, it is
recommended to integrate qPCR results with clinical parameters and
biomarkers to offer a more precise understanding of Pneumocystis-related
conditions.</p>

id="associations-of-vaginal-microbiota-with-the-onset-severity-and-type-of-symptoms-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-in-women">Associations
of vaginal microbiota with the onset, severity, and type of symptoms of
genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGenitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes the
symptoms and signs resulting from the effect of estrogen deficiency on
the female genitourinary tract, including genital, urinary, and sexual
symptoms. However, besides estrogen deficiency, little is known about
the etiology of GSM. The objective of this study was to investigate the
effects of vaginal microbiota dysbiosis on the occurrence and
development of GSM in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.MethodsIn
total, 96 women were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and clinical
data were collected. GSM symptoms were divided into three types:
genital, urological, and sexual symptoms. Full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequencing using the third-generation PacBio sequencing technology was
performed to analyze the vaginal microbiome using vaginal swabs of
non-GSM and GSM women with different types of GSM symptoms. Live
Lactobacillus Capsule for Vaginal Use (LLCVU) treatment was used to
verify the effects of Lactobacillus on GSM symptoms.ResultsWe found that
83.58% (56/67) of women experienced GSM symptoms in the perimenopausal
and postmenopausal stages. Among these women with GSM, 23.21% (13/56),
23.21% (13/56), and 53.57% (30/56) had one type, two types, and three
types of GSM symptoms, respectively. The richness and diversity of
vaginal microbiota gradually increased from reproductive to
postmenopausal women. There were significant differences in vaginal
microbial community among non-GSM women and GSM women with different
types of symptoms. Lactobacillus was found to be negatively associated
with the onset, severity, and type of GSM while some bacteria, such as
Escherichia-shigella, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Enterococcus,
Peptoniphilus_harei, and Streptococcus, were found to be positively
associated with these aspects of GSM, and these bacteria were especially
associated with the types of genital and sexual symptoms in GSM women.
LLCVU significantly relieved genital symptoms and improved the sexual
life of GSM women in shortterm observation.ConclusionsThe onset,
severity, and type of GSM symptoms may be associated with changes in
vaginal microbiota in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Vaginal
microbiota dysbiosis probably contributes to the occurrence and
development of GSMsymptoms, especially vaginal and sexual symptoms.
Lactobacillus used in the vagina may be a possible option for
non-hormonal treatment of GSM women with genital and sexual
symptoms.Clinical Trial

id="neisseria-meningitidis-activates-pyroptotic-pathways-in-a-mouse-model-of-meningitis-role-of-a-two-partner-secretion-system">Neisseria
meningitidis activates pyroptotic pathways in a mouse model of
meningitis: role of a two-partner secretion system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>There is evidence that in infected cells in vitro the meningococcal
HrpA/HrpB two-partner secretion system (TPS) mediates the exit of
bacteria from the internalization vacuole and the docking of bacteria to
the dynein motor resulting in the induction of pyroptosis. In this study
we set out to study the role of the HrpA/HrpB TPS in establishing
meningitis and activating pyroptotic pathways in an animal model of
meningitis using a reference serogroup C meningococcal strain, 93/4286,
and an isogenic hrpB knockout mutant, 93/4286ΩhrpB. Survival experiments
confirmed the role of HrpA/HrpB TPS in the invasive meningococcal
disease. In fact, the ability of the hrpB mutant to replicate in brain
and spread systemically was impaired in mice infected with hrpB mutant.
Furthermore, western blot analysis of brain samples during the infection
demonstrated that: i. N. meningitidis activated canonical and
non-canonical inflammasome pyroptosis pathways in the mouse brain; ii.
the activation of caspase-11, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D was markedly
reduced in the hrpB mutant; iii. the increase in the amount of IL-1β and
IL-18, which are an important end point of pyroptosis, occurs in the
brains of mice infected with the wild-type strain 93/4286 and is
strongly reduced in those infected with 93/4286ΩhrpB. In particular, the
activation of caspase 11, which is triggered by cytosolic
lipopolysaccharide, indicates that during meningococcal infection
pyroptosis is induced by intracellular infection after the exit of the
bacteria from the internalizing vacuole, a process that is hindered in
the hrpB mutant. Overall, these results confirm, in an animal model,
that the HrpA/HrpB TPS plays a role in the induction of pyroptosis and
suggest a pivotal involvement of pyroptosis in invasive meningococcal
disease, paving the way for the use of pyroptosis inhibitors in the
adjuvant therapy of the disease.</p>

between pathogenic E.coli O78-induced intestinal epithelial barrier
damage and Zonulin expression levels in yaks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>To explore whether the intestinal damage of yak colibacillosis
resulted from the regulation of Zonulin expression by its pathogenic
bacteria, the overexpression and interference plasmids of Zonulin were
designed and cultured in Tranwell after cell transfection. Then qRT-PCR
and Western blot were used to detect the results of cell transfection,
200 mL 1×105 CFU/mL E.coli O78 was added for 4 hours, transmembrane
resistance was measured by transmembrane resistance meter, FD4
fluorescence concentration in the lower chamber was detected by enzyme
labeling instrument, bacterial translocation was measured by CFU
counting method, and epithelial mucin (MUC1, MUC2) and tight junction
protein (FABP2, Occludin, ZO-1) were detected by qRT-PCR.ResultsThe
Zonulin gene overexpression and knockout cell lines were successfully
constructed, the TEER value of the barrier of Zonulin overexpression
cell lines began to decrease at 1 h after the addition of E.coli O78 and
reached the lowest value at 4 h, and the TEER value of Zonulin
interference cell lines decreased within 1-4 h after the addition of
E.coli O78. At 4 h, the FD4 passing capacity of Zonulin overexpression
cell lines was significantly higher than that of interfering cell lines,
reaching twice as much as siRNA-1. The amount of bacterial translocation
in overexpressed cell lines increased rapidly within 1-4 h, and the
concentration of E.coli in the lower chamber was significantly higher
than that in the siRNA-1 group at 4 h, but there was no significant
change in the siRNA-1 group in the 1-4 h. There was no significant
change in the mRNA level of MUC1 in Zonulin overexpression and
interference cell lines after the addition of E.coli O78. In the
overexpression group, the mRNA levels of MUC2, Occludin, and ZO-1 were
significantly decreased, and the mRNA level of FABP2 was increased
considerably. These results suggest stimulate epithelial cells to
secrete Zonulin protein. Many Zonulin proteins regulate the opening of
tight junction structures, reduce the transmembrane resistance of the
cell barrier, and improve the permeability of the cell barrier and the
amount of bacterial translocation.</p>

contamination with carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in
healthcare settings in Fiji: a potential source of infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThere are multiple ongoing outbreaks of carbapenem
resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAb) infection in Fiji’s hospitals.
CRAb is able to colonize and persist on various hospital surfaces for
extended periods. We conducted a study to understand the extent of
hospital environmental contamination and phylogenetic links with
clinical isolates.MethodsSwabs were collected from high-touch surfaces
at Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) September 2021 and December
2022; Lautoka Hospital (LTKH) August 2022; and Labasa Hospital (LBSH)
November 2022. All bacterial isolates were identified, and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) performed; isolates resistant to
carbapenems and producing a carbapenemase underwent whole genome
sequencing. Comparison was made to clinical isolates obtained from CWMH
in 2016–2017 and 2019–2021 and from LTKH and LBSH from
2020–2021.ResultsFrom the 180 environmental samples collected, ten
(5.6%) CRAb were isolated; no other carbapenem-resistant gram-negative
organisms were isolated. Seven (70%) of the CRAb were isolated from CWMH
and three (30%) from LTKH; no CRAb were isolated from LBSH. Of the seven
CWMH CRAb, two were sequence type 2 (ST2), three ST25, and two ST499.
All LTKH isolates were ST499. The two environmental CRAb ST2 isolates
were closely genetically linked to isolates obtained from patients in
CWMH, LTKH, and LBSH 2020–2021. Similarly, the three environmental CRAb
ST25 isolates were closely genetically linked to isolates obtained from
patients admitted to CWMH in 2019–2021 and LBSH in 2020. The
environmental CRAb ST499 isolates represented two distinct clones, with
clone 1 comprising two genetically identical isolates from CWMH and
clone 2 the three isolates from LTKH. Although no genetic linkages were
observed when comparing environmental ST499 isolates to those from CWMH
patients in 2020–2021, both clone 1 isolates were genetically identical
to an isolate obtained from a patient admitted during the sampling
period.ConclusionOur study highlights the contamination of high-touch
surfaces within Fiji hospitals with CRAb, suggesting that these may
serve as important sources for CRAb. Phylogenetic linkages to CRAb
isolated from patients since 2019 underscores the persistence of this
resistant pathogen in hospital settings and the ongoing risk for
hospital-acquired infections.</p>
