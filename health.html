id="deconstruct-the-link-between-gut-microbiota-and-neurological-diseases-application-of-mendelian-randomization-analysis">Deconstruct
the link between gut microbiota and neurological diseases: application
of Mendelian randomization analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecent research on the gut-brain axis has deepened our
understanding of the correlation between gut bacteria and the
neurological system. The inflammatory response triggered by gut
microbiota may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Additionally, the impact of gut microbiota on emotional state, known as
the “Gut-mood” relationship, could play a role in depression and anxiety
disorders.ResultsThis review summarizes recent data on the role of
gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and
neurological disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s
disease, brain cancer, Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder and stroke.
Also, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study on seven neurological
disorders (Epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, brain cancer,
Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder and stroke). MR-Egger and
MR-PRESSO tests confirmed the robustness of analysis against horizontal
pleiotropy.ConclusionsBy comparing the protective and risk factors for
neurological disorders found in our research and other researches, we
can furtherly determine valuable indicators for disease evolution
tracking and potential treatment targets. Future research should explore
extensive microbiome genome-wide association study datasets using
metagenomics sequencing techniques to deepen our understanding of
connections and causality between neurological disorders.</p>

analysis reveals that low cathepsin S expression aggravates sepsis
progression and worse prognosis via inducing monocyte polarization</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMonocytes represent a vital cellular subpopulation in the
peripheral blood, crucial in the progression of sepsis. Nonetheless, the
prognostic role and precise function of monocytes in sepsis are still
inadequately understood.MethodsSingle-cell transcriptomic sequencing and
bioinformatics analysis were performed on peripheral blood samples from
septic patients to identify key molecules in cell subsets. Subsequently,
the expression pattern of this molecule was validated through diverse
biological experiments, encompassing quantitative RT-PCR, western
blotting, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the functionality of this
molecule was evaluated using its specific agonist.ResultsA total of 22
monocytes-related biomarkers were identified from single-cell and bulk
RNA-seq analyses. Initially, LASSO analysis was performed to derive a
prognostic signature composed of 4 key genes, including CD14, CTSS,
CXCL8 and THBS1. Subsequently, mendelian randomization and survival
analysis demonstrated that only CTSS showed crucially protective role in
sepsis development and prognosis. Next, CTSS was confirmed to be lower
expressed in peripheral monocytes of septic patients. Inflammatory
markers (p &lt; 0.05) and migration ability of LPS-activated monocytes
were significantly reduced after CTSS agonist. In addition, CTSS agonist
decreased the pulmonary tissue monocyte/macrophages infiltration in
septic mice.ConclusionMonocyte marker CTSS represent a promising target
for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of sepsis and plays a
critical role in monocytes activation, tissue inflammatory response and
macrophages infiltration. Thus, CTSS agonist probably serves as new drug
for clinical protection against sepsis.</p>

Medicata Fermentata treated spleen deficiency constipation by mediating
intestinal microbiota and serum peptide</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesTo investigate the correlation between the treatment of
spleen deficiency constipation and the typical brain and intestinal
peptides.MethodsA total of 18 male Kunming mice were randomly divided
into three treatment groups (n = 6): normal group (CC), model group
(CM), and Massa Medicata Fermentata intervention group (CG). CM and CG
were used to establish a spleen deficiency constipation mouse model.
After the model was finished, CG was infused with 0.15 g/mL Massa
Medicata Fermentata water infusion at a dose of 4 g/(kg·day), twice a
day, at 0.4 mL. An equal amount of distilled water was infused in CC and
CM for 7 days. The body weight and fecal water content of the mice were
monitored during the modeling. Following the intervention, 16S rRNA
amplicon sequencing was used to analyze changes in the microflora in the
intestinal contents, and serum substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels were
determined via ELISA.ResultsThe modeling had no significant effect on
the weight of the mice, the water content of the mice’s feces was
greatly reduced, and the feces were dry and hard. Constipation caused by
spleen deficiency can lead to a decrease in serum SP and an increase in
VIP and CGRP. After treatment with Massa Medicata Fermentata, SP, VIP,
and CGRP all changed. Intestinal microbiota diversity of mice with
spleen deficiency constipation, and the dominant microbiota and
characteristic microbiota changed, indicating that the intestinal
microbiota was unbalanced. After the intervention of Massa Medicata
Fermentata, the intestinal microbiota diversity of spleen deficiency
constipation mice increased; the dominant microbiota became Candidatus
Arthromitus, Lactobacillus, unclassified Bacilli, Bacillus,
Ligilactobacillus, Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides, and Enterorhabdus; and
the characteristic microbiota became Candidatus Arthromitus. Through the
analysis of characteristic microbiota and serum SP, VIP, and CGRP
levels, Ligilactobacillus was found to be positively correlated with SP
and negatively correlated with VIP, Akkermansia and Streptococcus were
negatively correlated with SP, Candidatus Arthromitus was negatively
correlated with CGRP, Akkermansia and Candidatus Arthromitus were
negatively correlated with VIP, and Candidatus Arthromitus was
negatively correlated with CGRP.ConclusionsMassa Medicata Fermentata can
affect the secretion of short-chain fatty acids in the intestine by
altering the microecological environment of the intestine, then affect
the secretion of serum peptides in mice, and alleviate the spleen
deficiency constipation.</p>

of 16S rRNA gene sequencing using nanopore long read sequencing
technology for clinical diagnosis of culture negative infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The integration of long-read sequencing technology, such as nanopore
sequencing technology [Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)], into routine
diagnostic laboratories has the potential to transform bacterial
infection diagnostics and improve patient management. Analysis of
amplicons from long-read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene generates a
comprehensive view of the microbial community within clinical samples,
significantly enhancing sensitivity and capacity to analyse mixed
bacterial populations compared to short read sequencing approaches. This
study evaluates various ONT sequencing approaches and library
preparation kits to establish a reliable testing and quality framework
for clinical implementation. This study highlights the critical
importance of using well-characterized reference materials in validating
and revalidating long-read sequencing methods, leveraging a combination
of standardized reference materials and clinical samples to navigate the
evolving landscape of microbial diagnostics. It presents a robust
validation framework for laboratory accreditation and outlines a
methodology for comparing the performance of newer ONT chemistries with
earlier versions. Additionally, the study details the methods and
quality control measures necessary for achieving more accurate and
efficient diagnoses of bacterial infections, ultimately reducing time to
treatment and enhancing patient outcomes.</p>

id="clinical-characteristics-molecular-epidemiology-and-mechanisms-of-colistin-heteroresistance-in-enterobacter-cloacae-complex">Clinical
characteristics, molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of colistin
heteroresistance in Enterobacter cloacae complex</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionColistin has emerged as the last resort for treating
multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) infections. The
primary purposes of this study were to demonstrate the presence of
colistin heteroresistance in ECC and to further investigate their
clinical characteristics, molecular epidemiology and
mechanisms.MethodsPopulation analysis profiles (PAP) were performed to
confirm the heteroresistance phenotype. Average nucleotide identity
(ANI) was determined to classify ECC species. Phylogenetic analysis
based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (cg-SNPs),
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and core genome MLST (cg-MLST). Risk
factors and clinical outcomes of infections were analyzed through a
retrospective case-control study. Potential mechanisms of colistin
heteroresistance were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
efflux pump inhibition assays and reverse transcription quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR).ResultsA high proportion (24.4%) of the non-resistant strains
were colistin-heteroresistant isolates. Among the several ECC species,
Enterobacter kobei had the largest percentage (29.4%) of
colistin-heteroresistant isolates, followed by Enterobacter hormaechei
(20.5%) and Enterobacter bugandensis (20.0%). Notably, only one strain
(0.8%; 1/132) of Enterobacter hormaechei was fully resistant to
colistin. Different ECC species showed varying heteroresistance levels:
Enterobacter roggenkampii, Enterobacter kobei, Enterobacter asburiae and
Enterobacter bugandensis displayed high heteroresistance levels  (MIC ≥
128 mg/L). 75% of all ST116 and ST56 strains were heteroresistant to
colistin. The infection of ST116 and ST56 strains as well as exposure to
cephalosporin antibiotics were independent risk factors for
colistin-heteroresistant ECC infections. Mechanistic analysis revealed
that heteroresistance strongly correlated with the overexpression of
arnA, regulated by the PhoPQ two-component system (TCS). Notably, mgrB
had minimal impact. AcrAB-TolC efflux pump genes showed unsynchronized
expression; High acrB expression was strongly associated with colistin
heteroresistance, while acrA and tolC were not.DiscussionColistin
heteroresistance showed species-dependent variations in levels and
prevalence rates. The colistin-heteroresistant mechanisms were complex,
involving coordinated regulation of multiple genes. These results
highlighted the need for tailored antimicrobial stewardship. In
addition, the development of direct, reliable and rapid clinical methods
for detecting heteroresistance is essential for improving infection
management and prevention.</p>

id="identification-and-phylogenetic-characterization-of-novel-hunnivirus-recombinant-strains-in-cattle-from-guangxi-china">Identification
and phylogenetic characterization of novel hunnivirus recombinant
strains in cattle from Guangxi, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHunnivirus (HuV), a member of the Picornaviridae family,
is a single-stranded RNA virus associated with gastrointestinal issues
in animals and poses potential zoonotic risks. While HuV has been
detected in various animals, its prevalence and genetic characteristics
in cattle remain poorly understood.MethodsFrom 2021 to 2023, we
collected 1,017 fecal samples from cattle across Guangxi, China, and
analyzed them for HuV using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses
were conducted to assess the virus’s genetic diversity and potential
recombination events. Additionally, five HuV-positive samples were
selected for whole-genome amplification and sequencing.ResultsThe
overall prevalence of HuV was 3.05%, with significantly higher detection
rates in diarrheic cattle (9.59%) compared to healthy cattle (2.54%).
Regional prevalence varied, with the highest in Liuzhou (5.66%) and the
lowest in Nanning (1.51%). Phylogenetic analysis identified a novel
recombinant strain with distinct evolutionary patterns in the P3 genomic
region. Sequence analysis revealed low homology in the VP1 and P1
regions compared to known genotypes, suggesting the classification of
these strains as a new genotype. Additionally, the 5’ untranslated
region (5’UTR) analysis confirmed the presence of type II Internal
Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES), showing up to 91.8% nucleotide similarity
with human parechovirus HPeV-3.DiscussionThese findings reveal
significant genetic diversity and regional adaptation of HuV in cattle
populations. The virus is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms,
especially in areas with suboptimal farming conditions, and exhibits a
potential for zoonotic transmission. This study provides a foundation
for further research into the virus’s pathogenicity and zoonotic risk,
highlighting the need for continued surveillance to monitor its spread
and evolution.</p>

and salmochelin S4 inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>There is increasing demand for novel antimicrobial agents to tackle
the antimicrobial resistance crisis. Here we report that two
Enterobacteriaceae-produced siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin
S4, inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including
methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates. The IC50 for
different S. aureus isolates were 2-5 µM for salmochelin S4 and 5-10 µM
for enterobactin. This inhibitory activity was partially repressed by
adding Fe+3. These siderophores also inhibited the growth of
Enterococcus strains, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)
clinical isolates, though less effectively than for S. aureus. The
growth of various Gram-negative bacteria was barely affected by these
siderophores. These results shed new light on the role of enterobactin
and salmochelin in bacterial physiology and ecology and have potential
for the development of novel strategies to combat the rapid rise of
multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p>

detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae CARDS toxin in clinical respiratory
specimens by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In light of the absence of rapid and precise diagnostic laboratory
tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), a prominent
etiological agent implicated in a range of respiratory infections, we
developed and evaluated a rapid and straightforward loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the MP
community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome toxin (CARDS TX) gene.
The LAMP assay was performed at 65°C for a duration of 60 min, yielding
a minimum detection concentration of MP CARDS TX at 0.4986 pg/μl. The
assay exhibited no cross-reactivity with 13 other prevalent pathogens
associated with respiratory infections or with other common bacterial
toxin genes. To further substantiate the validity of the LAMP assay, 200
pharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected
from inpatients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
between June 2021 and July 2022. The results were compared with those
obtained by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
method for verification purposes. Of the 200 clinical specimens, 11
exhibited positive results for MP by LAMP and 10 displayed positive
results for MP by qPCR (P = 1.000). In summary, a sensitive, specific,
straightforward, and expeditious LAMP method for CARDS TX identification
was developed to facilitate rapid detection of MP in point-of-care
settings. This assay enables early and accurate diagnosis, even in
resource-limited environments, which is important for proper antibiotic
treatment and prognosis of MP infection.</p>

id="optimized-oxygen-therapy-improves-sleep-deprivation-induced-cardiac-dysfunction-through-gut-microbiota">Optimized
oxygen therapy improves sleep deprivation-induced cardiac dysfunction
through gut microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Adequate sleep is of paramount importance for relieving stress and
restoring mental vigor. However, the adverse physiological and
pathological responses resulting from sleep insufficiency or sleep
deprivation (SD) are becoming increasingly prevalent. Currently, the
impact of sleep deficiency on gut microbiota and microbiota-associated
human diseases, especially cardiac diseases, remains controversial.
Here, we employed the following methods: constructed an experimental
sleep-deprivation model in mice; conducted 16S rRNA sequencing to
investigate the changes in gut microbiota; through fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) experiments, transplanted fecal microbiota from
sleep-deprived mice to other mice; established an environment with a 30%
oxygen concentration to explore the therapeutic effects of oxygen
therapy on gut microbiota-associated cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction;
and utilized transcriptome data to study the underlying mechanisms of
oxygen therapy. The results revealed that: sleep-deprived mice exhibited
weakness, depression-like behaviors, and dysfunction in multiple organs.
Pathogenic cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis occurred in sleep-deprived
mice, accompanied by poor ejection fraction and fractional shortening.
16S rRNA sequencing indicated that sleep deprivation induced pathogenic
effects on gut microbiota, and similar phenomena were also observed in
mice that received fecal microbiota from sleep-deprived mice in the FMT
experiments. The environment with a 30% oxygen concentration effectively
alleviated the pathological impacts on cardiac function. Transcriptome
data showed that oxygen therapy targeted several hypoxia-dependent
pathways and inhibited the production of cardiac collagen. In
conclusion, these results demonstrate the significance of sufficient
sleep for gut microbiota and may represent a potential therapeutic
strategy, where the oxygen environment exerts a protective effect on
insomniacs through gut microbiota.</p>

id="investigating-the-gut-microbiota-profile-in-prehypertensive-individuals-exhibiting-phlegm-dampness-constitution">Investigating
the Gut Microbiota Profile in Prehypertensive Individuals Exhibiting
Phlegm-Dampness Constitution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPrehypertension is the preclinical stage of hypertension,
which is more likely to develop into hypertension than normal blood
pressure. Although the body may experience pathological changes at this
stage, there are often no symptoms. Chinese medicine constitution theory
is widely used to assess an individual’s health and disease status,
which provides a new method for disease prevention. The phlegm-dampness
constitution (PDC) is the main constitution in prehypertension.
Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora is considered to be related to the
development of hypertension. However, the characteristics of the
intestinal flora in prehypertensive populations with PDCs are still
unknown.Methods16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples was performed
in this study, which included 30 prehypertensive subjects with PDCs, 30
nonphlegm-dampness constitution (NPDC) prehypertensive individuals with
balanced constitution, and 30 ideal blood pressure subjects with
balanced constitution (BC). On the basis of the composition of the
intestinal flora, a random forest classifier was constructed to screen
the specific bacteria of the prehypertensive PDC population, and the
diagnostic efficiency was determined by the area under the curve
(AUC).ResultsAt the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes
decreased in the PDC group compared with the NPDC group. Bacteroides was
the most important genus at the genus level. Compared with those in the
NPDC or BC group, the relative abundances of o_RF39,
f_Porphyromonadaceae, f_Christensenellaceae, g_parabacteroides, and
g_nitrobacteria in the PDC group were significantly greater. The random
forest analysis results revealed that Alistipes, Butyricimonas,
Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, and Corynebacterium are bacterial genera
that significantly differ between the PDC and NPDC groups and greatly
contribute to group differentiation. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis revealed that the AUC range of differential bacteria and
its combined diagnostic model ranged from 0.653 (95% CI: 0.511–0.794) to
0.706 (95% CI: 0.573–0.838), suggesting that it is a potential risk
marker for phlegm-dampness constitution with
prehypertension.ConclusionsOur study indicates that PDC individuals with
prehypertension can be distinguished from NPDC individuals according to
their gut microbiome characteristics. Prevention and treatment measures
based on these biomarkers may be beneficial in opening new ideas and
directions for identifying more aggressive and effective interventions
for prehypertensive populations.</p>

of the gut tract in the therapeutic mechanisms of polydopamine for acute
cerebral infarction: neuro-immune interaction through the gut-brain
axis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecent research has made significant progress in
elucidating gastrointestinal complications following acute cerebral
infarction (ACI), which includes disorders in intestinal motility and
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the role of the gut
(which is acknowledged as being the largest immune organ) in the
immunoreactive effects of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) on acute
ischemic stroke remains inadequately understood. In addition to its
function in nutrient absorption, the gut acts as a protective barrier
against microbes. Systemic immune responses, which are triggered by the
disruption of gut barrier integrity, are considered as one of the
mechanisms underlying acute ischemic stroke, with the gut-brain axis
(GBA) playing a pivotal role in this process.MethodsIn this study, we
used a PDA intervention in an ACI model to investigate ACI-like
behavior, intestinal barrier function, central and peripheral
inflammation, and hippocampal neuron excitability, thus aiming to
elucidate the mechanisms through which PDA improves ACI via the
GBA.ResultsOur findings indicated that as ACI mice experienced dysbiosis
of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier damage, the levels of
proinflammatory factors in the serum and brain significantly increased.
Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampal region and
neuronal apoptosis were observed in ACI mice. Importantly, our study is
the first to provide evidence demonstrating that PDA effectively
suppresses the neuroimmune interactions of the gut-brain axis and
significantly improves intestinal epithelial barrier
integrity.ConclusionWe hope that our discoveries will serve as a
foundation for further explorations of the therapeutic mechanisms of PDA
in ACI, particularly in elucidating the protective roles of gut
microbiota and intestinal barrier function, as well as in the
development of more targeted clinical interventions for ACI.</p>

id="macrolide-resistance-in-mycoplasma-pneumoniae-in-adult-patients">Macrolide
resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adult patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most significant pathogens
responsible for<br>respiratory infections in humans. Macrolides are
recommended as the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. The
prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has increased
significantly in recent decades, particularly in China. The mechanisms
of resistance in M. pneumoniae to macrolides have been extensively
studied in pediatric patients. However, a paucity reports regarding the
resistance characteristics and mechanisms exhibited in adults. The aim
of this study was to elucidate the resistance of M. pneumoniae to
macrolides and the underlying mechanisms in adult patients. Pharyngeal
swab specimens were collected from adult patients presenting with
subacute cough or community-acquired pneumonia at our hospital from
January 2011 to June 2017 to identify and isolate M. pneumoniae strains.
The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates to 3 macrolide
antibiotics was assessed using broth microdilution method. The 23S rRNA
genes of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains were sequenced, and
the presence of target methylation genes (ermA, ermB, and ermC), efflux
pump genes (mefA, mefA/E, msrA, and msrA/B), and the macrolide
resistance gene mphC was identified through polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) testing. Additionally, MICs were determined with and without the
efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. A total of 72 M. pneumoniae strains
were isolated from adult patients, with 41.7% (30/72) exhibiting
macrolide resistance. Among the 3 macrolides tested, the
16-membered-ring midecamycin exhibited the greatest activity (MIC90: 16
µg/ml) against M. pneumoniae. All macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae
strains harbored mutations at the 2063 site in domain V of the 23S rRNA
gene. Two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae clinical isolates were found
to harbor the efflux pump genes msrA/B and mefA. The efflux pump
inhibitor reserpine reduced the MIC for azithromycin in these two
strains to a quarter of their original values. In summary,
macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae is commonly observed among adults in
Beijing. Point mutations are the primary mechanism responsible for
macrolide resistance in adults with M. pneumoniae. Additionally, the
efflux pump mechanism may contribute partially to this resistance.
Midecamycin presents a promising alternative drug for treating M.
pneumoniae infections, particularly in cases of azithromycin-resistant
M. pneumoniae infection in young children.</p>

environmental survey of Scedosporium species in Lebanon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundScedosporium species are filamentous fungi causing a wide
spectrum of infections in healthy and debilitated individuals. Despite
their clinical significance, the ecology of Scedosporium species remains
understudied, particularly in the Middle East.MethodsIn this context, we
conducted an environmental study to elucidate the distribution and
ecological preferences of Scedosporium species in the North of Lebanon.
One hundred and fifty-five soil samples were collected from different
environmental areas and analyzed for several chemical parameters.
Scedosporium isolates were then selected for species identification and
genotyping.ResultsOverall, 39 (25.16%) were positive for Scedosporium
species, with a predominance of S. apiospermum (80.56%). Soil analysis
revealed associations between the fungal presence and pH, nitrogen,
phosphorus, and organic matter content. Moreover, genotyping analysis
using MultiLocus Sequence Typing identified five major clusters.
Interestingly, a number of Lebanese isolates formed an Asian-specific
cluster (V) with one clinical Chinese isolate, whereas two clusters (II
and III) showed a close association with German isolates, and clusters
(I and IV) contained isolates with a global distribution.ConclusionThese
findings provide new insights into the ecology of Scedosporium species,
bridging a gap in our knowledge of their distribution on the Asian
continent and laying the groundwork for future clinical investigations.
Future international collaborations are essential to trace the origin of
S. apiospermum.</p>

and antibiofilm activities of star anise-cinnamon essential oil against
multidrug-resistant Salmonella Thompson</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR)
Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food
is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya
quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty
food in Guangxi, China.MethodsEight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated
from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets.
Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We
determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional
inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO)
and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and
checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess
the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil
(SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay
and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to
bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after
SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the
expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO
treatment.ResultsThe MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas
that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index
calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between
the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it
demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities
compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through
the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in
Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of
biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and
csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional
responses within the bacteria.DiscussionSCEO significantly impacts cell
wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm
formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an
alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific
investigation and development.</p>

CD4+ T cells through gut microbiota: therapeutic potential of
traditional Chinese medicine in inflammatory bowel disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease
characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract.
Gut microbiota (GM) and CD4+T cells are important in the development of
IBD. A lot of studies have shown that GM and their metabolites like
short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and tryptophan can be involved in
the differentiation of CD4+T cells through various mechanisms, which in
turn regulate the immune homeostasis of the IBD patients. Therefore,
regulating CD4+T cells through GM may be a potential therapeutic
direction for the treatment of IBD. Many studies have shown that
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas and some herbal extracts can
affect CD4+T cell differentiation by regulating GM and its metabolites.
In this review, we mainly focus on the role of GM and their metabolites
in regulating the differentiation of CD4+T cells and their correlation
with IBD. We also summarize the current research progress on the
regulation of this process by TCM.</p>
