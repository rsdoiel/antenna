and phenotypic characterization of a Clostridioides difficile strain of
the epidemic ST37 type from China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Clostridioides difficile strains of sequence type (ST) 37, primarily
including PCR ribotype (RT) 017, are prevalent in mainland China. Our
study aimed to compare the major virulence factors of an epidemic C.
difficile isolate of ST37 type (Xy06) from China with the
well-characterized C. difficile reference strains R20291 (RT027) and
CD630E (ST54), as well as a Chinese ST54 strain (Xy07) isolated from the
same hospital. The Xy06 genome was predicted to harbor two complete
prophages and several transposon-like elements. Comparative analysis of
PaLoc revealed a truncated tcdA gene, a functional tcdB gene, a
functional tcdC gene, and well-conserved tcdR and tcdE genes. Phenotypic
comparisons showed that Xy06 was a robust producer of TcdB, readily
sporulated and germinated, and strongly bound to human gut epithelial
cells. In a mouse model of C. difficile infection, Xy06 was more
virulent than strains CD630E and Xy07 and was comparable to strain
R20291 in virulence. Our data suggest the potential threat of the
epidemic ST37 strains in China.</p>

the frequency, antifungal susceptibility, and enzymatic profiles of the
oral fungal composition in patients with and without Alzheimer’s disease
admitted to a neurology clinic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundStudies have shown that changes in the frequency of oral
microorganisms may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). However, no research has been conducted on the oral fungal
composition in AD-patients. The present study aimed to investigate the
changes in the frequency of oral fungal composition, the antifungal
susceptibility, and the enzymatic profiles of oral fungal composition in
patients suffering from AD compared to non-AD individuals.Materials and
methodsIn the present analytical cross-sectional study during 12 months,
76 hospitalized patients with AD were matched with 76 individuals
without AD. A sterile serum physiology-moistened cotton-tipped swab was
used to sample the mouth area. All swabs were cultured on Sabouraud
Chloramphenicol Agar. Fungal identified were confirmed through the
PCR-sequencing techniques. Enzyme activity index (EAI) for important
pathogenic factors including proteinase, esterase and hemolysin was
measured using relevant protocols. The susceptibility to 8 antifungal
agents (nystatin, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole,
amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, and caspofungin) against fungal
strains obtained from AD-patients was evaluated according to the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, document
M38-A2 for filamentous fungi, and document M27-A4 for yeasts.ResultsThe
results showed that compared to the non-AD individuals, the prevalence
of oral fungal composition in AD group was 1.6 times higher. Candida
albicans was the most common fungal species isolated from oral swab
samples of AD group (n=53, 80%) and non-AD group (n=28, 40%), and the
diversity of the oral fungal composition in AD-patients were lower than
non-AD individuals. Among the 3 investigated virulence factors, a
statistically significant difference was shown in terms of hemolysin
activity level between the two studied groups (p&lt;0.05) and the
activity level of esterase and proteinase enzymes did not show a
significant difference in the two studied groups (p&gt;0.05). The
results showed that almost all of the tested isolates were susceptible
to nystatin, the most widely prescribed antifungal to treat superficial
infections, and only 1.69 % (2/118) of the Candida isolates were
resistant to this antifungal drug.ConclusionUnderstanding the changes in
the frequency of oral fungal composition the antifungal susceptibility,
and the enzymatic profiles of oral fungal composition in patients
suffering from AD compared to non-AD individuals makes it possible to
better understand the etiology of this disease.</p>

DNA oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs are non-stimulatory in vitro

<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Therapies that modulate and appropriately direct the immune response
are promising candidates for the treatment of infectious diseases. One
such candidate therapeutic is DZ13, a short, synthetic, single-stranded
DNA molecule. This molecule has enzymatic activity and can modulate the
immune response by binding to and degrading the mRNA encoding a key
immuno-regulatory molecule. Originally developed and entering clinical
trials as an anti-cancer agent, DZ13 has also been evaluated as a
treatment for viral infections, and has been shown to provide protection
against infection with influenza virus in a mouse model of infection. In
this work, we evaluated whether the immuno-modulatory properties of DZ13
could provide protection against the potential biothreat pathogen
Burkholderia pseudomallei which causes the neglected tropical disease
melioidosis. Treatment of mice infected with B. pseudomallei
demonstrated that DZ13 did indeed provide excellent protection after
only two post-exposure treatments. However, our data indicated that the
enzymatic activity contained in DZ13 was not required for protection,
with control oligonucleotide treatments lacking activity against the
target mRNA equally as protective against B. pseudomallei. We have
designed new sequences to study the mechanism of protection further.
These novel sequences offer enhanced protection against infection, but
are not directly anti-microbial and do not appear to be stimulating the
immune system via TLR9 or other key innate immune sensors, despite
containing CpG motifs. The molecular mechanism of these novel sequences
remains to be elucidated, but the data highlights that these
oligonucleotide-sensing pathways are attractive and relevant targets to
modulate during bacterial and viral infections.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In this mini review, we explore the complex network of inflammatory
reactions incited by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which extends its reach well
beyond the respiratory domain to influence various organ systems.
Synthesizing existing literature, it elucidates how the
hyperinflammation observed in COVID-19 patients affects multiple organ
systems leading to physiological impairments that can persist over long
after the resolution of infection. By exploring the systemic
manifestations of this inflammatory cascade, from acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) to renal impairment and neurological sequelae,
the review highlights the profound interplay between inflammation and
organ dysfunction. By synthesizing recent research and clinical
observations, this mini review aims to provide an overview of the
systemic interactions and complications associated with COVID-19,
underscoring the need for an integrated approach to treatment and
management. Understanding these systemic effects is crucial for
improving patient outcomes and preparing for future public health
challenges.</p>

id="isolation-and-pathogenicity-of-a-highly-virulent-group-iii-porcine-getah-virus-in-china">Isolation
and pathogenicity of a highly virulent group III porcine Getah virus in
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGetah virus (GETV) is a multi-host virus found in pigs,
horses, and blue foxes. Clinically, GETV can cause fever, diarrhea, and
reproductive disorders in pigs, representing significant threats to pig
breeding. At present, few studies have examined the pathogenicity of
GETV in pigs of different ages.MethodsIn the present study, a new
strain, named GETV-QJ, was isolated from clinically ill pigs, and whole
genome sequencing analysis was performed. Besides the pathogenicity of
piglets and pregnant sows of this strain was further studied.Resultsthe
results illustrated that the strain belonged to group III. The strain
had 93.6%–96.3% homology with other subtypes, and its homology with the
same subtype strain ranged 96.5%–99%. Further studies on the
pathogenicity of the virus indicated that this strain caused severe
diarrhea, fever, and intestinal and lung damage in 7-day-old piglets,
resulting in their death. The piglet survival rate was 0%. In pregnant
sows, this strain did not cause fever, death, or abortion, but it
induced viremia, which affected the farrowing performance of sows and
led to reduced piglet survival.DiscussionIn this study, we isolated a
highly virulent group III and comprehensively established a pathogenic
model of GETV in piglets and sows, providing a reference and guidance
for the prevention and control of this infection.</p>

pigderived Enterococcus hirae regulates the inflammatory function and
enhances the protection of piglets against ETEC challenge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This study investigated the effects of Enterococcus hirae (Eh)
derived from Ningxiang pigs on growth performance, diarrhea incidence,
and immune responses in ETEC-challenged piglets. The results showed that
compared to the CON group, ETEC infection significantly reduced the
average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI), increased
rectal temperature, and resulted in a diarrhea rate of up to 24%.
Additionally, ETEC infection significantly increased the spleen index
and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spleen, serum and
intestine, with decreasing serum sIgA and colonic SCFAs of piglets.
Compared to the ETEC group, orally Eh significantly increased ADFI in
ETEC-infected piglets, reduced the diarrhea rate to 11.53%, reduced the
spleen index and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the spleen,
serum and intestine, with decreasing serum sIgA and colonic SCFAs of
ETEC-infected piglets. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that
the levels of SCFAs (particularly acetate) were significantly negatively
correlated with the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in
colonic and splenic tissues, suggesting that acetate may be a key
metabolite in the anti-inflammatory effects of Eh. These results
indicate that Eh can enhance the protection of piglets against ETEC K88
via intestine-acetate-spleen axis, thereby alleviating diarrhea and
improving growth performance in piglets.</p>

management of pseudomonas biofilm-like structure in a post-pneumonectomy
empyema</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>We present a patient with a post-pneumonectomy empyema refractory to
surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics. The patient initially
presented with a bronchopleural fistula and pneumothorax secondary to
tuberculosis (TB) destroyed lung, which required a pneumonectomy with
Eloesser flap. Ongoing pleural infection delayed the closure of the
Eloesser flap, and thoracoscopic inspection of his chest cavity revealed
a green, mucous biofilm-like structure lining the postpneumonectomy
pleural cavity. Cultures identified pan-susceptible Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Despite debriding this biofilm-like structure and
administering systemic antibiotics, the patient continued to show
persistent signs of infection and regrowth of the film. We employed a
novel approach to dissolve the biofilm-like structure using intrapleural
dornase alfa followed by intrapleural antibiotic washes. After 3 weeks
of daily washes, repeat inspection demonstrated the biofilm-like
structure had completely resolved. Resolving the pseudomonas
biofilm-like structure allowed permanent closure of his chest without
further need for systemic antibiotics. At follow up 3 months later, he
showed no sequalae. This treatment option can be an important adjunct to
improve likelihood of chest closure in patients with post-pneumonectomy
empyema that resists standard treatment options due to biofilm
formation.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study describes the detection and tracking of
emergency neurosurgical cross-transmission infections with
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca (CRKO).MethodsWe conducted an
epidemiological investigation and a rapid screening of 66 surveillance
samples using the chromogenic selective medium. Two CRKO isolates from
infected patients and three from the preoperative shaving razors had
similar resistance profiles identified by the clinical
laboratory.ResultsThe whole genome sequencing (WGS) results identified
all isolates as Klebsiella michiganensis (a species in the K. oxytoca
complex) with sequence type 29 (ST29) and carrying resistance genes
blaKPC-2 and blaOXY-5, as well as IncF plasmids. The pairwise average
nucleotide identity values of 5 isolates ranged from 99.993% to 99.999%.
Moreover, these isolates displayed a maximum genetic difference of 3
among 5,229 targets in the core genome multilocus sequence typing
scheme, and the razors were confirmed as the contamination source. After
the implementation of controls and standardized shaving procedures, no
new CRKO infections occurred.ConclusionContaminated razors can be
sources of neurosurgical site infections with CRKO, and standard shaving
procedures need to be established. Chromogenic selective medium can help
rapidly identify targeted pathogens, and WGS technologies are effective
mean in tracking the transmission source in an epidemic or outbreak
investigation. Our findings increase the understanding of microbial
transmission in surgery to improve patient care quality.</p>

<p>BackgroundThis article employs bibliometric methods and visual maps
to delineate the research background, collaborative relationships,
hotspots, and trends in the study of gut fungi in human diseases and
health.MethodsPublications related to human gut fungi were retrieved
from the Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, R
software and Microsoft Excel were employed to generate visual
representations illustrating the contributions made by
countries/regions, authors, organizations, and journals. Employing
VOSviewer and CiteSpace, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the
retrieved publications, revealing underlying tendencies, research
hotspots, and intricate knowledge networks.ResultsThis study analyzed a
total of 3,954 publications. The United States ranks first in the number
of published papers and has the highest number of citations and h-index.
Mostafa S Elshahed is the most prolific author. The University of
California System is the institution that published the most papers.
Frontiers In Microbiology is the journal with the largest number of
publications. Three frequently co-cited references have experienced a
citation burst lasting until 2024.ConclusionAdvancements in sequencing
technologies have intensified research into human gut fungi and their
health implications, shifting the research focus from gut fungal
infections towards microbiome science. Inflammatory bowel diseases and
Candida albicans have emerged as pivotal areas of interest in this
endeavor. Through this study, we have gained a deeper insight into
global trends and frontier hotspots within this field, thereby enhancing
our understanding of the intricate relationship between gut fungi and
human health.</p>

gallate protects mice from Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium
infection by modulating bacterial virulence through quorum sensing
inhibition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium is a common pathogen that poses
a considerable public health threat, contributing to severe
gastrointestinal diseases and widespread foodborne illnesses. The
virulence of S. Typhimurium is regulated by quorum sensing (QS) and the
type III secretion system (T3SS). This study investigated the inhibitory
effects and anti-QS activity of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which
is a bioactive ingredient found in green tea, on the virulence of S.
Typhimurium. In vitro bacterial experiments demonstrated that EGCG
inhibited the production of autoinducers, biofilm formation, and
flagellar activity by downregulating the expression of AI-1, AI-2,
Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI)-1, SPI-2, and genes related to
flagella, fimbriae, and curli fibers. In a mouse model of S.
Typhimurium-induced enteritis, EGCG considerably reduced intestinal
colonization by S. Typhimurium and alleviated intestinal damage. In
conclusion, EGCG protects the intestines of mice infected with S.
Typhimurium by inhibiting QS-induced virulence gene expression,
demonstrating its potential as a therapeutic agent for controlling S.
Typhimurium infections.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIn clinical diagnosis of porcine diseases, co-infection
with multiple viruses often leads to similar clinical symptoms.
Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) can be caused by
infections with TTSuV or PCV2, while PCV2, PRV, and PPV can cause
respiratory and reproductive disorders in pigs. The overlapping clinical
and pathological features of these infections necessitate the
development of a rapid and specific method for differentiating and
detecting these four DNA viruses.MethodsIn this study, four pairs of
primers and TaqMan probes were designed targeting the conserved sequence
of TTSuV, the Rep gene of PCV2, the gE gene of PRV, and the VP2 gene of
PPV. After optimizing reaction conditions, including annealing
temperature, primer concentration, and probe concentration, a quadruplex
real-time PCR method was developed.ResultsThis method can specifically
detect TTSuV1, PCV2, PRV, and PPV simultaneously, with no
cross-reactivity with ASFV, CSFV, PRRSV, PEDV, PSV, and TGEV. The
minimum detection limit for each virus was 10 copies/μl, and the
inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 0.33%
to 1.43%. Subsequently, 150 clinical samples were tested to evaluate the
practical applicability of this method. The positive rates for TTSuV1,
PCV2, PRV, and PPV were 8.6% (13/150), 10.67% (16/150), 14% (21/150),
and 11.33% (17/150), respectively.DiscussionThe results indicate that
the established quadruplex real-time PCR method can assist in the
accurate and rapid diagnosis of TTSuV1, PCV2, PRV, and PPV in clinical
settings, providing robust support for the prevention and control of
these infections.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionUrinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common
medical complaints in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this
study was to assess the real indication of an initial broad-spectrum
treatment administered in the ED for hospitalized patients with a
diagnosis of community-acquired UTI (CAUTI).Materials and methodsThis is
a monocentric observational retrospective study conducted in the ED of
one of the largest tertiary care centers in Lebanon, on a two-year
period, including adult patients admitted to the hospital for a CAUTI.
The primary outcome was to evaluate the need of downgrading empirical
antibiotherapy started in the ED. Secondary outcomes included a
description of CAUTIs characteristics: prevalence and risk factors for
(extended spectrum beta lactamases) ESBL-related infection, complicated
and uncomplicated UTIs, empirical and targeted treatment, and finally
the rate of adherence to local guidelines.ResultsThe most isolated
strains on urine cultures were gram negative bacilli (GNB) with 29.1%
producing ESBL; 69.4% of patients received an ESBL-targeting empirical
treatment in the ED, in agreement with local guidelines, 46% of which
needed a downgrade. Amikacin adjunction was only indicated in 42.8% of
the cases. Patients who received antibiotics in the last 6 months had a
2.36 times higher risk of developing an ESBL-related
infection.ConclusionThis study showed a high adherence rate to local
recommendations suggesting the use of empirical ESBL-targeting
antibiotherapy even in uncomplicated UTIs. However, the frequent need of
de-escalation highlights the importance of establishing an efficient
multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria surveillance system in the community
in order to elaborate a stewardship program with more solid local
guidelines.</p>

activates NF-κB and ERK1/2 through TLR2 and contributes to the virulence
of Pasteurella multocida</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPasteurella multocida is a pathogenic bacterium known to
cause hemorrhagic septicemia and pneumonia in poultry. Reports have
indicated that certain proteins, either directly involved in or
regulating iron metabolism, are important virulence factors of P.
multocida. Therefore, understanding virulent factors and analyzing the
role of pro-inflammatory cytokines can help us elucidate the underlying
pathogenesis.MethodsIn this study, the PMCNA_RS00975 protein, a putative
encapsuling protein encoded by a gene from a specific prophage island of
the pathogenic strain C48-1 of P. multocida, was investigated. To
further explore the impact of the PMCNA_RS00975 protein on
pathogenicity, a PMCNA_RS00975 gene mutant of P. multocida strain C48-1
was constructed using positive selection technology. Subcellular
localization was performed to determine the location of the
PMCNA_RS00975 protein within P. multocida. The recombinant protein
PMCNA_RS00975 of P. multocida was soluble expressed, purified, and its
role in pro-inflammatory cytokines was investigated.ResultsThe mutant
exhibited significantly reduced pathogenicity in the mice model.
Furthermore, subcellular localization indicated that the PMCNA_RS00975
protein was located at the outer membrane and expressed during infection
of P. multocida. Additionally, our experiments revealed that recombinant
PMCNA_RS00975 protein promotes the secretion of the IL-6
pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by the TLR2 receptor via NF-κB and
ERK1/2 signaling pathways in the macrophages.DiscussionThis study
identified a novel virulence factor in the C48-1 strain, providing a
basis for understanding the pathogenesis and directions for the
development of attenuated vaccines against P. multocida.</p>

viruses and A. fumigatus in vitro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionInfluenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is
associated with high mortality rates and limited treatment options. The
current standard practice involves treating each pathogen separately.
However, the use of antifungal drugs can lead to serious side effects,
and the presence of triazole-resistant Aspergillus strains can
complicate antifungal therapy. In addition, drug-resistant influenza
viruses are becoming an increasing concern in clinics. A drug that
affects fungal and viral propagation could overcome these disadvantages.
Thus, we conducted a study to examine the antifungal and antiviral
properties of ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride (HCl), which are
prodrugs derived from the local anesthetic procaine.MethodsConidia of
different A. fumigatus strains, A. flavus and A. terreus were treated
with the test substances in a human cell-free system and antifungal
properties were analyzed either by fluorescence microscopy or absorption
measurements. Changes in metabolic activity and intracellular Ca2+
distribution during treatment of A. fumigatus with ProcCluster® were
observed using fluorescence microscopy. In addition, antifungal and
antiviral properties of ProcCluster® and procaine HCl were investigated
during in vitro coinfection of lung epithelial cells with A. fumigatus
and influenza A viruses (IAV). Analysis was performed by fluorescence
microscopy, standard plaque assay and Western blot assay.ResultsBoth
substances inhibited the growth of the fungus, even when applied after
germination or in the presence of purified IAV particles. ProcCluster®
remained effective against triazole-resistant A. fumigatus strains.
However, the addition of CaCl2 reversed the antifungal effect,
indicating that ProcCluster® inhibited fungal growth by disrupting
fungal Ca2+ homeostasis. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that
ProcCluster® and procaine HCl reduced the pathogen load of IAV and A.
fumigatus during coinfection. Finally, the combination of ProcCluster®
with the antiviral drug favipiravir exhibited increased antipathogenic
activity, particularly against IAV replication.DiscussionThis research
highlights ProcCluster® and procaine HCl as substances with
anti-infective properties against various pathogens.</p>

metabolomics and pseudo-targeted lipidomics combined with gut microbes
reveal the protective effects of Causonis japonica (Thunb.) Raf. in
ulcerative colitis mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease
characterized by recurrent inflammatory tissue damage to the intestinal
mucosa and forming intestinal epithelial ulcers. It is one of the most
intractable diseases in the world. To date, the mechanism is unclear.
Causonis japonica (Thunb.) Raf. (Wu Lianmei in Chinese; WLM), a
traditional Chinese medicine, which has a long history as an
anti-inflammatory, but its effect on UC was unconfirmed yet. Therefore,
we established a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC mice model and
evaluated the therapeutic effect of WLM extract. The results indicated
that WLM inhibits DSS-induced inflammatory response in colitis in vivo,
decrease DSS-induced clinical manifestations, reverses colon length
shortening, and reduces tissue damage. The results of ELISA kits
suggested that WLM could reverse the levels of DSS-induced inflammatory
factors. To explore the mechanism of WLM in treating DSS-induced UC, 1H
NMR and UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap MS were used to perform non-targeted
metabolomics analysis; 21 differential metabolites in colon tissues were
closely related to UC. Meanwhile, the pseudo-targeted lipidomics based
on UHPLC-Q/Trap MS was used to analyze lipid metabolism disorders, and
60 differential lipid compounds were screened. These differential
compounds were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid,
glycerolipid, citric acid, tyrosine, and ether lipid metabolisms. The
analysis of gut microbial showed that WLM may improve the symptoms of UC
mice by reducing the abundance of Helicobacter and Streptococcus and
increasing the abundance of Limosilactobacillus and Akkermansia.
Moreover, the real-time qPCR results showed that WLM extract could
decrease the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors and may be associated
with protecting the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier by
destroying in vivo metabolic pathways, especially by regulating energy
and lipid metabolisms and reducing inflammatory reactions. It provides a
beneficial reference for studying WLM to elucidate the therapeutic
mechanism of UC.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe co-existence of S. mutans and C. albicans is
frequently detected in root caries and early child caries and is
reported to be associated with recurrent caries. The aim of this study
was to investigate the effects of potassium iodide (KI) in combination
with toluidine blue O-mediated antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT)
on S. mutans and C. albicans mixed-species biofilm, as well as the
antibiofilm mechanisms involved.MethodsMixed-species biofilm was
constructed of S. mutans and C. albicans on dentin blocks. The
antibiofilm efficacy, cytotoxicity and antibiofilm mechanism of KI in
combination with aPDT were determined and evaluated.ResultsKI+TBO-aPDT
treatment caused reduction in microorganism counts, metabolic activity,
and biofilm biomass of mixed-species biofilm without inducing
cytotoxicity to hDPCs (human dental pulp cells). Observations such
increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels, impaired cell membrane
function, cell apoptosis and reduced expression in several genes seem to
be artifacts of reduced growth and general killing by KI+TBO-aPDT
treatment.DiscussionThese data suggested that KI in combination with
aPDT as an innovative approach to combat S. mutans and C. albicans
biofilm, and thus as an optional treatment for caries.</p>

compound-induced downregulation of antimicrobial resistance and
biofilm-linked genes in wastewater Aeromonas species</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Addressing the global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis requires
a multifaceted innovative approach to mitigate impacts on public health,
healthcare and economic systems. In the complex evolution of AMR,
biofilms and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs)
play a pivotal role. Aeromonas is a major AMR player that often forms
biofilm, harbors ARGs and is frequently detected in wastewater. Existing
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) do not have the capacity to totally
eliminate antimicrobial-resistant bacteria favoring the evolution of
ARGs in wastewater. Besides facilitating the emergence of AMR, biofilms
contribute significantly to biofouling process within the activated
sludge of WWTP bioreactors. This paper presents the inhibition of
biofilm formation, the expression of biofilm-linked genes and ARGs by
phytochemicals andrographolide, docosanol, lanosterol, quercetin, rutin
and thymohydroquinone. Aeromonas species were isolated and purified from
activated sludge samples. The ARGs were detected in the isolated
Aeromonas species through PCR. Aeromonas biofilms were quantified
following the application of biocompounds through the microtiter plate
assay. qPCR analyses of related genes were done for confirmation.
Findings showed that the natural compounds inhibited the formation of
biofilms and reduced the expression of genes linked to biofilm
production as well as ARGs in wastewater Aeromonas. This indicates the
efficacy of these compounds in targeting and controlling both ARGs and
biofilm formation, highlighting their potential as innovative solutions
for combating antimicrobial resistance and biofouling.</p>

influence of perilipin 5 deficiency on gut microbiome profiles in murine
metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and
MAFLD-hepatocellular carcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD) has emerged as the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) worldwide. Over the years, Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) has been recognized
as a key regulator of both MAFLD and HCC development. In our previous
studies we demonstrated that deficiency in Plin5 reduces the severity of
MAFLD and HCC in mice. Interestingly, it has been established that
patients with MAFLD and HCC exhibit various changes in their gut
microbiome profiles. The gut microbiome itself has been shown to play a
role in modulating carcinogenesis and the immune response against
cancer.MethodsTherefore, we conducted a study to investigate the
alterations in fecal microbiome composition in wild type (WT) and
Plin5-deficient (Plin5-/-) mice models of MAFLD and MAFLD-induced HCC
(MAFLD-HCC). We utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to profile
the composition of gut bacteria in fecal samples.ResultsNotably, we
discovered that the absence of Plin5 alone is already associated with
changes in gut microbiota composition. Moreover, feeding the mice a
Western diet (WD) resulted in additional microbial alterations.
Interestingly, Plin5-/- animals exhibited an enrichment of the
beneficial taxa Lactobacillus in both animal models.DiscussionOur
findings identify Plin5 as a major regulator of gut microbiota during
the development of MAFLD and MAFLD-HCC.</p>

cruzi-derived exovesicles contribute to parasite infection, tissue
damage, and apoptotic cell death during ex vivo infection of human
placental explants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be
congenitally transmitted by crossing the placental barrier. This study
investigates the role of T. cruzi-derived exovesicles (TcEVs) in
facilitating parasite infection and the consequent tissue damage and
apoptotic cell death in human placental explants (HPEs). Our findings
demonstrate that TcEVs significantly enhance the parasite load and
induce tissue damage in HPEs, both in the presence and absence of the
parasite. Through histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, we
show that TcEVs alone can disrupt the placental barrier, affecting the
basal membrane and villous stroma. The induction of apoptotic cell death
is evidenced by DNA fragmentation, caspase 8 and 3, and p18 fragment
immunodetection. This damage is exacerbated when TcEVs are combined with
T. cruzi infection. These findings suggest that TcEVs play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of congenital Chagas disease by disrupting the
placental barrier and facilitating parasite transmission to the fetus.
This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transplacental
transmission of T. cruzi and highlights the potential of targeting TcEVs
as a therapeutic strategy against congenital Chagas disease.</p>

patients with invasive meningococcal disease in Lithuania</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNeisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium
responsible for life-threatening invasive infections known as invasive
meningococcal disease and is associated with high fatality rates and
serious lifelong disabilities among survivors.MethodsThis study aimed to
characterize N. meningitidis isolates cultured from blood and
cerebrospinal fluid collected between 2009 and 2021 in Lithuania, assess
their genomic relationships with European strains, and evaluate the
possibility of using a cost-effective method for strain
characterization, thus improving the national molecular surveillance of
invasive meningococcal disease. In total, 321 N. meningitidis isolates
were collected and analyzed using multilocus restriction typing (MLRT).
Amplification of the penA gene and restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis were performed to identify the modified penA
genes. Based on the MLRT genotyping results, we selected 10 strains for
additional analysis using whole-genome sequencing. The sequenced genomes
were incorporated into a dataset of publicly available N. meningitidis
genomes to evaluate genomic diversity and establish phylogenetic
relationships within the Lithuanian and European circulating
strains.ResultsWe identified 83 different strains using MLRT genotyping.
Genomic diversity of N. meningitidis genomes analysed revealed 21
different sequence types (STs) circulating in Lithuania. Among these,
ST34 was the most prevalent. Notably, three isolates displayed unique
combinations of seven housekeeping genes and were identified as novel
STs: ST16969, ST16901, and ST16959. The analyzed strains were found to
possess virulence factors not commonly found in N. meningitidis. Six
distinct penA profiles were identified, each with different frequencies.
In the present study, we also identified N. meningitidis strains with
new penA, NEIS0123, NEIS1320, NEIS1525, NEIS1600, and NEIS1753 loci
variants. In our study, using the cgMLST scheme, Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST) analysis did not identify significant geographic relationships
between Lithuanian N. meningitidis isolates and strains from
Europe.DiscussionDiscussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study
to employ whole genome sequencing (WGS) method for a comprehensive
genetic characterization of invasive N. meningitidis isolates from
Lithuania. This approach provides a more detailed and precise analysis
of genomic relationships and diversity compared to prior studies relying
on traditional molecular typing methods and antigen analysis.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis and infections with periodontal bacteria have been
highlighted as risk factors for dementia. In recent years, attention has
been drawn to the role of microglia cells in neurodegenerative diseases.
However, there is limited knowledge of the influence of periodontal
bacteria on microglia cells. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the interactions between the periodontal bacteria
Porphyromonas gingivalis and microglia cells and to unravel whether
these interactions could contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer’s
disease. We found, through microarray analysis, that stimulation of
microglia cells with P. gingivalis resulted in the upregulation of
several Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes, including NOX4. We also
showed that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (LPS) mediated reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin
8 (IL-8) induction via NOX4 in microglia. The viability of neurons was
shown to be reduced by conditioned media from microglia cells stimulated
with P. gingivalis LPS and the reduction was NOX4 dependent. The levels
of total and phosphorylated tau in neurons were increased by conditioned
media from microglia cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or LPS. This
increase was NOX4-dependent. In summary, our findings provide us with a
potential mechanistic explanation of how the periodontal pathogen P.
gingivalis could trigger or exacerbate AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>BackgroundTuberculous meningitis (TBM) with adults Epstein-Barr (EB)
virus encephalitis is a very rare infectious disease, with a high
mortality and disability. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly diagnostic. We report on a case
of severe meningoencephalitis caused by co-infection with mycobacterium
tuberculosis and EB virus. Brain MRI indicated a parenchyma lesion in
the brain. mNGS of CSF indicated Mycobacterium tuberculosis and EB virus
amplification, positive serum EB virus IgG antibodies, and improved
symptoms after anti-tuberculosis and antiviral treatment. A
re-examination of the brain MRI revealed that the significantly
absorption of the lesions.Case reportA 49-year-old male patient
presented with a chief complaint of headache and fever with
consciousness disturbance. The brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a
lesions in the right parenchymal brain with uneven enhancement,
accompanied by significantly increased intracranial pressure, elevated
CSF cell count and protein levels, as well as notably decreased glucose
and chloride levels. mNGS of CSF showed the coexistence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and EBV. The patient was diagnosed as TBM with EBV
encephalitis. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved with the active
administration of anti-tuberculosis combined with antiviral agents, the
use of hormones to reduce inflammatory reaction, dehydration to lower
intracranial pressure, and intrathecal injection. Subsequent follow-up
brain magnetic resonance imaging indicated significant absorption of the
lesions, along with a marked decrease in CSF count and protein levels,
as well as obvious increase in glucose and chloride levels.ConclusionTBM
associated with adult EBV encephalitis is extremely rare. The disease’s
early stages are severe and have a high fatality rate. A prompt and
accurate diagnosis is particularly important. NGS of CSF is of great
value for early diagnosis.</p>
