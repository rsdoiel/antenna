threats of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b: cross-species transmission,
pathogenesis, and pandemic risk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) with
zoonotic potential, posing a significant risk to animal health,
agriculture, and human public health. A particular strain, clade
2.3.4.4b, has spread globally and has been detected in various mammalian
species—including cattle and a limited number of human
cases—highlighting its potential to spark a pandemic. Investigating this
specific clade represents a crucial step toward the development of
effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. This mini-review aims
to outline the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms driving the
current bird flu outbreak in cattle. A targeted literature search was
conducted in PubMed for studies published between 2003 and 2025 using
keywords such as “bird flu”, “cattle”, “mammals”, “H5N1”, and
“pathogenesis”. This review explores the pathogenic mechanisms and
clinical manifestations associated with HPAIV H5N1 infections in mammals
specially in cattle. A key hypothesis is that the ongoing outbreak is
fueled by molecular adaptations in the virus that enhance its ability to
cross species barriers. As these mechanisms continue to be uncovered,
there is a pressing need for high-quality research to inform pandemic
preparedness, guide effective control strategies, and support the
development of targeted vaccines and antiviral therapies.</p>

gut bacteria and their potential role in the initiation, exacerbation,
and development of human colorectal cancer: a narrative review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths around the world. Rectal bleeding, changes in
bowel movements, weight loss, and fatigue are the main clinical
presentations of CRC. While the exact etiology of the disease is
unknown, CRC is considered a complex and multifactorial disease resulted
from an intricate interplay of genetic and environmental factors.
Moreover, CRC is known as a chronic inflammation–associated tumor, and
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) are susceptible groups to CRC development. The gut
microbiota and its metabolites play a crucial role in the development
and progression of CRC. CRC can be created after anaerobic bacterial
infections such as Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF),
Fusobacterium, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens,
Clostridium septicum, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, etc.
Activation of Wnt signaling, loss of tissue architecture,
proinflammatory signaling, and genotoxic cellular DNA damage are the
primary mechanisms by which anaerobic bacteria induce carcinogenesis in
CRC. Besides, spore germination and toxin production are done in hypoxic
and acidic conditions. Therefore, according to the presence of this
condition (anaerobic glycolysis) in tumor tissue, the tumor environment
is suitable for the formation of anaerobic infections. The current
review‐based study aims to discuss the important aspects of these
mechanisms and their possible roles in the initiation, development, and
exacerbation of CRC.</p>

and pathogenicity of the novel porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome virus 1 strain ZJ01 in South China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe emergence and widespread dissemination of novel
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus type 1 (PRRSV-1)
strains in China pose significant challenges, leading to substantial
clinical infections within swine populations. MethodsIn this study, we
isolated a novel PRRSV-1 strain, designated ZJ01.ResultsWhole-genome
sequencing revealed a genome length of 15,125 bp. Comprehensive
phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequence classified
ZJ01 within a distinct new sublineage. Intriguingly, phylogenetic
analysis of the ORF5 gene indicated that ZJ01 clusters with classical
BJEU06-1-like strains. Molecular characterization identified unique
deletions within the hypervariable regions of structural proteins: a
three-amino acid deletion at positions 243-248 in GP3 and a four-amino
acid deletion at positions 63-68 in GP4. Pathogenicity studies in
piglets demonstrated that ZJ01 infection induces characteristic clinical
signs, including pyrexia and sustained viral shedding. Post-mortem
examination revealed significant lung pathology characterized by
hemorrhages and lesions typical of PRRSV infection. Notably, while
causing significant morbidity, the ZJ01 strain did not result in direct
mortality in the infected piglets under the conditions of this study.
DiscussionCollectively, this study provides a detailed characterization
and pathogenic evaluation of the novel PRRSV-1 strain ZJ01, contributing
essential information for the development of effective prevention and
control strategies in swine farms.</p>

in animal infectious disease control: diagnosis and therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Animal infectious diseases threaten livestock productivity, public
health, and food security. Traditional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) face
limitations in diagnostics and therapy due to their large size,
instability, and high cost. Nanobodies (Nbs), derived from camelid
heavy-chain antibodies, offer superior properties—small size (~15 kDa),
high stability, deep tissue penetration, and cost-effective production.
Nbs feature extended CDR3 loops, enabling access to cryptic epitopes,
and exhibit exceptional thermal/pH stability. They are generated by
immunizing camelids, cloning VHH genes, and screening via phage/yeast
display. High-throughput methods (ELISA, flow cytometry) allow rapid
isolation of high-affinity Nbs. Compared to mAbs, Nbs are economically
produced in prokaryotic systems and engineered into multivalent or
Fc-fused formats for enhanced efficacy. In diagnostics, Nbs enable
sensitive, low-cost detection of pathogens like PRRSV, ASFV, and avian
influenza. Nb-based competitive ELISAs and lateral flow assays improve
field surveillance. Therapeutically, Nbs neutralize pathogens by
targeting viral proteins (e.g., blocking PRRSV-CD163 entry) or bacterial
toxins (e.g., Staphylococcus enterotoxins). Nb-Fc fusions degrade ASFV
proteins via TRIM-away, while intracellular Nbs disrupt Mycobacterium
ESAT-6 or Toxoplasma actin dynamics. Challenges remain in Nb affinity
optimization, intracellular delivery, and in vivo half-life. Solutions
include fusion with cell-penetrating peptides or viral vectors (e.g.,
adenoviruses). Reducing cross-species immunogenicity and scaling
production are critical for broader adoption. With advances in protein
engineering, Nbs hold transformative potential for preventing,
diagnosing, and treating animal diseases, offering scalable solutions
for global health and food security.</p>

characterization of Smilax glabra Roxb., and its inhibitory activity
against Helicobacter pylori through targeted suppression of its secreted
urease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSmilax glabra Roxb. (SGR), known as “tufuling” in China, is
a medical and edible plant, which has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial
and antineoplastic activity. SGR is extensively utilized in the remedy
of gastroenteric disorders associated with H. pylori infection. However,
the precise mechanism underlying the anti-H. pylori function of SGR
remains to be elucidated.AimThe inhibitory impact of SGR on the growth
of H. pylori was examined. Subsequently, SGR against H. pylori urease
(HPU) and jack bean urease (JBU) was investigated to illuminate the
inhibitory effects, kinetic types, sites of inhibition, and potential
mechanisms of action.MethodsUPLC-ESI-MS/MS was applied to identify the
components of SGR. The anti-H. pylori effect of SGR was conducted by
agar dilution method. The enzyme inhibitory activities of SGR and its
primary constituents were assessed through a modified spectrophotometric
Berthelot (phenol-hypochlorite) assay. The kinetics of urease inhibition
were analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk plots. To explore the underlying
mechanisms, sulfhydryl group reagents and Ni2+ binding depressors were
employed. Additionally, molecular docking simulations were conducted to
examine the binding interactions between the main compounds of SGR and
urease.ResultsA total of 34 compounds including astilbin, engeletin,
isoengeletin, neoastilbin, isoastilbin and neoisoastilbin are identified
in SGR. SGR was observed to inhibit the growth of three H. pylori
strains (ATCC 43504, NCTC 26695, and ICDC 111001) with minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) values spanning a range of 0.5 to 1.5
mg/mL. Moreover, SGR exerted a significant inhibitory effect on HPU and
JBU, with IC50 values of 1.04 ± 0.01 mg/mL and 1.01 ± 0.01 mg/mL,
separately. Enzyme kinetics analysis showed that SGR was a slow binding,
non-competitive depressor to HPU, and a slow binding, mixed depressor to
JBU. In-depth mechanism exploration showed that thiol compounds had
better protective effect on HPU or JBU than inorganic substances,
implying that the active site of SGR repressing urease may be the
sulfhydryl group. Furthermore, glutathione reactivated SGR-inhibited
urease, demonstrating that the inhibition was reversible. Additionally,
astilbin and engeletin exhibited a certain inhibitory role towards
urease activity, with astilbin inhibiting urease more than three times
as strongly as engelitin. Enzyme kinetics analysis established that the
inhibitory role of astilbin on enzymes was consistent with that of SGR.
Molecular docking study indicated that astilbin and engeletin interacts
with sulfhydryl groups at the active site of urease.ConclusionThese
results indicated that SGR could prominently inhibit H. pylori growth
through targeted suppression of its secreted urease. This investigation
provides substantial experimental evidence supporting the consideration
of SGR as a safe and promising natural treatment for H.
pylori-associated gastrointestinal diseases.</p>

into intestinal barrier disruption during long-term gut Chlamydia
colonization in mice: a single-cell transcriptomic approach</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionChlamydia trachomatis, a leading cause of sexually
transmitted bacterial infections in women, is increasingly recognized
for its potential to colonize the gastrointestinal tract as a long-term
reservoir. However, the mechanisms enabling its persistence in the gut
remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective
treatments for chronic infections.MethodsWe employed single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze gene expression profiles and cellular
heterogeneity in mouse colonic tissues during Chlamydia long-term
colonization to characterize transcriptional changes and intercellular
interactions critical for bacterial persistence.ResultsOur analysis
revealed significant alterations in gene expression across intestinal
cell populations, with distinct molecular pathways implicated in
Chlamydia persistence. Key findings included downregulation of
epithelial tight junction markers, suggesting compromised intestinal
barrier integrity, which may facilitate bacterial invasion.
Additionally, we observed dysregulation of goblet cell transcriptional
networks and disrupted immune-epithelial cell communication, indicating
potential mechanisms for bacterial survival.DiscussionThese findings
highlight how Chlamydia may exploit host cell pathways to establish
long-term colonization in the gut. The impairment of epithelial barrier
function and altered cellular crosstalk provide novel insights into its
persistence strategies. Understanding these mechanisms could inform
future therapeutic approaches targeting chronic Chlamydia
infections.</p>

performance evaluation of FilmArray RP 2.1 and targeted next-generation
sequencing in upper respiratory tract infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionUpper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) represent a
significant global health burden, impacting patient morbidity and
quality of life. The implementation of accurate pathogen detection
methods is crucial for precise diagnosis and effective clinical
management of URTIs. This study evaluates the clinical performance of
targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) as a diagnostic tool for
comprehensive identification of URTI-associated pathogens.MethodsA total
of 190 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients were enrolled for the
study. These specimens underwent pathogen identification using both tNGS
and the FilmArray respiratory panel. The results obtained from these two
methods were then compared.ResultsOverall, tNGS identified 164 positive
samples, compared to 91 positives identified by FilmArray. Regarding the
shared target species or subtypes, tNGS identified 97 positive samples,
whereas the FilmArray respiratory panel detected 88 positives out of 190
specimens. tNGS identified a diverse array of 34 different pathogens,
significantly surpassing the 12 pathogens identified by the FilmArray
panel. The detection rates for tNGS and FilmArray were 51.05% (97/190)
and 46.32% (88/190), respectively. Statistical analysis revealed no
significant difference in the detection rates of 10 specific respiratory
pathogens (with ≥3 positives). Furthermore, the overall pathogen
detection accuracy of tNGS was determined to be 90.16% (95%CI =
83.45%~94.81%), with a sensitivity of 95.45%
(88.77%~98.75%).ConclusionsThe tNGS method demonstrates broader pathogen
detection capability compared to the FilmArray, achieving a higher
positive detection rate in upper respiratory tract infections. It
demonstrates high accuracy and sensitivity, offering a viable and rapid
diagnostic approach for upper respiratory tract infections.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes ongoing economic losses to
the livestock industry. Monitoring antibodies via enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a key tool for ensuring the eradication
of BVDV from cattle herds. We developed an indirect ELISA (rE2-iELISA)
using CHO-S-expressed recombinant E2 protein, the major immunogenic
glycoprotein mediating viral attachment and immune evasion. Optimized
assay conditions included: 0.4 μg/well antigen coating, 5% BSA blocking,
1:100 serum dilution, and 1:5000 secondary antibody dilution. The assay
demonstrated exclusive specificity for BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 with detection
sensitivity to 1:1,500 serum dilution. Validation revealed exceptional
diagnostic performance: ROC analysis showed 0.998 AUC (cutoff=0.125),
94.8% concordance with IDEXX ELISA, and the intra- and inter-batch
coefficient of variation are both less than 5%. The experimental results
indicate that the indirect ELISA detection method based on BVDV rE2
exhibits good sensitivity, specificity, and stability. And a stable
serological tool for BVDV surveillance and vaccine efficacy evaluation
in cattle populations.</p>

<p>Exosomes are nanoparticles delimited by a lipid bilayer that are
secreted by a wide variety of cells. They play a significant role in the
pathophysiological processes associated with HBV infection, which poses
huge burdens for public health. Emerging evidence has been demonstrated
that exosomes are extensively associated with the replication and
transmission processes of HBV. In this review, we outline the process of
exosome production, composition and function. Moreover, we elaborate on
the essential role of exosomes in the pathology processes of HBV
infection. Exosomes could serve as essential biomarkers for early
detection of HBV infection and HBV-related diseases. Finally, we outline
the therapeutic potential of exosomes in anti-HBV therapy, which may
provide novel insights into the prevention and treatment of HBV.</p>

microbiota and metabolomics in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty
liver disease: interaction, mechanism, and therapeutic value</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The global epidemic of Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver
disease (MAFLD) urgently demands breakthroughs in precision medicine
strategies. Its pathogenesis centers on the cascade dysregulation of the
gut microbiota-metabolite-liver axis: microbial dysbiosis drives hepatic
lipid accumulation and fibrosis by suppressing short-chain fatty acid
synthesis, activating the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway, and
disrupting bile acid signaling. Metabolomics further reveals
characteristic disturbances including free fatty acid accumulation,
aberrantly elevated branched-chain amino acids (independently predictive
of hepatic steatosis), and mitochondrial dysfunction, providing a
molecular basis for disease stratification. The field of precision
diagnosis is undergoing transformative innovation—multi-omics
integration combined with AI-driven analysis of liver enzymes and
metabolic biomarkers enables non-invasive, ultra-high-accuracy staging
of fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies are shifting towards
personalization: microbial interventions require matching to
patient-specific microbial ecology, drug selection necessitates efficacy
and safety prediction, and synthetically engineered “artificial
microbial ecosystems” represent a cutting-edge direction. Future efforts
must establish a “multi-omics profiling–AI-powered dynamic
modeling–clinical validation” closed-loop framework to precisely halt
MAFLD progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by
deciphering patient-specific mechanisms.</p>

of donation-related infections: investigating the use of antibiotics in
the decontamination of preservation fluid for organ transplantation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDonation-related infections (DRIs), particularly those
caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB), can have
disastrous consequences because of their extensive drug resistance.
Contamination during graft acquisition and transport can lead to DRIs,
and the use of antibiotics in preservation fluid (PF) before organ
transplantation can reduce the incidence of DRIs. This study was to
determine and compare the effectiveness of different PF decontamination
regimens to prevent CRGNB related DRIs.MethodsTwelve CRGNB strains were
chosen to be the targets of decontamination, and a drug concentration
gradient was established for each test drug based on the previous
clinical research. In addition the standard decontamination procedures
were performed to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of polymyxin
B (PB), colistin sulfate (CS), colistimethate sodium (CMS) and amikacin
(AK) in the 0~4°C PF, and to explore the antimicrobial effects of CMS
after different preprocessing methods.ResultsPB and CS exhibited
significantly better antimicrobial effectiveness against CRGNB than AK
and CMS in the 0~4°C PF, and the antimicrobial effects on CRGNB
increased with the increasing concentration of drugs. Notably, CMS after
pretreatment (CMS-AP), its antibacterial was significantly enhanced at
4°C.ConclusionsThe PF decontamination is important in preventing the
DRIs caused by CRGNB, and the decontamination regimens based on PB or CS
were confirmed effective. Notably, CMS could even achieve a better
decontamination effect than PB after a simple and fast pretreatment.</p>

of the GI-19 genotype and genomic characterization of the S1 gene in
avian infectious bronchitis virus from 2020 to 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The continuous emergence of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)
variants poses a critical threat to poultry health and productivity in
China. In this study, we conducted comprehensive genetic and antigenic
analyses of IBV strains isolated in our laboratory between 2020 and
2024. A total of 94 IBV isolates were sequenced for the S1 gene,
revealing widespread nucleotide insertions, deletions, and mutations.
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GI-19 was the predominant genotype
(70.21%), followed by GI-13 (21.28%). Recombination analysis using RDP
5.42 identified 14 recombinant strains, primarily GI-13/GI-22 (50%),
GI-19/GI-7 (28.6%), and GI-19/GI-22 (21.4%), which were further
confirmed using Simplot. Glycosylation analysis revealed that all
isolates possessed 14 to18 N-glycosylation sites, whereas only the
SDJN3/23 strain contained an O-glycosylation site (position 416). Novel
cleavage site motifs (HRRKR, HRHRR, RRFRR) were identified in GI-19
strains, diverging from the canonical HRRRR. The evolutionary rate
calculated via BEAST software, was 1.98 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year.
Serum neutralization assays demonstrated that GI-19 recombinants
exhibited partial one-way cross-protection against GI-1, GI-13, and
GI-22 genotypes (titer ≥ 1:32), but reciprocal neutralization was
limited. Overall, we systematically characterized the genetic diversity
and antigenic evolution of the currently circulating IBV strains in
China, emphasizing the critical demand for genotype-specific vaccine
development and dynamic surveillance systems to counteract viral immune
escape.</p>

<p>BackgroundA previous study indicated that poly L-lysine-glycerol
monolaurate mouthwash reduced the virulence of Helicobacter pylori;
however, these compounds are derivatives. Thus, this study aimed to
compare the effects of postbiotics, postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate, and
poly L-lysine-glycerol monolaurate mouthwashes against clinical H.

activity and synergistic effects. Subsequently, mouthwashes containing
postbiotics, postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate, and poly L-Lysine-glycerol
monolaurate were prepared and evaluated for their ability to reduce H.
pylori adhesion to host cells, suppress inflammation induced by H.
pylori, eradicate biofilm, decrease cagA expression, and assess
epithelial cell viability. The stability of the mouthwashes was
evaluated every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks for their efficacy against H.
pylori growth, biofilm eradication, and epithelial cell
viability.ResultsThe postbiotics, L. paracasei SD1 and L. rhamnosus
SD11, demonstrated significant anti-H. pylori activity, with synergistic
effects observed in combinations with derivative compounds.
Postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate mouthwashes exhibited higher efficacy in
reducing H. pylori adhesion to host cells (42.64-43.83%), suppressing
pro-inflammatory cytokines, eradicating biofilm (82.62% at 24 h), and
reducing cagA expression (112.60 fold) compared to others. Such
mouthwashes also displayed low cytotoxicity (&lt; 30% for 15 min) to all
cells tested. The stability was observed up to 24 weeks.ConclusionThis
in vitro study demonstrated that postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate
mouthwash revealed the highest efficacy against H. pylori with low
cytotoxicity to host cells. The stability lasted for 24 weeks.</p>

alleviates septic cardiomyopathy by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the protective role of microRNA-27b (miR-27b)
in septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) and its regulatory mechanism on the
mitochondrial fission factor (Mff)/mitochondrial antiviral signaling
protein (MAVS) axis.MethodsTranscriptome data from septic patients’
cardiac tissues (GSE79962) were analyzed. Serum miR-27b expression was
measured in SCM patients (n=11), sepsis-only patients (n=22), and
healthy controls (n=30). Mouse SCM model and HL-1 cardiomyocyte model
were established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. The molecular
mechanism was investigated using miR-27b agonist/antagonist and Mff
intervention, combined with RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence,
and transmission electron microscopy.ResultsBioinformatics analysis
revealed significant downregulation of miR-27b in SCM cardiac tissues
(log2FC=-3.9, P&lt;0.001). Clinical validation showed lower miR-27b
expression in SCM patients’ serum compared to sepsis-only patients and
healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). LPS-induced SCM model exhibited cardiac
dysfunction, myocardial injury, mitochondrial abnormalities, decreased
miR-27b expression, and increased Mff and MAVS levels. miR-27b targeted
Mff to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, thus attenuating LPS-induced
cardiomyocyte inflammation and apoptosis, while Mff overexpression
reversed this protective effect.ConclusionmiR-27b alleviates myocardial
injury and inflammation in SCM by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis to
maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, representing a potential novel
therapeutic target for SCM.</p>

the potential impact of salidroside on Chikungunya virus-induced acute
interstitial nephritis via network pharmacology, molecular docking and
in vitro experiments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is often linked to acute
interstitial nephritis (AIN) in fatal cases. Given the global spread of
CHIKV and the lack of targeted antiviral treatments, there is an urgent
need for effective therapeutic strategies against CHIKV-induced AIN.
This study explored the therapeutic potential of salidroside (Sal) using
an integrative approach involving network pharmacology, molecular
docking and in vitro validation. Network pharmacology analysis
identified 18 overlapping targets between Sal and AIN, including TNF,
IL6 and AKT1. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities
between Sal and key pathway proteins (Vina scores &lt; –6), notably TNF,
IL6 and BCL2. In vitro assays using CHIKV-infected 293T cells
demonstrated that Sal (7.8125–2000 μM) enhanced cell viability by
8.9–25.9%, with the greatest effect observed at 1000 μM, without
significantly altering viral replication. Mechanism analysis using the
KEGG and FerrDB databases implicated apoptosis and ferroptosis in
CHIKV-induced AIN pathogenesis. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that Sal
significantly downregulated ferroptosis-related genes (IL-6, IL-1β,
SIRT1, PARP1, HMOX1) and apoptosis-associated markers (Bax, TNF-α,
PARP1) in infected cells. Consistent with these findings, molecular
docking demonstrated that Sal binds strongly to the ferroptosis-related
protein GPX4 (Vina score: –6.3) and the apoptosis regulator NFKB1 (Vina
score: –6.0). These results suggest that Sal is a promising therapeutic
candidate for the treatment of CHIKV-induced AIN.</p>

next-generation sequencing-based characterization of the viral spectrum
in clinical pulmonary and peripheral blood samples of patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables
comprehensive profiling of viral communities in clinical samples.
However, comparative analyses of the virome across anatomical
compartments and disease states remain limited. This study aims to
characterize the virome in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
peripheral blood samples from patients with various clinical conditions
using mNGS.MethodsA total of 338 clinical samples—including 240 BALF and
69 blood samples for DNA sequencing, and 18 BALF and 11 blood samples
for RNA sequencing—underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Following
removal of host-derived reads, high-quality non-human sequences were
aligned to a viral reference database. Virome composition was assessed
through alpha and beta diversity metrics. Principal coordinates analysis
was used to evaluate disease-related variation, and virus–bacteria
associations in BALF were investigated via Spearman
correlation.ResultsSequencing yielded an average of 51 million raw reads
per sample, resulting in approximately 8 million non-human reads after
host filtering. Distinct virome profiles were observed between BALF and
blood samples. Bacteriophages dominated all groups, with Siphoviridae
and Myoviridae as the most abundant families, although only 13.6% of
viral abundance could be assigned to known families. Diversity analyses
revealed significant differences between BALF and peripheral blood, and
DNA-sequenced BALF samples showed disease-specific viral signatures in
pulmonary infections. In contrast, tumor presence had no significant
effect on virome composition in either BALF or blood. Network analysis
identified complex virus–bacteria correlations in BALF, with genera such
as Haemophilus, Megasphaera, and Treponema as key bacterial
hosts.ConclusionsThis study reveals pronounced differences in virome
composition between the respiratory and circulatory systems and
highlights the specific influence of pulmonary disease—but not tumors—on
the pulmonary virome. The observed virus–bacteria networks provide novel
insights into pulmonary microbial ecology and underscore the importance
of integrating host and disease context in virome studies.</p>

J-shaped association between the ratio of neutrophil counts to
prognostic nutritional index and mortality in ICU patients with sepsis:
a retrospective study based on the MIMIC database</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe ICU faces persistent challenges with sepsis, marked by
systemic inflammation and metabolic disruptions, often leading to poor
outcomes. Despite advances, reliable biomarkers for predicting sepsis
outcomes are needed. This study introduces a novel indicator combining
neutrophil count and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) to improve
predictive accuracy by addressing both inflammatory and
nutritional-immune aspects.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort
study analyzing data from the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adults
diagnosed with sepsis per Sepsis 3.0 criteria. We excluded those younger
than 18, with ICU stays under 48 hours, multiple ICU admissions, or
incomplete data. Participants’ neutrophil counts/PNI ratios were
calculated and correlated with 30, 60, and 90-day hospital and ICU
mortality, utilising Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional
hazards models, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models and subgroup
analysis.ResultsWe included 2,116 patients from 22,517 eligible cases.
Survival analysis demonstrated lower survival probabilities for higher
neutrophil counts/PNI ratios across all observed time windows. Cox
regression models revealed a significant association between higher
neutrophil counts/PNI ratios and increased short- to medium-term
mortality. The restricted cubic spline regression models illustrated a
J-shaped relationship between neutrophil counts/PNI and
mortality.ConclusionThe neutrophil counts/PNI ratio is a promising
prognostic biomarker for sepsis-related outcomes in ICU settings,
offering improved risk stratification and potentially guiding
therapeutic interventions. Further research is warranted to validate
these findings across diverse populations.</p>

antiviral research</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe large size of coronavirus genome, along with the
instability of certain genomic sequences, makes the construction of
reverse genetics for coronaviruses particularly challenging. The rapid
development and application of reverse genetics systems for
coronaviruses require further exploration.MethodsUsing
transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast and the
in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 system, reverse genetics systems of two mild
coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were rapidly established.
Antiviral assays, high-content imaging, and NanoLuc luciferase assays
were used to characterize reporter viruses and replicon
systems.ResultsWe rapidly assembled infectious clones for two mild
coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, using transformation-associated
recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast. The infected clones could stably
express the mGreenLantern reporter gene. We further generated T7
promoter-driven RNA replicon of HCoV-229E and CMV promoter-driven DNA
replicon of HCoV-OC43, with the readout of NanoLuc luciferase activity.
The effectiveness of these tools for antiviral study was evaluated using
the broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir,
exhibiting high sensitivity, efficiency, and convenience.DiscussionThe
application of yeast-based TAR cloning significantly facilitates the
rapid assembly of large viral genome, and the establishment of HCoV-OC43
and HCoV-229E reverse genetics systems provides valuable platforms for
studying the biology and developing antivirals against
coronaviruses.</p>

and optimization of a novel nanocarrier SabiWhite-loaded ethosomal gel
for targeted skin inflammation complicated by multidrug-resistant
pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThis study aimed to develop and evaluate SabiWhite-loaded
ethosomes (SW-ETH) for topical application, focusing on improving
stability, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy. Ethosomal
formulations are known for their enhanced drug delivery properties,
making them suitable for skin inflammation.MethodsThe SW-ETH
formulations were developed utilizing an adapted cold preparation
technique. A 3² factorial design was used to optimize phospholipid
concentration and ethanol content, and their impact on vesicle size and
entrapment efficiency (EE%) was assessed. Structural characterization of
SabiWhite was performed using melting point determination,
Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray Diffraction
(XRD). In vitro drug release was assessed using a Franz diffusion cell,
and anti-inflammatory and skin irritation studies were performed on
Wistar rats.ResultsSabiWhite exhibited a melting point of 96°C and
characteristic FTIR peaks, confirming its identity and purity. XRD
analysis revealed its crystalline nature, while ethosomal formulations
showed a shift to an amorphous state. The optimized SW-ETH formulation
(SW-ETH 6) had a vesicle size of 184.4 nm, an EE% of 92.5%, and a zeta
potential of -13.50 mV, indicating stable and uniform vesicles. In-vitro
drug release from SW-ETH 6 showed a sustained release profile with
93.12% drug release over 24 hours. In vivo, SW-ETH demonstrated
significant anti-inflammatory effects with 36.17% edema inhibition at
150 minutes, comparable to Diclofenac gel (41.92%). No skin irritation
was observed, and the formulation was classified as non-irritant.
Stability tests confirmed minimal changes in appearance, viscosity, and
drug content over 120 days at different storage
conditions.ConclusionSW-ETH demonstrated effective drug encapsulation,
enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, and excellent biocompatibility,
making it a promising candidate for topical therapy. Further clinical
validation is warranted to confirm its therapeutic potential.</p>

formula from “Tai ping sheng hui fang”: anti-Helicobacter pylori
activity, gut microbiota modulation, and inflammatory response
regulation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (HP) is a major gastric pathogen linked
to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. The emergence
of antibiotic resistance has prompted the search for alternative
treatments. Helile formula, derived from the ancient “Taiping
Shenghuifang,” is known to treat various degrees of diarrhea and has
potential for treating gastrointestinal disorders. However, the
antibacterial efficacy, material basis, and action mechanisms of the
helile formula against HP remain undetermined.MethodsThe chemical
constituents were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The in vitro anti-HP
activity and underlying mechanisms were investigated through a series of
assays, including the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC), N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assay, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) to observe morphological changes, cell viability and
cell adhesion activity assays, assessment of nitric oxide (NO)
production, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) for gene expression analysis. For the in vivo anti-HP
infection study and mechanism exploration, techniques such as
hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining for histological examination,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cytokine and antibody
quantification, 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) sequencing for microbial
community profiling, and metabolomics for global metabolite analysis
were employed.ResultsMultiple constituents of helile formula, namely
ellagic acid, gallic acid, chebulagic acid, chebulic acid, and
corilagin, were identified. In vitro, helile formula increased bacterial
outer-membrane permeability, disrupted HP structure, inhibited
toxin-related genes, and suppressed cell adhesion. In male Kunming mice,
helile formula effectively reversed HP-induced inflammation. It
modulated key metabolites, such as adenine, panaxytriol,
4-hydroxyglutamate semialdehyde, and N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine. It
influenced the gut microbiota, especially families like Muribaculaceae
and Lactobacillaceae. Adenine, in particular, repaired HP-caused damage
to GES1 cells, reduced HP - mediated cell adhesion, and inhibited
HP-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
production.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated the remarkable anti-HP
efficacy of the helile formula in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the
helile formula represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for
the management of HP infections.</p>

metabolic reprogramming modulates cytokine networks in nucleos(t)ide
analogue-treated chronic hepatitis B patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background &amp; aimsHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a
global health challenge. Tryptophan metabolism influences immune
regulation, but its interplay with cytokines during antiviral therapy is
unclear. We investigated associations between tryptophan pathways and
cytokine profiles in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with varying
treatment outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 106 CHB
patients (including 29 functional cure cases) receiving nucleos(t)ide
analogues (NAs) and 29 healthy controls. Plasma levels of 20 tryptophan
metabolites (kynurenine, serotonin, and bacterial pathways) were
quantified by HPLC-MS/MS, and 12 cytokines were measured via flow
cytometry. Multivariate analyses were performed.ResultsFunctional cure
patients showed unique metabolic patterns. Indole-3-carboxaldehyde
(IAld) levels increased progressively from HBsAg positive groups
(HBeAg-: 63.324 nmol/L; HBeAg+: 65.938 nmol/L) to functional cure (91.44
nmol/L) and healthy controls (130.634 nmol/L) (P &lt; 0.01), exhibiting
negative correlations with HBsAg (r = -0.31) and IFN-γ (r = -0.53) but
positive correlation with IL-1β (r = 0.47). Picolinic acid (PA) was
significantly elevated in the functional cure group (P &lt; 0.001),
associated with reduced HBsAg, IL-2 and increased IL-1β, IL-10 levels,
indicating potential antiviral effects. Serotonin (5-HT) levels were
higher in cured patients and correlated with IL-1β and IFN-α (P &lt;
0.05). HBeAg-positive patients displayed increased
kynurenine-to-tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratios (P &lt; 0.05), while non-cured
patients showed metabolic blockade downstream of 3-hydroxykynurenine
(elevated 3-HK/Kyn ratios and reduced KA, XA/3-HK, 3-HAA/3-HK, and NAA
levels; P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsThe tryptophan metabolites (IAld, PA,
5-HT) were found to correlate with cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-10),
potentially implicating their involvement in immune regulation and
antiviral responses. These observations delineate a metabolic-immune
framework that may inform future therapeutic development for HBV.</p>
