USP15 expression inhibits HIV-1 transcription involving changes in YY1
deubiquitination and stability</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionProtein homeostasis is maintained by the opposing action
of ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase, two important components of the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and contributes to both normal
physiological and pathophysiological processes. The current study aims
to delineate the roles of ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), a
member of the largest deubiquitinase family, in HIV-1 gene expression
and replication.MethodsWe took advantage of highly selective and
specific ubiquitin variants (UbV), which were recently designed and
developed for USP15, and ascertained the inhibitory effects of USP15 on
HIV-1 gene expression and production by transfection and Western
blotting. We also used real-time RT-PCR, transcription factor profiling,
subcellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation followed by Western
blotting to determine the transcription factors involved and the
underlying molecular mechanisms.ResultsWe first confirmed the
specificity of USP15-mediated HIV-1 gene expression and virus
production. We then showed that the inhibition of HIV-1 production by
USP15 occurred at the transcription level, associated with an increased
protein level of YY1, a known HIV-1 transcription repressor. Moreover,
we demonstrated that USP15 regulated YY1 deubiquitination and stability.
Lastly, we demonstrated that YY1 siRNA knockdown significantly
diminished the inhibition of USP15 on HIV-1 gene expression and virus
production.ConclusionThese findings together demonstrate that
stabilization of YY1 protein by USP15 deubiquitinating activity
contributes to USP15-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription and may
help the development of USP15-specific UbV inhibitors as an anti-HIV
strategy.</p>

of recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow assay to
pathogen point-of-care diagnosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, point-of-care diagnostics
based on nucleic acid testing have become a requirement for the
development of pathogen diagnostics, which require the ability to
accurately, rapidly, and conveniently detect pathogens. Conventional
nucleic acid amplification techniques no longer meet the requirements
for pathogen detection in low-resource, low-skill environments because
they require specialist equipment, complex operations, and long
detection times. Therefore, recombinant polymerase amplification (RPA)
is becoming an increasingly important method in today’s nucleic acid
detection technology because it can amplify nucleic acids in 20–30
minutes at a constant temperature, greatly reducing the dependence on
specialist equipment and technicians. RPA products are primarily
detected through methods such as real-time fluorescence, gel
electrophoresis, lateral flow assays (LFAs), and other techniques. Among
these, LFAs allow for the rapid detection of amplification products
within minutes through the visualization of results, offering convenient
operation and low cost. Therefore, the combination of RPA with LFA
technology has significant advantages and holds broad application
prospects in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, particularly in
low-resource settings. Here, we focus on the principles of RPA combined
with LFAs, their application to pathogen diagnosis, their main
advantages and limitations, and some improvements in the methods.</p>

treasured giants: a current overview on agricultural, nutritional,
bioactive, and economic potential of Macrocybe Species (Agaricales,
Basidiomycota)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Macrocybe is a well-studied genus in the family Callistosporiaceae
(Basidiomycota). Currently, the genus comprises eight species with
worldwide distribution. All species in this genus are relatively large
compared to other edible mushrooms and are commonly consumed by locals.
Cultivation methodologies have been developed for several species of the
genus, including M. gigantea, M. crassa, M. titans, and M. lobayensis.
These mushrooms can be cultivated in lignocellulosic wastes such as
sawdust, straw, and other agro-industrial wastes. The nutritional
compositions have been identified for M. gigantea, M. crassa, and M.
lobayensis, revealing that they are rich in fibers, proteins, and
various vitamins. Although these mushrooms are of culinary significance,
precautions should be taken when consuming them due to their potential
cyanic toxicity. In addition to being rich in different nutrients,
Macrocybe species possess medicinal properties such as antimicrobial,
antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anticancer, anti-inflammatory,
hepatoprotective, and several other beneficial effects. Several species
are commercially available in countries like China and Thailand, and the
commercial potential is high due to the large size, taste, and long
shelf life of these mushrooms. There is significant potential for
cultivating species of this genus and introducing their artificial
cultivation practices to various counties worldwide. Diverse value-added
products can also be produced using Macrocybe species.</p>

activated by transcription factor GATA2 promotes cell growth in
hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundElevated evidence suggests that KIF20A plays an important
role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Nevertheless, the
underlying mechanism by which KIF20A promotes HCC cell growth are not
well understood.MethodsUsing TCGA-LIHC RNAseq and GEO datasets, we
assessed the KIF20A expression and patient survival in HCC and hepatitis
B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Mutant and CNV analysis were performed to
evaluate the genetic alteration of KIF20A in HCC. PPI network and GSEA
enrichment was utilized for analyzing the KIF20A-related genes and
involved pathways in HCC. To further explore regulatory mechanism in
HBV-related HCC, PROMO prediction and luciferase reporter system was
utilized for verifying HBx/GATA2/KIF20A binding sites. CCK-8 and flow
cytometry were carried out to determine the regulation of GATA2-KIF20A
on HBV-related HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis.ResultsKIF20A was
significantly upregulated in pan-cancer (including HCC). KIF20A mRNA
level was a significant independent predictor of overall survival in
HBV-related HCC patients. Genetic alterations analysis revealed the copy
number gain and amplification triggered KIF20A upregulation in HCC. In
addition, the genes associated with KIF20A expression in HCC was
enriched in PLK1 pathway and cell cycle in HCC. HBx might indirectly
binds to KIF20A promoter via regulating GATA2. Additionally,
transcription factor GATA2 directly binds to the promoter region of
KIF20A. Overexpression of GATA2 promotes HepG2.2.15 cell growth and
inhibits cell apoptosis via modulating KIF20A.ConclusionsOur findings
demonstrated that HBx contributed to cell proliferation by interacting
with GATA2 and KIF20A in HBV-related HCC.</p>

without borders: microbiome of immature neotropical tick species
parasitizing migratory songbirds along northern Gulf of Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe long-distance, seasonal migrations of birds make them
an effective ecological bridge for the movement of ticks. The
introduction of exotic tick species to new geographical regions can
cause the emergence of novel tick-borne pathogens. This study examined
the prevalence of exotic tick species parasitizing migratory songbirds
at stopover sites along the northern Gulf of Mexico using the
mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene.MethodsOverall, 421 individual ticks in the
genera Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes were recorded from 28
songbird species, of which Amblyomma and Amblyomma longirostre were the
most abundant tick genera and species, respectively. A high throughput
16S ribosomal RNA sequencing approach characterized the microbial
communities and identified pathogenic microbes in all tick
samples.Results and discussionMicrobial profiles showed that
Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The most abundant pathogens
were Rickettsia and endosymbiont Francisella, Candidatus Midichloria,
and Spiroplasma. Permutation multivariate analysis of variance revealed
that the relative abundance of Francisella and Rickettsia drives
microbial patterns across the tick genera. We also noted a higher
percentage of positive correlations in microbe-microbe interactions
among members of the microbial communities. Network analysis suggested a
negative correlation between a) Francisella and Rickettsia and, b)
Francisella and Cutibacterium. Lastly, mapping the distributions of bird
species parasitized during spring migrations highlighted geographic
hotspots where migratory songbirds could disperse ticks and their
pathogens at stopover sites or upon arrival to their breeding grounds,
the latter showing mean dispersal distances from 421–5003 kilometers.
These findings spotlight the potential role of migratory birds in the
epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.</p>

and application of a quadruplex TaqMan fluorescence quantitative PCR
typing method for Streptococcus suis generalis, type 2, type 7 and type
9</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionStreptococcus suis (SS) is one of the most important
pathogens causing major economic losses in the global pig farming
industry and is a serious threat to public health safety. It has
multiple serotypes, with poor cross-protection between serotypes, and
effective typing methods are lacking.MethodsIn this study, a quadruplex
TaqMan fluorescence quantitative PCR assay that can differentiate
between Streptococcus suis types 2, 7 and 9 was developed using the gdh
gene, a generic gene for Streptococcus suis, and cps2J, cps7H and cps9J,
genes encoding podocarp-associated genes for types 2, 7 and 9,
respectively, as targets.ResultsThe method is specific enough to
accurately type Streptococcus suis pigmentosus without detecting
non-target pathogens (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida,
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus
pneumoniae and et al). The sensitivity was high, with a minimum lower
detection line of 10 copies for P-SS and P-SS9, and 100 copies for P-SS2
and P-SS7. The standard curves generated showed good linearity with R2
of 0.999, 0.999, 0.997 and 0.998 respectively. The repeatability was
good, with coefficients of variation between batch to batch and batch to
batch tests ranging from 0.21% to 1.10%. Testing of 156 samples yielded
68 positive and 88 negative samples, of which the positive rate of SS
was 5.77% (9/156), SS2 was 20.51% (32/156), SS7 was 8.33% (13/156) and
SS9 was 9.6% (15/156), which was in line with the existing fluorescent
quantitative PCR assay of 93.75%~100%, which was higher than the
detection rate of conventional PCR.DiscussionThe quadruplex TaqMan
fluorescence quantitative PCR method of Streptococcus suis generic, type
2, 7 and 9 established in this study can accurately differentiate the
three serotypes of Streptococcus suis that currently have high
prevalence and pathogenicity, which is of great importance for accurate
clinical prevention and treatment, epidemiological investigation and
vaccine development.</p>
