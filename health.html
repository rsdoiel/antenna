on the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance among the
non-carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIn Malaysia, an increase in non-carbapenemase-producing
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (NC-CRKP) has been observed
over the years. Previously, four NC-CRKP with increased susceptibility
to ciprofloxacin in the presence of phenylalanine-arginine
β-naphthylamide (PAβN) were identified. However, no contribution of the
PAβN-inhibited efflux pump to carbapenem resistance was observed. All
four NC-CRKP harboured non-carbapenemase β-lactamase, with two also
exhibiting porin loss. In this study, we further investigated the
genomic features and resistance mechanisms of these four
isolates.MethodsAll four NC-CRKP were subjected to whole-genome
sequencing, followed by comparative genomic and phylogenetic
analyses.ResultsMulti-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis divided the
four NC-CRKP into different sequence types: ST392, ST45, ST14, and
ST5947. Neither major nor rare carbapenemase genes were detected. Given
the presence of non-carbapenemase β-lactamase in all isolates, we
further investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance by
identifying related chromosomal mutations. Deletion mutation was
detected in the cation efflux system protein CusF. Insertion mutation
was identified in the nickel/cobalt efflux protein RcnA. Missense
mutation of ompK36 porin was detected in two isolates, while the loss of
ompK36 porin was observed in another two isolates.ConclusionsThis study
revealed that NC-CRKP may confer carbapenem resistance through a
combination of non-carbapenemase β-lactamase and potential chromosomal
mutations including missense mutation or loss of ompK36 porin and/or a
frameshift missense mutation in efflux pump systems, such as cation
efflux system protein CusF and nickel/cobalt efflux protein RcnA. Our
findings highlighted the significance of implementing whole-genome
sequencing into clinical practice to promote the surveillance of
carbapenem resistance mechanisms among NC-CRKP.</p>

id="precise-location-of-three-novel-linear-epitopes-using-the-generated-monoclonal-antibodies-against-the-knob-domain-of-fadv-4-surface-structural-protein-fiber1">Precise
location of three novel linear epitopes using the generated monoclonal
antibodies against the Knob domain of FAdV-4 surface structural protein,
fiber1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundFowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the main pathogen of
hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), which brings huge economic
losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Fiber-1 protein plays an
important role in viral infection and pathogenesis by binding directly
to cellular receptors of FAdV-4. In particular, the knob domain of
fiber-1 protein has been reported to induce the production of
neutralizing antibodies and arouse protection against the lethal
challenge of chickens with FAdV-4.MethodsThe fiber-1 knob (F1K) protein
was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and purified using
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
FAdV-4 were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with the purified F1K
protein and screened using a series of immunoassays. Potential B cell
epitopes on the knob domain of fiber-1 protein were mapped using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dot-blot. Precious
location and crucial amino acids of the identified epitopes were
determined using peptide array scanning, truncations and
alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The epitopes were analyzed and visualized
on the knob trimer of FAdV-4 fiber-1 protein using the PyMOL
software.ResultsWater-soluble recombinant fiber-1 knob (F1K) protein was
obtained with the assistance of chaperone. Four monoclonal antibodies
(5C10, 6F8, 8D8, and 8E8) against FAdV-4 were generated and
characterized using indirect ELISA, Western blot, dot-blot, and
immunological fluorescence assay (IFA). The mAbs were demonstrated to be
from different hybridoma cell lines based on the sequences of the
variable regions. Meanwhile, three distinct novel linear B-cell epitopes
(319SDVGYLGLPPH329, 328PHTRDNWYV336, and 407VTTGPIPFSYQ417) on the knob
domain of fiber-1 protein were identified and the key amino acid
residues in the epitopes were determined. Structural analysis showed
that the two adjacent epitopes 319SDVGYLGLPPH329 and 328PHTRDNWYV336
were exposed on the surface of the fiber-1 knob trimer, whereas the
epitope 407VTTGPIPFSYQ417 was located inside of the spatial
structure.ConclusionThis was the first identification of B-cell epitopes
on the knob domain of fiber-1 protein and these findings provided a
sound basis for the development of subunit vaccines, therapeutics, and
diagnostic methods to control FAdV infections.</p>

in the management of radiation-induced oral mucositis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Oral mucositis is a common and debilitating oral complication in head
and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, resulting in
diminished quality of life and potential treatment disruptions. Oral
microbiota has long been recognized as a contributing factor in the
initiation and progression of radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM).
Numerous studies have indicated that the radiation-induced oral
microbial dysbiosis promotes the occurrence and severity of oral
mucositis. Therefore, approaches that modulate oral microbial ecology
are promising for the management of RIOM. Probiotics as a relatively
predicable and safe measure that modulates microecology have garnered
significant interest. In this review, we discussed the correlation
between RIOM and oral microbiota, with a particular focus on the
efficacy of probiotics in the control of RIOM, in order to provide novel
paradigm for the management of this disease.</p>

id="emerging-fatal-gout-disease-in-chinese-goslings-linked-to-acute-kidney-injury-induced-by-novel-goose-astrovirus-infection">Emerging
fatal gout disease in Chinese goslings linked to acute kidney injury
induced by novel goose astrovirus infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>A novel goose astrovirus (GAstV) has broken out across China in
recent years, causing widespread damage to the poultry industry. In
goslings infected with GAstV, the leading cause of death is visceral
gout. However, our understanding of the mechanism of gout formation in
GAstV infection is largely inadequate. The aim of this study was to
examine the pathogenicity of a GAstV strain and explore the molecular
mechanisms of visceral gout caused by viral infection in goslings. The
virulent GAstV strain HR2105/1 was effectively isolated from the
visceral tissue of goslings in gout-affected areas. The whole genome of
the HR2105/1 strain was sequenced and analyzed. Subsequently, we
established a gosling gout models with experimental GAstV infection.
Finally, we conducted a study on the mechanism of GAstV induced acute
kidney injury. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequence
showed that it was closely related to the strain circulating in China
since 2016, and it was grouped within the GAstV-1 cluster. The clinical
signs were reproduced by experimental infection of healthy goslings with
the isolated strain and were found to be similar to those reported in
clinical cases. Moreover, the virus exhibits strong renal tropism.
Infection with the GAstV strain HR2105/1 was found to cause acute kidney
injury, as evidenced by increased levels of uric acid and creatinine as
well as severe pathological damage. Mechanistic experiments with Masson
and Picrosirius Red staining revealed fibrosis in renal tissues after
GAstV infection. Furthermore, TUNEL staining revealed that GAstV
infection triggered renal cell apoptosis. Additionally, RT-qPCR revealed
that GAstV infection caused an excessive inflammatory response by
upregulating the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, and iNOS in
renal tissues. Overall, our findings demonstrate that GAstV infection
causes renal damage by inducing renal cell apoptosis, fibrosis, and
excessive inflammatory response, which subsequently leads to
hyperuricemia and lethal visceral gout formation. This is the first
systematic study on the etiology of lethal gout in goslings caused by
GAstV infection, and we believe that the findings can guide vaccine
development and therapeutic targets for GAstV-associated renal
diseases.</p>

id="snx27retromerescpe-1-mediated-early-endosomal-tubulation-impacts-cytomegalovirus-replication">SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1-mediated
early endosomal tubulation impacts cytomegalovirus replication</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCytomegaloviruses (CMVs) extensively reorganize the
membrane system of the cell and establish a new structure as large as
the cell nucleus called the assembly compartment (AC). Our previous
studies on murine CMV (MCMV)-infected fibroblasts indicated that the
inner part of the AC contains rearranged early endosomes, recycling
endosomes, endosomal recycling compartments and trans-Golgi membrane
structures that are extensively tubulated, including the expansion and
retention of tubular Rab10 elements. An essential process that initiates
Rab10-associated tubulation is cargo sorting and retrieval mediated by
SNX27, Retromer, and ESCPE-1 (endosomal SNX-BAR sorting complex for
promoting exit 1) complexes.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to
investigate the role of SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1 complexes in the
biogenesis of pre-AC in MCMV-infected cells and subsequently their role
in secondary envelopment and release of infectious virions.ResultsHere
we show that SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE1-mediated tubulation is essential for
the establishment of a Rab10-decorated subset of membranes within the
pre-AC, a function that requires an intact F3 subdomain of the SNX27
FERM domain. Suppression of SNX27-mediated functions resulted in an
almost tenfold decrease in the release of infectious virions. However,
these effects cannot be directly linked to the contribution of
SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1-dependent tubulation to the secondary
envelopment, as suppression of these components, including the F3-FERM
domain, led to a decrease in MCMV protein expression and inhibited the
progression of the replication cycle.ConclusionThis study demonstrates a
novel and important function of membrane tubulation within the pre-AC
associated with the control of viral protein expression.</p>

advancement of novel marine fungi derived secondary metabolite
fibrinolytic compound FGFC in biomedical applications: a review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>For several decades, products derived from marine natural sources
(PMN) have been widely identified for several therapeutic applications
due to their rich sources of bioactive sub-stances, unique chemical
diversity, biocompatibility and excellent biological activity. For the
past 15 years, our research team explored several PMNs, especially fungi
fibrinolytic compounds (FGFCs). FGFC is an isoindolone alkaloid derived
from marine fungi, also known as staplabin analogs or Stachybotrys
microspora triprenyl phenol (SMTP). For instance, our previous studies
explored different types of FGFCs such as FGFC 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the
marine fungi Stachybotrys longispora FG216 derived metabolites. The
derivatives of FGFC are potentially employed in several disease
treatments, mainly for stroke, cancer, ischemia, acute kidney injury,
inflammation, cerebral infarction, thrombolysis and hemorrhagic
activities, etc. Due to the increasing use of FGFCs in pharmaceutical
and biomedical applications, it is important to understand the
fundamental signaling concept of FGFCs. Hence, for the first time, this
review collectively summarizes the background, types, mode of action and
biological applications of FGFCs and their current endeavors for future
therapies.</p>

the association between East Asian oral microbiome and colorectal cancer
through Mendelian randomization and multi-omics analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) poses a global health threat, with
the oral microbiome increasingly implicated in its pathogenesis. This
study leverages Mendelian Randomization (MR) to explore causal links
between oral microbiota and CRC using data from the China National
GeneBank and Biobank Japan. By integrating multi-omics approaches, we
aim to uncover mechanisms by which the microbiome influences cellular
metabolism and cancer development.MethodsWe analyzed microbiome profiles
from 2017 tongue and 1915 saliva samples, and GWAS data for 6692 CRC
cases and 27178 controls. Significant bacterial taxa were identified via
MR analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and enrichment analyses
elucidated underlying pathways, and drug predictions identified
potential therapeutics.ResultsMR identified 19 bacterial taxa
significantly associated with CRC. Protective effects were observed in
taxa like RUG343 and Streptococcus_umgs_2425, while HOT-345_umgs_976 and
W5053_sp000467935_mgs_712 increased CRC risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing
revealed key pathways, including JAK-STAT signaling and tyrosine
metabolism. Drug prediction highlighted potential therapeutics like
Menadione Sodium Bisulfite and Raloxifene.ConclusionThis study
establishes the critical role of the oral microbiome in colorectal
cancer development, identifying specific microbial taxa linked to CRC
risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing and drug prediction analyses further
elucidate key pathways and potential therapeutics, providing novel
insights and personalized treatment strategies for CRC.</p>

id="rfah-contributes-to-maximal-colonization-and-full-virulence-of-hypervirulent-klebsiella-pneumoniae">RfaH
contributes to maximal colonization and full virulence of hypervirulent
Klebsiella pneumoniae</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) have emerged as clinically
important pathogens, posing a serious threat to human health. RfaH, a
transcriptional elongation factor, has been regarded as implicated in
facilitating the transcription of long virulence operons in certain
bacterial species. In K. pneumoniae, RfaH plays a vital role in
promoting CPS synthesis and hypermucoviscosity, as well as mediating
bacterial fitness during lung infection. In this study, we aim to
conduct a systematic investigation of the roles of rfaH in the survival,
dissemination, and colonization of hvKp through in vitro and in vivo
assays. We found that bacterial cells and colonies displayed capsule
-deficient phenotypes subsequent to the deletion of rfaH in K.
pneumoniae NTUH-K2044. We confirmed that rfaH is required for the
synthesis of capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by positively
regulating the expression of CPS and LPS gene clusters. We found that
the ΔrfaH mutant led to a significantly decreased mortality of K.
pneumoniae in a mouse intraperitoneal infection model. We further
demonstrated that the absence of rfaH was associated with slower
bacterial growth under conditions of low nutrition or iron limitation.
ΔrfaH displayed reduced survival rates in the presence of human serum.
Besides, the engulfment of the ΔrfaH mutant was significantly higher
than that of NTUH-K2044 by macrophages in vivo, indicating an
indispensable role of RfaH in the phagocytosis resistance of hvKp in
mice. Both mouse intranasal and intraperitoneal infection models
revealed a higher bacterial clearance rate of ΔrfaH in lungs, livers,
and spleens of mice compared to its wild type, suggesting an important
role of RfaH in the bacterial survival, dissemination, and colonization
of hvKp in vivo. Histopathological results supported that RfaH
contributes to the pathogenicity of hvKp in mice. In conclusion, our
study demonstrates crucial roles of RfaH in the survival, colonization
and full virulence of hvKp, which provides several implications for the
development of RfaH as an antibacterial target.</p>

id="gut-microbiota-and-metabolomic-profile-changes-play-critical-roles-in-tacrolimus-induced-diabetes-in-rats">Gut
microbiota and metabolomic profile changes play critical roles in
tacrolimus-induced diabetes in rats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>AimsHyperglycemia is one of the adverse effects of tacrolimus (TAC),
but the underlying mechanism is not fully identified. We used
multi-omics analysis to evaluate the changes in the gut microbiota and
metabolic profile of rats with TAC-induced diabetes.MethodsTo establish
a diabetic animal model, Sprague Dawley rats were divided randomly into
two groups. Those in the TAC group received intraperitoneal injections
of TAC (3 mg/kg) for 8 weeks, and those in the CON group served as the
control. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze fecal microbiota. The
metabolites of the two groups were detected and analyzed by nontargeted
and targeted metabolomics, including amino acids (AAs), bile acids
(BAs), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).ResultsThe rats treated with
TAC exhibited hyperglycemia as well as changes in the gut microbiota and
metabolites. Specifically, their gut microbiota had significantly higher
abundances of Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, and Allobaculum, and
significantly lower abundances of Ruminococcus, Akkermansia, and
Roseburia. In addition, they had significantly reduced serum levels of
AAs including asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and methionine.
With respect to BAs, they had significantly higher serum levels of
taurocholic acid (TCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), but
significantly lower levels of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and
tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). There were no differences in the
levels of SCFAs between the two groups. Correlations existed among
glucose metabolism indexes (fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin),
gut microbiota (Ruminococcus and Akkermansia), and metabolites (glutamic
acid, hydroxyproline, GCDCA, TDCA, and TUDCA).ConclusionsBoth AAs and
BAs may play crucial roles as signaling molecules in the regulation of
TAC-induced diabetes.</p>

and fecal microbiota reveals microbial markers associated with gastric
carcinogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe relationship between dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal
microbiota and gastric cancer (GC) has been extensively studied.
However, microbiota alterations in GC patients vary widely across
studies, and reproducible diagnostic biomarkers for early GC are still
lacking in multiple populations. Thus, this study aimed to characterize
the gastrointestinal microbial communities involved in gastric
carcinogenesis through a meta-analysis of multiple published and open
datasets.MethodsWe analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data from 1,642 gastric
biopsy samples and 394 stool samples across 11 independent studies.
VSEARCH, QIIME and R packages such as vegan, phyloseq, cooccur, and
random forest were used for data processing and analysis. PICRUSt
software was employed to predict functions.ResultsThe α-diversity
results indicated significant differences in the intratumoral microbiota
of cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients, while no significant
differences were observed in the fecal microbiota. Network analysis
showed that the positive correlation with GC-enriched bacteria
increased, and the positive correlation with GC-depleted bacteria
decreased compared to healthy individuals. Functional analyses indicated
that pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were significantly
enriched in GC, while biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was
diminished. Additionally, we investigated non-Helicobacter pylori (HP)
commensals, which are crucial in both HP-negative and HP-positive GC.
Random forest models, constructed using specific taxa associated with GC
identified from the LEfSe analysis, revealed that the combination of
Lactobacillus and Streptococcus included alone could effectively
discriminate between GC patients and healthy individuals in fecal
samples (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.7949). This finding was also
validated in an independent cohort (AUC = 0.7712).ConclusionsThis study
examined the intratumoral and fecal microbiota of GC patients from a
dual microecological perspective and identified Lactobacillus,
Streptococcus, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium as
intratumoral and intestinal-specific co-differential bacteria.
Furthermore, it confirmed the validity of the combination of
Lactobacillus and Streptococcus as GC-specific microbial markers across
multiple populations, which may aid in the early non-invasive diagnosis
of GC.</p>
