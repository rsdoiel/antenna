vascular endothelial cell responses to Angiostrongylus vasorum: a
comparative in vitro study in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and domestic
dogs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCanine angiostrongylosis, caused by Angiostrongylus
vasorum, affects dogs and red foxes, with dogs developing
cardiopulmonary and coagulation disorders, while foxes remain mostly
subclinical.MethodsThis study examined aortic endothelial cell responses
from both species to A. vasorum adult full somatic antigen extracts,
first-stage larval (L1) antigen, and adult excretory-secretory products
(ESP). Differential gene expression of interleukins (IL) -6, -10, and
-33, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion
molecule 1 (VCAM-1), endothelial selectin (E-selectin), platelet
selectin (P-selectin), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) was assessed via reverse
transcription quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) after four and 24 hours of
antigen exposure.ResultsFour hours post ESP stimulation, IL-10 increased
in dogs (1.8-fold) but decreased in foxes (0.4-fold). IL-33 declined in
both, (0.9-fold vs. 0.7-fold, respectively). VCAM-1 was upregulated more
in foxes (3.5-fold vs. 1.2 in dogs). Following adult antigen exposure,
P-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 increased in fox more than in dog cells
(1.4, 1.7, and 3.1-fold vs. 0.9, 0.5, and 0.7-fold, respectively). L1
antigen downregulated IL-10 and MCP-1 in dogs (0.7 and 0.8-fold) but
upregulated them in foxes (2.1 and 1.1-fold). Twenty-four hours after
ESP stimulation, ICAM-1 decreased in dogs (0.8-fold) but increased in
foxes (1.4-fold). VCAM-1 was downregulated in dogs (0.6-fold) but
upregulated in foxes (12.9-fold). Adult antigen exposure upregulated
P-selectin in both species, more in foxes (4.8-fold) than in dogs
(1.9-fold). ICAM-1 was downregulated in dogs (0.8-fold) but upregulated
7.5-fold in foxes. L1 antigen stimulation caused the most substantial
differences between species: IL-6 was upregulated more in dogs
(4.7-fold) than foxes (1.2-fold). E-Selectin was upregulated in dogs
(12.8-fold) but downregulated in foxes (0.2-fold). P-selectin increased
more in dogs (10.0-fold) than in foxes (1.7-fold). ICAM-1 was
downregulated in dogs (0.6-fold) but upregulated in foxes (2.6-fold), as
was VCAM-1 (0.7-fold and 3.1-fold). VEGF was upregulated 9.5-fold in
dogs after adult antigen exposure, and 7.6-fold after L1 antigen
exposure, while it remained rather unchanged in foxes (0.9-fold and
1.0-fold, respectively).DiscussionThese findings corroborate that foxes
have developed mechanisms for a regulated immune response following A.
vasorum exposure, while dogs exhibit a higher pro-inflammatory reaction,
contributing to severe clinical outcomes. Host-parasite co-evolution may
explain differences in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of
canid angiostrongylosis.</p>

flora metabolites indole-3-butyric acid and disodium succinate promote
IncI2 mcr-1-carrying plasmid transfer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPlasmid-driven horizontal transfer of resistance genes in
bacterial communities is a major factor in the spread of resistance
worldwide. The gut microbiome, teeming with billions of microorganisms,
serves as a reservoir for resistance genes. The metabolites of gut
microorganisms strongly influence the physiology of their microbial
community, but the role of the metabolites in the transfer of resistance
genes remains unclear.MethodsA dual-fluorescence conjugation model was
established. We assessed the effects of different concentrations of
indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and disodium succinate (DS) on plasmid
transfer using conjugation assays. The growth of bacteria (donors,
recipients, and transconjugants), the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
levels and membrane permeability were measured under IBA and DS
exposure. The plasmid copy number, and transcriptional levels of
conjugation-related genes (including the related genes of the regulation
of ROS production, the SOS response, cell membrane permeability, pilus
generation, ATP synthesis, and the type IV secretion system (T4SS) )
were evaluated by qPCR.ResultsIn this study, we demonstrated that IBA
and DS at low concentrations, which can also be ingested through diet,
enhance the interspecies transfer ratio of IncI2 mcr-1-carrying plasmid
in Escherichia coli. At 20 mg/L, the transfer ratios in the presence of
IBA or DS increased by 2.5- and 2.7-fold compared to that of the
control, respectively. Exposure to this concentration of IBA or DS
increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the SOS
response, cell membrane permeability, and plasmid copy number. The
transcription of genes of the related pathways and of pilus, ATP, and
the T4SS was upregulated. DiscussionOur findings revealed that low-dose
gut microbiota metabolites—particularly those with dietary
origins—promote plasmid-mediated resistance gene dissemination through
multifaceted mechanisms involving oxidative stress, SOS activation, and
conjugation machinery enhancement. This highlights potential public
health risks associated with microbiota metabolites, especially those
utilized in food production.</p>

and gastric cancer: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutic
strategies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Gastric cancer, a prevalent malignancy globally, is influenced by
various factors. The imbalance in the gut microbiome and the existence
of particular intratumoural microbiota could have a strong connection
with the onset and progression of gastric cancer. High-throughput
sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis have revealed a close
correlation between abnormal abundance of specific microbial communities
and the risk of gastric cancer. These microbial communities contribute
to gastric cancer progression through mechanisms including increasing
cellular genomic damage, inhibiting DNA repair, activating abnormal
signaling pathways, exacerbating tumor hypoxia, and shaping a tumor
immune-suppressive microenvironment. This significantly impacts the
efficacy of gastric cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. Probiotic, prebiotic, antibiotic, carrier-based, dietary
interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, and traditional Chinese
medicine show potential applications in gastric cancer treatment.
However, the molecular mechanisms regarding dysbiosis of microbiota,
including gut microbiota, and intra-tumoral microbiota during the
progression of gastric cancer, as well as the therapeutic efficacy of
microbiota-related applications, still require extensive exploration
through experiments.</p>

detection and antibiotic use in granulomatous lobular mastitis: a
comparison of mNGS and culture</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical microbial profile
of patients with granulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM) and compare
various detection methods to identify the most effective approach for
pathogen detection, which could help enhance clinical diagnosis and
treatment.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed data from 84 patients
diagnosed with GLM, assessed the composition of pathogenic
microorganisms in these patients, and compared the effectiveness of
different sampling methods and detection
techniques.ResultsCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii (C. kroppenstedtii) was
identified as the predominant microorganism among GLM patients. The
positivity rate was low in skin swabs (10%) but similar in pus (40%) and
tissue samples (37%). After antibiotic treatment, the pathogen detection
rate of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) (54.55%) was found
to be higher than that of culture-based methods (27.27%). Among the GLM
cases with pathogenic infection, although mNGS demonstrated higher
sensitivity (75.0%) than culture tests (50.0%), both methods exhibited
100.0% specificity. However, the time for obtaining results with mNGS
was significantly shorter (1.2 ± 0.41 days) compared to bacterial
culture (5.5 ± 0.64 days) (P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsOur findings indicate
that pus was the most suitable sample type for microbial evidence
collection in patients with GLM. mNGS demonstrated superior performance
compared to culture in distinguishing infectious from non-infectious
cases, with reduced antibiotic interference, faster turnaround time, and
higher accuracy. Based on our single-center experience, empirical
cephalosporin treatment may be appropriate for these patients.
Additionally, surgical intervention remains the most efficient approach
for rapid and complete resolution.</p>

efficacy and safety of letermovir versus ganciclovir prophylaxis in
adolescent patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation: a single center observational study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesTo compare the efficacy and safety of letermovir and
ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in adolescent patients
(aged 14-17 years) undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (allo-HSCT).MethodsThis observational and single-center
study collected data from February 2023 and April 2024.ResultsThe
cumulative incidence of CMV DNAemia following HSCT was 44.4% in the
letermovir group (n=20) and 66.3% in the control group (n=32) receiving
ganciclovir. Notably, the cumulative incidence of clinically significant
CMV infection (csCMVi) was significantly reduced in the letermovir group
compared with control patients (11.0% vs 41.3%, p=0.021). Among patients
diagnosed with grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), a
significantly lower proportion of individuals in the letermovir group
presented CMV DNAemia than in the control group (20.0% vs 73.3%,
p=0.013). The common adverse events observed in the letermovir group
were aGVHD (60.0%), diarrhea (25.0%), and nausea (15.0%). Leukopenia was
reported in only one patient, and did not necessitate an adjustment of
letermovir dosage.ConclusionsIn this single-center real-world study,
letermovir exhibited a favourable efficacy and safety profile for CMV
prophylaxis in adolescent patients undergoing HSCT. However, further
prospective multi-center studies are warranted to validate our
conclusion in adolescent patients.</p>

of S100A8/A9 and resistin as predictive biomarkers for mortality in
critically ill patients with sepsis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSepsis is associated with high mortality. Early
intervention is crucial to reducing sepsis-related mortality. This study
aims to assess the clinical potential of S100A8/A9 and resistin as novel
biomarkers for predicting mortality risk in sepsis patients.MethodSerum
samples were collected and analyzed from 141 adult sepsis patients
(discovery cohort), 43 non-sepsis intensive care units (ICU) patients,
15 healthy volunteers, and 55 sepsis patients along with 17 non-sepsis
ICU patients (validation cohort). The 28-day mortality and sequential
organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores of the participants were
compared. Additionally, the predictive ability of S100A8/A9 and resistin
for sepsis mortality was evaluated using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve at ICU admission.ResultsThe
concentrations of S100A8/A9 and resistin in sepsis patients were
noticeably increased relative to non-sepsis patients and healthy
controls. Serum S100A8/A9 concentrations in surviving sepsis patients
were significantly higher than in non-surviving patients. On the day of
admission, serum resistin concentrations in Gram-negative (G-) sepsis
patients were considerably elevated relative to Gram-positive (G+)
infected sepsis patients. Among sepsis patients admitted to the ICU, the
AUC for S100A8/A9 in predicting 28-day mortality was 0.617 (P = 0.032;
95% confidence bounds 0.513–0.721), and for SOFA was 0.750 (P &lt;
0.0001; 95% confidence bounds 0.660–0.840). Sepsis patients with high
serum S100A8/A9 concentrations (≥ 377.53 ng/mL) had a higher survival
rate relative to those with low concentrations (&lt;377.53 ng/mL). In
the validation cohort, the AUC for S100A8/A9 and 28-day mortality was
0.708 (P = 0.032; 95% confidence bounds 0.563–0.854), and for SOFA was
0.698 (P = 0.025; 95% confidence bounds 0.550–0.845). Additionally,
sepsis patients with high serum S100A8/A9 concentrations (≥ 377.53
ng/mL) also had a higher survival rate relative to those with lower
concentrations (&lt; 377.53 ng/mL). Furthermore, serum resistin levels
in patients with a normal phenotype and mixed phenotype with
hyperinflammation were predictive of mortality, with an AUC of 0.810 (P
= 0.034; 95% confidence bounds 0.605–1.00) and 0.708 (P = 0.015; 95%
confidence bounds 0.571–0.846). In patients with a normal sepsis
phenotype, those with high serum resistin levels (≥ 63.695 ng/mL) had a
lower survival rate compared to those with low resistin levels (&lt;
63.695 ng/mL). In contrast, in patients with a mixed phenotype with
hyperinflammation, those with high serum resistin levels (≥ 107.64
ng/mL) had a higher survival rate compared to those with lower resistin
levels (&lt; 107.64 ng/mL).DiscussionSepsis, the leading cause of death
in intensive care unit patients. Identifying reliable biomarkers is
essential for improving both the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. We
found that serum S100A8/A9 concentration at ICU admission is a
significant predictor of 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients.
Additionally, resistin levels at ICU admission play an important role in
predicting 28-day mortality risk in patients with both normal and mixed
phenotypes with hyperinflammation. These findings suggest that S100A8/A9
and resistin could serve as effective biomarkers. Moreover, these
findings could guide early clinical decisions in the treatment of sepsis
patients.</p>

of β-lactam resistance genes in Gram-negative bacteria from positive
blood cultures using a microchip-based molecular assay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAccurate detection of β-lactam resistance genes in
bloodstream infections is critical for guiding antimicrobial therapy.
This study evaluates the Alifax Gram-negative resistance (GNR) microchip
assay for detecting β-lactam resistance genes directly from positive
blood cultures (PBCs) for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria, including
Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter
baumannii.MethodsSimulated (n=146) and clinical (n=106) GN-PBC samples
were tested for blaKPC, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaOXA-23-like,
blaOXA-48-like, blaSHV-ESBL, blaCTX-M-1/9 group, and blaCMY-2-like genes
using the GNR microchip assay. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) served as
the reference assay for simulated samples and, selectively, for clinical
samples. The bioMérieux BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2 (BCID2)
panel assay was used as a comparator for clinical samples.ResultsThe GNR
microchip assay correctly identified 203 (99.5%) of 204 β-lactam
resistance genes in simulated samples. One sample tested false negative
for a blaSHV-ESBL gene but true positive for a blaKPC gene. In clinical
samples, GNR results were concordant with BCID2 for 113 (100%) of 113
genes included in both assays. Additionally, the GNR assay detected
blaCMY-2-like (n=6), blaOXA-23-like (n=5), and blaSHV-ESBL (n=2), which
are not targeted by BCID2, all confirmed by WGS. In two
β-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa samples but negative by the GNR assay,
WGS confirmed the absence of acquired β-lactam resistance genes,
suggesting alternative resistance mechanisms.ConclusionThe GNR microchip
assay demonstrated high concordance and broader β-lactam resistance gene
coverage compared to BCID2, supporting its potential role in routine
diagnostics. Further validation in larger, prospective studies is
warranted.</p>

id="based-on-quorum-sensing-reverse-effect-of-traditional-chinese-medicine-on-bacterial-drug-resistance-mechanism">Based
on quorum sensing: reverse effect of traditional Chinese medicine on
bacterial drug resistance mechanism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a critical global health
challenge requiring urgent multidisciplinary interventions. Pathogenic
bacteria utilize six principal resistance mechanisms: (1) Enzymatic
degradation of antibiotics via the production of inactivating enzymes;
(2) Inactivation of antibiotics by changing the drug targets; (3)
Reduction of antibiotics entry by decreasing bacterial permeability; (4)
Enhanced antibiotics efflux through overexpression of efflux pumps; (5)
Acquisition of antibiotics resistance via genetic mutations; (6)
Development of antibiotics resistance through formation of microbial
biofilms. Notably, these resistance determinants demonstrate close
coordination through quorum sensing, collectively establishing
recalcitrant infections that defy conventional therapies. Emerging
evidence confirms the therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese
medicine in combating antimicrobial resistance. Traditional Chinese
medicine can be used as quorum sensing inhibitors to interfere with the
quorum sensing of bacteria, thereby achieving antibacterial effects.
Moreover, traditional Chinese medicine has the characteristics of rich
components, long history, mild action and no drug resistance, which
makes it stand out in the research against drug-resistant bacterial
infections. This paper systematically describes six mechanisms of
bacterial resistance and reviews the antagonistic effects of traditional
Chinese medicine against these mechanisms based on quorum sensing. It
highlights that the active ingredients, extracts and compound
formulations of traditional Chinese medicine have good reversal effects
on bacterial antibiotic resistance, which can effectively treat
drug-resistant bacterial infections. When combined with antibiotics,
traditional Chinese medicine not only reduces antibiotics dosage but
also adverse reactions, holding promise for improving and addressing
clinical challenges posed by bacterial resistance. This article further
discusses the impact of different delivery methods on the anti-bacterial
biofilms efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine. It introduces the
main delivery methods of traditional Chinese medicine at present and the
new delivery methods under research, pointing out the huge development
potential in the research of traditional Chinese medicine dosage forms.
Additionally, the deficiencies and improvement methods of the current
research were pointed out, and prospects for future related research
were put forward.</p>

kidney-yang deficiency syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of
sodium propionate in combination with Sishen Pill in the treatment of
diarrhea with kidney-yang deficiency syndrome in mice, with a focus on
its influence on intestinal microbiota, enzyme activity, and associated
therapeutic outcomes.MethodsA model of diarrhea with kidney-yang
deficiency syndrome was established via adenine combined with Folium
sennae administration. The model group was randomly assigned to the
following treatment groups: natural recovery group, 100% Sishen Pill
group, 75% Sishen Pill + 60 mg/kg sodium propionate group, 50% Sishen
Pill + 120 mg/kg sodium propionate group, 25% Sishen Pill + 240 mg/kg
sodium propionate group, and 480 mg/kg sodium propionate group. A
variety of parameters, including general symptoms, body weight, rectal
temperature, intestinal microbiota composition, microbial activity, and
enzyme activity, were assessed.ResultsCompared with natural recovery
group, the 480 mg/kg sodium propionate group presented significant
improvements in mental state, anal temperature, fecal water content, the
thymus index, and Bifidobacterium counts (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with
those in normal group, the fecal water content and Escherichia coli
counts in the 100% Sishen Pill group were significantly different (p
&lt; 0.01), but no significant differences were observed compared with
those in natural recovery group (p &gt; 0.05). The 75% Sishen Pill + 60
mg/kg sodium propionate group showed improvements in mental state, food
and water intake, body weight, rectal temperature, fecal water content,
spleen, and thymus index, Bifidobacterium counts, total bacterial count,
E. coli count, microbial activity, and lactase activity, which were
close to normal levels, and significant differences were observed when
compared to the natural recovery group (p &lt; 0.01). The 50% Sishen
Pill + 120 mg/kg sodium propionate group and 25% Sishen Pill + 240 mg/kg
sodium propionate group also exhibited significant differences in mental
status, microbial activity, and Lactobacillus count relative to those of
normal group (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the 50% Sishen Pill + 120 mg/kg
sodium propionate group presented significant changes in fecal water
content (p &lt; 0.01), whereas 25% Sishen Pill + 240 mg/kg sodium
propionate group presented significant differences in the spleen index,
total bacterial count, E. coli count, protease activity, lactase
activity, and xylanase activity compared with those of normal group (p
&lt; 0.01).ConclusionThe 75% Sishen Pill + 60 mg/kg sodium propionate
can improve the symptoms of kidney-yang deficiency syndrome, promote the
growth and development of mice, inhibit excessive bacterial
proliferation, support the growth of beneficial bacteria, and enhance
intestinal enzyme activity. Its effects are superior to the use of
sodium propionate or Sishen Pill alone. These results suggest that this
therapeutic ratio may optimize the efficacy of Sishen Pill in the
treatment of diarrhea with kidney-yang deficiency syndrome. However,
further research is necessary to confirm whether this combination
represents the most effective treatment regimen for this condition in
mice.</p>

clinical diseases as they require protracted and difficult-to-cure
courses. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common pathogen
responsible for bone infections and has high destruction rates. Previous
literature has indicated that during S. aureus osteomyelitis, immune
evasion mainly involves three mechanisms: biofilm formation,
intracellular infection, and abscess formation. However, recently, it
was observed that S. aureus can enter and persist for a long time in the
Osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN), a bone microstructure.
Furthermore, it has been found to successfully evade the host’s immune
system via natural physical barriers, chemical properties, and bone
microstructure’s immune escape mechanisms. Therefore, S. aureus bone
infections are more difficult to cure than soft-tissue infections.
Currently, there are only a few studies on OLCN invasion by S. aureus,
and the clinical evidence is not sufficient. Therefore, this review
aimed to combine relevant published literature on the OLCN-mediated
immune escape of S. aureus to elaborate on the pathological mechanisms
associated with protracted and difficult-to-cure bone infections. The
findings will provide a scientific basis and theoretical foundation for
future comprehensive analysis of how S. aureus invades OLCN and novel
treatment strategies for bone infections.</p>
