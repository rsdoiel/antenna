The 411</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: The Kidney Dietitian</p>
<p>
Magnesium &amp; kidney stones is a hot topic. Should people with kidney
stones take magnesium? Will magnesium help everyone with kidney stones?
Are magnesium supplements enough or should we focus on whole food
sources? Read on to learn about the basics of magnesium how much is
recommended and how to boost magnesium in your diet. […]

the relationship between cycle threshold of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, clinical
features, and laboratory data in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in
Semnan, Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCOVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has emerged as
a global public health crisis. Understanding the factors associated with
disease severity and outcomes is crucial for effective patient
management. This study aimed to investigate the association between
cycle threshold (CT) values, demographic data, medical history, clinical
manifestations, and laboratory findings in hospitalized COVID-19
patients in Semnan, Iran.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on
86 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in Semnan,
Iran, between December 2022 and March 2023. Respiratory swab samples
were collected RT-PCR was performed, CT values were obtained, and data
were collected from medical records, including demographic information,
medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory results.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.ResultsThe study
included 86 COVID-19 patients, with a slightly higher representation of
females (55.8%) and a mean age of 67.43 years. Pre-existing conditions
like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease were
prevalent among hospitalized patients. A majority of patients (59.3%)
had severe COVID-19, as indicated by lower CT values, while 31.4%
exhibited oxygen saturation levels below 90%. Significant differences
were observed in FBS, CRP, WBC, Hb, Cr, and SPo2 levels between severe
and non-severe patients. Correlation analysis revealed associations
between age, CRP, Cr, BUN, FBS, Vitamin D, TG, LDL, HDL, AST, ALP, and
SPo2. Reflecting complex interactions between inflammatory markers,
organ function, and lipid metabolism in COVID-19 patients.ConclusionThis
study provides valuable insights into the association between CT values,
clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. The findings underscore the importance of CT values
in assessing disease severity and potential prognostication. Further
research is warranted to validate these findings in larger and more
diverse patient populations.</p>

microbiome differences and disease risk in colorectal cancer relatives
and healthy individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Given the heightened focus on high-risk populations, this study aimed
to provide insights into early susceptibility and preventive strategies
for colorectal cancer (CRC) by focusing on high-risk populations. In
this research, fecal samples from 1,647 individuals across three
discovery cohorts and nine external validation cohorts were sequenced
using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing. A prediction model based on
random forest was constructed using the nine external cohorts and
independently validated with the three discovery cohorts. A disease
probability (POD) model based on microbial biomarkers was developed to
assess CRC risk. We found that the gut microbiome composition of CRC
relatives differed from that of controls, with enrichment of species
such as Fusobacterium and Bacteroides and a reduction in beneficial
genera like Coprococcus and Roseburia. Additionally, dietary red meat
intake emerged as a risk factor. The POD model indicated an elevated
risk of CRC in unaffected relatives. The findings suggest that the POD
for CRC may be increased in unaffected relatives or individuals living
in shared environments, although this difference did not reach
statistical significance. Our study introduces a novel framework for
assessing the risk of colorectal cancer in ostensibly healthy
individuals.</p>

affecting dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the elderly and the
progress of interventions in traditional Chinese and Western
medicine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>As the population ages, intestinal health in the elderly has become a
key area of concern, with gut microbiota dysbiosis emerging as a
significant issue. This review summarizes the factors influencing
dysbiosis and interventions from both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
and Western medicine, offering a reference for future research. A
comprehensive search of global databases up to March 2024 identified 617
original studies on gut microbiota dysbiosis in individuals aged 65 and
older. After applying strict PRISMA guidelines, 20 articles met the
inclusion criteria. Key findings are summarized in four areas: 1) the
definition and mechanisms of dysbiosis, 2) evaluation tools for gut
microbiota imbalance, 3) factors contributing to dysbiosis in the
elderly, and 4) pharmacological treatments. Both TCM and Western
medicine offer unique advantages in managing gut microbiota dysbiosis,
and the choice of intervention should be tailored to the individual’s
condition. Future research should focus on optimizing integrated TCM and
Western medicine approaches to improve outcomes for elderly patients
with gut microbiota dysbiosis.</p>
