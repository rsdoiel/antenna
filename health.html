immunodeficiency virus and oral microbiota: mutual influence on the
establishment of a viral gingival reservoir in individuals under
antiretroviral therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The role of the oral microbiota in the overall health and in systemic
diseases has gained more importance in the recent years, mainly due to
the systemic effects that are mediated by the chronic inflammation
caused by oral diseases, such as periodontitis, through the microbial
communities of the mouth. The chronic infection by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interacts at the tissue level (e.g. gut,
genital tract, brain) to create reservoirs; the modulation of the gut
microbiota by HIV infection is a good example of these interactions. The
purpose of the present review is to assess the state of knowledge on the
oral microbiota (microbiome, mycobiome and virome) of HIV-infected
patients in comparison to that of HIV-negative individuals and to
discuss the reciprocal influence of HIV infection and oral microbiota in
patients with periodontitis on the potential establishment of a viral
gingival reservoir. The influence of different clinical and biological
parameters are reviewed including age, immune and viral status, potent
antiretroviral therapies, smoking, infection of the airway and viral
coinfections, all factors that can modulate the oral microbiota during
HIV infection. The analysis of the literature proposed in this review
indicates that the comparisons of the available studies are difficult
due to their great heterogeneity. However, some important findings
emerge: (i) the oral microbiota is less influenced than that of the gut
during HIV infection, although some recurrent changes in the microbiome
are identified in many studies; (ii) severe immunosuppression is
correlated with altered microbiota and potent antiretroviral therapies
correct partially these modifications; (iii) periodontitis constitutes a
major factor of dysbiosis, which is exacerbated in HIV-infected
patients; its pathogenesis can be described as a reciprocal
reinforcement of the two conditions, where the local dysbiosis present
in the periodontal pocket leads to inflammation, bacterial translocation
and destruction of the supporting tissues, which in turn enhances an
inflammatory environment that perpetuates the periodontitis cycle. With
the objective of curing viral reservoirs of HIV-infected patients in the
future years, it appears important to develop further researches aimed
at defining whether the inflamed gingiva can serve of viral reservoir in
HIV-infected patients with periodontitis.</p>

microbial transmission in orthopedic patients without a history of
intestinal disorders</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The enrichment of oral taxa in the gut has recently been reported as
a notable alteration in the microbial balance in patients with
intestinal disorders. However, translocation in populations without such
diseases remains controversial. In this study, we examined 49 pairs of
tongue and rectal samples collected from orthopedic patients without a
history of intestinal disorders to verify the presence of oral taxa in
the rectal microbiota. The bacterial composition of each sample was
determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and amplicon sequence variant
(ASV) analysis. Although the bacterial compositions of the tongue and
rectal microbiota were distinctly different, tongue ASVs were detected
in 67.3% of the participants and accounted for 0.0%–9.37% of the rectal
microbiota. Particularly, Streptococcus salivarius, Fusobacterium
nucleatum, and Streptococcus parasanguinis were abundant in the rectal
microbiota. According to the network analysis, tongue taxa, such as S.
salivarius and S. parasanguinis, formed a cohabiting group with
Klebsiella pneumoniae and Alistipes finegoldii in the rectal microbiota.
The total abundance of tongue ASVs in the rectal microbiota was
significantly higher in participants with older age, hypertension, and
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. Our study presents an extensive
translocation of oral taxa to the rectum of a population without
intestinal disorders and suggests that aging, hypertension, and PPI use
are associated with an increased abundance of oral taxa and potential
pathogenic bacteria in the rectal microbiota.</p>

Cryptosporidium parvum sporozoite-derived extracellular vesicles:
profiling, origin, and protein composition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of a zoonotic disease and a
main cause of diarrhea in newborns. Effective drugs or vaccines are
still lacking. Oocyst is the infective form of the parasite; after its
ingestion, the oocyst excysts and releases four sporozoites into the
host intestine that rapidly attack the enterocytes. The membrane protein
CpRom1 is a large rhomboid protease that is expressed by sporozoites and
recognized as antigen by the host immune system. In this study, we
observed the release of CpRom1 with extracellular vesicles (EVs) that
was not previously described. To investigate this phenomenon, we
isolated and resolved EVs from the excystation medium by differential
ultracentrifugation. Fluorescence flow cytometry and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) experiments identified two types of
sporozoite-derived vesicles: large extracellular vesicles (LEVs) and
small extracellular vesicles (SEVs). Nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA) revealed mode diameter of 181 nm for LEVs and 105 nm for SEVs,
respectively. Immunodetection experiments proved the presence of CpRom1
and the Golgi protein CpGRASP in LEVs, while immune-electron microscopy
trials demonstrated the localization of CpRom1 on the LEVs surface. TEM
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that LEVs were generated
by means of the budding of the outer membrane of sporozoites;
conversely, the origin of SEVs remained uncertain. Distinct protein
compositions were observed between LEVs and SEVs as evidenced by their
corresponding electrophoretic profiles. Indeed, a dedicated proteomic
analysis identified 5 and 16 proteins unique for LEVs and SEVs,
respectively. Overall, 60 proteins were identified in the proteome of
both types of vesicles and most of these proteins (48 in number) were
already identified in the molecular cargo of extracellular vesicles from
other organisms. Noteworthy, we identified 12 proteins unique to
Cryptosporidium spp. and this last group included the immunodominant
parasite antigen glycoprotein GP60, which is one of the most abundant
proteins in both LEVs and SEVs.</p>

microflora: shedding light on the potential of blue light to modulate
the cutaneous microbiome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cutaneous diseases (such as atopic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis,
alopecia and chronic wounds) rank as the fourth most prevalent human
disease, affecting nearly one-third of the world’s population. Skin
diseases contribute to significant non-fatal disability globally,
impacting individuals, partners, and society at large. Recent evidence
suggests that specific microbes colonising our skin and its appendages
are often overrepresented in disease. Therefore, manipulating
interactions of the microbiome in a non-invasive and safe way presents
an attractive approach for management of skin and hair follicle
conditions. Due to its proven anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory
effects, blue light (380 – 495nm) has received considerable attention as
a possible ‘magic bullet’ for management of skin dysbiosis. As humans,
we have evolved under the influence of sun exposure, which comprise a
significant portion of blue light. A growing body of evidence indicates
that our resident skin microbiome possesses the ability to detect and
respond to blue light through expression of chromophores. This can
modulate physiological responses, ranging from cytotoxicity to
proliferation. In this review we first present evidence of the diverse
blue light-sensitive chromophores expressed by members of the skin
microbiome. Subsequently, we discuss how blue light may impact the
dialog between the host and its skin microbiome in prevalent skin and
hair follicle conditions. Finally, we examine the constraints of this
non-invasive treatment strategy and outline prospective avenues for
further research. Collectively, these findings present a comprehensive
body of evidence regarding the potential utility of blue light as a
restorative tool for managing prevalent skin conditions. Furthermore,
they underscore the critical unmet need for a whole systems approach to
comprehend the ramifications of blue light on both host and microbial
behaviour.</p>

randomization analysis identifies druggable genes and drugs repurposing
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent
condition that significantly impacts public health. Unfortunately, there
are few effective treatment options available. Mendelian randomization
(MR) has been utilized to repurpose existing drugs and identify new
therapeutic targets. The objective of this study is to identify novel
therapeutic targets for COPD.MethodsCis-expression quantitative trait
loci (cis-eQTL) were extracted for 4,317 identified druggable genes from
genomics and proteomics data of whole blood (eQTLGen) and lung tissue
(GTEx Consortium). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for
doctor-diagnosed COPD, spirometry-defined COPD (Forced Expiratory Volume
in one second [FEV1]/Forced Vital Capacity [FVC] &lt;0.7), and FEV1 were
obtained from the cohort of FinnGen, UK Biobank and SpiroMeta
consortium. We employed Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization
(SMR), HEIDI test, and colocalization analysis to assess the causal
effects of druggable gene expression on COPD and lung function. The
reliability of these druggable genes was confirmed by eQTL two-sample MR
and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) SMR, respectively. The
potential effects of druggable genes were assessed through the
phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Information on drug repurposing
for COPD was collected from multiple databases.ResultsA total of 31
potential druggable genes associated with doctor-diagnosed COPD,
spirometry-defined COPD, and FEV1 were identified through SMR, HEIDI
test, and colocalization analysis. Among them, 22 genes (e.g., MMP15,
PSMA4, ERBB3, and LMCD1) were further confirmed by eQTL two-sample MR
and protein SMR analyses. Gene-level PheWAS revealed that ERBB3
expression might reduce inflammation, while GP9 and MRC2 were associated
with other traits. The drugs Montelukast (targeting the MMP15 gene) and
MARIZOMIB (targeting the PSMA4 gene) may reduce the risk of
spirometry-defined COPD. Additionally, an existing small molecule
inhibitor of the APH1A gene has the potential to increase
FEV1.ConclusionsOur findings identified 22 potential drug targets for
COPD and lung function. Prioritizing clinical trials that target these
identified druggable genes with existing drugs or novel medications will
be beneficial for the development of COPD treatments.</p>

in fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of diabetes
mellitus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) refers to a group of chronic diseases with
global prevalence, characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting
from various etiologies. DM can harm various organ systems and lead to
acute or chronic complications, which severely endanger human
well-being. Traditional treatment mainly involves controlling blood
sugar levels through replacement therapy with drugs and insulin;
however, some patients still find a satisfactory curative effect
difficult to achieve. Extensive research has demonstrated a close
correlation between enteric dysbacteriosis and the pathogenesis of
various types of DM, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches
targeting the gut microbiota to manage DM. Fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT), a method for re-establishing the intestinal
microbiome balance, offers new possibilities for treating diabetes. This
article provides a comprehensive review of the correlation between DM
and the gut microbiota, as well as the current advancements in FMT
treatment for DM, using FMT as an illustrative example. This study aims
to offer novel perspectives and establish a theoretical foundation for
the clinical diagnosis and management of DM.</p>

id="causal-associations-between-human-gut-microbiota-and-osteomyelitis-a-mendelian-randomization-study">Causal
associations between human gut microbiota and osteomyelitis: a Mendelian
randomization study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecent studies have emphasized the role of gut microbiota
in the onset and progression of osteomyelitis. However, the exact types
of gut microbiota and their mechanisms of action remain unclear.
Additionally, there is a lack of theoretical support for treatments that
improve osteomyelitis by altering the gut microbiota.MethodsIn our
study, we utilized the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS)
meta-analysis to date from the MiBioGen consortium, involving 13,400
participants. The GWAS data for osteomyelitis were sourced from the UK
Biobank, which included 4,836 osteomyelitis cases and 486,484 controls.
We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization framework for a
detailed investigation into the causal relationship between gut
microbiota and osteomyelitis. Our methods included inverse variance
weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode approaches.
Additionally, we applied Cochran’s Q statistic to assess the
heterogeneity of the instrumental variable.ResultsAt the class level,
Bacilli and Bacteroidia were positively correlated with the risk of
osteomyelitis. At the order level, only Bacteroidales showed a positive
association with osteomyelitis. At the genus level, an increased
abundance of Butyricimonas, Coprococcus3, and Tyzzerella3 was positively
associated with the risk of osteomyelitis, whereas Lachnospira was
negatively associated. Sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of
heterogeneity or pleiotropy.ConclusionThis study reveals that classes
Bacilli and Bacteroidia, order Bacteroidales, and genera Butyricimonas,
Coprococcus3, and Tyzzerella3 are implicated in increasing the risk of
osteomyelitis, while the genus Lachnospira is associated with a reduced
risk. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise
mechanisms through which these specific bacterial groups influence the
pathophysiology of osteomyelitis</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe potential role of the endometrial microbiota in the
pathogenesis of endometrial polyps (EPs) warrants further investigation,
given the current landscape of limited and inconclusive research
findings. We aimed to explore the microecological characteristics of the
uterine cavity in patients with EPs and investigate the potential of
endometrial microbiota species as novel biomarkers for identifying
EPs.MethodsEndometrial samples were collected from 225 patients who
underwent hysteroscopies, of whom 167 had EPs, whereas 58 had non-
hyperproliferative endometrium status. The endometrial microbiota was
assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We characterized the
endometrial microbiota and identified microbial biomarkers for
predicting EPs.ResultsThe endometrial microbial diversity and
composition were significantly different between the EP and control
groups. Predictive functional analyses of the endometrial microbiota
demonstrated significant alterations in pathways involved in
sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and apoptosis
between the two groups. Moreover, a classification model based on
endometrial microbial ASV-based biomarkers along with the presence of
abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms achieved powerful classification
potential in identifying EPs in both the discovery and validation
cohorts.ConclusionOur study indicates a potential association between
altered endometrial microbiota and EPs. Endometrial microbiota-based
biomarkers may prove valuable for the diagnosis of EPs.Clinical trial

pathogens: the intriguing genetic legacy of endogenous retroviruses in
host physiology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The notion that viruses played a crucial role in the evolution of
life is not a new concept. However, more recent insights suggest that
this perception might be even more expansive, highlighting the ongoing
impact of viruses on host evolution. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are
considered genomic remnants of ancient viral infections acquired
throughout vertebrate evolution. Their exogenous counterparts once
infected the host’s germline cells, eventually leading to the permanent
endogenization of their respective proviruses. The success of ERV
colonization is evident so that it constitutes 8% of the human genome.
Emerging genomic studies indicate that endogenous retroviruses are not
merely remnants of past infections but rather play a corollary role,
despite not fully understood, in host genetic regulation. This review
presents some evidence supporting the crucial role of endogenous
retroviruses in regulating host genetics. We explore the involvement of
human ERVs (HERVs) in key physiological processes, from their precise
and orchestrated activities during cellular differentiation and
pluripotency to their contributions to aging and cellular senescence.
Additionally, we discuss the costs associated with hosting a substantial
amount of preserved viral genetic material.</p>

mechanisms of tigecycline-resistance among Enterobacterales</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The global emergence of antimicrobial resistance to multiple
antibiotics has recently become a significant concern. Gram-negative
bacteria, known for their ability to acquire mobile genetic elements
such as plasmids, represent one of the most hazardous microorganisms.
This phenomenon poses a serious threat to public health. Notably, the
significance of tigecycline, a member of the antibiotic group
glycylcyclines and derivative of tetracyclines has increased.
Tigecycline is one of the last-resort antimicrobial drugs used to treat
complicated infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria,
extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria or even pan-drug-resistant
(PDR) bacteria. The primary mechanisms of tigecycline resistance include
efflux pumps’ overexpression, tet genes and outer membrane porins.
Efflux pumps are crucial in conferring multi-drug resistance by
expelling antibiotics (such as tigecycline by direct expelling) and
decreasing their concentration to sub-toxic levels. This review
discusses the problem of tigecycline resistance, and provides important
information for understanding the existing molecular mechanisms of
tigecycline resistance in Enterobacterales. The emergence and spread of
pathogens resistant to last-resort therapeutic options stands as a major
global healthcare concern, especially when microorganisms are already
resistant to carbapenems and/or colistin.</p>

mutational scanning of the RNase III-like domain in Trypanosoma brucei
RNA editing protein KREPB4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Kinetoplastid pathogens including Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and
Leishmania species, are early diverged, eukaryotic, unicellular
parasites. Functional understanding of many proteins from these
pathogens has been hampered by limited sequence homology to proteins
from other model organisms. Here we describe the development of a
high-throughput deep mutational scanning approach in T. brucei that
facilitates rapid and unbiased assessment of the impacts of many
possible amino acid substitutions within a protein on cell fitness, as
measured by relative cell growth. The approach leverages several
molecular technologies: cells with conditional expression of a wild-type
gene of interest and constitutive expression of a library of mutant
variants, degron-controlled stabilization of I-SceI meganuclease to
mediate highly efficient transfection of a mutant allele library, and a
high-throughput sequencing readout for cell growth upon conditional
knockdown of wild-type gene expression and exclusive expression of
mutant variants. Using this method, we queried the effects of amino acid
substitutions in the apparently non-catalytic RNase III-like domain of
KREPB4 (B4), which is an essential component of the RNA Editing
Catalytic Complexes (RECCs) that carry out mitochondrial RNA editing in
T. brucei. We measured the impacts of thousands of B4 variants on
bloodstream form cell growth and validated the most deleterious variants
containing single amino acid substitutions. Crucially, there was no
correlation between phenotypes and amino acid conservation,
demonstrating the greater power of this method over traditional sequence
homology searching to identify functional residues. The bloodstream form
cell growth phenotypes were combined with structural modeling, RECC
protein proximity data, and analysis of selected substitutions in
procyclic form T. brucei. These analyses revealed that the B4
RNaseIII-like domain is essential for maintenance of RECC integrity and
RECC protein abundances and is also involved in changes in RECCs that
occur between bloodstream and procyclic form life cycle stages.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The microbiota, also referred to as the microbial community, is a
crucial component of the human microenvironment. It is located
predominantly in various organs, including the intestines, skin, oral
cavity, respiratory tract, and reproductive tract. The microbiota
maintains a symbiotic relationship with the human body, influencing
physiological and pathological functions to a significant degree. There
is increasing evidence linking the microbial flora to human cancers. In
contrast to the traditional belief that the urethra and urine of normal
individuals are sterile, recent advancements in high-throughput
sequencing technology and bacterial cultivation methods have led to the
discovery of specific microbial communities in the urethras of healthy
individuals. Given the prevalence of bladder cancer (BCa) as a common
malignancy of the urinary system, researchers have shifted their focus
to exploring the connection between disease development and the unique
microbial community within tumors. This shift has led to a deeper
investigation into the role of microbiota in the onset, progression,
metastasis, prognosis, and potential for early detection of BCa. This
article reviews the existing research on the microbiota within BCa
tumors and summarizes the findings regarding the roles of different
microbes in various aspects of this disease.</p>

<p>BackgroundAchieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients
infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) reduces all-cause mortality.
However, the mechanisms and risk factors for liver fibrosis and portal
hypertension post-SVR remain incompletely understood. In the gut-liver
axis, mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) substantially influence immune
and metabolic functions, displaying spatial heterogeneity at the
anatomical intestinal site. We analyzed MAM composition and function to
isolate the locoregional MAM involved in chronic liver disease
progression in HCV post-SVR patients.MethodsWe collected MAM samples
from three intestinal sites (terminal ileum, ascending colon, and
sigmoid colon) via brushing during colonoscopy in 23 HCV post-SVR
patients and 25 individuals without liver disease (controls). The 16S
rRNA of bacterial DNA in specimens collected with a brush and in feces
was sequenced. The molecular expression of intestinal tissues and
hepatic tissues were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsIn
the post-SVR group, the microbial β-diversity of MAM, especially in the
ascending colon, differed from the control group and was associated with
liver fibrosis progression. In PICRUSt analysis, MAM in the ascending
colon in the liver cirrhosis (LC) group showed compromised functions
associated with the intestinal barrier and bile acid production, and
FGF19 expression was markedly decreased in the terminal ileum biopsy
tissue in the LC group. At the genus level, six short-chain fatty acid
(SCFA)-producing bacterial genera, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia,
Agathobaculum, Dorea, and Pseudoflavonifractor were reduced in the
ascending colon of post-SVR LC patients.ConclusionIn patients of HCV
post-SVR, we identified the association between the degree of liver
fibrosis and dysbiosis of mucosa-associated SCFA-producing bacterial
genera that may be related to intestinal barrier and bile acid
production in the ascending colon.</p>
