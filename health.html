treatment of sodium propionate and Sishen Pill for diarrhea mice with
kidney-yang deficiency syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of
sodium propionate in combination with Sishen Pill in the treatment of
diarrhea with kidney-yang deficiency syndrome in mice, with a focus on
its influence on intestinal microbiota, enzyme activity, and associated
therapeutic outcomes.MethodsA model of diarrhea with kidney-yang
deficiency syndrome was established via adenine combined with Folium
sennae administration. The model group was randomly assigned to the
following treatment groups: natural recovery group, 100% Sishen Pill
group, 75% Sishen Pill + 60 mg/kg sodium propionate group, 50% Sishen
Pill + 120 mg/kg sodium propionate group, 25% Sishen Pill + 240 mg/kg
sodium propionate group, and 480 mg/kg sodium propionate group. A
variety of parameters, including general symptoms, body weight, rectal
temperature, intestinal microbiota composition, microbial activity, and
enzyme activity, were assessed.ResultsCompared with natural recovery
group, the 480 mg/kg sodium propionate group presented significant
improvements in mental state, anal temperature, fecal water content, the
thymus index, and Bifidobacterium counts (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with
those in normal group, the fecal water content and Escherichia coli
counts in the 100% Sishen Pill group were significantly different (p
&lt; 0.01), but no significant differences were observed compared with
those in natural recovery group (p &gt; 0.05). The 75% Sishen Pill + 60
mg/kg sodium propionate group showed improvements in mental state, food
and water intake, body weight, rectal temperature, fecal water content,
spleen, and thymus index, Bifidobacterium counts, total bacterial count,
E. coli count, microbial activity, and lactase activity, which were
close to normal levels, and significant differences were observed when
compared to the natural recovery group (p &lt; 0.01). The 50% Sishen
Pill + 120 mg/kg sodium propionate group and 25% Sishen Pill + 240 mg/kg
sodium propionate group also exhibited significant differences in mental
status, microbial activity, and Lactobacillus count relative to those of
normal group (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the 50% Sishen Pill + 120 mg/kg
sodium propionate group presented significant changes in fecal water
content (p &lt; 0.01), whereas 25% Sishen Pill + 240 mg/kg sodium
propionate group presented significant differences in the spleen index,
total bacterial count, E. coli count, protease activity, lactase
activity, and xylanase activity compared with those of normal group (p
&lt; 0.01).ConclusionThe 75% Sishen Pill + 60 mg/kg sodium propionate
can improve the symptoms of kidney-yang deficiency syndrome, promote the
growth and development of mice, inhibit excessive bacterial
proliferation, support the growth of beneficial bacteria, and enhance
intestinal enzyme activity. Its effects are superior to the use of
sodium propionate or Sishen Pill alone. These results suggest that this
therapeutic ratio may optimize the efficacy of Sishen Pill in the
treatment of diarrhea with kidney-yang deficiency syndrome. However,
further research is necessary to confirm whether this combination
represents the most effective treatment regimen for this condition in
mice.</p>

escape of Staphylococcus aureus mediated by osteocyte lacuna-canalicular
network leads to persistent and uncured bone infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bone infections, specifically chronic osteomyelitis, are
characterized by recurrent episodes. They are considered intractable
clinical diseases as they require protracted and difficult-to-cure
courses. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common pathogen
responsible for bone infections and has high destruction rates. Previous
literature has indicated that during S. aureus osteomyelitis, immune
evasion mainly involves three mechanisms: biofilm formation,
intracellular infection, and abscess formation. However, recently, it
was observed that S. aureus can enter and persist for a long time in the
Osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN), a bone microstructure.
Furthermore, it has been found to successfully evade the host’s immune
system via natural physical barriers, chemical properties, and bone
microstructure’s immune escape mechanisms. Therefore, S. aureus bone
infections are more difficult to cure than soft-tissue infections.
Currently, there are only a few studies on OLCN invasion by S. aureus,
and the clinical evidence is not sufficient. Therefore, this review
aimed to combine relevant published literature on the OLCN-mediated
immune escape of S. aureus to elaborate on the pathological mechanisms
associated with protracted and difficult-to-cure bone infections. The
findings will provide a scientific basis and theoretical foundation for
future comprehensive analysis of how S. aureus invades OLCN and novel
treatment strategies for bone infections.</p>
