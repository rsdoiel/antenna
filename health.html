in diagnostic assays for Clostridioides difficile infection in
adults</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) was a gram-positive anaerobic
bacterium in the gut, exhibiting clinical manifestations ranging from
mild diarrhoea to fatal pseudomembranous colitis. C. difficile infection
(CDI) remains a serious public health problem and accounted for an
estimated 360,075 cases in the United States in 2021. It has attracted
the utmost attention of the world health organization (WHO). Since
publication of a review of the diagnosis of CDI in adults, new clinical
diagnostic assays have become available and clinical practice guidelines
were updated. This paper presents a comprehensive review of contemporary
laboratory diagnostic approaches for CDI in adult patients, with a focus
on the utilisation and potential advancements of five sophisticated
methodologies, CRISPR in conjunction with nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAATs), gene sequencing technology, ultra-high performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and real-time cell
analysis (RTCA). It can provide new perspectives and ideas for the early
diagnosis of CDI in clinical settings.</p>

stem CD8+T cells in HIV/Mtb mono- and co-infection: characteristics,
implications, and clinical significance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) co-infection presents a significant public health challenge
worldwide. Comprehensive assessment of the immune response in HIV/Mtb
co-infection is complex and challenging. CD8+T cells play a pivotal role
in the adaptive immune response to both HIV and Mtb. The differentiation
of CD8+T cells follow a hierarchical pattern, with varying degrees of
exhaustion throughout the process. Memory stem T cells (TSCM cells) is
at the apex of the memory T lymphocyte system, which has recently
emerged as a promising target in immunotherapy. In this context, we
discuss the alterations of CD8+TSCM cells in HIV/Mtb mono- and
co-infection, their implications and clinical significance, and
potential for improving immunotherapy.</p>

analysis of proteome and transcriptome revealed changes in multiple
signaling pathways involved in immunity in the northern snakehead
(Channa argus) during Nocardia seriolae infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a valuable aquaculture
species across certain Asian countries, contributing significantly to
economic prosperity and dietary needs. However, its productivity faces
significant challenges, particularly from diseases such as nocardiosis,
caused by Nocardia seriolae. To date, the majority of research efforts
have focused on describing the observed phenomena related to N. seriolae
infection. However, there remains a notable gap in knowledge concerning
the infectivity of N. seriolae and the immune response it elicits. To
better understand the modulation of the immune responses to N. seriolae
infection in snakeheads, we investigated the splenic proteome profiles.
Specifically, we compared the profiles between uninfected northern
snakehead specimens and those infected with N. seriolae at 96 h using
the label-free data-independent acquisition methodology. A total of 700
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were obtained. Of these, 353
proteins exhibited upregulation, whereas 347 proteins displayed
downregulation after the infection. The DEPs were mapped to the
reference canonical pathways in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
database, revealing several crucial pathways that were activated
following N. seriolae infection. Noteworthy, among these were pathways
such as ferroptosis, complement and coagulation cascades, chemokine
signaling, tuberculosis, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and
Th17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, protein–protein interaction
networks were constructed to elucidate the interplay between
immune-related DEPs. These results revealed expression changes in
multiple signaling pathways during the initial colonization phase of N.
seriolae. This discovery offers novel insights into the infection
mechanisms and host interaction dynamics associated with N.
seriolae.</p>

value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing with blood samples for
the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of
metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of blood samples for the
identification of disseminated tuberculosis (DTB).MethodsA total of 48
individuals suspected of DTB were enrolled. All patients underwent mNGS
of peripheral blood and conventional microbiological tests. Patient
characteristics were collected from their medical records.ResultsA total
of 28 patients were diagnosed with DTB, whereas 20 patients were
confirmed as non-DTB cases. In the DTB groups, 19 (67.9%) contained TB
sequences, with specific reads of TB ranging from 1 to 219. The TB
sequence was more detectable by mNGS in male patients, those with
elevated PCT levels, those who are HIV positive, and those with a
decreased CD4 T-cell count. The HIV-positive group shows higher TB mNGS
reads (p = 0.012) and TB mNGS sensitivity (p = 0.05). The sensitivity of
TB mNGS in blood samples was 80% for HIV-infected patients and 44.4% for
non-HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.05). The non-HIV group had a higher
prevalence of miliary tuberculosis (p = 0.018), and extrapulmonary
tuberculosis was more prevalent in the HIV-positive group.ConclusionOur
research has shown that the mNGS of blood samples has excellent
sensitivity for the diagnosis of DTB. The TB sequence was more
detectable by mNGS in patients with elevated PCT levels, those who are
HIV positive, and those with a decreased CD4 T-cell count.</p>

promotes β-1,3-glucan exposure in Candida albicans and enhances
macrophage response</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Among the diverse fungal opportunistic pathogens, Candida albicans
garners significant attention due to its wide range of infections and
high frequency of occurrence. The emergence of resistance and the
limited number of antifungals drives the need to develop novel
antifungal drugs. Although the natural product baicalin has been shown
to trigger apoptosis in C. albicans in previous experiments, its
influence on cell wall (CW) structure along with immune recognition
remains elusive. In this work, baicalin showed a significant killing
effect against C. albicans SC5314. Moreover, CW destruction,
characterized by β-1,3-glucan unmasking and chitin deposition, was
observed as a consequence of the treatment with baicalin. The RNA
sequencing analysis revealed that treatment with baicalin resulted in
eight hundred forty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
Sixty-five genes, such as GSC1, ENG1, CHS3, GWT1, and MKC1, were
associated with CW organization or biogenesis. Baicalin-pretreated C.
albicans SC5314 was phagocytosed more efficiently by RAW264.7
macrophages, accompanied by increased TNF-α and IL-1β production.
Accordingly, it is hypothesized that baicalin could stimulate
β-1,3-glucan unmasking by governing CW-associated gene expression in C.
albicans SC5314, which contributes to macrophage recognition and
clearance.</p>

and regulatory interplay of T and B cells in chronic hepatitis B:
immunotherapy and emerging antiviral strategies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In the context of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the
continuous replication of HBV within host hepatocytes is a
characteristic feature. Rather than directly causing hepatocyte
destruction, this replication leads to immune dysfunction and
establishes a state of T-B immune tolerance. Successful clearance of the
HBV virus is dependent on the close collaboration between humoral and
cellular immunity. Humoral immunity, mediated by B-cell subpopulations,
and cellular immunity, dominated by T-cell subpopulations show varying
degrees of dysfunction during chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Notably, not
all T- and B-cells produce positive immune responses. This review
examine the most recent developments in the mutual regulation of T-B
cells during chronic HBV infection. Our focus is on the prevailing
immunotherapeutic strategies, such as T cell engineering, HBV-related
vaccines, PD-1 inhibitors, and Toll-like receptor agonists. While
nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) and interferons have notable limitations,
including inadequate viral suppression, drug resistance, and adverse
reactions, several HBV entry inhibitors have shown promising clinical
efficacy. To overcome the challenges posed by NUCs or monotherapy, the
combination of immunotherapy and novel antiviral agents presents a
promising avenue for future CHB treatment and potential cure.</p>

id="development-of-a-prediction-nomogram-for-igg-levels-among-asymptomatic-or-mild-patients-with-covid-19">Development
of a prediction nomogram for IgG levels among asymptomatic or mild
patients with COVID-19</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveCOVID-19 has evolved into a seasonal coronavirus disease,
characterized by prolonged infection duration and repeated infections,
significantly increasing the risk of patients developing long COVID. Our
research focused on the immune responses in asymptomatic and mild cases,
particularly the critical factors influencing serum immunoglobulin G
(IgG) levels and their predictive value.MethodsWe conducted a
retrospective analysis on data from 1939 asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic COVID-19 patients hospitalized between September 2022 and
June 2023. Spearman methods were used to test the correlation between
serum IgG and age, immunoglobulin M (IgM), procalcitonin (PCT),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), nucleic acid conversion time, and BMI. Univariate
and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified independent key
factors influencing serum IgG levels, which were integrated and
visualized in a nomogram. Finally, receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves were plotted to predict the model’s diagnostic performance
by calculating the AUC.ResultsMild patients showed higher levels of IgG,
IgM, and longer nucleic acid conversion times than asymptomatic
patients, and a lower proportion of them had received ≥ 3 COVID-19
vaccine doses. Serum IgG was positively correlated with serum IgM and
negatively correlated with age, PCT, IL-6, and BMI. Notably, it showed a
moderate negative correlation with nucleic acid conversion time (r =
-0.578, P &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression results showed that younger
age, lower IL-6 levels, ≥ 3 doses of vaccine, and no comorbidities were
independent predictors of serum IgG levels ≥ 21.08 g/L. We used age,
IL-6 levels, vaccine doses, and comorbidities to create a nomogram for
predicting serum IgG levels, with the area under the ROC curve reaching
0.772.ConclusionAge, IL-6 levels, vaccination status, and comorbidities
were independent predictors of serum IgG levels in asymptomatic or mild
COVID-19 patients, facilitating risk stratification and clinical
decision-making. Notably, receiving ≥3 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine was
the most beneficial factor for elevated serum IgG levels.</p>

molecular, and evolutionary characteristics of G1P[8] rotavirus in China
on the eve of RotaTeq application</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis study, conducted in China prior to RotaTeq’s launch,
examined the epidemiological, molecular, and evolutionary features of
the G1P[8] genotype RVA in children admitted with diarrhea, to aid in
evaluating its efficacy and impact on G1P[8] RVA in China.MethodsData
from the Chinese viral diarrhea surveillance network were collected from
January 2016 to December 2018. RVA strains identified as the G1P[8]
genotype were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Neutralizing
epitope, amino acid selection pressure, and evolution dynamics analyses
on VP7 and VP4 were performed using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 and PyMOL v.2.5.2,
four algorithms (MEME, SLAC, FEL, and FUBAR) in the Datamonkey online
software, and the MCMC model in BEAST v. 1.10.4, respectively.
Phylogenetic and identity features of 11 genes were assessed by DNAStar
and MEGA v.7.ResultsResults showed that the detection rate of G1P[8] in
China from 2016 to 2018 was generally low with significant seasonality.
The whole genome of G1P[8] of four 2016 childhood diarrhea specimens was
successfully sequenced. Phylogenetic and neutralizing epitope analysis
showed that Rotavin-M1 might have better protection on G1P[8] prevalent
in China than Rotarix and RotaTeq. Two conserved N-glycosylation sites
on VP7 of Chinese G1P[8] might affect the protective effect of the
vaccine. Evolution rate and selection pressure analysis identified the
possibility of rapidly evolving and adapting to the new environment
introduced by vaccines of G1P[8], whereas positive selection specific to
VP4 indicated the potential tendency to select for dominant traits.
Identity and phylogeny analysis showed that Chinese G1P[8] from before
2018 was generally stable with possible genetic recombination among
local strains.DiscussionThese findings not only are of great
significance for predicting the prevalence of G1P [8] in China, but also
provide data reference for evaluating rotavirus vaccine efficacy.</p>
