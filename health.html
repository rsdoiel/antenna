microbiome: a novel preventive and therapeutic target for prostatic
disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The human gut microbiome (GM) impacts various physiological processes
and can lead to pathological conditions and even carcinogenesis if
homeostasis is disrupted. Recent studies have indicated a connection
between the GM and prostatic disease. However, the underlying mechanisms
are still unclear. This review aims to provide a summary of the existing
information regarding the connection between the GM and various
prostatic conditions such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain
syndrome (CP/CPPS), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate
cancer (PCa). Furthermore, the review aims to identify possible
pathogenic mechanisms and suggest potential ways of targeting GM to
prevent and treat prostatic disease. Due to the complexity of the
mechanism between GM and prostatic diseases, additional research is
required to comprehend the association between the two. This will lead
to more effective treatment options for prostatic disease.</p>

aeruginosa mucinous phenotypes and algUmucABD operon mutant
characteristics obtained from inpatients with bronchiectasis and their
correlation with acute aggravation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveAlthough the mechanism is unclear, Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(PA) infection directly affects the frequency of acute exacerbations in
patients with bronchiectasis. The aims of this article are to analyze
the genetic mutation characteristics of the algUmucABD operon in PA,
isolated from hospitalized patients with bronchiectasis, and to explore
independent risk factors for frequent acute exacerbations of
bronchiectasis.MethodsBased on the number of acute exacerbations that
occurred in the past year, these patients with bronchiectasis were
divided into those with frequent acute exacerbations (Group A) and those
with non-frequent acute exacerbations (Group B). We identified the
distribution of mucoid phenotypes (MPs) and alginate morphotypes (AMs)
in PA, and classified them into I–IV categories based on their different
AMs; otherwise, the gene mutation types (GMTs) of the algUmucABD operon
were tested. Subsequently, the relationship between GMT, MP, and AM and
the independent risk factors for frequent acute exacerbations in
patients with bronchiectasis were explored.ResultsA total of 93 patients
and 75 PA strains, from January 2019 to August 2023, were included in
this study. The MP and AM distributions of PA were as follows: 64
strains (85.33%) of mucoid (the AMs were 38 strains of type I, 3 strains
of type II, and 23 strains of type IV) and 11 strains of non-mucoid (the
AM was type III only). Mucoid PA with algU, mucA, mucB, and mucD
mutations accounted for 19.61%, 74.51%, 31.37%, and 50.98%,
respectively. GMT was divided into the following: mucA mutations only,
mucA combined with other gene mutations, other gene mutations without
mucA mutations, and without gene mutations. In 91.7% of PA with type I
of AM, only mucA mutations occurred, and in both separate MP and AM, the
GMT differences were statistically significant. Lastly, the number of
lung lobes with bronchiectasis and the number of PA with mucA mutations
only were the independent risk factors for frequent acute
exacerbations.ConclusionThe mucA mutation was primarily responsible for
the mucoid of MP and type I of AM in PA, and it was also an independent
risk factor for frequent exacerbations of bronchiectasis.</p>

value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing with different nucleic
acid extracting methods of cell-free DNA or whole-cell DNA in the
diagnosis of non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeMetagenomic next-generation sequencing(mNGS) is a novel
molecular diagnostic technique. For nucleic acid extraction methods,
both whole-cell DNA (wcDNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are widely applied
with the sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We aim to
evaluate the clinical value of mNGS with cfDNA and mNGS with wcDNA for
the detection of BALF pathogens in non-neutropenic pulmonary
aspergillosis.MethodsmNGS with BALF-cfDNA, BALF-wcDNA and conventional
microbiological tests (CMTs) were performed in suspected non-neutropenic
pulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnostic value of different assays for
pulmonary aspergillosis was compared.ResultsBALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA)
outperformed CMTs in terms of microorganisms detection. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated BALF-mNGS (cfDNA,
wcDNA) was superior to culture and BALF-GM. Combination diagnosis of
either positive for BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) or CMTs is more sensitive
than CMTs alone in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis
(BALF-cfDNA+CMTs/BALF-wcDNA+CMTs vs. CMTs: ROC analysis: 0.813 vs.0.66,
P=0.0142/0.796 vs.0.66, P=0.0244; Sensitivity: 89.47% vs. 47.37%,
P=0.008/84.21% vs. 47.37%, P=0.016). BALF-cfDNA showed a significantly
greater reads per million (RPM) than BALF-wcDNA. The area under the ROC
curve (AUC) for RPM of Aspergillus detected by BALF-cfDNA, used to
predict “True positive” pulmonary aspergillosis patients, was 0.779,
with a cut-off value greater than 4.5.ConclusionWe propose that the
incorporation of BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) with CMTs improves diagnostic
precision in the identification of non-neutropenic pulmonary
aspergillosis when compared to CMTs alone. BALF-cfDNA outperforms
BALF-wcDNA in clinical value.</p>

id="the-intratumoral-microbiota-a-new-horizon-in-cancer-immunology">The
intratumoral microbiota: a new horizon in cancer immunology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Over the past decade, advancements in high-throughput sequencing
technologies have led to a qualitative leap in our understanding of the
role of the microbiota in human diseases, particularly in oncology.
Despite the low biomass of the intratumoral microbiota, it remains a
crucial component of the tumor immune microenvironment, displaying
significant heterogeneity across different tumor tissues and individual
patients. Although immunotherapy has emerged a major strategy for
treating tumors, patient responses to these treatments vary widely.
Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between the intratumoral
microbiota and the immune system can modulate host tumor immune
responses, thereby influencing the effectiveness of immunotherapy.
Therefore, it is critical to gain a deep understanding of how the
intratumoral microbiota shapes and regulates the tumor immune
microenvironment. Here, we summarize the latest advancements on the role
of the intratumoral microbiota in cancer immunity, exploring the
potential mechanisms through which immune functions are influenced by
intratumoral microbiota within and outside the gut barrier. We also
discuss the impact of the intratumoral microbiota on the response to
cancer immunotherapy and its clinical applications, highlighting future
research directions and challenges in this field. We anticipate that the
valuable insights into the interactions between cancer immunity and the
intratumoral microbiota provided in this review will foster the
development of microbiota-based tumor therapies.</p>

of an antimicrobial resistance surveillance network through data
management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide within 2 months
demonstrated the vulnerability of the world’s population to infectious
diseases. In 2015, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use
Surveillance System (GLASS) was launched to combat antimicrobial
resistance (AMR). However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of
the decade-long global battle against AMR based on GLASS
data.MethodsSouth Korea established Kor-GLASS (Korean-GLASS) to
proactively monitor data quality and enable international
collaborations. A unique feature of Kor-GLASS is the quality control
center (QCC), which uses network hubs and ensures standardized,
high-quality data through interlaboratory proficiency testing (IPT) and
external quality assessment (EQA). In addition, the QCC multifaceted
endeavors for integrated data quality management.ResultsSince 2020,
high-quality AMR data have indicated fluctuating antibiotic resistance
rates in South Korea. This trend does not align with the decrease in
antibiotic usage seen in humans but coincides with non-human antibiotic
sales, indicating a need for greater monitoring of non-human antibiotic
resistance. Comprehensive and robust management taking account of the
intricate interplay among humans, animals, and the environment is
essential. Kor-GLASS has been expanded into a “One Health” multiagency
collaborative initiative.DiscussionAlthough a standardized solution is
not suitable for all countries, it must align with the local context and
international standards. A centralized top-down management structure
such as that of the QCC is essential to ensure continuous data quality
coordination. Sustained efforts and surveillance systems are crucial for
monitoring and managing AMR and safeguarding human health.</p>
