id="development-of-a-four-autophagy-related-gene-signature-for-active-tuberculosis-diagnosis">Development
of a four autophagy-related gene signature for active tuberculosis
diagnosis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) diagnostics urgently require non-sputum
biomarkers to address the limitations of conventional methods in
distinguishing active TB (ATB) from latent infection (LTBI), healthy
controls (HCs), and TB-mimicking diseases (ODs, other
diseases).MethodsTranscriptomic data from GSE83456 and GSE152532 were
combined to form the selection dataset. Marker genes were identified
from differentially expressed autophagy-related genes using a Random
Forest classifier. The optimal gene signature was selected based on
optimal performance through a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier with cross-validation. The signature was subsequently
evaluated in six independent evaluation datasets and validated using
whole blood samples collected from 70 participants.ResultsWe identified
a novel four-gene autophagy-related signature (CASP1, FAS, TRIM5, C5) in
the selection dataset. This signature demonstrated robust diagnostic
accuracy across multiple evaluation datasets: Area Under the Curve (AUC)
0.83–0.98 for ATB vs. LTBI and 0.82–0.94 for ATB vs. HCs. Crucially, it
maintained high specificity (AUC 0.89–0.90) against ODs. RT-qPCR
validation in whole blood samples confirmed elevated expression in ATB,
while an SVM model achieved promising differentiation (AUC 0.86 for ATB
vs. LTBI and AUC 0.99 for ATB vs. HCs).ConclusionsOur findings yielded a
four-gene signature in whole blood that is robustly diagnostic for ATB,
validated across multiple evaluation datasets and clinical samples. The
autophagy-driven specificity and PCR-compatible design of this signature
offer a blood-based, cost-effective strategy to enhance TB detection,
addressing WHO-aligned diagnostic needs.</p>

id="an-overview-of-rapid-non-culture-based-techniques-in-various-clinical-specimens-for-the-laboratory-diagnosis-of-talaromyces-marneffei">An
overview of rapid non-culture-based techniques in various clinical
specimens for the laboratory diagnosis of Talaromyces marneffei</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is a temperature-dependent
biphasic deep opportunistic infectious fungus that primarily affects
individuals with advanced HIV disease and other immunocompromised
populations. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on fungal culture, but
this process, although sensitive, is time-consuming and susceptible to
contamination. Therefore, non-culture techniques serve as important
complementary and alternative methods for diagnosing talaromycosis. They
enable faster and more convenient pathogen identification, improving
diagnostic efficiency and facilitating earlier initiation of treatment.
Patients with talaromycosis can present with a wide range of clinical
symptoms, and different clinical samples require different detection
techniques. Blood samples are the most versatile, as laboratory
technologists can utilize a wide range of diagnostic methods to obtain
accurate results, particularly in the setting of a suspected
disseminated infection. In contrast, urine diagnosis relies primarily on
immunological methods that detect an antigen abundantly secreted during
an infection. Moreover, for invasive samples like bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid or cerebrospinal fluid, metagenomic next-generation sequencing is
likely to be of significant importance for the early diagnosis due to
its high sensitivity and specificity, though this approach is not yet
standardized or widely available. For tissue samples, histopathology for
light microscopy analysis is a well-established basic method, but it
relies on experienced laboratory personnel, is time-consuming, and the
histological appearance of other fungi can overlap with T. marneffei.
Recent advances in rapid non-culture-based methods diagnostics
underscore the growing importance of these tools in clinical settings,
particularly for resource-limited areas where culture facilities are
inadequate or unavailable. These methods improve diagnostic turnaround
time and may lead to better clinical outcomes, especially for vulnerable
patient populations. This review emphasizes the need for ongoing
development and validation of non-culture diagnostics, with a focus on
standardization, accessibility, and integration of rapid molecular and
immunological tools to improve early detection and patient management in
endemic regions.</p>

id="systematic-bacteriophage-selection-for-the-lysis-of-multiple-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-strains">Systematic
bacteriophage selection for the lysis of multiple Pseudomonas aeruginosa
strains</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing severe
infections of the lung, burn wounds and eyes. Due to its intrinsic high
antibiotic resistance the bacterium is difficult to eradicate. A
promising therapeutic option is the use of P. aeruginosa-specific
bacteriophages. Thus, the implementation of a phage therapy requires
their selection, production and systematic administration using multiple
strains of the bacterial target. Here, we used 25 phages and tested
their susceptibility on 141 different P. aeruginosa strains isolated
from patients with different types of infection. Comparative host
spectrum analyses were carried out using double agar overlay plaque
assay (DPA) and planktonic killing assay (PKA), which resulted in 70% of
the cases in the same host range. All phages were assigned to known
phage genera, but some of the phages are new species. Isolated members
of the genera Pakpunavirus, Pbunavirus (myoviruses), Pawinskivirus,
Elvirus (myoviruses, jumbo phages), Litunavirus and Bruynoghevirus
(podoviruses) demonstrated great therapeutic potential due to strong
lysis behavior on diverse strains. Seven phages were excluded for
therapeutic purposes due to genetic determinants that confer
lysogenicity. Due to automation with lower time expenditure in execution
and analysis, PKA has the higher potential for implementation in
diagnostics. Finally, different combinations of phages were tested in
silico with various P. aeruginosa strains. Highly efficient phage
combinations eradicating multiple P. aeruginosa strains were found.
Thus, a solid basis for the development of a broad host range phage
therapy was laid.</p>

microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic shifts in pediatric norovirus
infection: a metagenomic study in Northeast China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundNorovirus (NoV) is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis
in pediatric populations worldwide. However, the role of gut microbiota
in NoV pathogenesis remains poorly understood.MethodsWe conducted a
longitudinal metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from 12 NoV-infected
children and 13 age-matched healthy controls in Northeast China.
Microbial composition and functional pathways were assessed using
high-throughput shotgun sequencing and bioinformatic
profiling.ResultsNoV infection was associated with significant gut
microbial dysbiosis, including increased alpha diversity and distinct
taxonomic shifts. Notably, Bacteroides uniformis, Veillonella spp., and
Carjivirus communis were enriched in infected individuals. Functional
analysis revealed upregulation of metabolic pathways involved in
carbohydrate and lipid processing. These microbial and functional
alterations persisted over time and correlated with disease
severity.ConclusionsOur findings reveal novel associations between NoV
infection and gut microbiota dysbiosis, particularly the enrichment of
Bacteroides uniformis, which may influence host-pathogen interactions
via metabolic or immune mechanisms. The identified microbial and
metabolic signatures offer potential biomarkers for diagnosis and
targets for microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in pediatric NoV
infection.</p>

in fungal drug development: opportunities, challenges, and future
outlook</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in fungal drug
development offers innovative strategies to address the escalating
threat of fungal infections and the challenge of antifungal resistance.
This review evaluates the current landscape of fungal infections,
highlights the limitations of existing antifungal therapies, and
examines the transformative potential of AI in drug discovery and
development. We specifically focus on how AI can enhance the
identification of new antifungal agents and improve therapeutic
strategies. Despite numerous opportunities for advancement, significant
challenges remain, particularly regarding data quality, regulatory
frameworks, and the complexities associated with the drug development
process. This review aims to provide insights into recent advancements
in AI technologies, their implications for the future of fungal drug
development, and the necessary research directions to effectively
leverage AI for improved patient outcomes.</p>

characteristics and genetic features of 35 cases of adverse reactions to
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine in children</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics
and genetic features of children with adverse reactions to the Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. The goal was to improve understanding of
this condition, provide insights into early diagnosis and intervention,
and support stratified management.MethodsClinical data of 35 children
hospitalized at Kunming Children’s Hospital between January 2014 and
June 2024 with complete records and diagnosed with BCG vaccine adverse
reactions were collected. Cases were classified into two groups:
disseminated BCG disease (BCG-D) and BCG-itis. Children with primary
immunodeficiency (PID) were further divided into severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) and non-SCID groups. Clinical characteristics,
immunological profiles, genetic backgrounds, and outcomes were compared
between the groups.ResultsAmong the 35 cases, 25 were male, and 10 were
female, with a median age of onset of 2 months (1–4 months). Eight cases
(22.9%) were diagnosed with BCG-D, while 27 cases (77.1%) were
classified as BCG-itis. Sixteen cases (45.7%) were confirmed to have
PID, including SCID (7 cases, 20.0%), chronic granulomatous disease (6
cases, 17.1%), Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (2
cases, 5.7%), and fas associated via death domain (FADD) gene mutation
(1 case, 2.6%). Compared to the BCG-itis group, the BCG-D group
exhibited significantly higher rates of fever, hepatosplenomegaly,
elevated white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and C-reactive
protein (CRP) levels, along with lower red blood cell counts and
hemoglobin levels (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, the SCID group showed
significantly lower age, lymphocyte counts, IgM levels, CD3, CD4, and
CD8 cell ratios, but higher CD19 cell ratios and mortality rates
compared to the non-SCID group (p&lt;0.05). Twenty-seven (77.1%) cases
were discharged after improvement, and eight children (22.9%) succumbed
to the condition, including six with SCID gene mutations (representing
85.7% of the total SCID cases), one with an interleukin 12 receptor
subunit beta 1(IL12RB1) mutation, and one who was not genetically tested
but diagnosed with disseminated BCG disease.ConclusionsIn children
presenting with adverse reactions to the BCG vaccine, the presence of
fever, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated neutrophil levels, and CRP should
prompt evaluation for disseminated BCG disease and assessment of
immunological status. Early identification of underlying PID,
particularly SCID, is crucial, given the high mortality and poor
prognosis associated with the condition, necessitating timely
interventions.</p>

id="prostate-and-urinary-microbiomes-in-prostate-cancer-development-focus-on-cutibacterium-acnes">Prostate
and urinary microbiomes in prostate cancer development: focus on
Cutibacterium acnes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignancies among
men, with its incidence steadily increasing worldwide. Recent advances
in microbiome research have opened new avenues for understanding and
treating PCa; however, studies focusing specifically on the prostate
tissue microbiome remain limited. Evidence suggests that the microbial
communities within PCa tissues exhibit significant diversity and
regional variability, with certain bacteria potentially contributing to
PCa initiation and progression through chronic inflammation. The
prostate microbiome comprises not only bacteria but also viruses, fungi,
and parasites, and its diversity is influenced by a complex interplay of
genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Methodological
limitations and sample contamination further complicate the
interpretation of microbiome data. The urinary microbiome is similarly
diverse and shaped by multiple overlapping influences. Although urine,
prostatic fluid, and prostate tissue are anatomically and functionally
connected, whether urine and prostatic fluid can accurately reflect the
prostate tissue microbiome remains to be conclusively determined. Among
the microorganisms detected, Cutibacterium acnes is frequently
identified in prostate tissue, urine, and prostatic fluid from PCa
patients. This bacterium is known to elicit inflammatory responses
through various pathways, potentially impacting tumorigenesis and cancer
progression. Nevertheless, findings across studies remain inconsistent.
Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by
which the microbiome influences PCa. Such efforts may offer novel
insights and strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
this disease.</p>

and safety of voriconazole and caspofungin for the treatment of invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo compare and analyze the efficacy and safety of different
antifungal drug treatment regimens for patients with invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis (IPA) in the intensive care unit (ICU).MethodsWe
retrospectively collected the clinical data of patients with IPA in the
ICU in two grade-A tertiary hospitals from January 2019 to January 2024
using the HIS system and compared the clinical efficacy, incidence of
adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and all-cause mortality at discharge
among different antifungal treatments, such as voriconazole alone,
caspofungin alone, and a combination of voriconazole plus
caspofungin.ResultsA total of 151 patients were enrolled, including 129
in the monotherapy group (with 92 in the voriconazole subgroup and 37 in
the caspofungin subgroup) and 22 in the voriconazole plus caspofungin
combination group. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common pathogenic
fungus in patients with IPA, followed by Aspergillus flavus. In terms of
clinical efficacy, monotherapy and combination therapy were equally
effective (P=0.618), and the efficacy of voriconazole or caspofungin
alone and that of voriconazole combined with caspofungin in the
treatment of IPA was equivalent (P=0.630). In terms of safety, the total
incidence of ADRs in the combination therapy group was greater than that
in the monotherapy group, but the difference was not statistically
significant (P=0.109). The two groups were also equally safe in terms of
causing renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, visual abnormalities, and
hypokalemia. However, compared with the monotherapy group, the
combination therapy group exhibited a significantly greater incidence of
pancytopenia (P=0.013, P=0.004). The all-cause mortality in the
combination therapy group was significantly greater than that in the
monotherapy group (P=0.027, P=0.009).ConclusionsVoriconazole is still
the preferred treatment for critically ill patients with IPA, and
caspofungin has good clinical efficacy and safety and can effectively
replace voriconazole for these patients. However, the combination
treatment with voriconazole and caspofungin did not improve the
all-cause mortality rate of critically ill patients with IPA, is
associated with increased total ADR and pancytopenia incidence and is
not recommended as an initial treatment plan.</p>

pylori infection and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio: a
cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (HP) infection is one of the most
common chronic infections worldwide, closely related to various
gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic disorders. In recent years, the
relationship between HP infection and abnormal glucose and lipid
metabolism has received significant attention, although its specific
mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to explore the association
between HP infection and lipid metabolism abnormalities, particularly
the role of the apolipoprotein B/A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio.MethodsThis
cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed data from 9,218 patients
who underwent physical examinations at Shanghai Health and Medical
Center in 2022. HP infection status was determined using the carbon-13
breath test, and clinical data, biochemical indicators, and lipid
metabolism-related data were collected. Multiple regression analysis was
employed to investigate the relationship between HP infection and the
ApoB/ApoA1 ratio.ResultsPatients in the HP-positive group were older and
had a higher proportion of males. Their body mass index (BMI), blood
pressure, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), total cholesterol (TC),
fasting blood glucose (FBG), Creatinine and White blood Cell were
significantly higher than those in the HP-negative group. The
HP-positive group exhibited a higher prevalence of underlying diseases
(e.g., hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease) and significant
abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, uric acid,
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and other indicators. The
ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was significantly elevated in the HP-positive group and
was not influenced by gender. Multiple regression analysis revealed that
the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is an independent risk factor for HP
infection.ConclusionHP infection is closely associated with abnormal
lipid metabolism, and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is an independent risk factor
for HP infection, demonstrating significant advantages over other lipid
indicators. This large-scale study highlights a significant association
between HP infection and an elevated ApoB/ApoA1 ratio. The findings
suggest that HP may contribute to cardiovascular risk via dyslipidemia,
with the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio serving as a potential biomarker. Further
research should explore whether HP eradication could mitigate these
metabolic disturbances.</p>

transcriptomic changes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected
macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeat 2 (IFIT2) is
known for its antiviral activity and has recently been implicated in the
defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). This study employed
global transcriptomics to investigate the downstream effects of IFIT2
induction in THP-1 macrophages infected with R179 M. tb, aiming to
elucidate its role and downstream contributing factors that aid it in
intracellular M. tb killing. Using a vector-based overexpression
approach, IFIT2 expression was induced in THP-1 cells infected with R179
M. tb, followed by RNA extraction 12 hours post-infection and
AmpliSeq-based targeted transcriptome sequencing. Bioinformatics
analysis identified 282 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which
189 were upregulated and 90 were downregulated (FDR &lt;0.05). Filtering
for highly significant DEGs (|log2(fold change) | &gt; 1.5) yielded 70
genes, predominantly upregulated, with functional enrichment in pathways
such as defense response to viruses and cytokine-mediated signaling.
Signaling pathway impact analysis highlighted pathway activation and
inhibition of the tuberculosis (TB) pathway. RT-qPCR validation
confirmed the upregulation of selected DEGs (ISG15, CMPK2, RSAD2,
IFI44L, IFI44), corroborating the AmpliSeq data. This study provides
comprehensive insights into the transcriptomic profile induced by IFIT2
in TB, revealing critical downstream contributors and pathways that
underpin IFIT2’s ability to combat M. tb infection.</p>

communities in plague foci: pathogens rather than symbionts?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Besides causing allergies from their bites, fleas transmit the most
notorious zoonotic pathogen, Yersinia pestis. They also harbor commensal
bacteria in their guts. Here, the microbial communities of fleas were
characterized using 16S rRNA Next-Generation Sequencing to understand
microbial interactions and functions in areas with historical
plague-outbreaks in Iran with the ultimate idea of ​​managing flea-borne
diseases. Meriones persicus, Xenopsylla buxtoni and Bartonella spp. were
identified as the dominant host, vector and bacterium, respectively. Six
bacteria Bartonella, Sphingomonas, Wolbachia, Cardinium, Rickettsia and
Ralstonia were identified as the most abundant genera in the microbiome
of five flea species. More detailed surveys revealed substantial
intrageneric variations (e.g. nine phylotypes for Bartonella) and the
diverse nature (from biofilm-forming human pathogens to insect
reproductive manipulators, and environmental microbes) for the bacteria
studied. The fleas microbiome is largely affected by species and to a
lesser extent by location, and circulates by both horizontal and
vertical transmissions. The prevalence of Bartonella spp. infection in
fleas highlights the potential to explore One Health approaches,
particularly in addressing travel-related and zoonotic disease risks.
Environmental drivers—such as climate change, habitat alteration, and
host dynamics—shape flea microbiomes and influence disease risk, while
concerns about antimicrobial resistance further complicate control
efforts. Our findings advocate for coordinated strategies that combine
public health education, ecological monitoring, and global collaboration
to sustainably manage flea-borne diseases.</p>

<p>ObjectiveWe developed and validated a diagnostic scoring system for
tuberculous meningitis (TBM) using 13 laboratory parameters, comparing
tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and non-tuberculous meningitis
(non-TBM).MethodsThis study enrolled patients diagnosed with meningitis.
We retrospectively collected and analyzed demographic data (gender, age)
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, including biochemical profiles
and white blood cell counts with differential analysis. Variable
selection was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator (LASSO) regression. The dataset was randomly divided into a
training set and a validation set. A diagnostic prediction model was
developed using logistic regression in the training set, with nomograms
constructed to visually demonstrate the diagnostic relationships.
Decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to assess the clinical
utility of the model. Finally, the diagnostic performance of the model
was evaluated in the validation set.ResultsA total of 254 patients with
meningitis were included in this study. LASSO regression analysis
identified four predictive variables: CSF glucose, CSF chloride, CSF
protein and CSF mononuclear cells proportion. These parameters were
incorporated into a logistic regression model, with weighted factors
generating a diagnostic score. A score of ≥ 3 was suggestive of TBM with
a sensitivity of 76.10% and a specificity of 84.10%, and the area under
the curve (AUC) values was 0.86 (95% CI 0.81-0.91). Both calibration
curves and DCA validated the robust performance of model.ConclusionWe
developed and validated a clinically applicable diagnostic model for TBM
using routinely available and low-cost CSF parameters. Our findings
demonstrated that this scoring system provided reliable TBM diagnosis,
particularly in countries and regions with limited microbial and
radiological resources.</p>

<p>May 19, 2025 Press release The Trump Administration has failed to
protect the workforce by cutting most of NIOSH and HICPAC at the CDC 
Washington DC -  As the US faces the start of the sixth year of the
COVID pandemic, the People’s CDC denounces the Trump administration for
failing to protect workers and especially workers and patients in
healthcare settings. Healthcare-acquired infections from SARS-CoV-2 and
Flu drive unnecessary harm and death, all preventable by universal
masking. However, federal agencies and committees at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with vital roles in ensuring the
highest safety standards in workplaces and healthcare settings such as
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was
defunded and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory
Committee (HICPAC) was eliminated. This was carried out under the
current Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F Kennedy,
Jr. </p>

gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles in HBV-related liver cirrhosis:
insights into disease progression</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) is
a significant global health issue, affecting gut microbiota (GM)
composition and metabolic processes. This study aimed to explore the
associations between intestinal microbiota, metabolic profiles, and
disease progression in patients with HBV-LC.MethodsFecal samples were
collected prospectively from 40 healthy controls (HC) and 83 HBV-LC
patients between December 2022 and August 2023. Gut microbiota
alterations at various stages of liver function were analyzed using 16S
rRNA gene sequencing. Untargeted metabolomics was employed to identify
potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways associated with early
cirrhosis. Additionally, correlations between bacterial genera,
inflammatory markers, and metabolites were investigated.ResultsHBV-LC
patients demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial diversity and
relative abundance compared to the HC group. Genera such as Alistipes
and Lachnospira were notably depleted, while Fusobacterium and
Enterococcus were enriched in patients with Model for End-Stage Liver
Disease (MELD) scores ≥ 21 or Child-Turcotte-Pugh C grade. Correlation
analyses revealed strong associations between intestinal flora, clinical
indicators of disease severity, and inflammatory factors. Metabolic
analysis showed decreased levels of tocopherol and
21-hydroxypregnenolone, which were strongly linked to the reduced
abundance of Alistipes and Lachnospira. Biosynthesis of unsaturated
fatty acids and linoleic acid metabolism emerged as critical enrichment
pathways.ConclusionsHBV-LC patients displayed significant alterations in
gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, which correlated closely with
disease severity and inflammatory status. These findings provide new
insights into cirrhosis pathogenesis and suggest potential biomarkers
for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>

situ identification of toxin-producing Clostridioides difficile in stool
samples based on single-cell Raman spectroscopy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Clostridioides difficile (CD) has emerged as one of the most
prevalent nosocomial infections in hospitals and is the primary
causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous
colitis. In recent years, C. difficile-induced infections have resulted
in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a particularly
rapid increase in incidence observed in China. C. difficile strains are
categorized into toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing based on their
ability to synthesize toxins, with the pathogenicity of C. difficile
being strictly dependent on the protein toxins produced by the
toxin-producing strains. Therefore, early and rapid identification of
toxin-producing C. difficile is crucial for the diagnosis and prevention
of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Currently, the detection
methods of C. difficile infection carried out by clinical laboratories
in China mainly include C. difficile toxin-producing culture, cell
culture toxin assay, toxin assay by immunological methods, glutamate
dehydrogenase (GDH) assay and nucleic acid amplification assay.However,
current detection methods for CDI in clinical laboratories in China
exhibit significant limitations, such as being time-consuming,
operationally complex, and lacking in specificity and sensitivity. Raman
microspectroscopy has been shown to have the potential for rapid and
reliable identification in microbial diagnostics, with the method
reducing the time to results to less than 1 hour, including the
processing of clinical samples, the measurement of single-cell Raman
spectra, and the final diagnosis through the use of training models. In
this study, we aimed to predict in situ strain identification and
virulent strain identification of 24 raw clinical stool samples by
constructing a reference single-cell Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) database
of common intestinal flora and C. difficile, as well as a reference SCRS
database of toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing C. difficile
strains. The results showed that the accuracy of C. difficile strain
identification in clinical stool samples was 83%, and the accuracy of
virulent strain prediction was 80%. These findings suggest that Raman
spectroscopy may be a viable method for the rapid in situ identification
of virulent and non-virulent C. difficile strains and holds promise for
clinical application in the rapid diagnosis of CDI.</p>

features and management of postoperative lumbar intervertebral space
infections following spinal endoscopy: a retrospective analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPostoperative lumbar intervertebral space infections
following spinal endoscopy are infrequent but severe complications that
can markedly affect patient recovery and treatment outcomes. Early
diagnosis remains challenging due to the nonspecific nature of clinical
symptoms. This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics, risk
factors, and effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for
postoperative intervertebral space infections.MethodsA retrospective
analysis was conducted on 14 cases of postoperative intervertebral space
infections following spinal endoscopy. The data set included patient
demographics, clinical symptoms, imaging findings, blood culture
results, and treatment approaches. The analysis assessed early diagnosis
and treatment outcomes concerning the infection’s progression and the
use of MRI, inflammatory markers, and empirical antibiotics.ResultsThe
most common clinical symptoms included localized back pain, neurological
deficits, and fever, though these lacked specificity. MRI proved
valuable in diagnosing early infections. The majority of cases exhibited
elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ESR. The
treatment plan included early surgical intervention with debridement and
internal fixation, along with extended antibiotic therapy.ConclusionThe
early identification and intervention of postoperative intervertebral
space infections following spinal endoscopy are of critical importance.
The implementation of a strict aseptic technique, the execution of
careful preoperative planning, and the timely use of MRI for diagnosis
are essential to the prevention and effective treatment of these
infections. This study underscores the necessity of a comprehensive
approach to minimize the risk of postoperative intervertebral space
infections and to enhance patient outcomes.</p>

urine cultures: reconciling contamination with the urobiome while
recognizing the pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Polymicrobial or mixed urine cultures of more than one predominant
microbe confound clinical urinary tract infection diagnosis. The current
College of American Pathologists clinical laboratory standard states
that a urine sample cultured with more than two isolates with &gt;10,000
colony forming units/ml is to be considered contaminated. However, the
presence of urinary sample bacteria in individuals without urinary
symptoms (referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria) is common especially
in older people and in pregnant individuals. Furthermore, the discovery
of an indigenous urinary microbiome (urobiome) in healthy humans
throughout life from shortly after birth to death conflicts with the
long-standing notion that urine derived from sterile filtered blood
should be sterile above the urethral sphincter. Polymicrobial infections
are not consistent with Koch’s postulates that a single pathogen is
causal for disease. In this review, we will discuss current standards of
contamination, how to reconcile the sterility of urine with the
existence of the urobiome, a history of polymicrobial infections, and
why re-examining current practices is essential for the practice of
medicine, improving quality of life, and potentially saving lives. </p>

3-year retrospective analysis of microbial species and key biomarkers
associated with wound infections in Shantou Hospital, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>A biomarker is an important indicator of a normal physiological or
pathological process, or a pharmacological response to a therapeutic
intervention. This retrospective study aimed to measure blood biomarkers
in wound patients, identify the microorganisms responsible for wound
infections and determine their drug susceptibility patterns at a
tertiary care hospital in China. The study was conducted between 2022
and 2024, including 279 patients. A total of 33 microbial species were
isolated using culture techniques, identified, and analyzed for their
antibiotic susceptibility. The organisms were predominantly
gram-positive (50.8%), with Staphylococcus aureus (80.2%) being the most
prevalent species. Among the gram-negative bacteria (41.2%), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (22.6%) was the most predominant species. Biomarkers such as
white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) values were higher than normal in most of
microbial species associated with wound infections. The WBC value in
gram-positive infections and the neutrophil and ESR values in fungal
infections were statistically significantly higher than the normal range
(p = 0.0002, p = 0.002, and p = 0.003, respectively). Albumin levels
were high value in P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae (0.48 and 0.56
respectively), while lymphocytes levels were the lowest value (-0.62) in
S. aureus. Resistance to at least one antibiotic was identified in 82.4%
of the isolates. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant microbes in
different wound infections is a significant concern in China. A health
awareness campaign, coupled with improved hygiene measures, should be
implemented to prevent the spread of microorganisms responsible for
wound infections within the community.</p>
