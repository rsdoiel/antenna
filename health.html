formation and role of other pathogenic factors in the virulence of
Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Medical device-associated infections represent a significant
healthcare challenge, as sterilization of the biomaterial often
necessitates device removal. The most frequently isolated microorganism
in these infections is Staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal
capable of causing a wide range of nosocomial infections. The primary
virulence factor of S. epidermidis is biofilm formation, which decreases
antibiotic efficacy and host immune response. However, additional
factors play crucial roles in infection establishment. Understanding the
interplay between virulence factors is essential to developing
preventive strategies that inhibit microbial adhesion and biofilm
development. In this study, we analyzed the presence of genes associated
with adhesion and biofilm formation (ica-dependent and ica-independent
pathways) in 25 clinical isolates of S. epidermidis and four control
strains: ATCC 12228, ATCC 35983, ATCC 35984, and the HAM 892 mutant.
Resistance profile was determined, and biofilm quantification and
composition of matrix was performed using multiple methodologies.
Additionally, parameters associated with initial adherence as cell
surface hydrophobicity (CSH) were investigated. A strong correlation was
observed among different methods for measuring biofilm formation and
matrix composition. The 14 icaADBC+ isolates exhibited higher prevalence
of the aap, bhp, mecA, and IS256 genes, with polysaccharide
intercellular adhesin (PIA) identified as the main matrix component. In
contrast, icaADBC− biofilm-producing strains formed biofilms rich in
other polysaccharides and proteins. The 15 non-biofilm-producing
isolates showed significantly higher hydrophobicity levels, suggesting
that this factor plays a critical role in initial adhesion and
colonization. This study highlights the diverse mechanisms underlying
biofilm formation in S. epidermidis and identifies hydrophobicity as a
potential pathogenicity factor contributing to its virulence.</p>

protein–protein ligation approaches for the cytosolic delivery of
antigens using AIP56</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe intracellular delivery of biologics, particularly
large cargoes like proteins, remains a challenge in biotechnology and
biomedicine. The modular structure of well-characterized AB toxins
allows different cargoes to be grafted, creating a target-specific
biotechnological tool capable of cytosolic delivery.MethodsIn this
study, we employed protein–protein fusion strategies—SpyCatcher003,
SnoopCatcher, and SnoopLigase—to generate chimeras between the delivery
region of AIP56 (AIP56L258-N497) and β-lactamase and performed
functional delivery assays.ResultsThe chimeras were successfully
obtained using these strategies and were all able to deliver β-lactamase
into the cytosol of J774.A1 macrophages. Cellular fractionation showed
that, although most of the β-lactamase remains associated with the
endosomal compartment, an active portion is released into the
cytosol.ConclusionAIP56 delivery region transporting other cargo
directly to the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells might be a promising
platform for antigen/cargo delivery. This study highlights the potential
of protein–protein fusion strategies to create versatile, antigenically
distinct toxin-based delivery systems for therapeutic applications.</p>

field investigations revealing natural exposure of one-humped dromedary
camels (Camelus dromedarius) to foot-and-mouth disease virus in
India</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most significant animal
diseases globally, affecting over 60 susceptible species including
camelids particularly Bactrian camels. In order to gather baseline
evidence on the current status of FMD in Indian camels, a preliminary
random serosurvey was conducted in camels of Rajasthan state with
significant camel population. A total of 777 sera collected from
one-humped dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) across 11 districts of
Rajasthan during 2016–2017 were screened for FMD virus (FMDV) 3ABC
nonstructural protein (NSP)-antibodies using the commercial PrioCHECK®
FMDV NS kit. The sera were further tested using in-house liquid phase
blocking (LPB) ELISA to evaluate the level of protective structural
protein (SP)-antibody responses against three vaccine strains of FMDV
serotypes O, A and Asia 1 if any. Out of 777 serum samples, 117 (15.05%;
95% Confidence Interval: 12.6%-17.7%) tested positive for 3ABC
NSP-antibodies indicating the exposure of camels to FMDV. However, none
of the sera tested in LPB ELISA showed a protective log10 antibody titre
of ≥1.8 against any of the three FMDV serotypes confirming the absence
of vaccination in these animals. This report provides retrospective
evidence of anti-FMDV antibody response in dromedaries in India.
Nevertheless, the role of dromedaries in epidemiology and transmission
of FMDV remains unclear, emphasizing the need for further extensive
serological screening of a larger number of samples. To the best of our
knowledge, the present study, although preliminary, seems to be the
first of its kind reporting the evidence of anti-FMDV antibody response
in dromedaries in India.</p>

flexible peptide linking the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains of MxiG
controls type III secretion signaling and stable sorting platform
assembly in Shigella</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Shigella flexneri uses its type III secretion system (T3SS) to invade
human enterocytes. The T3SS injectisome is controlled by proteins at the
tip of an exposed needle that sense host cell contact. Substrate
selection and powering of secretion is controlled by a cytoplasmic
assembly called the sorting platform (SP). The Shigella SP possesses six
pod structures linked to a central ATPase via radial spokes. The SP
associates with the injectisome inner membrane ring (IR) via the adaptor
protein MxiK. The major IR component is MxiG, whose globular periplasmic
domain (MxiGP) packs with MxiJ in a 24-fold symmetry. MxiG also has a
transmembrane helix attached to a small cytoplasmic domain (MxiGC) via a
flexible linker peptide. Change from the IR’s 24-fold symmetry to
six-fold symmetry for the SP in Shigella occurs via MxiGC pairs that
associate with MxiK. The intervening pairs shift to the center of the
IR/SP assembly, which is distinct from what is seen for Salmonella. This
implicates the linker in dynamic motions at the IR-SP interface, but the
functional importance of the linker is unknown. Using a library of
mutants, we found that the linker can accept diverse mutations without
eliminating injectisome function. However, some mutants were found to
give rise to subpopulations able to form needles and secrete effectors
in the absence of a stably assembled SP. Mutants lacking the entire
linker could not secrete any effector proteins (e.g. the IpaD tip
protein) and had no T3SS-related virulence functions, however, there
were subpopulations that could still secrete MxiH and assemble visible
needles. In contrast, a very short linker could export IpaD to the
needle tip, but could not rapidly respond to external secretion signals
and were thus unable to quickly enter epithelial cells. These findings
implicate the MxiG linker in signaling processes that are sensed at the
needle tip. Our findings suggest that the native MxiG linker peptide has
evolved to maximize T3SS function at steps beyond needle formation,
while needle formation can occur even when the SP is highly
destabilized.</p>

vaginal microecology and infection epidemiology among premenopausal and
postmenopausal gynecologic outpatients: a cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPostmenopausal estrogen deficiency disrupts vaginal
microecological balance. This cross-sectional study investigates the
epidemiology of vaginal infections and alterations in microbiota
composition, enzymes, and metabolites among premenopausal and
postmenopausal gynecologic outpatients.MethodsThe study analyzed the
vaginal microecology data from 27,346 women who underwent examinations
at Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital between 2018 and 2023.
Parameters including vaginal cleanliness, bacterial density, and
diversity were systematically evaluated. Additionally, a total of 20
participants (10 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal women) were
enrolled for nontargeted LC-MS metabolomic analysis through stratified
random sampling.ResultsThe population comprised 22,525 (82.4%)
premenopausal women (18–44 years), 3,456 (12.6%) transitioning women
(45–55 years), and 1,365 (5.0%) postmenopausal women (&gt;55 years). In
mixed infections, BV + VVC co-infections predominated (1264/2766,
45.7%). Postmenopausal women showed significantly higher BV prevalence
(22.8% vs. 17.9%, P &lt; 0.001) and AV (24.8% vs. 4.6%, P &lt; 0.001),
but lower rates of VVC (1.2% vs. 8.2%, P &lt; 0.001). In postmenopausal
women, BV-associated biomarkers (including clue cells and sialidase
activity) and inflammatory markers (such as pus cells and leukocyte
esterase activity) were concurrently elevated. Metabolomic analysis
identified elevated chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate levels
alongside reduced O-phosphothreonine, morpholine, and
diethanolamine.ConclusionAge significantly influences vaginal
microecology, altering infection epidemiology, microbiota, enzymes, and
metabolites. Accounting for these age-related estrogen changes in
clinical interventions is critical for effective management.</p>

novel YGGT family protein is localized in the apicoplast and is
essential for the organelle inheritance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite.
Most apicomplexan parasites contain an endosymbiont-derived organelle
called the apicoplast. This organelle is critical for the survival of
parasites because it plays a role in several essential metabolic
pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining the
apicoplast have not been well understood. In this study, we investigated
the function of an apicoplast-residing protein called TgYCAP in the
inheritance of the apicoplast. Our results showed that conditional
knockdown of TgYCAP severely inhibited the growth of the parasite and
disrupted the inheritance of the apicoplast. In addition, the YGGT
domain is essential for its function in the apicoplast.</p>

rs3775291 C/T polymorphism is associated with elevated IFN-α level in
asymptomatic HTLV-1 infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAlterations in the immune response may influence the
development of HTLV-1-associated diseases. TLR3 detects viral nucleic
acids, including HTLV-1, and triggers the production of IFN-I and other
cytokines. Genetic variations in TLR3 may alter the antiviral and
inflammatory responses and contribute to the progression of HTLV-1
infection. The present study investigated the association of
polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene (rs5743305 T/A and rs3775291 C/T) with
HTLV-1 infection status and their relationship with infection-associated
diseases, receptor expression levels, proviral load, and inflammatory
and antiviral cytokines.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 179
individuals with HTLV-1 infection (82 with inflammatory diseases and 97
asymptomatic individuals) and 179 controls. Genotyping of polymorphisms,
analysis of TLR3 gene expression, and quantification of proviral load
were performed by real-time PCR, and cytokine levels were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).ResultsThe polymorphisms
showed no correlation with susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection, or the
occurrence of disease symptoms linked to the infection. The presence of
disease symptoms was associated with higher TNF-α levels and proviral
load. TLR3 rs5743305 T/A polymorphism was not associated with variations
in TLR3 and IFN-α levels. For the TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism,
asymptomatic individuals carrying the TT polymorphic genotype presented
significantly higher IFN-α levels and lower proviral load. The profile
of asymptomatic individuals carrying the polymorphic genotypes for TLR3
rs3775291 C/T was characterized by higher levels of TLR3 and IFN-α and
lower levels of proviral load, TNF-α and IL-6 compared to those with the
wild-type genotype.ConclusionAlthough polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene
have not been associated with the presence of symptoms of HTLV-1-related
inflammatory diseases, the TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism appears to
contribute to a better evolution of the HTLV-1 infection status and
inflammatory process among asymptomatic individuals.</p>

the elimination of infectious HPV: exploiting CRISPR/Cas
innovations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>HPV has been conclusively associated with various human malignancies,
making the development of prevention and treatment strategies for
HPV-induced diseases a high priority. Currently, primary prevention
methods include HPV immunization and routine screening, which
significantly reduce the risk of HPV transmission. However, for patients
diagnosed with invasive, advanced, or recurrent malignancies,
non-virus-specific therapies frequently lead to drug resistance and
adverse effects, resulting in minimal improvement in treatment efficacy
for numerous patients. Viral genome-targeting therapy is emerging as a
promising avenue for the future management of HPV infections. With the
rapid advancement of genetic modification technologies, the CRISPR/Cas
system has demonstrated significant potential in treating viral
infections. Its ability to selectively target and edit viral genomes for
elimination positions it as a highly effective approach for combating
HPV. This review will explore the functions and applications of the
CRISPR/Cas system as an innovative therapy for HPV. We will illustrate
the prospective efficacy of CRISPR/Cas as a groundbreaking and promising
cure for HPV infections, while also addressing the opportunities and
challenges associated with this novel approach.</p>
