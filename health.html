metabolic reprogramming modulates cytokine networks in nucleos(t)ide
analogue-treated chronic hepatitis B patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background &amp; aimsHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a
global health challenge. Tryptophan metabolism influences immune
regulation, but its interplay with cytokines during antiviral therapy is
unclear. We investigated associations between tryptophan pathways and
cytokine profiles in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with varying
treatment outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 106 CHB
patients (including 29 functional cure cases) receiving nucleos(t)ide
analogues (NAs) and 29 healthy controls. Plasma levels of 20 tryptophan
metabolites (kynurenine, serotonin, and bacterial pathways) were
quantified by HPLC-MS/MS, and 12 cytokines were measured via flow
cytometry. Multivariate analyses were performed.ResultsFunctional cure
patients showed unique metabolic patterns. Indole-3-carboxaldehyde
(IAld) levels increased progressively from HBsAg positive groups
(HBeAg-: 63.324 nmol/L; HBeAg+: 65.938 nmol/L) to functional cure (91.44
nmol/L) and healthy controls (130.634 nmol/L) (P &lt; 0.01), exhibiting
negative correlations with HBsAg (r = -0.31) and IFN-γ (r = -0.53) but
positive correlation with IL-1β (r = 0.47). Picolinic acid (PA) was
significantly elevated in the functional cure group (P &lt; 0.001),
associated with reduced HBsAg, IL-2 and increased IL-1β, IL-10 levels,
indicating potential antiviral effects. Serotonin (5-HT) levels were
higher in cured patients and correlated with IL-1β and IFN-α (P &lt;
0.05). HBeAg-positive patients displayed increased
kynurenine-to-tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratios (P &lt; 0.05), while non-cured
patients showed metabolic blockade downstream of 3-hydroxykynurenine
(elevated 3-HK/Kyn ratios and reduced KA, XA/3-HK, 3-HAA/3-HK, and NAA
levels; P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsThe tryptophan metabolites (IAld, PA,
5-HT) were found to correlate with cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-10),
potentially implicating their involvement in immune regulation and
antiviral responses. These observations delineate a metabolic-immune
framework that may inform future therapeutic development for HBV.</p>
