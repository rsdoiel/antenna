microbiota and metabolite features in NSCLC nude mouse models of
subcutaneous tumor and leptomeningeal metastasis: a
microbiome-metabolome combined analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer are both
elevated. In lung cancer, leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a serious
consequence. Patients suffering from LM have severe symptoms and a short
survival time. Numerous studies have shown a connection between the
prognosis of lung cancer and the composition of the gut microbiota.
However, Current knowledge regarding the gut microbiota and metabolites
in lung cancer patients with LM, as well as their potential impacts on
LM pathogenesis, remains remarkably limited.MethodWe established a mouse
model of LM from lung cancer and a subcutaneous metastatic model, using
wild-type mice as controls. Each of the three groups above contained six
mice. We examined the fecal microbiota and metabolites of three groups
of mice utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. Conducting
correlation analysis on microbiome and metabolome data concurrently to
identify significant relationships.ResultMice with LM had a different
gut microbiota and metabolite composition than wild-type and
subcutaneous metastatic mice; the LM group had a higher ratio of
Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Differential metabolites are primarily seen
in pathways such as Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, Tryptophan
metabolism; Association analysis reveals that some changes in gut
microbiota are linked to metabolites, such as a positive association
between Eubacteria and N-Acetylsorotonin.ConclusionSome microbiota and
metabolites may act as biomarkers for LM, controlling gut microbiota and
metabolites or giving a novel option for research into lung cancer
leptomeningeal metastases.</p>

id="risk-factors-for-identifying-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-pediatric-patients">Risk
factors for identifying pulmonary aspergillosis in pediatric
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to identify the independent risk factors
and develop a predictive model for pulmonary aspergillosis (PA) in
pediatric populations.MethodsThis retrospective study compromised 97
pediatric patients with pulmonary infections (38 PA cases and 59 non-PA
cases) at Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University between
January 2020 and October 2024. Multivariate binary logistic regression
was used to identify PA-associated risk factors. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and Brier scoring were
used to evaluate the diagnostic model.Results8 clinical variables
significantly differed between the PA and non-PA groups. Multivariate
binary logistic regression analysis identified six significant
independent risk factors: a history of surgery (OR: 9.52; 95% CI:
1.96–46.23; P = 0.005), hematologic diseases (OR: 11.68; 95% CI:
0.89–153.62; P = 0.062), absence of fever (OR: 8.244; 95% CI:
1.84–36.932; P = 0.006), viral coinfection (OR: 15.99; 95% CI:
3.55–72.00; P &lt; 0.001), elevated (1, 3) -β -D-glucan levels (BDG,
&gt; 61.28 pg/mL; OR: 7.38; 95% CI: 1.26–43.31; P = 0.027), and shorter
symptom-to-admission interval (&lt; 4.5 days; OR: 38.68; 95% CI:
5.38–277.94; P &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for PA. The predictive
model demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98)
and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=0.606, R²=0.96, Brier score 0.097).
metagenomic next - generation sequencing (mNGS) revealed significantly
higher rates of polymicrobial infections in PA cases (86.84% vs 18.64%,
p&lt;0.001).ConclusionsThis study established and validated a
high-performance predictive model incorporating six clinically
accessible parameters for the diagnosis of pediatric PA.</p>

predicts poor prognosis in pediatric macrolides-unresponsive Mycoplasma
pneumoniae pneumonia with A2063/2064G mutations treated with
azithromycin</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate prognostic indicators for pediatric
macrolides-unresponsive Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MUMPP) cases
with A2063/2064G mutations with azithromycin therapy.MethodsThis was a
retrospective observational cohort study conducted at the Children’s
Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Children with
macrolide-resistant mutations (A2063/2064G) diagnosed as MUMPP who
received only anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) treatment with
azithromycin were retrospectively enrolled. Logistic regression analysis
was used to identify potential risk factors for predicting short-term
(refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia [RMPP]) and long-term
(bronchiolitis obliterans [BO] or bronchiectasis) adverse prognosis. The
results were visualized using forest plots.ResultsThis study
retrospectively included 82 children with MUMPP, and all received only
azithromycin for anti-MP treatment. The incidence of pulmonary
consolidation, pleural effusion, and atelectasis was 80.49% (66/82),
34.15% (28/82), and 24.39% (20/82), respectively. 29.27% (24/82) of
patients diagnosed with RMPP, and 14.63% (12/82) of patients diagnosed
with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) or bronchiectasis diagnosed within
one year after discharge. Logistic analysis showed that atelectasis was
independently associated with short-term (RMPP) and long-term (BO or
bronchiectasis) adverse prognosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.02, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.03-16.00, P = 0.043; OR 5.62, 95% CI 1.04-32.80, P =
0.045; respectively).ConclusionAtelectasis predicts a poor prognosis for
children with A2063/2064G MUMPP. The occurrence of atelectasis may
indicate an increased risk of failure of current azithromycin treatment.
Combined with the results of drug-resistant mutations, it is recommended
to strengthen disease monitoring and individualized intervention
evaluation.</p>

id="the-alternations-of-gut-microbiota-in-diabetic-kidney-disease-insights-from-a-triple-comparative-cohort">The
alternations of gut microbiota in diabetic kidney disease: insights from
a triple comparative cohort</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDiabetic kidney disease (DKD) exhibits heterogeneous
progression, implicating factors beyond hyperglycemia, such as gut
microbiota dysbiosis. However, microbial distinctions among
biopsy-confirmed pure DKD, DKD with non-diabetic renal disease
(DKD+NDRD), and long-term diabetes without nephropathy (DM) remain
unclear. This study aimed to identify gut microbial and functional
biomarkers differentiating these groups.MethodsWe enrolled 40
biopsy-confirmed participants classified into DKD (n=26), DM (n=8), and
DKD+NDRD (n=6) groups. Gut microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA
sequencing. Microbial diversity, composition, and functional prediction
(PICRUSt2 analysis) were compared among groups. Biomarkers were
identified using LEfSe analysis.ResultsNo significant differences in
alpha-diversity (Chao1, Shannon indices) or beta-diversity (PCoA/PCA)
were observed among groups. Taxonomic analysis revealed distinct
microbial signatures: DKD patients showed enrichment of Olsenella and
reduced Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a short-chain fatty acid
producer), while DM patients exhibited higher Roseburia and
Flavonifractor. The DKD+NDRD group was uniquely enriched in
Prevotella_9. Functional prediction highlighted elevated pyruvate
metabolism and bacterial toxin pathways in DKD, contrasting with
enhanced linoleic acid metabolism in DM and attenuated endotoxin-related
pathways in DKD+NDRD.ConclusionsThis study delineates gut microbiota
profiles and functional shifts across DKD, DM, and DKD+NDRD. Key taxa
(Olsenella, Prevotella_9) and metabolic pathways (pyruvate, toxin
production) may serve as biomarkers for DKD progression and differential
diagnosis. The findings underscore the gut-kidney axis’s role in DKD
pathogenesis and suggest microbiota-targeted interventions for precision
management. Further validation in larger cohorts is warranted.</p>

id="the-inhibitory-effects-of-7nd-protein-on-osteoclast-differentiation-in-apical-periodontitis">The
inhibitory effects of 7ND protein on osteoclast differentiation in
apical periodontitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundApical periodontitis (AP) is a highly prevalent
inflammatory condition that affects the tissue surrounding the apex of a
tooth root. 7ND protein, a mutant form of monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1), functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of MCP-1.
Previous studies have shown that 7ND protein can suppress osteoclast
differentiation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting its
potential to prevent inflammatory bone destruction. However, whether 7ND
protein can inhibit AP-induced osteolysis remains unknown.MethodsTo
investigate the effects of 7ND protein on osteoclast differentiation, we
utilized RAW264.7 macrophage cells and an AP rat model. Western blotting
analysis was employed to assess MCP-1 expression in RAW264.7 cells
treated with 7ND protein. The impact of 7ND protein on osteoclast
formation was evaluated both in vitro (using RAW264.7 cells) and in vivo
(in AP rats). Additionally, X-ray imaging and micro-computed tomography
were used to compare the lesion volume and area in the periapical
regions of AP rats treated with 7ND protein versus those treated with
PBS.ResultsWestern blotting analysis revealed that 7ND protein reduced
MCP-1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophage cells without affecting their
proliferation. Furthermore, 7ND protein significantly inhibited
osteoclast formation in both RAW264.7 cells and AP rats. In AP rats
treated with 7ND protein, X-ray imaging and micro-computed tomography
demonstrated a significant decrease in lesion volume and area in the
periapical regions compared to AP rats treated with PBS.ConclusionOur
study demonstrates that 7ND protein has the potential to inhibit
osteoclast differentiation and reduce bone loss associated with apical
periodontitis. These findings suggest that 7ND protein may serve as a
valuable therapeutic option for the treatment of AP-related
osteolysis.</p>

boundaries between PML and PML-IRIS: difficult to define, pathology may
predict</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by
John Cunningham (JC) virus reactivation, represents a critical
neurological complication in AIDS-related immunosuppression. This
single-center study conducted a clinicopathological analysis of 19
confirmed PML cases in an AIDS cohort (16 biopsy; 3 surgical specimens),
employing comprehensive neuropathological evaluation.
Immunohistochemical testing included SV40, NF, NeuN, P53, Ki-67, GFAP,
Oligo-2, and CD68. Myelin architecture was evaluated through Luxol fast
blue staining, complemented by molecular diagnostics incorporating
quantitative JC viral load PCR and metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS).ResultsNotably, 63.2% (12/19) of them had blood CD4+
T-cell counts &lt; 200 cells/μl, and 36.8% (7/19) had ≥ 200 cells/μl.
52.9% (9/17) of the patients had elevated CSF protein, 5.3% (1/19) had
decreased CSF glucose. Statistical analysis revealed significant
correlations between mass effect and both blood CD4+ T-cell counts (P =
0.022) and CSF protein levels (P &lt; 0.001). It also demonstrated
significant positive correlations between the duration of HIV diagnosis
and the degree of inflammatory infiltration (P = 0.038) and perivascular
inflammatory infiltration (P = 0.005), as well as plasma cell
infiltration (P = 0.011). The degree of inflammatory infiltration was
significantly positively correlated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (P
= 0.036). The degree of inflammatory infiltration, the presence of
plasma cells, and perivascular lymphocytic cuffing were significantly
associated with contrast enhancement on imaging studies (P = 0.044, P =
0.011, and P = 0.018, respectively). These cases display characteristics
that deviate from the classic PML previously reported, exhibiting a
tendency towards MRI enhancement and histologically indicating a more
severe inflammatory response, especially for patients following ART
treatment.ConclusionOur findings suggest that PML and PML-immune
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) represent a continuous
pathological spectrum, potentially bridged by an intermediate stage with
distinct clinicopathological features. This transitional phase may
constitute a critical link in the continuum between classic PML and
fully developed PML-IRIS. Importantly, it implicates synergistic
mechanisms of viral oncogenesis and immune reconstitution, which could
redefine therapeutic strategies for this emerging PML variant.</p>

microbiota dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease: interaction with
intestinal barriers and microbiota-targeted treatment options</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Recent studies have deepened our understanding on gut microbiota
alterations and the interaction with intestinal barrier impairments,
which play a crucial role in the etiology and pathophysiology of
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in
IBD including the altered microbiota composition, decreased beneficial
species and increased harmful species. The disturbed gut microbiota
results in the aggravation of intestinal barrier dysfunction through
regulation of antimicrobial substances in mucus layer, tight junction
protein in mechanical layer and inflammatory response in immune layer.
The therapeutic options targeted on the microbiota including
antibiotics, probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
exhibit efficacies and limitations in the treatment of IBD. Reasonable
single or combined use of these treatments can restore intestinal
microecological homeostasis, which further contributes to the treatment
of IBD. This review analyzes the underlying mechanisms for the
interaction between microbiota alterations and gut barrier dysfunction
in IBD; meanwhile, it provides new insights into the microbiota-targeted
therapeutic options IBD, including the benefits, risks and limitations
of antibiotic and probiotic therapies, unresolved clinical application
strategies for FMT, and combination administrations of antibiotics and
FMT.</p>

the devil you know: sympatric fish host copes better than allopatric
with a myxozoan parasite</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ceratomyxosis due to the myxozoan parasite Ceratonova shasta affects
salmonids, causing severe enteritis leading to hemorrhaging and
necrosis. The waterborne parasite stages penetrate host gills and reach
the fish intestine through the bloodstream. Steelhead trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations from C. shasta endemic watersheds
(sympatric) are less susceptible than populations from non-endemic
watersheds (allopatric). We investigated the immune effectors behind
these different susceptibilities. Both steelhead trout strains were
exposed to C. shasta genotype 0. Intestinal tissue and serum samples of
control and exposed sympatric and allopatric fish were taken at 8, 15,
22, 29, 57, and 183 days post exposure. Gills were taken at 1 and 8 days
post exposure. Parasite abundance and histopathology were evaluated on
tissue sections of fish that tested PCR+ for the parasite. Zap70+ T
cells, IgT+ B cells, and IgD+ B cells were quantified, and the presence
of specific IgM was evaluated from fish sera by immunohistochemistry.
Parasite counts were significantly lower and limited to a shorter
duration in sympatric fish. The initial intestinal inflammatory response
in both fish strains was characterized by hyperplasia of the lamina
propria–submucosa and epithelial infiltration of lymphocytes.
Remarkably, hyperplasia was resolved earlier in sympatric fish, whereas
in allopatric fish, hyperplasia was not resolved by the end of the
experiment, coinciding with high intestinal parasite counts and
sporogenesis. An increase of intestinal Zap70+ T cells occurred before
IgT+ B cells peaked, earlier in sympatric than in allopatric fish. Low
numbers of intestinal IgD+ B cells were detected in both strains. In
gills, an early increase of Zap70+ T cells was observed in both fish
strains at 1 day post exposure, and an increase of IgD+ B cells occurred
only in the allopatric strain. Specific circulating IgM was detected
much later in both fish strains, only at 57 and 183 days post exposure.
In conclusion, sympatric steelhead trout restricted intestinal
proliferation of C. shasta genotype 0 more effectively than allopatric
fish, probably due to an earlier T cell response triggering a stronger
IgT-based mucosal adaptive response in the intestine. Specific
circulating IgM appeared later in both sympatric and allopatric fish,
probably also contributing systemic protection.</p>

intersection of Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer: signaling
pathways and molecular mechanisms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is widely recognized as a potent risk
factor for gastric adenocarcinoma, although only a small percentage of
infected individuals develop malignancy. Recent advances have provided
insights into how H. pylori contributes to gastric tumorigenesis through
the modulation of inflammation, DNA damage, and cellular junctions via
shared host cell targets and signaling pathways. A thorough examination
of the signaling pathways altered by H. pylori infection could
facilitate the discovery of previously unidentified infectious causes of
cancer. This, in turn, would support the development of preventive
strategies for H. pylori-related gastric malignancies by understanding
the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. This review highlights
recent advancements in understanding how H. pylori influences host cell
signaling pathways to impact inflammation, genomic stability, abnormal
cell proliferation, and other biological processes that promote the
onset and progression of gastric cancer.</p>

monitoring of Aspergillus infections in chronic lung disease patients: a
combined serology and HRCT imaging approach</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDiagnosing Aspergillus infections in patients with chronic
pulmonary diseases is challenging, particularly in settings where
invasive diagnostic tools are limited. This study explores a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, combining serological tests and
high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging, to identify patients
who may need further invasive evaluation for Aspergillus
infection.MethodsThis retrospective study included patients with chronic
pulmonary diseases from regional centers who experienced acute
exacerbations that did not respond to antibacterial therapy, had
positive sputum cultures for Aspergillus species, and lacked typical
invasive radiological features on HRCT. Patients were classified based
on clinical data, HRCT imaging, and serological markers (IgG, IgM,
galactomannan) to distinguish between Aspergillus colonization and
clinically diagnosed active infection.ResultsOf the 2,731 patients
assessed, 209 met the study criteria: 112 were identified with
Aspergillus colonization, and 97 with clinically diagnosed Aspergillus
infection. Patients with active infection had significantly higher
Aspergillus -specific IgG levels (median 185.47 IU/mL vs. 59.96 IU/mL,
p&lt;0.001) and higher galactomannan indices, especially those with
invasive infection (p&lt;0.001). HRCT scores were strongly correlated
with the risk of infection. The combination of IgG levels and HRCT
scores achieved an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.9 for differentiating
infection from colonization and 0.74 for distinguishing different types
of Aspergillus infections.ConclusionThis study supports the use of a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, combining serological testing and HRCT
imaging, to identify patients with chronic lung diseases who have
positive sputum cultures for Aspergillus and are highly suspected of
active infection, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and chronic
pulmonary aspergillosis, for further invasive diagnostic evaluation.
This method is particularly useful in patients who experience frequent
acute exacerbations and are unwilling or unable to undergo invasive
diagnostic procedures, helping clinicians identify those who really
require further definitive evaluation and thereby reducing unnecessary
antifungal treatment.Clinical trial

trivalent candidate vaccine elicits broad humoral and cellular immunity
against pneumococcal pneumonia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen causing public
health problems worldwide. Existing pneumococcal vaccines provide
protection against only a few of the more than 100 pneumococcal
serotypes, highlighting the urgent need for new preventive strategies.
Pneumococcal protein vaccines have attracted considerable attention
owing to their favorable immunogenicity and antigen conservation, and
have demonstrated protective potential against non-serotype-dependent
infections. Mice immunized with a trivalent vaccine targeting protein
PepN, PepO, and SPD_1609 elicited a robust humoral immune response, as
well as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cellular immune responses. The antiserum
derived from the trivalent vaccine significantly inhibited Streptococcus
pneumoniae adhesion to A549 cells, reduced pneumococcal colonization in
the nasopharynx, and improved lung tissue damage and inflammatory
responses compared to the monovalent or bivalent vaccine group. In terms
of in vivo protection, the trivalent vaccine significantly increased the
survival rate of infected mice. The findings suggest that the trivalent
vaccine targeting PepN, PepO, and SPD_1609 is a promising multivalent
vaccine candidate against Streptococcus pneumoniae.</p>

pathobiology of oral diseases. S. mutans is considered to be a major
pathogen in the development of dental caries. It is often found to
interact with C. albicans in oral infection settings. The interaction of
these organisms is often mediated via the binding of Glucosyltransferase
(GtfB) enzyme secreted by S. mutans to C. albicans surface proteins Als1
and Hwp1. During these interactions, both C. albicans and S. mutans
exhibit increased gene regulatory activity, leading to the modulation of
virulence attributes and adaptation to environmental changes. This
results in the strong attachment of the species to tooth surfaces and
increased resistance of the mixed species biofilms to external factors.
Mechanistically, intercellular communication between these species in
mixed biofilms through quorum sensing and production of exoenzymes such
as glucosyltransferases account for the synergy and modulation of their
virulence attributes. Specifically, these mixed-species biofilms exhibit
increased acid production and enhanced resistance to antimicrobial
agents. Understanding these complex interkingdom pattern of interactions
is essential to develop efficient therapeutic approaches against
biofilm-associated oral infections. The review also highlights probiotic
strategies to interfere with these interkingdom interactions to combat
oral diseases like early childhood caries (ECC).</p>

a key player in microbiome dynamics and cancer pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The human microbiome refers to the genomic content of microorganisms
inhabiting the human body, including the lungs, oral cavity, intestinal
tract, esophagus, and other areas. The human oral microbiota is a
diverse and complex ecosystem that includes bacteria, microeukaryotes,
archaea, and viruses. These communities have a highly structured
biogeography resulting from the various microenvironments in the oral
cavity, shaping local metabolic exchange. Dietary nitrate (NO3-) is an
ion naturally present in vegetables, especially leafy greens. When
consumed, it leads to the production of nitric oxide (NO). This
bioactive molecule benefits bodily functions like host defense and
neuronal communication and improves vascular and metabolic health.
Dietary NO3- is reduced to NO via the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway,
facilitated by nitrate-reducing bacteria inside the oral cavity. NO has
a leading role in different types of diseases, including cancer,
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The bioavailability of NO is
greatly enhanced by the activity of bacteria residing in the mouth,
which reduces NO3-to NO2- and increases the concentration of circulating
NO2-. NO is the key to causing different malignancies, including
gastrointestinal cancers. NO can cause cell death by inducing DNA damage
and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. Low to moderate levels of NO
derived from tumors can activate angiogenesis and promote an invasive
phenotype, while high levels of NO may have an anti-tumor effect in
protecting against cancer. In this review, we intend to discuss the
human microbiome, dietary NO3-consumption, the vital role of NO in the
human body, types of cancers, and treatments based on it.</p>

burden of urinary tract infections in older women from 1990 to 2021 with
projections to 2040: a trend analysis of the Global Burden of Disease
Study 2021</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundComprehensive estimations regarding the worldwide burden of
urinary tract infections (UTIs) in older women aged ≥ 65 years are
lacking. This study first explored the trends in the burden of UTIs
among older women from 1990 to 2021 with projections to 2040.MethodsThe
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021
analytical tool was adopted to calculate the age-standardized incidence
rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and
age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rate (ASDR). We
applied the Joinpoint regression analysis to examine the overall trends
by calculating the average annual percentage change. In addition, the
trends were further stratified by age group, sociodemographic index, and
geographic region. Predictive analysis was employed to make further
estimations of the burden until 2040.ResultsThe global ASIR of UTIs
among older women remained stable between 1990 and 2021, while the ASMR
and ASDR increased substantially during the same period. Moreover, the
prediction analysis showed that although the ASIR in older women was
projected to decline, the number of incident cases, deaths, and DALYs
was forecasted to continue rising. Regionally, in 2021, South Asia
experienced the greatest number of incident cases, deaths, and DALYs,
and Tropical Latin America had the highest ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR. Between
1990 and 2021, we found Southern Latin America exhibited the largest
regional-level increase in the ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR. At the national
level, significant disparities in the burden of UTIs among older women
were identified in different countries and
territories.ConclusionAlthough the ASIR of UTIs among older women has
remained stable over the past three decades, the annual number of
incident cases, deaths, and DALYs from UTIs has increased substantially.
During the same period, a significant upward trend was found in the
UTIs-related ASMR and ASDR. With population growth and aging, the burden
of UTIs is expected to keep rising in the coming years. These findings
can provide valuable perspectives on the distribution and magnitude
relating to the burden of UTIs and promote equity in health
outcomes.</p>

the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)
Moench] phenolic extracts on liver abscess causing bacterial
pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLiver abscesses that occur in finishing cattle fed
high-grain, low-roughage diets, are of significant economic concern to
the feedlot industry. The causative agents include both Fusobacterium
necrophorum subspecies (necrophorum and funduliforme), Trueperella
pyogenes, and Salmonella enterica serotype Lubbock. Tylosin, a macrolide
antibiotic, is supplemented in the feed to reduce liver abscesses.
Because of the concern with emergence of potential antimicrobial
resistance, there is a need to find antibiotic alternatives. The aim of
our study was to investigate the efficacy of phenolic compounds
extracted from black and brown sumac sorghum extracts on liver abscess
causing bacterial pathogens.MethodsPhenolic compounds were extracted by
75% aqueous acetone and total phenolic content was determined
spectrophotometrically. Muller-Hinton broth (for S. enterica and T.
pyogenes), and anaerobic Brain–Heart infusion broth (for Fusobacterium)
with and without sorghum extracts (1 mg GAE/mL) were used. Growth was
measured at 24 and 48 hours to determine bacterial concentration.
Micro-broth dilution method was used to quantify growth inhibition.
ResultsPlant based phenolic compounds have the potential to be an
antibiotic alternative to control liver abscesses. Sorghum [Sorghum
bicolor (L.) Moench] grain phenolic compounds, have the potential to be
one of these alternatives. DiscussionOur study demonstrated that the
phenolic extracts of black and brown sumac sorghum exhibited
antibacterial activities against the liver abscesses causing pathogens
including both subspecies of F. necrophorum and T. pyogenes in a dose
dependent manner, but not S. enterica. Sorghum phenolic compounds have
the potential to be supplemented in the cattle feed to control liver
abscesses.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The association between viral infections and asthma has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Accumulating evidence suggests
that viral infections can trigger asthma exacerbations, while asthma may
also influence the susceptibility to viral infections, thereby creating
a cycle of worsening symptoms and recurrent asthma attacks. Given that
asthma is predominantly driven by Type 2 immune responses and viral
infections are typically associated with Type 1 immune responses, the
innate immune cells and cytokines that participate in both conditions
appear to be the critical bridge connecting these two processes. In
particular, innate immune cells play a pivotal role in modulating the
immune response at the interface of viral infections and asthma. In this
review, we summarize the key innate immune cells and cytokines involved
in viral infections and asthma, highlighting their immunoregulatory
mechanisms. We aim to provide novel perspectives and potential
therapeutic directions for the clinical management of recurrent asthma
attacks induced by viral infections.</p>

<p>A description of the construction of the bioengineered P4-EKORhE and
a comprehensive method for producing very high yields (up to 1012
particles per millilitre) enable the use of virus-like particles to
transduce genetically encoded antimicrobials through a combination of
synthetic biology and optimised upstream and downstream processing. The
final product, a gene-delivered antimicrobial in the form of the
multi-lysin cassette, is fully functional before and after packaging
within P4-EKORhE particles. The antimicrobial activity of the
multi-lysin cassette, characterised by its lysis proteins, was tested in
vivo in both pure bacterial Escherichia coli cultures and a model of
phage infection in co-culture with A549 immortalised human epithelial
tissue cells. This work exemplifies several bioproduction methods and
demonstrates how the virology of the P4 and P2 phages can be harnessed
to establish a bioprocess for producing transducing particles at very
high yields, avoiding contamination by the natural virus while
maintaining the antimicrobial effectiveness of the final product.</p>

against mycobacteria</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>With the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the development of novel
anti-mycobacterial agents has become urgent. In this study, a
curcumin-cinnamon essential oil (Cur-CEO) nanoemulsion was developed
with optimized preparation parameters, including a 10% CEO volume
fraction, 7.5 minutes of ultrasonic treatment, and 350 W ultrasound
power, yielding a particle size of 101.14 nm. The nanoemulsion
demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency (90.2%) and stability, with a
stability coefficient of 0.984. Structural analysis revealed a dense
network structure of the nanoemulsion and amorphous forms of Cur and
CEO, enhanced by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, which
improved solubility and bioavailability. The Cur-CEO nanoemulsion
exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against mycobacteria,
demonstrating MIC values of 2 µg/mL and 0.25 µg/mL against Mycobacterium
smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, respectively, representing a fourfold
reduction compared to the CEO solution alone, owing to its ability to
induce substantial damage to mycobacterial cell membranes and
consequently enhance nucleic acid and protein leakage. Furthermore, the
aerosol form of the nanoemulsion effectively inhibited both surface and
airborne mycobacteria, with no significant changes in structural
properties post-atomization. Lung deposition studies indicated that
75.6% of aerosol particles of the nanoemulsion reached the alveolar
region, suggesting its potential as an inhalation agent. Additionally,
the Cur-CEO nanoemulsion exhibited negligible effects on macrophage
viability, maintaining a survival rate exceeding 85% even at
concentrations up to 1250 ng/mL. These findings indicate that the
Cur-CEO nanoemulsion, formulated using natural ingredients, holds
significant promise as a food-grade antibacterial agent for the
prevention and control of mycobacterial infections.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a major human pathogen with
significant morbidity in neonates and immunocompromised individuals.
However, antiviral drugs targeting HSV-1 are emerging with antiviral
resistance, highlighting the need to identify new targets for future
treatment. Once HSV-1 enters the host cells, it recruits host factors to
facilitate viral life cycle. In this study, we showed that aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, is
required for HSV-1 effective replication and offers an opportunity for
pharmacological intervention. Our results showed that HSV-1 infection
activates AhR signaling in an interferon-dependent manner.
Pharmacological inhibition or knockout of AhR reduced the expression of
viral proteins and infectious progeny, while increased AhR signaling
promoted the expression of viral proteins and viral replication.
Mechanistically, AhR formed a transcription complex with cyclin T1, VP16
and RNA Pol II in the nucleus, bound to viral gene promoters, and
promoted their transcription. Additionally, AhR promoted viral
replication partially by facilitating the expression of multiple viral
receptors. Collectively, AhR is a proviral host factor for HSV-1, and
thus may be used as a promising host-directed antiviral target.</p>

deletion inhibits Glaesserella parasuis-mediated inflammatory responses
in porcine alveolar macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Glaesserella parasuis (GPS) infection causes severe inflammatory
disorder, resulting in lung injury. SIRT7 is an NAD+-dependent
deacetylase known to regulate inflammatory responses, but its role in
GPS infection remains unclear. Here we found that GPS infection
increased SIRT7 expression and induced inflammatory responses.
Deficiency of SIRT7 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology significantly inhibited
GPS-induced cytopathic effects and inflammatory responses. In addition,
RNA-seq analysis showed that differentially expressed genes(DEGs)
induced by SIRT7 deficiency were enriched in biological processes such
as cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton formation, lipid synthesis,
protein kinase activation regulation, and GTPase activity regulation.
Functional enrichment analysis further indicated the involvement of
these DEGs in tight junction pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, actin
cytoskeleton regulation, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, Hippo signaling
pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, we identified some hub
genes (GNAI3, GNAI1, JAK1, NDUFS8, CYC1) related to oxidative
phosphorylation. In summary, our results demonstrate that SIRT7 is
pivotal for GPS-induced inflammatory responses, which represents a
promising target resistant to GPS infection.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic diseases
of the oral cavity, and it usually refers to chronic inflammatory
diseases caused by the infection of pathogenic microorganisms in the
oral cavity. PD mainly affects the tissues around the teeth, causing
inflammation of the gums and periodontium, destroying the alveolar bone,
and even leading to tooth loosening. Many studies have shown that PD is
not only limited to oral health but is also associated with diseases of
multiple systems throughout the body. In recent years, more and more
studies have focused on the interaction between PD and urologic
diseases, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). PD is also a typical
oral disease frequently observed in patients with kidney disease. This
paper reviews the potential link between PD and CKD and discusses the
interaction’s pathologic mechanisms and clinical implications. In
addition, this review aims to identify possible pathogenic mechanisms
and suggest potential ways to target PD to prevent and treat CKD. This
would lead to better treatment options to delay the progression of
CKD.</p>

cellular transcriptional response to respiratory syncytial virus
infection in HEp-2 cells: insights from cDNA microarray and quantitative
PCR analyses</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower
respiratory tract infections in young children and elderly, worldwide
and poses significant risks to immunocompromised individuals. To
elucidate host-virus interactions at the transcriptional level, we
analyzed differential gene expression in HEp-2 cells infected with RSV
using cDNA microarray analysis complemented by quantitative PCR (qPCR).
HEp-2 cells were infected with RSV at a multiplicity of infection of 1,
and total RNA was isolated 24 hours post-infection for gene expression
profiling. Radiolabeled cDNA probes from RSV-infected and mock-infected
cells were hybridized to Atlas® Human Cancer cDNA arrays, and
differential gene expression was quantified by densitometry. We
identified 12 host genes that were significantly upregulated in
RSV-infected cells from the cDNA microarray (≥2-fold increase,
P&lt;0.01), confirmed by qPCR, encompassing functional categories
including cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal organization, apoptosis
modulation, immune evasion, and inflammation. Notably, the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A was induced ~14-fold,
suggesting RSV triggers a host cell cycle arrest. The intermediate
filament protein, vimentin was up ~6-fold, consistent with cytoskeletal
rearrangements observed during viral syncytium formation. Anti-apoptotic
MCL1 increased ~11-fold, while pro-apoptotic caspase-4 showed a more
modest 1.6-fold rise, indicating a complex regulation of cell death
pathways. We also observed marked upregulation of a fibronectin receptor
subunit (~24-fold) and complement regulatory protein CD59 (~2-fold),
highlighting potential mechanisms of enhanced cell-cell fusion and viral
immune evasion. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 was elevated
~7-fold, underscoring the inflammatory response to RSV. These findings
provide a global snapshot of the host transcriptomic response to RSV
infection and yield insights into how RSV modulates host cellular
machinery to favor viral replication and spread. Understanding these
host-virus interactions may unveil novel targets for antiviral therapy
and inform strategies to mitigate RSV disease pathogenesis.</p>

diarrhea in pediatrics: a multicenter efficacy and safety study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecent or ongoing use of antibiotics causes diarrhea.
Probiotic yogurt is generally used in antibiotic-induced diarrhea as
adjuvant therapy. In recent times, there have been no clear
recommendations or guidelines for the course of treatment of probiotics
in preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea in infants and young children
in mainland China. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium in
antibiotic-induced diarrhea in infants and young children in Chinese
settings.MethodsData were collected retrospectively. Infants and
children received antibiotic treatments with 50 g daily regular yogurt
and 50 g daily regular yogurt for 7 days after those treatments (AY
cohort, n = 119), or with 10 billion CFU daily Saccharomyces boulardii
and 10 billion CFU daily Saccharomyces boulardii for 7 days after those
treatments (AS cohort, n = 110), or with 10 billion CFU daily
Bifidobacterium and 10 billion CFU daily Bifidobacterium for 7 days
after those treatments (AB cohort, n = 106). Two times per day loose or
watery stools were considered mild diarrhea, and three or more times per
day loose or watery stools were considered severe diarrhea.ResultsAll
infants and young children reported diarrhea after the start of any type
of antibiotic treatment with probiotics. Time for the start of diarrhea
after the start of antibiotic treatments with probiotics was higher in
infants and children of the AS cohort than in infants and children of
the AY [3 (4–3) days versus 1 (1–1) days, p &lt; 0.001] and the AB [3
(4–3) days versus 2 (2–1) days, p &lt; 0.001] cohorts. Twenty-four
(20%), 11 (10%), and 17 (16%) infants and children reported any type of
diarrhea in the AY, AS, and AB cohorts, respectively. The number of
patients with reported diarrhea (mild and severe) and the number of
patients who required extra anti-diarrheal treatments after antibiotic
treatments in the AS cohort were fewer than those reported in the AY and
the AB cohorts (p &lt; 0.05 for all). Yogurt reported sneezing, runny
nose, redness of the eyes, and nausea in the AY cohort (p &lt; 0.05 for
all comparisons). Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium caused
vomiting and nausea.ConclusionsAny type of antibiotic treatment cause
diarrhea in infants and young children. Probiotics especially
Saccharomyces boulardii co-treatments with any type of antibiotic
treatment, significantly reduce incidences of diarrhea in infants and
young children with manageable adverse effects.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an apicomplexan parasite, infects a
wide range of warm-blooded animals and poses significant risks to human
health. The fatty acid synthesis II (FASII) pathway in the apicoplast,
which is the major source of fatty acids in parasites, is considered a
potential drug target. The apicoplast also harbors some enzymes of
central carbon metabolism, which are crucial for its survival, but their
biological roles remain unclear. In this study, we focused on
apicoplast-localized isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (ICDH1) and deleted it
using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The Δicdh1 mutant tachyzoites displayed
markedly impaired growth kinetics, with further suppression under
serum-deprived conditions. However, this deletion did not affect the
viability or virulence of the Δicdh1 mutant in mice. NADPH, a product of
ICDH1-mediated decarboxylation of isocitrate, is an essential cofactor
for fatty acid synthesis. Using ¹³C6 glucose as a metabolic carbon
source, we showed that the mutant strains had reduced incorporation of
glucose-derived carbons into medium-chain length fatty acids (C14:0 and
C16:0). Additionally, the growth of the mutant was partially restored by
supplementation with exogenous C14:0 and C16:0 fatty acids. These
results indicate that ICDH1 deletion affects the FASII pathway and
parasite growth. Consistent with previous studies, this study confirms
that T. gondii has metabolic flexibility in the apicoplast that allows
it to acquire fatty acids through various pathways.</p>

<p>BackgroundBlood routine-derived inflammation indexes have been
studied in many diseases. However, their roles in varicella-zoster virus
(VZV)-related central nervous system (CNS) infection diseases are
unclear. This study analyzed the value of blood routine-derived
inflammatory indexes in the diagnosis and prognosis of VZV meningitis in
patients with acute herpes zoster (HZ).MethodsA total of 31 cases of VZV
meningitis were selected as the research subjects, with 64 cases of
acute HZ admitted to our hospital during the same period as the control

logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between the levels of
each inflammatory marker and the occurrence of VZV meningitis, as well
as to evaluate the relationship between the inflammatory markers and the
prognosis of VZV meningitis at discharge.ResultsCompared with those in

counts of lymphocytes decreased (p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic
regression analysis showed a correlation between the PLR and the
occurrence of VZV meningitis. The PLR also showed a significant
correlation with the prognosis of VZV meningitis patients at discharge
(r = 0.774, p &lt; 0.01).ConclusionThe PLR, as a potential inflammatory
index, may have certain clinical value in predicting the occurrence and
prognosis of VZV meningitis.</p>

epidemiological and spatiotemporal analysis of lumpy skin disease
outbreaks in cattle from Karnataka, India</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLumpy Skin Disease (LSD), is a re-emerging transboundary
disease of cattle, which has severely impacted India’s livestock
population. This study investigates its molecular epidemiology, spatial
patterns, and risk factors in Karnataka from 2021–2024.MethodologyIn
this study, total of 1,353 different types of samples from 451 suspected
LSD cases were analyzed using PCR. Spatial clustering was assessed using
QGIS and GeoDa. Risk factor analysis and phylogenetic studies were
performed to identify susceptible groups and viral lineages.ResultsAmong
the analyzed samples, scabs showed the highest positivity rate at 83.6%,
followed by nasal swabs at 80.9%, and blood samples at 76.9%,
underscoring the utility of nasal swabs as a simple and effective
non-invasive clinical sample for diagnosis and clinical surveillance.
Spatial analysis conducted with QGIS (v3.32.2) and GeoDa (v1.22)
identified strong spatial autocorrelation and consistent clustering of
cases in densely populated livestock areas, driven by environmental
factors and mechanical vectors, including blood-feeding arthropods like
flies (Stomoxys calcitrans, Haematobia irritans) and ticks
(Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma species). Vaccination campaigns achieved
near 100% coverage in most districts by 2022, substantially reducing
LSD-related mortality rate from 1.45% to negligible levels in 2024. Risk
factor analysis identified cattle aged 1 to 5 years and females as most
susceptible, with exotic breeds exhibiting 2.1–2.6 times higher odds of
infection than indigenous breeds. Molecular studies unveiled a
genetically stable lumpy skin disease virus strain unique to Karnataka,
consistent with the low mutation rate of DNA viruses.DiscussionThese
findings emphasize that, despite vaccination success, persistent
hotspots and vulnerable cattle groups remain. Therefore, region-specific
strategies such as targeted vector control, robust molecular
surveillance, and GIS-based early outbreak alerts are necessary for LSD
control in endemic regions. This study also highlights how the
integration of combining molecular diagnostics, epidemiological
modeling, and spatial analytics can strengthen LSD surveillance and
redefine disease control strategies, ultimately mitigating its
socio-economic impact.</p>

inflammatory stimuli that engage innate immune sensors induce novel
CD103 expression profiles in macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The integrin CD103 is an adhesion molecule that facilitates immune
cell retention in epithelial tissues through its interaction with
E-cadherin. It is a marker for certain CD8+ T-cell subpopulations and
conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), but its presence on
macrophages remains poorly characterized. Macrophage differentiation is
influenced by M-CSF and GM-CSF, and we investigated whether macrophages
can also express CD103 under inflammatory conditions. We examined
baseline CD103 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)
differentiated in M-CSF or GM-CSF and then stimulated them with
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or examined them
following viral infection. We found that CD103 is minimally expressed at
baseline but is selectively upregulated in M-CSF-differentiated
macrophages after stimulation with endosomal TLR agonists.
Mechanistically, p38 MAPK inhibition prevented CD103 upregulation,
suggesting that this process is mediated by p38 MAPK signaling.
Furthermore, in vivo LCMV infection induced CD103 expression on
peritoneal macrophages. These findings demonstrate that macrophages can
express CD103 under specific inflammatory conditions, challenging the
assumption that CD103 is restricted to T cells and dendritic cells. This
study expands our understanding of CD103 beyond its recognized roles in
T cells and DCs, providing new insight into its regulation by
macrophages.</p>

evaluation of a novel H. pylori fecal molecular diagnosis kit (multiplex
RT-PCR method) for detecting clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones
resistance using stool samples</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori infection poses a significant global
health challenge, exacerbated by rising antibiotic resistance. This
study aimed to evaluate a novel multiplex RT-PCR-based fecal diagnostic
kit (Cowin Biosciences, Jiangsu, China) for detecting mutations in the
23S rRNA and gyrA genes associated with clarithromycin and
fluoroquinolone resistance in H. pylori.MethodsA total of 1,176
participants from four clinical centers in China were enrolled between
August 2022 and October 2023. Phenotypic resistance was assessed on H.
pylori isolated from gastric samples using the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) method (E-test), while fecal samples were analyzed
molecularly via the diagnostic kit and Sanger sequencing. Positive
(PPA), negative (NPA), and overall percentage agreement (OPA) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.ResultsThere was a high level
of consistency between phenotypic testing and novel diagnostic kit. The
PPA, NPA, and OPA of the fecal diagnostic kit for detecting
clarithromycin susceptibility were 92.97% (CI: 90.6%-95.3%), 87.89% (CI:
85.0%-90.8%), and 90.36% (CI: 88.5%-92.3%), respectively. And likewise,
the PPA, NPA, and OPA in diagnosing H. pylori resistance to
fluoroquinolones were 86.85% (CI:83.6%- 90.1%), 91.12% (CI:
88.6%-93.7%), and 89.12% (CI: 87.1%-91.1%), respectively. Beyond that,
the diagnostic kit also exhibited a high degree of concordance with the
outcomes of Sanger sequencing. Specifically, when assessing
clarithromycin resistance, the PPA, NPA, and OPA of the diagnostic kit
were 97.13% (CI: 95.7%-98.6%), 94.62% (CI: 92.6%-96.6%), and 95.90% (CI:
94.7%-97.1%), respectively. Similarly, application of the diagnostic kit
to detect fluoroquinolone resistance achieved a PPA of 96.92% (CI:
94.9%-98.4%), an NPA of 93.18% (CI: 91.0%-95.3%), and an OPA of 94.69%
(CI: 93.3%-96.1%). The concordance rate between the fecal kit and
phenotypic susceptibility testing varied with MIC values. For
clarithromycin resistance, the positive percentage agreement (PPA) was
lowest (89.74%) when MIC exceeded 256 µg/mL but peaked at 96.47% for MIC
values between 32 and 256 µg/mL. The highest overall concordance (Kappa
= 0.774) was observed at intermediate MIC levels (4–32 µg/mL),
suggesting optimal detection accuracy in this range.ConclusionsThe fecal
diagnostic kit provides a rapid, non-invasive, and reliable method to
predict clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance, supporting
personalized therapy.Clinical Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov,

of human respiratory tract infection in Chongqing, China after
COVID-19–based on surveillance data encompassing 17 respiratory
pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRespiratory tract infections (RTIs) are an important public
health concern, and SARS-CoV-2 affects the epidemic pattern of RTIs
globally. National multipathogenic surveillance for RTIs was conducted
in mid-October 2023. However, baseline data on the pathogen spectrum of
RTIs in Chongqing, China, before mid-October 2023 are limited.MethodsA
descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the epidemiology of RTIs
in Chongqing, China, in 2023.Results A total of 1,894 individuals were
included in 2023, with an overall positivity rate of 28.7%. The highest
overall positivity rate was observed in May 2023 (53.0%). Different
predominant respiratory pathogens were observed among different age
groups. Among all single-infected individuals, SARS-CoV-2 accounted for
32.1%, followed by IFV, which accounted for 28.2%. In the children
group, RSV ranked first, accounting for 15.7%. Among school-aged
children, IFV ranked the top, accounting for 46.7%. SARS-CoV-2 ranked
the top among adults and the elderly, accounting for 45.5% and 47.0%,
respectively.ConclusionsThe local pathogen spectrum of RTIs one year
after the onset of COVID-19 showed that SARS-CoV-2 was steady, and viral
infection might be the main cause of RTIs. Both upper respiratory tract
infections and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) showed high RTI
positivity rates. The pathogen spectra of upper respiratory tract
infections (URIs) and LRIs differ in adults. Holistic surveillance of
RTIs is necessary to estimate the local disease burden. Vaccination
against respiratory infections remains an important strategy to prevent
and control RTIs.</p>

and placental microbiome and immune crosstalk in pregnancies with
small-for-gestational-age fetuses – a pilot case-control study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction are
associated with specific bacterial abundances and elevation of
proinflammatory cytokines. The aim of the study was to simultaneously
analyze the relation between the gut and placenta microbiome and
cytokine profile in pregnant women with fetuses appropriate (AGA) and
small for gestational age (SGA).Material and methodsWomen with singleton
pregnancies at or beyond 32 weeks of gestation were recruited. 11
delivered SGA newborns (study group) and 11 AGA newborns (control
group). Samples of maternal venous blood, stool and placenta were
collected perinatally.ResultsIn SGA group lower Chao index in placental
samples collected from maternal side, while higher Chao index in
placental samples collected from fetal side were observed. Taxonomic
analysis identified four significantly less abundant genera in samples
collected from maternal side. No taxa remained significant after
correction in samples from fetal side, but several taxa showed trends of
differing abundance. Veillonella showed a trend toward higher abundance
in stool samples in SGA group, while other taxa were significant only at
a lower threshold. Metabolite analysis revealed that hexanoic acid was
significantly elevated compound in the stool of women from the SGA
group. Proteobacteria unclassified and Halomonadaceae correlated with
stool metabolites, while IL-6 and TNF-α correlated with specific
bacterial groups.ConclusionsSpecific changes in the gut microbiome and
metabolome as well as placenta microbiome of women with SGA have been
observed, with additional associations with inflammatory cytokine
levels, suggesting a potential role of these factors in SGA development
and highlighting the need for further research.</p>

periodontitis microbiome research: integrating design, analysis, and
technology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 20%-50% of
adults worldwide, is driven by polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis.
Despite numerous studies on the oral microbiota in periodontitis,
significant heterogeneity exists between findings, posing challenges for
treatment strategies. To understand the sources of this variability and
establish standardized protocols, we reviewed the literature to identify
potential factors contributing to these discrepancies. We found most
studies focus on microbial communities in periodontal pockets, with
fewer investigating microbial composition within gingival tissue.
Research indicates that bacterial communities in gingival tissue exist
as biofilms, potentially serving as reservoirs for persistent infection.
Therefore, further exploration of the microbiome within periodontal
tissues is needed, which may offer new insights for treatment
strategies. Metatranscriptomics provides valuable insights into gene
expression patterns of the oral microbiota, enabling the exploration of
microbial activity at a functional level. Previous studies revealed that
most upregulated virulence factors in periodontitis originate from
species not traditionally considered major periodontal pathogens.
However, current studies have not fully identified or revealed the
functional changes in key symbiotic microbes in periodontitis. We
reviewed the analytical paradigms of metatranscriptomics and found that
current analysis is largely limited to assessing functional changes in
known periodontal pathogens, highlighting the need for a
functional-driven approach. Beyond the limitations of current analytical
paradigms, the metatranscriptomics also has inherent constraints. We
suggested integrating emerging high-throughput microbial sequencing
technologies with functional-driven analytical strategies to provide a
more comprehensive and higher-resolution insight for microbiome
reconstruction in periodontitis.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to enhance the comprehension of the
practical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) metagenomic
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the clinical management of patients
with suspected pneumonia.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 296
individuals who underwent BALF mNGS and conventional microbial tests
(CMTs) for suspected pneumonia. We compared the clinical characteristics
between patients with pulmonary infection (PI) and those without
pulmonary infection (NPI). The detection rate of mNGS and CMTs in
different groups of patients were compared. The Sankey diagram was used
to present the results of the influence of mNGS on diagnosis and
treatment.ResultsComparison between PI and NPI showed that individuals
with fever, concurrent malignant tumors, consolidation or ground-glass
opacity on chest CT(Computed tomography) images, and elevated
inflammatory markers on blood tests were more likely to develop lung
infections. Analysis of the rate of positive detection between CMTs and
mNGS in various subgroups revealed that mNGS had a significantly higher
positive detection rate in patients with pulmonary infections (87.95%
vs. 71.06%, p&lt;0.001), in immunocompetent patients (86.91% vs. 68.08%,
p&lt;0.001), and in patients with malignant tumors (92.31% vs. 69.23%,
p=0.035). Furthermore, mNGS helped initiate appropriate antibiotic
treatment and confirmed the effectiveness of empirical treatment.
Compared to immunocompetent patients, BALF mNGS in immunocompromised
individuals with suspected lung infections yielded higher rates of
accurate diagnosis (62.86% vs. 42.79%, p = 0.027) and more effective
treatment (71.43% vs. 58.56%, p = 0.148).ConclusionsBALF mNGS identified
a greater variety of pathogens than CMTs. Immunocompromised patients
with suspected pneumonia may benefit more from BALF mNGS.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe central nervous system disorder
characterized by high incidence, disability, mortality, and recurrence
rates, along with numerous complications. The microbiota-gut-brain axis
(MGBA) represents a bidirectional communication pathway between the
brain and the gut, which can influence the onset and progression of IS
through neural, immunoregulatory, and gut metabolite pathways. Recent
preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT), probiotics and prebiotics, dietary interventions,
and antibiotics as strategies to suppress neuroinflammation in IS,
protect the blood-brain barrier, modulate immune responses, and improve
stroke outcomes. In this review, we summarize the manifestations of
innate inflammation and adaptive immunity following the onset of IS,
highlight the interactions between the MGBA and post-stroke
neuroinflammation, and discuss current therapeutic measures, thus
providing insights for the development of novel treatment strategies in
the future.</p>

<p>ObjectiveTinea capitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the scalp
and hair shafts caused by dermatophyte infections, ​manifests clinically​
as erythematous lesions, scaling, alopecia, and pustule formation.
Hainan, a tropical island province in China, exhibits distinctive
climatic conditions and demographic contact patterns that ​could shape​
its pathogen spectrum. However, comprehensive epidemiological data
​remain scarce. This study ​analyzes​ the epidemiological characteristics
and pathogen spectrum of tinea capitis in Hainan, China.MethodsThis
study ​was undertaken​ across 11 coastal and inland dermatological centers
in Hainan Province (January 2023 to December 2024). A total of 76 tinea
capitis patients ​diagnosed​ via mycological examination (fungal
fluorescence microscopy, fungal culture with species identification) ​and
corroborated​ by dermatoscopic evaluation ​were consecutively enrolled.
Data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and clinical
manifestations ​were systematically collated​ using standardized case
report forms. Pathogen subtyping ​was performed via​ integrated
morphological identification ​supplemented by​ molecular biological
analysis of the ITS region.ResultsAmong 76 enrolled patients, minors
(≤15 years) ​accounted for​ 80.26% (61/76), with ≤10-year-olds
​representing​ 91.8% (56/61) of pediatric cases. The overall
male-to-female ratio ​was recorded as​ 1:1.05 (37 males vs. 39 females),
while pediatric patients (≤15 years) ​exhibited​ a 1.07:1 ratio (31 males
vs. 29 females). Animal contact history ​was reported in​ 31 cases
(40.79%), scalp trauma in 3 cases (3.95%), and co-occurring superficial
fungal infections in 12 cases (15.79%). ​Fungal elements were detected​
via direct microscopic examination in 64 cases (84.21%). Fungal cultures
​obtained​ 45 positive isolates (19 strains in 2023, 26 in 2024), with
kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) ​exhibiting​ the highest culture
positivity rate, followed by tinea alba. ​The primary pathogens
identified​ were zoophilic Microsporum canis (M. canis) (20 cases,
43.79%) and anthropophilic Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) (9 strains,
19.57%). Clinical manifestations ​comprised​ kerion (44 cases, 57.89%),
tinea alba (27 cases, 35.53%), and black dot tinea (5 cases, 6.58%).
Kerion cases ​were predominantly linked to​ M. canis and T. mentagrophytes
(interdigital subtype), whereas tinea alba ​demonstrated​ infections by M.
canis and T. rubrum. Black dot lesions ​were additionally observed​ in M.
canis infections.ConclusionThe primary affected group is children ≤10
years old, with the most common pathogenic fungus being zoophilic M.
canis, and clinical classification is predominantly kerion.
Dermatologists should pay attention to different transmission routes and
pathogen spectra.</p>

bacterial and fungal communities associated with Fusarium-wilt
symptomatic and non-symptomatic ‘Gros Michel’ banana plants in
Ecuador</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
cubense (Foc), remains a critical threat to banana production worldwide.
Despite the persistence of the disease in fields planted with
susceptible cultivars such as ‘Gros Michel’, little is known about the
microbial interactions influencing symptom development. In this study,
we assessed the bacterial and fungal communities associated to
symptomatic and non-symptomatic ‘Gros Michel’ bananas plants sampled in
Ecuador banana fields affected by Foc race 1. We aimed to compare their
diversity, composition, and to identify potential microbial taxa that
could be active in disease suppression. Samples were collected from the
pseudostem, rhizome, and rhizosphere, and analyzed through
high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS2 regions to
characterize bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Results
revealed that non-symptomatic plants harbored significantly higher
bacterial diversity, particularly in pseudostem and rhizome tissues,
compared to symptomatic plants. Genera including, Bacillus,
Enterobacter, Paenibacillus, Pectobacterium, Herbaspirillum and
Pseudomonas were enriched in non-symptomatic tissues, suggesting a
potential role in disease suppression. In contrast, symptomatic plants
showed an increased abundance of genera such as Klebsiella and
Kosakonia. Fungal community shifts were less pronounced, indicating that
bacterial dynamics may play a more critical role in disease development.
These findings shed light on the key microbial taxa associated with
FWB-affected banana plants and the potential role of their microbiome to
plant health and disease suppression.</p>
