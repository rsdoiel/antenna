id="structural-and-functional-alteration-of-the-gut-microbiota-in-elderly-patients-with-hyperlipidemia">Structural
and functional alteration of the gut microbiota in elderly patients with
hyperlipidemia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the structure, composition, and functions of
the gut microbiota in elderly patients with
hyperlipidemia.MethodsSixteen older patients diagnosed with
hyperlipidemia (M group) and 10 healthy, age-matched normal volunteers
(N group) were included. These groups were further subdivided by sex
into the male normal (NM, n = 5), female normal (NF, n = 5), male
hyperlipidemia (MM, n = 8), and female hyperlipidemia (MF, n = 8)
subgroups. Stool samples were collected for high-throughput sequencing
of 16S rRNA genes. Blood samples were collected for clinical biochemical
index testing.ResultsAlpha- and beta-diversity analyses revealed that
the structure and composition of the gut microbiota were significantly
different between the M and N groups. The relative abundances of
Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Blautia, Peptococcus, and Bifidobacterium
were significantly decreased, while those of Lactobacillus,
Helicobacter, and Desulfovibrio were significantly higher in the M
group. There were also significant sex-related differences in microbial
structure between the NM and NF groups, and between the MM and MF
groups. Through functional prediction with PICRUSt 2, we observed
distinct between-group variations in metabolic pathways associated with
the gut microbiota and their impact on the functionality of the nervous
system. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used as a distance metric
to build co-abundance networks. A hypergeometric test was used to detect
taxonomies with significant enrichment in specific clusters. We
speculated that modules with Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae as the
core microbes play an important ecological role in the intestinal
microbiota of the M group. The relative intestinal abundances of
Agathobacter and Faecalibacterium in the M group were positively
correlated with serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels,
while the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was negatively
correlated with the serum lipoprotein a level.</p>

evidence strengthens the connection between gut microbiota and
gingivitis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe oral cavity and gut tract, being interconnected and
rich in microbiota, may have a shared influence on gingivitis. However,
the specific role of distinct gut microbiota taxa in gingivitis remains
unexplored. Utilizing Mendelian Randomization (MR) as an ideal method
for causal inference avoiding reverse causality and potential
confounding factors, we conducted a comprehensive two-sample MR study to
uncover the potential genetic causal impact of gut microbiota on
gingivitis.MethodsInstrumental variables were chosen from single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with 418 gut
microbiota taxa, involving 14,306 individuals. Gingivitis, with 4,120
cases and 195,395 controls, served as the outcome. Causal effects were
assessed using random-effect inverse variance-weighted, weighted median,
and MR-Egger methods. For replication and meta-analysis, gingivitis data
from IEU OpenGWAS were employed. Sensitivity analyses included Cochran’s
Q tests, funnel plots, leave-one-out analyses, and MR-Egger intercept
tests. This study aimed to assess the genetic correlation between the
genetically predicted gut microbiota and gingivitis using linkage
disequilibrium score regression (LDSC).ResultsThree gut microbiota taxa
(class Actinobacteria id.419, family Defluviitaleaceae id.1924, genus
Defluviitaleaceae UCG011 id.11287) are predicted to causally contribute
to an increased risk of gingivitis (P&lt; 0.05). Additionally, four gut
microbiota taxa (class Actinobacteria id.419, genus Escherichia Shigella
id.3504, genus Ruminococcaceae UCG002 id.11360) potentially exhibit
inhibitory causal effects on the risk of gingivitis (P&lt; 0.05). No
significant evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy is detected. Our
findings indicate a suggestive genetic correlation between class
Actinobacteria id.419, class Bacteroidia id.912, family
Defluviitaleaceae id.1924, genus Escherichia Shigella id.3504 and
gingivitis.ConclusionOur study establishes the genetic causal effect of
418 gut microbiota taxa on gingivitis, offering insights for clinical
interventions targeting gingivitis. Subsequent research endeavors are
essential to corroborate the findings of our present study.</p>

id="cath-2-derived-antimicrobial-peptide-inhibits-multidrug-resistant-escherichia-coli-infection-in-chickens">CATH-2-derived
antimicrobial peptide inhibits multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli
infection in chickens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Avian colibacillosis (AC), caused by infection with Escherichia coli
(E. coli), is a major threat to poultry health, food safety and public
health, and results in high mortality and significant economic losses.
Currently, new drugs are urgently needed to replace antibiotics due to
the continuous emergence and increasing resistance of
multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of E. coli caused by the irrational
use of antibiotics in agriculture and animal husbandry. In recent years,
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which uniquely evolved to protect the
host, have emerged as a leading alternative to antibiotics in clinical
settings. CATH-2, a member of the antimicrobial cathelicidin peptide
family, has been reported to have antibacterial activity. To enhance the
antimicrobial potency and reduce the adverse effects on animals, we
designed five novel AMPs, named C2-1, C2-2, C2-3, C2-4 and C2-5, based
on chicken CATH-2, the secondary structures of these AMPs were
consistently α-helical and had an altered net charge and hydrophobicity
compared to those of the CATH-2 (1-15) sequences. Subsequently, the
antimicrobial activities of CATH-2 (1-15) and five designed peptides
against MDR E. coli were evaluated in vitro. Specifically, C2-2 showed
excellent antimicrobial activity against either the ATCC standard strain
or veterinary clinical isolates of MDR E. coli, with concentrations
ranging from 2-8 μg/mL. Furthermore, C2-2 maintained its strong
antibacterial efficacy under high temperature and saline conditions,
demonstrating significant stability. Similarly, C2-2 retained a high
level of safety with no significant hemolytic activity on chicken mature
red blood cells or cytotoxicity on chicken kidney cells over the
concentration range of 0-64 μg/mL. Moreover, the administration of C2-2
improved the survival rate and reduced the bacterial load in the heart,
liver and spleen during MDR E. coli infection in chickens. Additionally,
pathological damage to the heart, liver and intestine was prevented when
MDR E. coli infected chickens were treated with C2-2. Together, our
study showed that C2-2 may be a promising novel therapeutic agent for
the treatment of MDR E. coli infections and AC.</p>

and characterization of the capsule depolymerase Dpo27 from phage
IME-Ap7 specific to Acinetobacter pittii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Among the Acinetobacter genus, Acinetobacter pittii stands out as an
important opportunistic infection causative agent commonly found in
hospital settings, which poses a serious threat to human health.
Recently, the high prevalence of carbapenem-resistant A. pittii isolates
has created significant therapeutic challenges for clinicians.
Bacteriophages and their derived enzymes are promising therapeutic
alternatives or adjuncts to antibiotics effective against
multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. However, studies investigating
the depolymerases specific to A. pittii strains are scarce. In this
study, we identified and characterized a capsule depolymerase, Dpo27,
encoded by the bacteriophage IME-Ap7, which targets A. pittii. A total
of 23 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. were identified as A.
pittii (21.91%, 23/105), and seven A. pittii strains with various K
locus (KL) types (KL14, KL32, KL38, KL111, KL163, KL207, and KL220) were
used as host bacteria for phage screening. The lytic phage IME-Ap7 was
isolated using A. pittii 7 (KL220) as an indicator bacterium and was
observed for depolymerase activity. A putative tail fiber gene encoding
a polysaccharide-degrading enzyme (Dpo27) was identified and expressed.
The results of the modified single-spot assay showed that both A. pittii
7 and 1492 were sensitive to Dpo27, which was assigned the KL220 type.
After incubation with Dpo27, A. pittii strain was susceptible to killing
by human serum; moreover, the protein displayed no hemolytic activity
against erythrocytes. Furthermore, the protein exhibited sustained
activity across a wide pH range (5.0–10.0) and at temperatures between
20 and 50°C. In summary, the identified capsule depolymerase Dpo27 holds
promise as an alternative treatment for combating KL220-type A. pittii
infections.</p>

host-mimicking conditions and a murine cutaneous abscess model to
identify synergistic antibiotic combinations effective against
Pseudomonas aeruginosa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antibiotic drug combination therapy is critical for the successful
treatment of infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens. We
investigated the efficacy of β-lactam and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor
combinations with other antibiotics, against the hypervirulent,
ceftazidime/avibactam resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Liverpool
epidemic strain (LES) B58. Although minimum inhibitory concentrations in
vitro differed by up to eighty-fold between standard and host-mimicking
media, combinatorial effects only marginally changed between conditions
for some combinations. Effective combinations in vitro were further
tested in a chronic, high-density murine infection model. Colistin and
azithromycin demonstrated combinatorial effects with ceftazidime and
ceftazidime/avibactam both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, while
tobramycin and tigecycline exhibited strong synergy in vitro, this
effect was not observed in vivo. Our approach of using host-mimicking
conditions and a sophisticated animal model to evaluate drug synergy
against bacterial pathogens represents a promising approach. This
methodology may offer insights into the prediction of combination
therapy outcomes and the identification of potential treatment
failures.</p>

complexity: O-linked protein glycosylation in pathogenic Neisseria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The genus Neisseria, which colonizes mucosal surfaces, includes both
commensal and pathogenic species that are exclusive to humans. The two
pathogenic Neisseria species are closely related but cause quite
different diseases, meningococcal sepsis and meningitis (Neisseria
meningitidis) and sexually transmitted gonorrhea (Neisseria
gonorrhoeae). Although obvious differences in bacterial niches and
mechanisms for transmission exists, pathogenic Neisseria have high
levels of conservation at the levels of nucleotide sequences, gene
content and synteny. Species of Neisseria express broad-spectrum
O-linked protein glycosylation where the glycoproteins are largely
transmembrane proteins or lipoproteins localized on the cell surface or
in the periplasm. There are diverse functions among the identified
glycoproteins, for example type IV biogenesis proteins, proteins
involved in antimicrobial resistance, as well as surface proteins that
have been suggested as vaccine candidates. The most abundant
glycoprotein, PilE, is the major subunit of pili which are an important
colonization factor. The glycans attached can vary extensively due to
phase variation of protein glycosylation (pgl) genes and polymorphic pgl
gene content. The exact roles of glycosylation in Neisseria remains to
be determined, but increasing evidence suggests that glycan variability
can be a strategy to evade the human immune system. In addition,
pathogenic and commensal Neisseria appear to have significant
glycosylation differences. Here, the current knowledge and implications
of protein glycosylation genes, glycan diversity, glycoproteins and
immunogenicity in pathogenic Neisseria are summarized and discussed.</p>

detection of Blastocystis spp.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Blastocystis spp. is a ubiquitous protozoon in the intestinal tract
of human and many animals. Microscopic examination is the main method of
clinical diagnosis for Blastocystis spp., which is prone to false
negative. A simple and rapid diagnosis of Blastocystis spp. infection is
an important step to prevent and control blastocystosis. Here, a
recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD)
assay was developed for rapid visual detection of Blastocystis spp. DNA
amplification could be performed within 18 min at 37°C. The minimum DNA
detection limit was 1 pg/μL, and there was no cross-reactivity with 12
other non-target pathogens, which was consistent with the sensitivity of
conventional PCR (cPCR). Furthermore, 56 fecal samples from the Third
Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University were tested using RPA
and cPCR methods respectively, and the results were completely
consistent. The results show that RPA-LFD method has high accuracy and
visual results, which provides a new choice for the differential
diagnosis and rapid field detection of Blastocystis spp.</p>

DNA sensors activation of human astrocytes inhibits herpes simplex virus
through IRF1 induction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWhile astrocytes participate in the CNS innate immunity
against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, they are the
major target for the virus. Therefore, it is of importance to understand
the interplay between the astrocyte-mediated immunity and HSV-1
infection.MethodsBoth primary human astrocytes and the astrocyte line
(U373) were used in this study. RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were used
to measure IFNs, the antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFN
regulatory factors (IRFs) and HSV-1 DNA. IRF1 knockout or knockdown was
performed with CRISPR/Cas9 and siRNA transfection
techniques.ResultsPoly(dA:dT) could inhibit HSV-1 replication and induce
IFN-β/IFN-λs production in human astrocytes. Poly(dA:dT) treatment of
astrocytes also induced the expression of the antiviral ISGs (Viperin,
ISG56 and MxA). Among IRFs members examined, poly(dA:dT) selectively
unregulated IRF1 and IRF9, particularly IRF1 in human astrocytes. The
inductive effects of poly(dA:dT) on IFNs and ISGs were diminished in the
IRF1 knockout cells. In addition, IRF1 knockout attenuated
poly(dA:dT)-mediated HSV-1 inhibition in the cells.ConclusionThe DNA
sensors activation induces astrocyte intracellular innate immunity
against HSV-1. Therefore, targeting the DNA sensors has potential for
immune activation-based HSV-1 therapy.</p>

id="characterization-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-colonization-of-macrophages-under-distinct-polarization-states-and-nutrients-environment">Characterization
of Neisseria gonorrhoeae colonization of macrophages under distinct
polarization states and nutrients environment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) is a uniquely adapted human pathogen and
the etiological agent of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease. Ng
has developed numerous mechanisms to avoid and actively suppress innate
and adaptive immune responses. Ng successfully colonizes and establishes
topologically distinct colonies in human macrophages and avoids
phagocytic killing. During colonization, Ng manipulates the actin
cytoskeleton to invade and create an intracellular niche supportive of
bacterial replication. The cellular reservoir(s) supporting bacterial
replication and persistence in gonorrhea infections are poorly defined.
The manner in which gonococci colonize macrophages points to this innate
immune phagocyte as a strong candidate for a cellular niche during
natural infection. Here we investigate whether nutrients availability
and immunological polarization alter macrophage colonization by Ng.
Differentiation of macrophages in pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and
tolerogenic (M2-like) phenotypes prior to infection reveals that Ng can
invade macrophages in all activation states, albeit with lower
efficiency in M1-like macrophages. These results suggest that during
natural infection, bacteria could invade and grow within macrophages
regardless of the nutrients availability and the macrophage immune
activation status.</p>

activity of carotenoid crocetin against Staphylococcal strains</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis stand as
notorious threats to human beings owing to the myriad of infections they
cause. The bacteria readily form biofilms that help in withstanding the
effects of antibiotics and the immune system. Intending to combat the
biofilm formation and reduce the virulence of the pathogens, we
investigated the effects of carotenoids, crocetin, and crocin, on four
Staphylococcal strains. Crocetin was found to be the most effective as
it diminished the biofilm formation of S. aureus ATCC 6538 significantly
at 50 µg/mL without exhibiting bactericidal effect (MIC &gt;800 µg/mL)
and also inhibited the formation of biofilm by MSSA 25923 and S.
epidermidis at a concentration as low as 2 µg/mL, and that by
methicillin-resistant S. aureus MW2 at 100 µg/mL. It displayed minimal
to no antibiofilm efficacy on the Gram-negative strains Escherichia coli
O157:H7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as a fungal strain of Candida
albicans. It could also curb the formation of fibrils, which partly
contributes to the biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. Additionally,
the ADME analysis of crocetin proclaims how relatively non-toxic the
chemical is. Also, crocetin displayed synergistic antibiofilm
characteristics in combination with tobramycin. The presence of a
polyene chain with carboxylic acid groups at its ends is hypothesized to
contribute to the strong antibiofilm characteristics of crocetin. These
findings suggest that using apocarotenoids, particularly crocetin might
help curb the biofilm formation by S. aureus and S. epidermidis.</p>

<p>BackgroundMultiple studies have suggested a possible connection
between the gut microbiota and the development of lymphoma, though the
exact nature of this relationship remains unclear. This study aimed to
explore whether a causal association exists between gut microbiota and
lymphoma.MethodsA bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)
approach was conducted to investigate potential causal effects between
gut microbiota and various lymphoma subtypes. The primary method
employed for MR analysis was inverse variance weighted (IVW),
supplemented by additional methods including MR-Egger, weighted median,
and weighted mode approaches. The Cochrane Q test, MR-PRESSO global test
and MR-Egger intercept test were performed to assess pleiotropy and
heterogeneity. Furthermore, a reverse MR analysis was performed to
explore potential reverse causal effect.ResultsThe primary MR analysis
identified 36 causal relationships between genetic liabilities in gut
microbiota and different lymphoma subtypes. Neither the MR-PRESSO test
nor the MR-Egger regression detected any pleiotropy, and Cochran’s Q
test indicated no significant heterogeneity.ConclusionsOur MR analysis
revealed substantial causal associations between gut microbiota and
lymphoma, offering new insights into lymphoma prevention and management

at the portals of entry after single and co-infections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLittle is known about the proteomic changes at the
portals of entry in rainbow trout after infection with the myxozoan
parasites, Myxobolus cerebralis, and Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae.
Whirling disease (WD) is a severe disease of salmonids, caused by the
myxosporean M. cerebralis, while, proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is
caused by T. bryosalmonae, which instead belongs to the class
Malacosporea. Climate change is providing more suitable conditions for
myxozoan parasites lifecycle, posing a high risk to salmonid aquaculture
and contributing to the decline of wild trout populations in North
America and Europe. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide the
first proteomic profiles of the host in the search for evasion
strategies during single and coinfection with M. cerebralis and T.
bryosalmonae.MethodsOne group of fish was initially infected with M.
cerebralis and another group with T. bryosalmonae. After 30 days, half
of the fish in each group were co-infected with the other parasite.
Using a quantitative proteomic approach, we investigated proteomic
changes in the caudal fins and gills of rainbow trout before and after
co-infection.ResultsIn the caudal fins, 16 proteins were differentially
regulated post exposure to M. cerebralis, whereas 27 proteins were
differentially modulated in the gills of the infected rainbow trout post
exposure to T. bryosalmonae. After co-infection, 4 proteins involved in
parasite recognition and the regulation of host immune responses were
differentially modulated between the groups in the caudal fin. In the
gills, 11 proteins involved in parasite recognition and host immunity,
including 4 myxozoan proteins predicted to be virulence factors, were
differentially modulated.DiscussionThe results of this study increase
our knowledge on rainbow trout co-infections by myxozoan parasites and
rainbow trout immune responses against myxozoans at the portals of
entry, supporting a better understanding of these host-parasite
interactions.</p>

<p>IntroductionAcute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common
infections in the general population and are mainly caused by
respiratory viruses. Detecting several viruses in a respiratory sample
is common. To better understand these viral codetections and potential
interferences, we tested for the presence of viruses and developed
quantitative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) for the viruses most
prevalent in coinfections: human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), and quantified their viral loads according to
coinfections and health status, age, cellular abundance and other
variables.Materials and methodsSamples from two different cohorts were
analyzed: one included hospitalized infants under 12 months of age with
acute bronchiolitis (n=719) and the other primary care patients of all
ages with symptoms of ARI (n=685). We performed Multiplex PCR on
nasopharyngeal swabs, and quantitative PCR on samples positive for HRV
or/and RSV to determine viral loads (VL). Cellular abundance (CA) was
also estimated by qPCR targeting the GAPDH gene. Genotyping was
performed either directly from first-line molecular panel or by PCR and
sequencing for HRV.ResultsThe risks of viral codetection were 4.1
(IC95[1.8; 10.0]) and 93.9 1 (IC95[48.7; 190.7]) higher in infants
hospitalized for bronchiolitis than in infants in primary care for RSV
and HRV respectively (p&lt;0.001). CA was higher in samples positive for
multiple viruses than in mono-infected or negative samples (p&lt;0.001),
and higher in samples positive for RSV (p&lt;0.001) and HRV (p&lt;0.001)
than in negative samples. We found a positive correlation between CA and
VL for both RSV and HRV. HRV VL was higher in children than in the
elderly (p&lt;0.05), but not RSV VL. HRV VL was higher when detected
alone than in samples coinfected with RSV-A and with RSV-B. There was a
significant increase of RSV-A VL when codetecting with HRV (p=0.001) and
when co-detecting with RSV-B+HRV versus RSV-A+ RSV-B
(p=0.02).ConclusionsMany parameters influence the natural history of
respiratory viral infections, and quantifying respiratory viral loads
can help disentangle their contributions to viral outcome.</p>

fiber may benefit chondrocyte activity maintenance</h2>

<p>The understanding of the link between the gut-bone axis is growing
yearly, but the mechanisms involved are not yet clear. Our study
analyzed the role of Sestrin2 (SESN2)pathway in the gut-bone axis. We
established an osteoarthritis (OA) model in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats
using the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) procedure,
followed by a dietary intervention with varying levels of dietary fiber
content for 8 weeks. By 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota, we
found that high dietary fiber (HDF) intake could significantly increase
the Bacillota-dominant gut microbiota. Meanwhile, enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and histological analysis showed that
intervention with HDF could reduce the degree of bone and joint lesions
and inflammation. We hypothesize that HDF increased the dominant flora
of Bacillota, up-regulated the expression of SESN2 in knee joint, and
reduced gut permeability, thereby reducing systemic inflammatory
response and the degree of bone and joint lesions. Therefore, the
present study confirms that changes in gut microbiota induced by
increased dietary fiber intake delayed the onset of OA by promoting
up-regulation of SESN2 expression at the knee joint to maintain
chondrocyte activity and reduce synovial inflammation.</p>

protocols and their contributions to the microbiological diagnosis of
implant-associated infections: a review of the current scenario</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Addressing the existing problem in the microbiological diagnosis of
infections associated with implants and the current debate about the
real power of precision of sonicated fluid culture (SFC), the objective
of this review is to describe the methodology and analyze and compare
the results obtained in current studies on the subject. Furthermore, the
present study also discusses and suggests the best parameters for
performing sonication. A search was carried out for recent studies in
the literature (2019-2023) that addressed this research topic. As a
result, different sonication protocols were adopted in the studies
analyzed, as expected, and consequently, there was significant
variability between the results obtained regarding the sensitivity and
specificity of the technique in relation to the traditional culture
method (periprosthetic tissue culture – PTC). Coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus (CoNS) and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as the
main etiological agents by SFC and PTC, with SFC being important for the
identification of pathogens of low virulence that are difficult to
detect. Compared to chemical biofilm displacement methods, EDTA and DTT,
SFC also produced variable results. In this context, this review
provided an overview of the most current scenarios on the topic and
theoretical support to improve sonication performance, especially with
regard to sensitivity and specificity, by scoring the best parameters
from various aspects, including sample collection, storage conditions,
cultivation methods, microorganism identification techniques (both
phenotypic and molecular) and the cutoff point for colony forming unit
(CFU) counts. This study demonstrated the need for standardization of
the technique and provided a theoretical basis for a sonication protocol
that aims to achieve the highest levels of sensitivity and specificity
for the reliable microbiological diagnosis of infections associated with
implants and prosthetic devices, such as prosthetic joint infections
(PJIs). However, practical application and additional complementary
studies are still needed.</p>

characterization of supragingival plaque microbiomes in malocclusion
adult female patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with removable
aligners or fixed appliances: a descriptive cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the effects of removable
aligners and fixed appliances on the supragingival bacterial communities
in adult female patients undergoing orthodontic
treatment.MethodsSupragingival plaque samples from 48 female individuals
underwent microbiome analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) using PacBio
Sequel sequencing. The study included 13 adults without orthodontic
treatment needs as the control group (Group C), and 35 patients with
comparable initial orthodontic conditions who received treatment at a
university clinic in Beijing, China. The treatment involved either
traditional fixed brackets (Group B, n = 17) or Invisalign® aligners
(Group AT, n = 18). Bioinformatics methods were used for data
analysis.ResultsFrom the 48 plaque samples, a total of 334,961 valid
reads were obtained, averaging 6,978 sequences per sample. The 16S rDNA
sequences were classified into 25,727 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).
Significant variances in alpha and beta diversity among the groups were
noted. Group B microbiome exhibited an increased presence of
Gram-negative bacteria. At the phylum level, Actinobacteriota was
significantly more prevalent in Group C samples, while Bacteroidota was
enriched in Group B samples. Family-level relative abundance analysis
showed a notable increase in Saccharibacteria (formerly TM7) and
Prevotellaceae in Group B. Genus-level analysis revealed a significant
rise in Lautropia in Group AT. Fixed orthodontic appliances were linked
to oral microbiome changes, notably an enhanced relative abundance of
anaerobes, including periodontal pathogens.ConclusionThe observation
points to the impact of orthodontic appliance on the oral microbial
community, highlighting the difference between traditional braces (Group
B) and clear aligners (Group AT)in terms of the predominance of
anaerobic and gram negative bacteria. This emphasizes the importance of
considering the microbiological effects when choosing orthodontic
appliance and underscores the need for tailored oral hygiene practices
for individuals undergoing these treatments. This research might provide
insights that could assist in the development of innovative cleaning
techniques and antibacterial materials.</p>

(Nosema) ceranae can promote Serratia development in honeybee gut: an
underrated threat for bees?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The genus Serratia harbors opportunistic pathogenic species, among
which Serratia marcescens is pathogenic for honeybees although little
studied. Recently, virulent strains of S. marcescens colonizing the
Varroa destructor mite’s mouth were found vectored into the honeybee
body, leading to septicemia and death. Serratia also occurs as an
opportunistic pathogen in the honeybee’s gut with a low absolute
abundance. The Serratia population seems controlled by the host immune
system, but its presence may represent a hidden threat, ready to arise
when honeybees are weakened by biotic and abiotic stressors. To shed
light on the Serratia pathogen, this research aims at studying
Serratia’s development dynamics in the honeybee body and its
interactions with the co-occurring fungal pathogen Vairimorpha ceranae.
Firstly, the degree of pathogenicity and the ability to permeate the gut
epithelial barrier of three Serratia strains, isolated from honeybees
and belonging to different species (S. marcescens, Serratia
liquefaciens, and Serratia nematodiphila), were assessed by artificial
inoculation of newborn honeybees with different Serratia doses (104,
106, and 108 cells/mL). The absolute abundance of Serratia in the gut
and in the hemocoel was assessed in qPCR with primers targeting the luxS
gene. Moreover, the absolute abundance of Serratia was assessed in the
gut of honeybees infected with V. ceranae at different development
stages and supplied with beneficial microorganisms and fumagillin. Our
results showed that all tested Serratia strains could pass through the
gut epithelial barrier and proliferate in the hemocoel, with S.
marcescens being the most pathogenic. Moreover, under cage conditions,
Serratia better proliferates when a V. ceranae infection is
co-occurring, with a positive and significant correlation. Finally,
fumagillin and some of the tested beneficial microorganisms could
control both Serratia and Vairimorpha development. Our findings suggest
a correlation between the two pathogens under laboratory conditions, a
co-occurring infection that should be taken into consideration by
researches when testing antimicrobial compounds active against V.
ceranae, and the related honeybees survival rate. Moreover, our findings
suggest a positive control of Serratia by the environmental
microorganism Apilactobacillus kunkeei in a in vivo model, confirming
the potential of this specie as beneficial bacteria for honeybees.</p>

falciparum AMA1 and CSP antigen diversity in parasite isolates from
southern Ghana</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDiversity in malarial antigens is an immune evasion
mechanism that gives malaria parasites an edge over the host. Immune
responses against one variant of a polymorphic antigen are usually not
fully effective against other variants due to altered epitopes. This
study aimed to evaluate diversity in the Plasmodium falciparum antigens
apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP)
from circulating parasites in a malaria-endemic community in southern
Ghana and to determine the effects of polymorphisms on antibody response
specificity.MethodsThe study involved 300 subjects, whose P. falciparum
infection status was determined by microscopy and PCR. Diversity within
the two antigens was evaluated by msp2 gene typing and molecular gene
sequencing, while the host plasma levels of antibodies against PfAMA1,
PfCSP, and two synthetic 24mer peptides from the conserved central
repeat region of PfCSP, were measured by ELISA. ResultsOf the 300
subjects, 171 (57%) had P. falciparum infection, with 165 of the 171
(96.5%) being positive for either or both of the msp2 allelic families.
Gene sequencing of DNA from 55 clonally infected samples identified a
total of 56 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
the Pfama1 gene and these resulted in 44 polymorphic positions,
including two novel positions (363 and 365). Sequencing of the Pfcsp
gene from 69 clonal DNA samples identified 50 non-synonymous SNPs that
resulted in 42 polymorphic positions, with half (21) of these
polymorphic positions being novel. Of the measured antibodies, only
anti-PfCSP antibodies varied considerably between PCR parasite-positive
and parasite-negative persons. DiscussionThese data confirm the presence
of a considerable amount of unique, previously unreported amino acid
changes, especially within PfCSP. Drivers for this diversity in the
Pfcsp gene do not immediately seem apparent, as immune pressure will be
expected to drive a similar level of diversity in the Pfama1 gene.</p>
