anti-virulence therapies in combating methicillin- and
vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDespite years of efforts to develop new antibiotics for
eradicating multidrug-resistant (MDR) and multi-virulent
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infections, treatment
failures and poor prognoses in most cases have been common. Therefore,
there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches targeting
virulence arrays. Our aim is to discover new anti-virulence therapies
targeting MRSA and VRSA virulence arrays.MethodologyWe employed
phenotypic, molecular docking, and genetic studies to screen for
anti-virulence activities among selected promising compounds: Coumarin,
Simvastatin, and Ibuprofen.ResultsWe found that nearly all detected MRSA
and VRSA strains exhibited MDR and multi-virulent profiles. The
molecular docking results aligned with the phenotypic and genetic
assessments of virulence production. Biofilm and hemolysin productions
were inhibited, and all virulence genes were downregulated upon
treatment with sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of these
promising compounds. Ibuprofen was the most active compound, exhibiting
the highest inhibition and downregulation of virulence gene products.
Moreover, in vivo and histopathological studies confirmed these results.
Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in wound area and
improvements in re-epithelialization and tissue organization in the
Ibuprofen and antimicrobial treated group compared with the group
treated with antimicrobial alone. These findings support the idea that a
combination of Ibuprofen and antimicrobial drugs may offer a promising
new therapy for MRSA and VRSA infections.ConclusionWe hope that our
findings can be implemented in clinical practice to assist physicians in
making the most suitable treatment decisions.</p>

next-generation sequencing promotes pathogen detection over culture in
joint infections with previous antibiotic exposure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the diagnostic value of metagenomic
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogens from joint
infection (JI) synovial fluid (SF) samples with previous antibiotic
exposure.MethodsFrom January 2019 to January 2022, 59 cases with
suspected JI were enrolled. All cases had antibiotic exposure within 2
weeks before sample collection. mNGS and conventional culture were
performed on SF samples. JI was diagnosed based on history and clinical
symptoms in conjunction with MSIS criteria. The diagnostic values,
including sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values
(PPV/NPV), and accuracy, were in comparison with mNGS and
culture.ResultsThere were 47 of the 59 cases diagnosed with JI, while
the remaining 12 were diagnosed with non-infectious diseases. The
sensitivity of mNGS was 68.1%, which was significantly higher than that
of culture (25.5%, p&lt;0.01). The accuracy of mNGS was significantly
higher at 71.2% compared to the culture at 39.0% (p &lt;0.01). Eleven
pathogenic strains were detected by mNGS but not by microbiological
culture, which included Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus
cohnii, Finegoldia magna, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus
saprophytics, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Acinetobacter pittii, Brucella ovis, andCoxiella burnetii.
Antibiotic therapy was adjusted based on the mNGS results in 32 (68.1%)
patients, including 12 (25.5%) and 20 (42.6%) patients, in whom
treatment was upgraded and changed, respectively. All JI patients
underwent surgery and received subsequent antibiotic therapy. They were
followed up for an average of 23 months (20-27 months), and the success
rate of treatment was 89.4%. Out of the 33 patients who had positive
results for pathogens, reoperation was performed in 1 case (3.03%),
while out of the 14 cases with negative results for both mNGS and
cultures, reoperation was performed in 4 cases (28.6%).ConclusionsmNGS
has advantages over conventional culture in detecting pathogens in SF
samples from JI patients previously treated with antibiotics,
potentially improving clinical outcomes.</p>
