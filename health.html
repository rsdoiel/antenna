id="analysis-of-the-correlation-between-cervical-hpv-infection-cervical-lesions-and-vaginal-microecology">Analysis
of the correlation between cervical HPV infection, cervical lesions and
vaginal microecology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundVaginal microbiota is involved in human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection and cervical cancer (CC) progression, and the specific
changes in vaginal microbial composition during this process remains
uncertain.ObjectiveThis study aimed to observe the changes in the
specific composition of vaginal microorganisms in different cervical
lesions and identify biomarkers at different stages of lesions.MethodsIn
this study we used the illumina high-throughput gene sequencing
technology to determine the V4 region of 16SrRNA and observed the
vaginal microbial composition in different cervical lesions.ResultsThe
vaginal microbiota of patients with high-risk HPV infection and cervical
lesions is significantly different from that of the normal population,
but there is no significant difference in the richness of vaginal
microbes. The diversity of vaginal species in CC patients is higher than
that in high-risk HPV infection or CIN patients. The main manifestation
is an increase in the diversity of vaginal microbes, a decrease in the
relative abundance of cyanobacteria and Lactobacillus, and an increase
in the relative abundance of dialister, peptonephila and other
miscellaneous bacteria. There are characteristic vaginal biomarker in
normal women, high risk HPV patients and CC patients. In detail, the
biomarker in the normal group was varibaculum, the biomarker in the
high-risk HPV group was saccharopolyspora, the biomarker of the CC group
was the Proteobacteria, Corynebacterium, Coprococcus, Peptococcus and
Ruminococcus.ConclusionsThe study indicated that the compositions of
vaginal microbes in different cervical lesions is different. The vaginal
microbial composition has a certain diagnostic effect on healthy women,
patients with high-risk HPV infection and cervical lesions. These
microbes may serve as potential biomarkers for CC. It also provided an
effective way for the treatment of HPV infections and cervical
lesions.</p>

and prognostic potential of the intra-tumoral microbiota profile in
HPV-independent endocervical adenocarcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMicrobial community dynamics have been involved in numerous
diseases, including cancer. The diversity of intertumoral microbiota in
human papillomavirus independent endocervical adenocarcinoma (HPVI ECA)
is not well-characterized.ObjectiveOur objective is to delineate the
intratumoral microbiota profile in HPVI ECA and investigate its
potential influence on oncogenesis.MethodsWe analyzed 45 HPVI ECA cases,
comprising 36 gastric-type ECA (GEA) and 9 clear cell carcinomas (CCC).
We compared the microbial composition within cancerous and adjacent
noncancerous tissue samples using 5R-16S ribosomal DNA sequencing.
Further, we investigated the correlation between specific microbes and
clinical-pathological metrics as well as patient outcomes.ResultsOur
findings demonstrate notable differences in the microbial spectra
between cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissues. Amongst HPVI ECA
subtypes, GEAs exhibit more microbial variations compared to CCCs. Using
the Random Forest algorithm, we identified two distinct microbial
signatures that could act as predictive biomarkers for HPVI ECA and
differentiate between GEA and CCC. Varied microbial abundances was
related to clinical characteristics of HPVI ECA patients. In addition,
high levels of Micrococcus and low levels of unknown genus75 from the
Comamonadaceae family were associated with poorer outcomes in HPVI ECA
patients. Similarly, an abundance of Microbacterium correlated with
reduced overall survival (OS), and a high presence of Streptococcaceae
family microbes was linked to reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) in
GEA patients. Intriguingly, a high abundance of Micrococcus was also
associated with a worse OS in GEA patients.ConclusionThe study reveals
distinct microbial signatures in HPVI ECA, which have potential as
biomarkers for disease prognosis. The correlation between these
tumor-associated microbiota features and clinicopathological
characteristics underscores the possibility of microbiome-based
interventions. Our research provides a foundation for more in-depth
studies into the cervical microbiome’s role in HPVI ECA.</p>

characteristics of mycoplasma pneumoniae in hospitalized children
before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Chongqing,
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a significant cause of
community-acquired pneumonia with high macrolide resistance rates.
Various COVID-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted the prevalence of
MP.ObjectiveTo assess the changes in the pattern of MP infections among
children before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsA total
of 36685 enrolled patients, aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with pneumonia
and admitted to Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from
January 2019 to December 2023, were retrospectively reviewed in this
study. The epidemiological characteristics of pediatric MP infection
were analyzed.ResultsAmong 36685 patients, 7610 (20.74%) tested positive
for MP. The highest positive rate was observed among children aged over
6 years (55.06%). There was no gender disparity in MP infection across
the three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital stays were longest
for children during the COVID-19 pandemic (P &lt;0.001). MP infection
was most prevalent in the summer (29.64%). The lowest positive rate was
observed during the pandemic, with the highest rate found after easing
the measures across all age groups (P &lt;0.001). There was a surge in
the positive rate of MP in the third year after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Regression analyses demonstrated a shift in the age range susceptible to
MP infection, with children aged 3.8 to 13.5 years post-pandemic
compared to the pre-pandemic range of 5.3 to 15.5 years old.
Additionally, the average macrolide resistance rate was 79.84%. We
observed a higher resistance rate during the pandemic than in the pre-
and post-pandemic phases (P &lt;0.001).ConclusionThe restrictive
measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have influenced the
spread of MP to some extent and altered demographic and clinical
characteristics, such as age, age group, season, length of stay, and
macrolide resistance. We recommend continuous surveillance of the
evolving epidemiological characteristics of MP infection in the
post-pandemic period when restrictions are no longer necessary.</p>

of new lineages of RSV-A and RSV-B in Kuwait shows high diversity in the
N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in the G protein between 2020 and
2022</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant health
concern, particularly for infants, young children, and the elderly. This
virus is known to evolve continuously due to environmental factors and
herd immunity. In light of this, our study aimed to analyze the genetic
variability of the G protein in RSV-A and RSV-B genotypes in Kuwait from
2020 to 2022. Between January 2020 and September 2022, we collected 490
respiratory samples from hospitalized patients with acute respiratory
tract infections. These samples were tested and confirmed positive for
RSV using multiplex Real-Time PCR. Subsequently, the samples underwent
nucleic acid sequencing using the advanced Nanopore sequencing
technology to analyze the full-length G gene. Sequence analysis showed
that 64 isolates (76%) were RSV-A, and 20 isolates (24%) were RSV-B. The
G genes of RSV-A belonged to genotype GA2.3.5, while all the RSV-B
genotypes belonged to GB5.0.5a. New lineages and sub-lineages of RSV-A
and RSV-B were detected, indicating the circulation of new strains in
Kuwait. Many unique and new amino acid changes, including insertions,
were found in the G proteins of Kuwaiti isolates, with the highest
variability in the second hypervariable region. An increased number of N
and O-linked glycosylation sites were also identified in the G protein,
which could speculate to alter the antigenicity of RSV. The identified
changes in the G protein of RSV-A and RSV-B genotypes might result from
immune pressure and could affect the antigenic characteristics of
circulating strains in Kuwait. This could potentially lead to new RSV
variants that can evade the immune response. Our in-depth analysis of
the G proteins of both RSV-A and RSV-B could aid in the development of
more potent treatments and vaccines.</p>

effects of Qingchang Ligan formula on hepatic encephalopathy in mouse
model: results from gut microbiome-metabolomics analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological disorder
resulting from advanced liver injury. HE has a high mortality rate and
poor prognosis. The pathogenesis of HE is still unclear, which has led
to the lack of a satisfactory specific treatment method. There is
increasing evidence that the intestinal flora affects the communication
between the gut and the brain in the pathogenesis of HE. Adjusting the
intestinal flora has had a beneficial effect on HE in recent studies,
and the Qingchang Ligan formula (QCLG) has been shown in previous
studies to regulate intestinal flora and metabolites. In this study, we
established a thioacetamide-induced HE mouse model to evaluate the
protective effect of QCLG on HE and explore its potential mechanism,
which also demonstrated that intestinal flora dysbiosis is involved in
the pathogenesis of HE.MethodsMice were intraperitoneally injected with
thioacetamide (TAA, 150 mg/kg) to induce HE. Additionally, they were
orally administered Qingchang Ligan Formula (QCLG) at a dose of 6.725
g/kg·d for seven days, while control mice received an equal volume of
saline via gavage. Subsequently, samples were subjected to 16S ribosomal
ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing, high-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)
analysis.ResultQCLG improved weight loss, cognitive impairment,
neurological function scores, blood ammonia, and brain gene expression
of interleukin-6 (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6
(IL-6) induced by HE. Moreover, QCLG increased the levels of liver
function indicators, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), and serum TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. 16S RNA
sequencing revealed increased Oscillibacter, Colidextribacter, and
Helicobacter in TAA-induced mouse fecal samples. Also, the abundance of
Bifidobacterium decreases TAA-induced mouse fecal samples. In contrast,
QCLG treatment significantly restored the gut microbial community.
Metabolomics indicated significant differences in some metabolites among
the normal control, treatment, and model groups, including
5-methoxytryptophan, Daidzein, Stercobilin, and Plumieride
(PLU).ConclusionQCLG can alleviate neuroinflammation and prevent HE
caused by liver injury by regulating intestinal flora in mouse
models.</p>

characteristics of human herpes viruses in the lower respiratory tract
and their impact on 30-day mortality in community-acquired pneumonia
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Human herpes viruses (HHVs) are commonly detected in
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, particularly those with
complex complications, attracting increased attention from clinical
practitioners. However, the significance of detecting HHVs in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) with CAP patients is still unclear.
This study retrospectively analyzed BALF samples from 64 CAP patients at
the Kunming Third People’s Hospital between August 2021 and December
2023. Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) was conducted on
BALF samples during CAP onset. Multivariate Cox regression models were
used to identify independent risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality
in CAP. HHVs were found in 84.4% of CAP patients, which were the most
common pathogens (45.1%), followed by bacteria (30.2%) and fungi
(11.5%). Bacterial-viral co-infections were most common, occurring in 39
patients. Notably, there was no significant difference in HHV presence
between severe and non-severe CAP patients (EBV: P = 0.431, CMV: P =
0.825), except for HHV-7 (P = 0.025). In addition, there was no
significant difference in the 30-day mortality between HHV positive and
HHV negative groups (P = 0.470), as well as between the HHV-7 positive
and HHV-7 negative groups (P = 0.910). However, neither HHVs nor HHV-7
was independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in CAP patients (HHVs:
HR 1.171, P = 0.888; HHV-7: HR 1.947, P = 0.382). In summary, among the
prevalent presence of multiple HHVs, EBV and CMV were the most prevalent
in CAP patients. Patients with sCAP were more susceptible to HHV-7 than
those with non-sCAP. These results provide valuable insights for
clinicians in guiding appropriate interventions for CAP treatment.</p>

blood transcriptomic signatures in patients with herpes zoster and
postherpetic neuralgia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, severe, and hard-to-treat
chronic pain condition in clinics. Although PHN is developed from herpes
zoster (HZ), the developing mechanism is unknown. A previous study
investigated blood metabolomic and proteomic profiling in patients with
PHN and HZ. The current study aims to explore the blood transcriptomic
signature of PHN compared to HZ patients. Whole blood from eight PHN and
15 HZ patients was used for RNA-Seq analysis. There were 82 and 1,788
genes detected specifically in the PHN and HZ groups, respectively.
PHN-specific genes are involved in viral infection, lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism, and immune response. For genes coexpressed in
PHN and HZ patients, there were 407 differential expression genes
(DEGs), including 205 upregulated (UP DEGs) and 202 downregulated (DOWN
DEGs) in PHN compared to HZ groups. DEGs are involved in viral
infection, type I interferon (IFN), and hemoglobin and oxygen carrier
activity. UP DEGs are associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs),
activated NK cells, and neutrophils, while DOWN DEGs are associated with
Tregs, resting NK cells, and monocytes. The results suggest that the
metabolism of lipid, glycan, and nucleotides, type I IFN signaling, and
altered neutrophil activation are associated with and might contribute
to the development of PHN in HZ. It is also suggested that persistent or
altered activation of nonspecific immunity may contribute to the
development of PHN from HZ.</p>

pathogen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The collective involvement of virulence markers of Escherichia coli
as an emerging pathogen associated with periodontitis remains
unexplained. This study aimed to implement an in vitro model of
infection using a human epithelial cell line to determine the virulome
expression related to the antibiotic and disinfectant resistance
genotype and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type in E. coli
strains isolated from patients with periodontal diseases. We studied 100
strains of E. coli isolated from patients with gingivitis (n = 12),
moderate periodontitis (n = 59), and chronic periodontitis (n = 29). The
identification of E. coli and antibiotic and disinfectant resistance
genes was performed through PCR. To promote the expression of virulence
genes in the strains, an in vitro infection model was used in the human
epithelial cell line A549. RNA was extracted using the QIAcube robotic
equipment and reverse transcription to cDNA was performed using the
QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). The determination of
virulence gene expression was performed through real-time PCR. Overall,
the most frequently expressed adhesion genes among the isolated strains
of gingivitis, moderate periodontitis, and chronic periodontitis were
fimH (48%), iha (37%), and papA (18%); those for toxins were usp (33%);
those for iron acquisition were feoB (84%), fyuA (62%), irp-2 (61%), and
iroN (35%); those for protectins were traT (50%), KpsMT (35%), and ompT
(28%); and those for pathogenicity islands were malX (45%). The most
common antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genes among gingivitis,
moderate periodontitis, and chronic periodontitis strains were sul-2
(43%), blaSHV (47%), blaTEM (45%), tet(A) (41%), dfrA1 (32%), marR-marO
(57%), and qacEA1 (79%). The findings revealed the existence of a wide
distribution of virulome expression profiles related to the antibiotic
and disinfectant resistance genotype and PFGE type in periodontal
strains of E. coli. These findings may contribute toward improving the
prevention and treatment measures for periodontal diseases associated
with E. coli.</p>

alphaviruses with emphasis on neurological implications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Arthritogenic alphaviruses pose a significant public health concern
due to their ability to cause joint inflammation, with emerging evidence
of potential neurological consequences. In this review, we examine the
immunopathology and immune evasion strategies employed by these viruses,
highlighting their complex mechanisms of pathogenesis and neurological
implications. We delve into how these viruses manipulate host immune
responses, modulate inflammatory pathways, and potentially establish
persistent infections. Further, we explore their ability to breach the
blood-brain barrier, triggering neurological complications, and how
co-infections exacerbate neurological outcomes. This review synthesizes
current research to provide a comprehensive overview of the
immunopathological mechanisms driving arthritogenic alphavirus
infections and their impact on neurological health. By highlighting
knowledge gaps, it underscores the need for research to unravel the
complexities of virus-host interactions. This deeper understanding is
crucial for developing targeted therapies to address both joint and
neurological manifestations of these infections.</p>

Toxoplasma gondii thioredoxin with cell adhesion and antioxidant
function</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundToxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a widespread, zoonotic
protozoan intracellular parasite with a complex life cycle, which can
cause toxoplasmosis, a potentially serious disease. During the invasion
process, T. gondii proteins first bind to the relevant host cell
receptors, such as glycosaminoglycan molecule (GAG-binding motif), which
is one of the main receptors for parasites or virus to infect host
cells. However, research on TGME49_216510 (T. gondii Trx21), a protein
from Toxoplasma gondii, is limited.MethodsBioinformatics analysis of the
Trx21 protein was performed firstly. And specific primers were then
designed using the conserved domain and GAG-binding motif to amplify,
express, and purify a fragment of the Trx21 protein. The purified
Trx21-GST protein was used for antioxidant and cell adhesion
experiments. Simultaneously, mice were immunized with Trx21-His to
generate specific polyclonal antibodies for subcellular localization
analysis.ResultsThe Trx21 protein, consisting of 774 amino acids,
included a transmembrane region, three GAG-binding motifs, and a
Thioredoxin-like domain. The recombinant Trx21-His protein had a
molecular mass of about 31 kDa, while the Trx21-GST protein had a
molecular mass of about 55 kDa, which was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
Western blot. Subcellular localization analysis by IFA revealed that
Trx21 is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm of T. gondii.
Furthermore, Trx21 exhibited a protective effect on supercoiled DNA
against metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) and demonstrated adhesion
abilities to Vero cells.ConclusionsThese results indicate that Trx21
plays an important role in host cell interaction and oxidative
damage.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe emergence of disinfectant resistance has become a
severe threat due to reduced effectiveness. This study was undertaken to
determine how bacteria adapt to survive exposure to disinfectants in the
busiest section of a tertiary care hospital in Varanasi,
India.MethodsFour isolates (two Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kp1 and Kp2; two
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pa1 and Pa2) were obtained from chlorhexidine
(CHX)–based handwash during microbiological surveillance of “in-use
disinfectants” in hospital. Six disinfectants [4% CHX, 2%
glutaraldehyde, 7.5% hydrogen peroxide, 1% sodium hypochlorite and 0.1%
benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and 70% ethyl alcohol] were tested against
these four isolates to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Antibiotic profile, change
in MIC on exposure to disinfectants and biofilm formation in the
presence and absence of disinfectants was studied. Whole genome
sequencing (WGS) was done to identify the resistance
mechanisms.ResultThe isolates showed the highest MBC/MIC ratio (4)
against glutaraldehyde. Exposure to supra-inhibitory concentration of
BAC for 21 days resulted in doubling of MIC/MBC. The majority (75%) of
the isolates were multidrug resistant. All the isolates were strong
biofilm producers. The reduction rate of biofilm formation decreased
with an increase in the concentration of disinfectants (p = 0.05 for
BAC). WGS revealed multiple AMR genes including blaDIM-1,
disinfectant-resistant gene and efflux pump genes.ConclusionThe study
emphasized the various adaptation strategies of these isolates for
survival in disinfectant environment, thus posing a huge challenge for
their control in the hospital environment.</p>

the Ningbo region. Importantly, we sought to elucidate its molecular
characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms. This information will provide
evidence-based insights for preventing and controlling nosocomial
infections and facilitate improved clinical diagnosis and treatment in
this region. Methods96 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
strains were collected from the Ningbo region between January 2021 and
December 2022. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic methods were
employed to identify and characterize CR-hvKP strains at the molecular
level. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of common clinical
antibiotics were determined using the VITEK-2 Compact automatic
microbiological analyzer. Plasmid conjugation experiments evaluated the
transferability of resistance plasmids. Finally, mouse virulence assays
were conducted to explore the pathogenic mechanisms.ResultsAmong the 96
strains, a single CR-hvKP strain, designated CR-hvKP57, was identified,
with an isolation frequency of 1.04%. Whole-genome sequencing revealed
the strain to be ST23 serotype with a K1 capsule. This strain harbored
three plasmids. Plasmid 1, a pLVPK-like virulence plasmid, carried
multiple virulence genes, including rmpA, rmpA2, iroB, iucA, and terB.
Plasmid 2 contained transposable element sequences such as IS15 and
IS26. Plasmid 3, classified as a resistance plasmid, harbored the
blaKPC-3 carbapenem resistance gene. Mouse virulence assays demonstrated
a high mortality rate associated with CR-hvKP57 infection. Additionally,
there was a significant increase in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in
response to CR-hvKP57 infection, indicating varying degrees of
inflammatory response. Western blot experiments further suggested that
the pathogenic mechanism involves activation of the NF-κB signaling
pathway.ConclusionThis study confirms the emergence of hypervirulent
CR-hvKP in the Ningbo region, which likely resulted from the acquisition
of a pLVPK-like virulence plasmid and a blaKPC-3 resistance plasmid by
the ST23-K1 type Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our findings highlight the
urgent need for more judicious use of antibiotics to limit the emergence
of resistance. Additionally, strengthening infection prevention and
control measures is crucial to minimize the spread of virulence and
resistance plasmids.</p>

progress on the pattern recognition receptors involved in porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the
most economically devastating infectious diseases of pigs globally. The
pathogen, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV),
is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus, which is considered to be
the key triggers for the activation of effective innate immunity through
pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-dependent signaling pathways.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin
receptors (CLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and Cytoplasmic DNA
receptors (CDRs) are used as PRRs to identify distinct but overlapping
microbial components. The innate immune system has evolved to recognize
RNA or DNA molecules from microbes through pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) and to induce defense response against infections, including the
production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and inflammatory cytokines.
However, PRRSV is capable of continuous evolution through gene mutation
and recombination to evade host immune defenses and exploit host cell
mechanisms to synthesize and transport its components, thereby
facilitating successful infection and replication. This review presents
the research progress made in recent years in the study of these PRRs
and their associated adapters during PRRSV infection.</p>

of anti-biofilm peptide CRAMP-34 on the biofilms of Acinetobacter
lwoffii derived from dairy cows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Dairy mastitis is one of the most common diseases in dairy farming,
and the formation of pathogenic bacteria biofilms may be an important
reason why traditional antibiotic therapy fails to resolve some cases of
dairy mastitis. We isolated and identified three strains of A. lwoffii
were with strong biofilm forming ability from dairy cow mastitis samples
from Chongqing dairy farms in China. In order to investigate the effect
of novel anti-biofilm peptide CRAMP-34 on A.lwoffii biofilms, the
anti-biofilm effect was evaluated by crystal violet staining, biofilms
viable bacteria counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
In addition, transcriptome sequencing analysis, qRT-PCR and phenotypic
verification were used to explore the mechanism of its action. The
results showed that CRAMP-34 had a dose-dependent eradicating effect on
A. lwoffii biofilms. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that 36
differentially expressed genes (11 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated)
were detected after the intervention with the sub-inhibitory
concentration of CRAMP-34. These differentially expressed genes may be
related to enzyme synthesis, fimbriae, iron uptake system, capsular
polysaccharide and other virulence factors through the functional
analysis of differential genes. The results of subsequent bacterial
motility and adhesion tests showed that the motility of A.lwoffii were
enhanced after the intervention of CRAMP-34, but there was no
significant change in adhesion. It was speculated that CRAMP-34 may
promote the dispersion of biofilm bacteria by enhancing the motility of
biofilm bacteria, thereby achieving the effect of eradicating biofilms.
Therefore, these results, along with our other previous findings,
suggest that CRAMP-34 holds promise as a new biofilm eradicator and
deserves further research and development.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the clinical
features, treatment outcomes, and short-term prognosis in kidney
transplant recipients (KTRs) with concurrent coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pneumonia.MethodsKTRs with COVID-19 pneumonia who were
admitted to our hospital from December 28, 2022, to March 28, 2023 were
included in the study. Their clinical symptoms, responses to antiviral
medications, and short-term prognosis were analyzed.ResultsA total of 64
KTRs with initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this
study. The primary symptoms were fever, cough, and myalgia, with an
incidence of 79.7%, 89.1%, and 46.9%, respectively. The administration
of antiviral drugs (paxlovid or molnupiravir) within 1–5 days and for
over 5 days demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral
shedding time compared to the group without antiviral medication
(P=0.002). Both the paxlovid and molnupiravir treatment groups exhibited
a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding time in comparison to
the group without antiviral drugs (P=0.002). After 6 months of recovery,
there was no significantly negative impact on transplant kidney function
(P=0.294).ConclusionFever, cough, and myalgia remain common initial
symptoms of concurrent COVID-19 pneumonia in KTRs. Early use of
antiviral drugs (paxlovid or molnupiravir) is associated with better
therapeutic outcomes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) had a limited impact on the short-term renal function of
the KTRs with concurrent moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the pathogenesis of
hyperglycemia and its associated vasculopathy using multiomics analyses
in diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, and validate the mechanism
using the cell experiments.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the metagenomic sequencing data of diabetes to
explore the key genera related to its occurrence. Subsequently,
participants diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and
healthy subjects, were recruited for fecal and blood sample collection.
The dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (GM) and its associated metabolites
were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatograph mass
spectrometry, respectively. The regulation of gene and protein
expression was evaluated through mRNA sequencing and data-independent
acquisition technology, respectively. The specific mechanism by which GM
dysbiosis affects hyperglycemia and its related vasculopathy was
investigated using real-time qPCR, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay techniques in HepG2 cells and
neutrophils.ResultsBased on the published data, the key alterable genera
in the GM associated with diabetes were identified as Blautia,
Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Faecalibacterium,
Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Lachnoclostridium. The
related metabolic pathways were identified as cholate degradation and
L-histidine biosynthesis. Noteworthy, Blautia and Faecalibacterium
displayed similar alterations in patients with IGT compared to those
observed in patients with diabetes, and the GM metabolites,
tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and carnosine (CARN, a downstream
metabolite of histidine and alanine) were both found to be decreased,
which in turn regulated the expression of proteins in plasma and mRNAs
in neutrophils. Subsequent experiments focused on insulin-like growth
factor-binding protein 3 and interleukin-6 due to their impact on blood
glucose regulation and associated vascular inflammation. Both proteins
were found to be suppressed by TUDCA and CARN in HepG2 cells and
neutrophils.ConclusionDysbiosis of the GM occurred throughout the entire
progression from IGT to diabetes, characterized by an increase in
Blautia and a decrease in Faecalibacterium, leading to reduced levels of
TUDCA and CARN, which alleviated their inhibition on the expression of
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and interleukin-6,
contributing to the development of hyperglycemia and associated
vasculopathy.</p>

infections in etiology of mental disorders: a broad analysis of cytokine
profile similarities – a narrative review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The recent pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated
mental health complications have renewed scholarly interest in the
relationship between viral infections and the development of mental
illnesses, a topic that was extensively discussed in the previous
century in the context of other viruses, such as influenza. The most
probable and analyzable mechanism through which viruses influence the
onset of mental illnesses is the inflammation they provoke. Both
infections and mental illnesses share a common characteristic: an
imbalance in inflammatory factors. In this study, we sought to analyze
and compare cytokine profiles in individuals infected with viruses and
those suffering from mental illnesses. The objective was to determine
whether specific viral diseases can increase the risk of specific mental
disorders and whether this risk can be predicted based on the cytokine
profile of the viral disease. To this end, we reviewed existing
literature, constructed cytokine profiles for various mental and viral
diseases, and conducted comparative analyses. The collected data
indicate that the risk of developing a specific mental illness cannot be
determined solely based on cytokine profiles. However, it was observed
that the combination of IL-8 and IL-10 is frequently associated with
psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to assess the risk of mental disorders in
infected patients, it is imperative to consider the type of virus, the
mental complications commonly associated with it, the predominant
cytokines to evaluate the risk of psychotic symptoms, and additional
patient-specific risk factors.</p>

HIV-infected patients: a 10-year study from an infectious disease
specialist hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCryptococcosis is an invasive infection that commonly
affects immunosuppressed individuals, especially patients with HIV
infection. Cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients should be
considered a major health concern because it is associated with high
morbidity and mortality rates. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of cryptococcal
infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients to
facilitate effective clinical management and improve patient
outcomes.MethodsWe reviewed and analyzed the clinical data and relevant
laboratory test results of HIV-infected patients with positive
cryptococcal cultures and reserved strains between 2013 and 2023 from
Beijing Youan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University. The
clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of the patients
were compared, and the correlation between parameters and the prognoses
of the patients at different observation timepoints (3, 6, 9, and 12
months) was analyzed.ResultsA total of 76 patients (70 males and six
females; median age, 37 years) were included in this study. The results
indicated that the later the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
after the diagnosis of HIV infection (&gt; 6 months), the higher the
probability of death. Analysis of the correlation between the time of
ART initiation and the timing of treatment for cryptococcal infections
showed that the time of ART initiation was strongly related to survival
at different timepoints. Initiation of ART time within 0-4 weeks, 4-6
weeks and more than 6weeks of starting treatment for Cryptococcus
infection was associated with a lower mortality rate at 12-month, the
3-month, 6- and 9-month follow-up timepoint
separately.ConclusionsAlthough cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected
patients continues to be a challenging and intricate issue, ART is a key
factor that affects its prognosis. The later ART is started, the worse
the prognosis of the infection. The time of ART initiation and the
timing of treatment for cryptococcal infections should be further
refined and balanced based on different clinical courses. Thus,
clinicians should pay closer attention to cryptococcal infections in
patients with HIV infection and initiate ART based on the patient’s
clinical condition.</p>

immune factors involved in the rapid clearance of bacteria from the
midgut of the tick Ixodes ricinus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ticks are obligate hematophagous arthropods that transmit a wide
range of pathogens to humans as well as wild and domestic animals. They
also harbor a non-pathogenic microbiota, although our previous study has
shown that the diverse bacterial microbiome in the midgut of Ixodes
ricinus is quantitatively poor and lacks a core. In artificial
infections by capillary feeding of ticks with two model bacteria
(Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative Pantoea sp.), rapid
clearance of these microbes from the midgut was observed, indicating the
presence of active immune mechanisms in this organ. In the current
study, RNA-seq analysis was performed on the midgut of I. ricinus
females inoculated with either M. luteus or Pantoea sp. or with sterile
water as a control. While no immune-related transcripts were upregulated
by microbial inoculation compared to that of the sterile control,
capillary feeding itself triggered dramatic transcriptional changes in
the tick midgut. Manual curation of the transcriptome from the midgut of
unfed I. ricinus females, complemented by the proteomic analysis,
revealed the presence of several constitutively expressed putative
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are independent of microbial
stimulation and are referred to here as ‘guard’ AMPs. These included two
types of midgut-specific defensins, two different domesticated amidase
effector 2 (Dae2), microplusin/ricinusin-related molecules, two
lysozymes, and two gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductases
(GILTs). The in vitro antimicrobial activity assays of two synthetic
mature defensins, defensin 1 and defensin 8, confirmed their specificity
against Gram-positive bacteria showing exceptional potency to inhibit
the growth of M. luteus at nanomolar concentrations. The antimicrobial
activity of midgut defensins is likely part of a multicomponent system
responsible for the rapid clearance of bacteria in the tick midgut.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of other identified
‘guard’ AMPs in controlling microorganisms entering the tick midgut.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Postoperative delayed gastric emptying is a prevalent complication
following surgical procedures, imposing heavy physical and financial
burdens on patients. However, current treatment options remain
suboptimal. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have
highlighted that the gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely
associated with postoperative complications. Various factors can disrupt
the gut microbiome after surgery. This review discusses the potential
mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and their metabolites may
contribute to the pathogenesis of postoperative delayed gastric
emptying. However, the current knowledge base is limited in terms of
fully understanding the exact mechanisms involved. It is therefore
evident that further research is required to fully elucidate the role of
the gut microbiome in postoperative delayed gastric emptying, with the
aim of uncovering new possibilities for preventive measures and
therapeutic treatments.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Neonatal sepsis is a major global health challenge, leading to
significant morbidity and mortality in newborns. The search for precise
biomarkers for its early prediction in clinical settings has been
ongoing, with heparin-binding protein (HBP) emerging as a promising
candidate. Originating from granules in neutrophils, HBP is released
into the bloodstream in response to infection and plays a pivotal role
in the body’s inflammatory response. Its significance extends beyond its
inflammatory origins; research indicates dynamic changes in HBP levels
are strongly linked to reduce in-hospital mortality, offering a
prognostic advantage over existing biomarkers. Furthermore, HBP has
demonstrated considerable clinical utility in the early diagnosis and
stratification of neonatal sepsis, suggesting its potential as a
reliable blood marker for early prediction of the disease and its
severity. Its application may extend to guiding the judicious use of
antibiotics in treating newborns, addressing a critical aspect of
neonatal care. Despite these encouraging results, the precise clinical
utility of HBP for diagnosing and treating sepsis in neonates still
demands further clarification through extensive research. This review
delves into the current scientific understanding of HBP’s contribution
to diagnosing, prognosticating, and treating neonatal sepsis, while
considering its future clinical applications.</p>

of Opi3 causes a lipid imbalance that influences the virulence traits of
Cryptococcus neoformans but not cryptococcosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a useful model
for investigating mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis in mammalian hosts.
This pathogen is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis in
immunocompromised patients and is in the critical priority group of the
World Health Organization fungal priority pathogens list. In this study,
we employed a mutant lacking the OPI3 gene encoding a
methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase to characterize the role of
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lipid homeostasis in the virulence of C.
neoformans. We first confirmed that OPI3 was required for growth in
nutrient limiting conditions, a phenotype that could be rescued with
exogenous choline and PC. Additionally, we established that loss of Opi3
and the lack of PC lead to an accumulation of neutral lipids in lipid
droplets and alterations in major lipid classes. The growth defect of
the opi3Δ mutant was also rescued by sorbitol and polyethylene glycol
(PEG), a result consistent with protection of ER function from the
stress caused by lipid imbalance. We then examined the impact of Opi3 on
virulence and found that the dependence of PC synthesis on Opi3 caused
reduced capsule size and this was accompanied by an increase in shed
capsule polysaccharide and changes in cell wall composition. Further
tests of virulence demonstrated that survival in alveolar macrophages
and the ability to cause disease in mice were not impacted by loss of
Opi3 despite the choline auxotrophy of the mutant in vitro. Overall,
this work establishes the contribution of lipid balance to virulence
factor elaboration by C. neoformans and suggests that host choline is
sufficient to support proliferation during disease.</p>

treatment of glutathione in bullfrogs with abnormal hepatic lipid
metabolism revealed by hepatic lipid metabolism and serum metabolomics
analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWith the continuous growth of bullfrog supply, it has
become an important aquaculture species. Due to the lack of actionable
industry standards and regulation, the misuse of anti-disease drugs and
abnormal liver lipid metabolism in bullfrogs have become a major
obstacle to the development of bullfrog aquaculture industry.
Glutathione is a natural tripeptide that can be synthesized
intracellularly, and its physiological functions mainly include the
treatment of liver diseases, antioxidant, detoxification, anti-tumor,
enhancement of immunity, and delaying aging.MethodsIn this study, the
therapeutic effect of glutathione on bullfrogs with abnormal liver lipid
metabolism was revealed from hepatic lipid metabolism and serum
metabolomics analysis. The survival rate, liver histomorphology, serum
antioxidant enzyme activity, liver lipase activity and serum
metabolomics, liver metabolomics were studied and analyzed by feeding
the bullfrogs with abnormal lipid metabolism with glutathione for 20
days in the NC, FI and GSH groups.ResultsThe results of the study showed
that glutathione was able to repair the liver and improve the survival
rate of bullfrogs with abnormal lipid metabolism; the activity of serum
SOD enzymes was significantly increased; the activities of ACP and AKP
were significantly decreased; the activities of HDL-C and T-CHO were
significantly increased; and the activities of LDL-C, TBA, and TG were
significantly decreased in the liver; the contents of metabolites, such
as PC, PS, and PE were significantly up-regulated, and the levels of
up-regulated Autophagy - other, Necroptosis and ErbB signaling pathway,
and down-regulated Sphingolipid metabolism, D-Amino acid metabolism
metabolic pathway, to some extent The metabolic pathways of Sphingolipid
metabolism and D-Amino acid metabolism were down-regulated to alleviate
the disorders of glycerophospholipid and amino acid metabolism to a
certain extent, thus alleviating the abnormalities of liver lipid
metabolism.DiscussionThe results showed that glutathione could
effectively treat the liver lipid metabolism disorder of bullfrogs,
promote the growth and development of bullfrogs, repair the liver
function, reduce the inflammation, and promote the healthy and green
development of bullfrog industry.</p>

antibodies are prevalent in Burkholderia cepacia complex infection and
their removal restores serum killing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe Burkholderia cepacia complex encompasses a group of
gram-negative opportunistic pathogens that cause chronic lung infections
in people with cystic fibrosis. Distinct from other respiratory
pathogens, Burkholderia causes a unique clinical disease in a subset of
patients known as ‘cepacia syndrome’, fulminant pneumonia accompanied by
bacteraemia and sepsis with a mortality rate of up to 75%. Due to the
bacteraemia associated with this disease, the mechanisms that allow
Burkholderia to resist the bactericidal effects of serum
complement-depending killing are vital. Antibodies usually promote serum
killing; however, we have described ‘cloaking antibodies’, specific for
lipopolysaccharides that paradoxically protect serum-sensitive bacteria
from complement-mediated lysis. Cloaking antibodies that protect
Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in 24%–41% of patients with
chronic lung diseases. The presence of these antibodies is also
associated with worse clinical outcomes. Here, we sought to determine
the relevance of cloaking antibodies in patients with Burkholderia
infection.MethodsTwelve Burkholderia spp. were isolated from nine pwCF
and characterised for susceptibility to healthy control serum. Patient
serum was analysed for the titre of the cloaking antibody. The ability
of the patient serum to prevent healthy control serum (HCS) killing of
its cognate isolates was determined.ResultsWe found that several of the
Burkholderia strains were shared between patients. Ten of the 12
isolates were highly susceptible to HCS killing. Four of nine (44%)
patients had cloaking antibodies that protected their cognate strain
from serum killing. Depleting cloaking antibodies from patient serum
restored HCS killing of Burkholderia isolates.DiscussionCloaking
antibodies are prevalent in patients with Burkholderia pulmonary
infection and protect these strains from serum killing. Removal of
cloaking antibodies via plasmapheresis, as previously described for
individuals with life-threatening Pseudomonas infection, may be a useful
new strategy for those with serious and life-threatening Burkholderia
infection.</p>

the gut microbiota’s effect on temporomandibular joint disorder: a
two−sample Mendelian randomization analysis</h2>

<p>BackgroundTemporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are highly
prevalent among people. Numerous investigations have revealed the impact
of gut microbiota in many diseases. However, the causal relationship
between Temporomandibular joint disorders and gut microbiota remains
unclear.MethodsGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) refer to the
identification of sequence variations, namely single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), existing across the entire human genome. GWAS data
were collected on gut microbiota and TMD. Then, instrumental variables
were screened through F-values and removal of linkage disequilibrium.
These SNPs underwent mendelian analysis using five mathematical models.
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to further verify the stability of
the results. Pathogenic factors of TMD mediate the causal relationship
between gut microbiota and TMD were explored through a two-step
Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, reverse mendelian analysis
was conducted to account for potential reverse effects.ResultsThe
analysis of the data in this article suggests that some gut microbiota,
including Coprobacter, Ruminococcus torques group, Catenibacterium,
Lachnospiraceae, Turicibacter, Victivallis, MollicutesRF9,
Methanobacteriales, Methanobacteriaceae, FamilyXI, Methanobacteria were
identified as risk factors, while Peptococcaceae provides protection for
TMD.ConclusionThe research reveals the relation of gut microbiota in
TMD. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and
suggest potential therapeutic strategy.</p>
