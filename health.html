expression in tuberculosis disease and its regulatory effect in
macrophage polarization and intracellular elimination of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Tuberculosis(TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) infections, remains the leading cause of mortality
from a single infectious agent globally. The progression of tuberculosis
disease is contingent upon the complex interplay between the host’s
immune system and the pathogen Mtb. Interleukin-26 (IL-26), the most
recently identified cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family, exhibits
both extracellular antimicrobial properties and pro-inflammatory
functions. However, the precise role of IL-26 in the host immune defense
against Mtb infections and intracellular killing remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we observed significantly elevated IL-26 mRNA
expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of active-TB patients
compared to healthy individuals. Conversely, circulating IL-26 levels in
the plasma of adult TB patients were markedly lower than those of
healthy cohorts. We purified recombinant IL-26 from an E. coli
expression system using the Ni-NTA resin. Upon stimulations with the
recombinant IL-26, human THP1 cells exhibited rapid morphological
changes characterized by increased irregular spindle shape and formation
of granular structures. Treating THP1 cells with IL-26 can also lead to
heightened expressions of CD80, TNF-α, and iNOS but not CD206 and Arg1
in these cells, indicating an M1 macrophage differentiation phenotype.
Furthermore, our investigations revealed a dose-dependent escalation of
reactive oxygen species production, decreased mitochondrial membrane
potential, and enhanced autophagy flux activity in THP1 macrophages
following IL-26 treatment. Moreover, our results demonstrated that IL-26
contributed to the elimination of intracellular Mycobacterium
tuberculosis via orchestrated ROS production. In conclusion, our
findings elucidated the role of IL-26 in the development of tuberculosis
and its contributions to intracellular bacilli killing by macrophages
through the induction of M1-polarization and ROS production. These
insights may have significant implications for understanding the
pathogenesis of tuberculosis and developing novel therapeutic
strategies.</p>

id="effects-of-tanreqing-injection-on-the-gut-microbiota-in-healthy-volunteers">Effects
of Tanreqing injection on the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesMany studies have confirmed that antibacterial agents can
disrupt the human gut microbiota. In China, Tanreqing injection (TRQ) is
a drug with antibacterial activity that is widely used in the treatment
of respiratory infections. However, its specific influence on gut
microbiota remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect
of TRQ on the gut microbiota of healthy volunteers.MethodsTwelve healthy
adults received 20 ml of TRQ intravenously daily for 7 consecutive days.
At six timepoints (Pre, on D1, D3, D5, D7 and follow-up visit) fecal
samples were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene
sequencing.ResultsEleven people were included in the analysis finally.
TRQ did not significantly alter gut microbiota diversity or richness
(Shannon and Simpson and Chao1 index) in healthy people during the
intervention. Gut microbial structure was stable (weighted and
unweighted Unifrac). Using a machine learning method based on PLS-DA
analysis, the separation trend on D7 at the genus level was found,
returning to baseline two days after discontinuation. The abundance of
major genus fluctuated on D7 compared with that prior to treatment,
including an increase of unclassified_f_Enterobacteriaceae (13.0611%), a
decrease of Bifidobacterium and Escherichia-Shigella (6.887%, 10.487%).
Functional prediction analysis did not reveal any significant
difference.ConclusionsOur study showed short-term use of TRQ at
conventional doses may not cause perturbations to the gut microbiota in
healthy adults. This finding provides some useful information for the
safe use of TRQ in the treatment of respiratory infections.Clinical

id="the-ifn-induced-protein-ifi27-binds-mda5-and-counteracts-its-activation-after-sars-cov-2-infection">The
IFN-induced protein IFI27 binds MDA5 and counteracts its activation
after SARS-CoV-2 infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Innate immune responses are induced after viral infections, being
these responses essential to establish an antiviral response in the
host. The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and MDA5 are pivotal for
virus detection by recognizing viral RNAs in the cytoplasm of infected
cells, initiating these responses. However, since excessive responses
can have a negative effect on the host, regulatory feedback mechanisms
are needed. In this work, we describe that IFN alpha-inducible protein
27 (IFI27) co-immunoprecipitates with melanoma
differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), being this interaction
likely mediated by RNAs. In addition, by using IFI27 overexpression,
knock-out, and knock-down cells, we show that IFI27 inhibits MDA5
oligomerization and activation, counteracting the innate immune
responses induced after SARS-CoV-2 infections or after
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) transfection. Furthermore,
our data indicate that IFI27 competes with MDA5 for poly(I:C) binding,
providing a likely explanation for the effect of IFI27 in inhibiting
MDA5 activation. This new function of IFI27 could be used to design
target-driven compounds to treat diseases associated with an exacerbated
induction of innate immune responses, such as those induced by
SARS-CoV-2.</p>

of four novel bacteriophages targeting multi-drug resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae strains of sequence type 147 and 307</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The global dissemination of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogenic
bacteria requires the rapid research and development of alternative
therapies that can support or replace conventional antibiotics. Among
MDR pathogens, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) are of
particular concern due to their extensive resistance profiles, global
dissemination in hospital environments, and their major role in some
life-threatening infections. Phages, or some of their components, are
recognized as one of the potential alternatives that might be helpful to
treat bacterial infections. In this study, we have isolated and
characterized four lytic bacteriophages targeting K. pneumoniae strains
of Sequence Type (ST) 307 or ST147, two predominant high-risk clones of
CR-Kp. Phages, designated vB_KpS_GP-1, vB_KpP_GP-2, vB_KpP_GP-4, and
vB_KpP_GP-5, were isolated from sewage wastewater samples. The
vB_KpS_GP-1 phage was a siphovirus unable to establish lysogeny with its
host, while the other three were podoviruses. While 85.7% of K.
pneumoniae strains of ST307 were selectively lysed by the phages
vB_KpS_GP-1 or vB_KpP_GP-5, the other two phages were able to lyse all
the tested strains of ST147 (n = 12). Phages were stable over a broad pH
and temperature range and were characterized by burst sizes of 10–100
plaque forming units and latency periods of 10–50 minutes. Genome
sequencing confirmed the absence of antibiotic resistance genes,
virulence factors or toxins and revealed that two phages were likely
members of new genera. Given their strictly lytic nature and high
selectivity towards two of the major high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae,
cocktails of these phages could represent promising candidates for
further evaluation in in vivo experimental models of K. pneumoniae
infection.</p>

id="association-of-glycerolipid-metabolism-with-gut-microbiota-disturbances-in-a-hamster-model-of-high-fat-diet-induced-hyperlipidemia">Association
of glycerolipid metabolism with gut microbiota disturbances in a hamster
model of high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHigh-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemia, which is
associated with gut microbiota disturbances, remains a major public
health challenge. Glycerolipid metabolism is responsible for lipid
synthesis and is thus involved in the development of hyperlipidemia.
However, possible association between the HFD-modulated gut microbiome
and the glycerolipid metabolism pathway remains unclear.MethodsHamsters
were fed a HFD for 4 weeks to establish a hyperlipidemia model. Fecal,
plasma and liver samples collected from hamsters fed a HFD or a normal
chow diet (NCD) were used for integrative metagenomic and untargeted
metabolomic analyses to explore changes in the composition and functions
of the gut microbiota, and relevant metabolites. Spearman rank
correlation analysis was used to explore correlations between gut
microbes and circulating glycerolipid metabolites, gut microbes and
lipids, and circulating glycerolipid metabolites and lipids.ResultsThe
gut microbial composition of HFD hamsters showed significant alterations
at the phylum, genus, and species levels that were skewed toward
metabolic disorders compared with that of NCD hamsters. Functional
characterization by KEGG analysis identified enrichment of the
glycerolipid metabolism pathway in the gut microbiome of HFD hamsters.
Plasma and liver metabolomics further indicated the upregulation and
enrichment of glycerolipid metabolites in HFD hamsters. The
Faecalibaculum, Allobaculum, and Eubacterium genera were positively
correlated with plasma glycerolipid metabolites and lipid
indices.ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest an association
between glycerolipid metabolism and the HFD-modulated gut microbiome
that is involved in the development of hyperlipidemia.</p>

id="chemical-composition-and-antifungal-activity-of-capsicum-pepper-aqueous-extracts-against-plant-pathogens-and-food-spoilage-fungi">Chemical
composition and antifungal activity of Capsicum pepper aqueous extracts
against plant pathogens and food spoilage fungi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Capsicum pepper is a rich source of phytochemical compounds such as
capsaicinoids, phenols, flavonoids, and so forth. Due to their
antimicrobial and antioxidant potential all of these compounds have been
assessed and used for both human and plant health benefits. Herein,
three fresh varieties of Capsicum annuum (Cacho de Cabra, Bell pepper,
and Hungarian Wax varieties) and one fresh and ripe variety of C.
baccatum (Cristal) were evaluated. Capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin,
nordihydrocapsaicin and the phenolic content of Capsicum spp. extracts
were characterised. The antifungal potential of capsaicinoids and
antioxidant activities, and the ecotoxicity of each Capsicum spp.
extract, using the model Galleria mellonella, were also evaluated.
Phytochemical analyses showed that the Cristal and Hungarian Wax
varieties presented the highest amount of capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin,
and nordihydrocapsaicin; while Bell Pepper had the highest phenol
content and antioxidant activity. Capsaicinoids’ standards and Capsicum
spp. extracts showed fungistatic activity against the fungal strains
assessed. For the fungal strains assessed, the fungistatic activities of
capsaicinoids’ standards were higher than those observed in Capsicum
spp. extracts. The Hungarian Wax extracts inhibited slightly the growth
of Aspergillus niger MUM05.11 and Fusarium oxysporum MUM16.143.
Similarly, A. niger, F. oxysporum, Rhizopus arrhizus MUM16.05 and
Alternaria sp. UFRO17.178 had their growth retarded by the use of Cacho
de Cabra and Cristal extracts. Noticeable changes were observed in the
fungal strains’ morphologies, such as the presence of fragile fungal
structures, pigmentation loss, variation in the reproductive structures
size and the conidia number. Capsicum extracts weaken the growth of
fungi, indicating their fungistatic potential. Considering the
fungistatic potential and non-ecotoxicity of these extracts, it is
possible to suggest their use as a tool for pest management in the
agri-food sector, controlling the growth and reproduction of fungi
without posing a risk to non-target biodiversity.</p>

characteristics of three herpesviruses infections in children in
Nanjing, China, from 2018 to 2023</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo evaluate the epidemiology characteristics of Herpes
simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in children from January 2018 to
December 2023, in Nanjing, China.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective
analysis of 21,210, 49,494 and 32,457 outpatients and inpatients aged 1
day to 17 years who were subjected to the three herpesviruses (HSV-2,
EBV, and CMV) nucleic acid testing from January 2018 to December 2023,
respectively. Demographic information, laboratory findings, etc. were
collected and analyzed. HSV-2, EBV and CMV nucleic acid testing were
performed by real-time PCR.ResultsThe total rate of detection of the
three herpesviruses for all specimens was 0.32% (67/21,210), 14.99%
(7419/49,494), and 8.88% (2881/32,457), respectively. A declining trend
in the incidence of viral infections over the years was observed for the
three herpesviruses (all P&lt;0.05). The detection rate for HSV-2, EBV,
and CMV was highest among patients aged 1-3 years, 3-7 years, and 28
days to 1 year, respectively (all P&lt;0.05). The presence of HSV-2 and
CMV infection did not exhibit a discernible seasonal pattern, whereas
EBV typically demonstrated an elevation during the summer and
autumn.ConclusionEBV and CMV were both prevalent among children in
China, except for HSV-2. The annual prevalence of the three
herpesviruses show decreasing trend from 2018 to 2023, and no difference
in gender (except for EBV). EBV infections usually occur in the summer
and autumn, whereas HSV-2 and CMV do not exhibit significant
seasonality. The positivity rate of HSV-2 is highest in 1-3 years, EBV
is highest in 3-7 years, and that of CMV is highest in 28 days to 1
year. Positive detection rates are higher in outpatients than in
inpatients.</p>

coli of porcine origin exhibits an open pan-genome within a single
clonal complex: insights from comparative genomic analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAlthough Campylobacter spp., including Campylobacter
coli, have emerged as important zoonotic foodborne pathogens globally,
the understanding of the genomic epidemiology of C. coli of porcine
origin is limited.MethodsAs pigs are an important reservoir of C. coli,
we analyzed C. coli genomes that were isolated (n = 3) from pigs and
sequenced (this study) them along with all other C. coli genomes for
which pig intestines, pig feces, and pigs were mentioned as sources in
the NCBI database up to January 6, 2023. In this paper, we report the
pan-genomic features, the multi-locus sequence types, the resistome,
virulome, and mobilome, and the phylogenomic analysis of these organisms
that were obtained from pigs.Results and discussionOur analysis revealed
that, in addition to having an open pan-genome, majority (63%) of the
typeable isolates of C. coli of pig origin belonged to a single clonal
complex, ST-828. The resistome of these C. coli isolates was
predominated by the genes tetO (53%), blaOXA-193 (49%), and APH
(3′)-IIIa (21%); however, the virulome analysis revealed a core set of
37 virulence genes. Analysis of the mobile genetic elements in the
genomes revealed wide diversity of the plasmids and bacteriophages,
while 30 transposons were common to all genomes of C. coli of porcine
origin. Phylogenomic analysis showed two discernible clusters comprising
isolates originating from Japan and another set of isolates comprising
mostly copies of a type strain stored in three different culture
collections.</p>

adenoviruses expressing HPV16/18 E7 upregulate the HDAC6 and DNMT3B
genes in C33A cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveHigh-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a carcinogenic virus
associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer, as well as an
increasing number of anal and oral cancers. The two carcinogenic
proteins of HPV, E6 and E7, can immortalize keratinocytes and are
essential for HPV-related cellular transformation. Currently, the global
regulatory effects of these oncogenic proteins on the host proteome are
not fully understood, and further exploration of the functions and
carcinogenic mechanisms of E6 and E7 proteins is needed.MethodsWe used a
previously established platform in our laboratory for constructing
recombinant adenoviral plasmids expressing the HPV16 E7 gene to further
construct recombinant virus particles expressing HPV16/18 E6, E7, and
both E6 and E7 genes. These recombinant viruses were used to infect C33A
cells to achieve sustained expression of the HPV16/18 E6/E7 genes.
Subsequently, total RNA was extracted and RNA-Seq technology was
employed for transcriptome sequencing to identify differentially
expressed genes associated with HPV infection in cervical
cancer.ResultsRNA-Seq analysis revealed that overexpression of the
HPV16/18 E6/E7 genes upregulated GP6, CD36, HDAC6, ESPL1, and DNMT3B
among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cervical
cancer. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a statistically
significant correlation between the HDAC6 and DNMT3B genes and key
pathways, including DNA replication, tumor proliferation signature, G2M
checkpoint, p53 pathways, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Further,
qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses indicated that both HPV16/18 E7 can
upregulate the expression of HDAC6 and DNMT3B, genes associated with HPV
infection-related cervical cancer.ConclusionThe successful expression of
HPV16/18 E6/E7 in cells indicates that the recombinant viruses retain
the replication and infection capabilities of Ad4. Furthermore, the
recombinant viruses expressing HPV16/18 E7 can upregulate the HDAC6 and
DNMT3B genes involved in cervical cancer pathways, thereby influencing
the cell cycle. Additionally, HDAC6 and DNMT3B are emerging as important
therapeutic targets for cancer. This study lays the foundation for
further exploration of the oncogenic mechanisms of HPV E6/E7 and may
provide new directions for the treatment of HPV-related cancers.</p>

characteristics of integrons and correlation analysis of antibiotic
resistance in urine isolated Enterobacter cloacae</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aims to understand the distribution of integrons
among Enterobacter cloacae isolated from clinical urine specimens in our
hospital, as well as the molecular characteristics of the variable
region resistance gene cassette of integron-positive strains and its
relationship with drug resistance.MethodsWe collected a total of 80
strains of Enterobacter cloacae isolated from urine specimens of
hospitalized patients in our hospital between August 2019 and July 2023,
and conducted drug sensitivity testing on them. Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) technology was employed to screen these strains for Class
1, 2, and 3 integrons. Following this, the promoter and variable regions
of integron-positive strains were amplified and sequenced. Additionally,
Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) was
utilized for homology analysis of integron-positive strains.ResultsAmong
the 80 clinical strains, Class 1 integrons were detected in 31 (38.8%)
strains, and the following resistance gene cassettes were identified:
aadA2, aadA1, aadB, aac(6’), and catB8. Three types of variable region
promoters were observed: PcS (4 strains), PcW (7 strains), and PcH1 (17
strains), with consistently inactive downstream P2 promoters.
Additionally, Class 2 integrons were detected in 5 (6.3%) strains,
carrying the variable region resistance gene cassette dfrA1-sat2-aadA1.
The promoters for Class 2 integrons were uniformly of the
Pc2D-Pc2A-Pc2B-Pc2C type. No Class 3 integrons were detected. The
strains containing integrons showed significantly higher resistance
rates to ciprofloxacin, compound sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin,
gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin compared to those without integrons
(P&lt;0.05). 35 strains of Enterobacter cloacae carrying integrons are
primarily classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. These genotypes
are mainly distributed in the urology department and Intensive Care Unit
(ICU). The distribution of variable region gene boxes and promoter types
is relatively concentrated in the same genotype.ConclusionOur study
confirmed that Enterobacter cloacae isolated from urine samples
predominantly carries Class 1 integrons with an extended array of
antibiotic-resistant genes. For future research, it is recommended to
explore additional resistance mechanisms and evaluate the effectiveness
of new therapeutic strategies. Clinicians should be vigilant about the
possibility of clonal dissemination and implement enhanced infection
control measures in hospital settings.</p>

id="gut-microbiota-dysbiosis-in-ankylosing-spondylitis-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis">Gut
microbiota dysbiosis in ankylosing spondylitis: a systematic review and
meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a connective tissue disease
that primarily affects spinal joints, peripheral joints, and
paravertebral soft tissues, leading to joint stiffness and spinal
deformity. Growing evidence has implicated gut microbiota in the
regulation of AS, though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase,
Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Wanfang Data, China
Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and China National
Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases from the time the databases were
created until 30 July 2023. To evaluate changes in α-diversity and the
abundance of certain microbiota families in AS, standardized mean
difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) calculations were
made. Meta-analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 and the quality of
the literature was assessed by following systematic review
guidelines.ResultsThis systematic review and meta-analysis included 47
studies, providing insights into the gut microbiota composition in
patients with AS compared to healthy controls (HCs). Our findings
indicate a significant reduction in gut microbial diversity in patients
with AS, as evidenced by a decrease in both richness and evenness.
Specifically, the Shannon index showed a moderate decrease (SMD = -0.27,
95% CI: -0.49, -0.04; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a less diverse microbial
ecosystem in patients with AS. The Chao1 index further confirmed this
trend, with a larger effect size (SMD = -0.44, 95% CI: -0.80, -0.07; P
&lt; 0.001), indicating a lower species richness. The Simpson index also
reflected a significant reduction in evenness (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI:
-0.53, -0.06; P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, patients with AS who received
anti-rheumatic combination treatment exhibited a more pronounced
reduction in α-diversity compared to untreated patients, highlighting
the potential impact of this treatment on gut microbiota balance. In
terms of specific microbial families, we observed a significant decrease
in the abundance of Bifidobacterium (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI: -2.37, 1.52; P

Conversely, an increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes was noted (SMD
= 0.42, 95% CI: -0.93, 1.76; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a possible shift
in the gut microbiota composition that may be associated with AS
pathophysiology.ConclusionOur analysis revealed changes in α-diversity
and the relative abundance of specific bacteria in AS. This suggests
that targeting the gut microbiota could provide new therapeutic
opportunities for treating AS.Systematic review

of dengue virus serotype 4 in Panama after 23 years without

<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Panama is a country with endemic Dengue virus (DENV) transmission
since its reintroduction in 1993. The four serotypes have circulated in
the country and the region of the Americas, however, DENV-4 confirmed
autochthonous cases have not been identified since 2000, despite its
circulation in neighboring countries. Here, we report DENV-4 detection
in Panama in the last four-month period of 2023 with co-circulation of
the other serotypes, this was associated with a peak of dengue cases
during the dry season even though most dengue outbreaks are described in
the rainy season. Complete genomes of DENV-4 allowed us to determine
that cases were caused by DENV-4 genotype IIb, the same genotype as 23
years ago, with high similarity to DENV-4 sequences circulating in
Nicaragua and El Salvador during 2023. This report shows the importance
of maintaining serotype and genotype surveillance for early detection of
new variants circulating in the country.</p>

expression correlates with high ATP levels in Ehrlichia, which confers
resistance during the extracellular stage to facilitate a new cycle of
infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ehrlichiosis is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by
infection with the obligatory intracellular bacteria Ehrlichia species.
Ehrlichia japonica infection of mice provides an animal model of
ehrlichiosis as it recapitulates full-spectrum and lethal ehrlichiosis
in humans. The E. japonica transposon mutant of EHF0962, which encodes a
previously uncharacterized hypothetical protein, is attenuated in both
infection and virulence in mice. EHF0962 was hence named here as
resistance-inducing protein of Ehrlichia (RipE). Using this ΔripE
mutant, we studied how RipE protein contributes to Ehrlichia
pathogenesis. Ehrlichia species have an intracellular developmental
cycle and a brief extracellular stage to initiate a new cycle of
infection. Majority of RipE proteins were expressed on the surface of
the smaller infectious dense-core stage of bacteria. Extracellular ΔripE
E. japonica contained significantly less adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
and lost infectivity more rapidly in culture compared with wild-type
(WT) E. japonica. Genetic complementation in the ΔripE mutant or
overexpression of ripE in WT E. japonica significantly increased
bacterial ATP levels, and RipE-overexpressing E. japonica was more
virulent in mice than WT E. japonica. RipE is conserved among Ehrlichia
species. Immunization of mice with recombinant RipE induced an in vitro
infection-neutralizing antibody, significantly prolonged survival time
after a lethal dose of E. japonica challenge, and cross-protected mice
from infection by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the agent of human monocytic
ehrlichiosis. Our findings shed light on the extracellular stage of
Ehrlichia, highlighting the importance of RipE and ATP levels in
Ehrlichia for extracellular resistance and the next cycle of infection.
Thus, RipE is a critical Ehrlichia protein for infection as such can be
a potential vaccine target for ehrlichiosis.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionStaphylococcus aureus is a highly resistant pathogen. It
has multiple virulence factors, which makes it one of the most
pathogenic bacteria for humankind. The vast increase in antibiotic
resistance in these bacteria is a warning of existing healthcare
policies. Most of the available antibiotics are ineffective due to
resistance; this situation requires the development of drugs that target
specific proteins and are not susceptible to resistance.MethodsIn this
study, we identified a compound that acts as an antagonist of ClfA and
ClfB by inhibiting their binding to host cells.ResultsThe shortlisted
compound’s binding activity was tested by docking and molecular dynamics
during its interaction with proteins. The identified compound has
excellent binding energy with both ClfA (-10.11 kcal/mol) and ClfB
(-11.11 kcal/mol).DiscussionThe molecular dynamics of the protein and
compound were stable and promising for further in vitro and in vivo
tests. The performance of our compound was tested and compared with that
of the control molecule allantodapsone, which was reported in a previous
study as a pan inhibitor of the clumping factor. An ADMET study of our
selected compound revealed its reliable drug likeliness. This compound
is an ideal candidate for in vitro studies.</p>

B Streptococcus vaginal colonisation throughout pregnancy is associated
with decreased Lactobacillus crispatus and increased Lactobacillus iners
abundance in the vaginal microbial community</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) asymptomatically colonises the vagina of
up to 40% of pregnant women and can transmit to neonates during birth,
causing neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, and significant
mortality. Vaginal GBS colonisation can be attributed to a range of host
and bacterial factors, which may include the composition of the vaginal
microbial community. There are few studies that have examined the
vaginal community composition in relation to GBS colonisation throughout
pregnancy. Here, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4) on vaginal
swabs from women at 24- and 36-weeks’ gestation, who were GBS
culture-negative or GBS culture-positive at either 24 weeks or 36 weeks’
gestation or at both timepoints. Vaginal swabs from 93 women were
analysed; 46 women were culture-negative, 11 women GBS culture-positive
at 24 weeks only, 21 women GBS culture-positive at 36 weeks only and 15
women GBS culture-positive at both timepoints on Brilliance GBS agar.
V3-V4 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing demonstrated that in women that
were GBS culture-positive at 36 weeks gestation only, G. vaginalis was
significantly more abundant at 24-weeks’ gestation despite a lack of
significant changes in community richness between the 24- and 36-week
samples. The vaginal microbial communities of women persistently
colonised with GBS, had a significantly higher abundance of
Lactobacillus iners, compared to other groups where L. crispatus, L.
gasseri or L. jensenii were dominant. We have characterised the vaginal
microbial community composition during pregnancy in relation to GBS
colonisation status, in a longitudinal study for the first time. The
most interesting finding was that in women that were persistently
colonised with GBS throughout pregnancy, there was a significant
increase in L. iners and significant reduction in L. crispatus
abundance. Given the lack of detail of the role that the vaginal
microbial community plays in GBS colonisation in the literature, it is
imperative that the relationship between L. iners and GBS in this unique
environmental niche is further investigated.</p>

factors and predictive model for nosocomial infections by extensively
drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundExtensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB)
has become a significant pathogen in hospital environments, particularly
in intensive care units (ICUs). XDRAB’s resistance to conventional
antimicrobial treatments and ability to survive on various surfaces pose
a substantial threat to patient health, often resulting in severe
infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream
infections (BSI).MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed clinical data from
559 patients with XDRAB infections admitted to Jinhua Central Hospital
between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients were randomly divided
into a training set (391 cases) and a testing set (168 cases). Variables
were selected using Lasso regression and logistic regression analysis,
and a predictive model was constructed and validated internally and
externally. Model performance and clinical utility were evaluated using
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, C-index, ROC curve, decision curve analysis
(DCA), and clinical impact curve (CIC).ResultsLasso regression analysis
was used to screen 35 variables, selecting features through 10-fold
cross-validation. We chose lambda.1se=0.03450 (log(lambda.1se)=-3.367),
including 10 non-zero coefficient features. These features were then
included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, identifying 8
independent risk factors for XDRAB infection: ICU stay of 1-7 days
(OR=3.970, 95%CI=1.586-9.937), ICU stay &gt;7 days (OR=12.316,
95%CI=5.661-26.793), hypoproteinemia (OR=3.249, 95%CI=1.679-6.291),
glucocorticoid use (OR=2.371, 95%CI=1.231-4.564), urinary
catheterization (OR=2.148, 95%CI=1.120-4.120), mechanical ventilation
(OR=2.737, 95%CI=1.367-5.482), diabetes mellitus (OR=2.435,
95%CI=1.050-5.646), carbapenem use (OR=6.649, 95%CI=2.321-19.048), and
β-lactamase inhibitor use (OR=4.146, 95%CI=2.145-8.014). These 8 factors
were used to construct a predictive model visualized through a nomogram.
The model validation showed a C-index of 0.932 for the training set and
0.929 for the testing set, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-value of 0.47,
indicating good calibration. Furthermore, the DCA curve demonstrated
good clinical decision-making performance, and the CIC curve confirmed
the model’s reliable clinical impact.ConclusionRegression analysis
identified ICU stay duration, hypoproteinemia, glucocorticoid use,
urinary catheterization, mechanical ventilation, diabetes mellitus,
carbapenem use, and β-lactamase inhibitor use as independent risk
factors for XDRAB infection. The corresponding predictive model
demonstrated high accuracy and stability.</p>

behavior changes - is microbial dysbiosis the missing link?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is one of the most successful
intracellular protozoa in that it can infect the majority of mammalian
cell types during the acute phase of infection. Furthermore, it is able
to establish a chronic infection for the host’s entire lifespan by
developing an encysted parasite form, primarily in the muscles and brain
of the host, to avoid the host immune system. The infection affects one
third of the world population and poses an increased risk for people
with a suppressed immune system. Despite the dormant characteristics of
chronic T. gondii infection, there is much evidence suggesting that this
infection leads to specific behavior changes in both humans and rodents.
Although numerous hypotheses have been put forth, the exact mechanisms
underlying these behavior changes have yet to be understood. In recent
years, several studies revealed a strong connection between the gut
microbiome and the different organ systems that are affected in T.
gondii infection. While it is widely studied and accepted that acute T.
gondii infection can lead to a dramatic disruption of the host’s normal,
well-balanced microbial ecosystem (microbial dysbiosis), changes in the
gut microbiome during the chronic stage of infection has not been well
characterized. This review is intended to briefly inspect the different
hypotheses that attempt to explain the behavior changes during T. gondii
infection. Furthermore, this review proposes to consider the potential
link between gut microbial dysbiosis, and behavior changes in T. gondii
infection as a novel way to describe the underlying mechanism.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) can cause seasonal epidemics and global
pandemics, posing serious threats to public health, making a deeper
understanding of its biological characteristics and effective
countermeasure strategies essential. Autophagy not only maintains
cellular homeostasis but also plays an important role in host defense
against IAV infection. However, the relationship between IAV and
autophagy is complex, and effective antiviral drugs are not yet
available. Natural products have shown excellent potential in disease
control due to their diversity and multi-targeting. This review focuses
on the relationship between IAV and autophagy and discusses the
potential of targeting autophagic pathways for the development of new
antiviral therapies. Particularly, the use of plant extracts as
autophagy modulators has garnered attention due to their non-toxic
nature and cost-effectiveness, which provides strong support for the
development of future antiviral drugs that can help to inhibit viral
infections and slow down disease progression.</p>

<p>Dengue fever, caused by dengue virus, poses a significant global
health challenge, particularly in tropical regions where Aedes aegypti
serves as the primary vector. The circadian clock in Aedes aegypti
governs key behavioral and physiological processes, including activity
patterns, feeding behaviors, and susceptibility to dengue virus
infection. This article explores the influence of circadian rhythms on
the mosquito’s ability to transmit dengue virus, emphasizing how the
circadian regulation of gene expression, immune responses, and lipid

primary and secondary immunodeficiency (common variable immunodeficiency
and splenectomy)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The gut microbiota serves a crucial role in the development of host
immunity. Immunocompromised patients are particularly vulnerable to
dysbiosis not only by virtue of a defect in the immune system but also
due to increased susceptibility to infection and multiple courses of
antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation is by far the most
effective option for restoring gastrointestinal homeostasis. However, it
is contraindicated in patients with significant primary and secondary
immunodeficiencies. This article presents the case of a 59-year-old
patient with common variable immunodeficiency, after splenectomy at age
39 for primary immune thrombocytopenia, who manifested diarrhea of up to
10 stools per day accompanied by secondary malnutrition and cachexia.
The patient was admitted to the hospital on multiple occasions due to
this condition, with stool PCR tests confirming a HHV-5
(Cytomegalovirus, CMV) infection. Following the administration of
valganciclovir, the patient’s complaints diminished, although, upon
cessation of the drug, the symptoms recurred. In addition, the patient
had an intestinal infection with C. difficile etiology. Given that the
patient’s therapeutic options had been exhausted, after obtaining
informed consent from the patient and approval from the bioethics
committee to conduct a medical experiment, treatment of diarrhea was
undertaken by fecal microbiota transplantation with the certified
preparation Mbiotix HBI from the Human Biome Institute. The patient
underwent two transplants, with a one-week interval between them. The
initial procedure was performed using the endoscopic method, while the
subsequent was conducted using the capsule method. Following the
administration of the applied treatment, the patient’s symptoms were
successfully alleviated, and no adverse effects were observed. A
microbiological analysis of the intestinal microbiota was conducted
prior to and following transplantation via next-generation sequencing
(NGS). No recurrence of symptoms was observed during the two-year
follow-up period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fecal
microbiota transplantation in an adult patient with primary and
secondary immunodeficiency.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that
significantly impacts patients’ quality of life. Recent evidence has
highlighted a complex relationship between the gut microbiota (GM) and
PD. Understanding this relationship is crucial for potentially targeting
GM in PD treatment and expanding therapeutic options. This study aimed
to comprehensively analyze the global landscape, trends, and research
focus on GM and PD using bibliometric analysis. Utilizing publications
from the Web of Science Core Collection (WsSCC), bibliometric tools such
as the R package ‘Bibliometrix,’ VOS viewer, and CiteSpace software were
employed to assess parameters like yearly publications,
countries/regions, institutions, and authors. Research trends and
hotspots were identified through keyword analysis. The results revealed
1,161 articles published between 2013-2023, with China leading in
publications (n=352, 30.31% of total), while the United States had a
higher influence (H-index=58). The University of California System was
the top institution in terms of publications (n=35), with the National
Natural Science Foundation of China funding the most projects (n=172).
Keshavarzian A and Sampson TR were the authors with the highest
publication and co-citation counts, respectively. The International
Journal of Molecular Sciences had the most articles published (n=48).
Keyword analysis identified parkinson’s disease, gut microbiota,
short-chain fatty acids, inflammation, and probiotics as main research
topics. Biomarkers, ketogenic diet, and NF-κB were recent research
hotspots and trends (2021-2023). The current study conducts an objective
and comprehensive analysis of these publications, identifying trends and
hotspots in the field of research. The findings offer valuable insights
to scholars globally and in-vestigate potential therapeutic strategies
for Parkinson’s Disease.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection

<p>Hepatic tuberculosis (HTB) is rare extrapulmonary tuberculosis that
is clinically similar to liver malignancy, making it difficult for
correct diagnoses. Pathology is the gold standard for tuberculosis
diagnosis. However, there are few reports on the pathological features
of HTB. A total of 32 HTB cases were considered and the differences in
pathological features and drug resistance were analyzed and compared
with those for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Enhanced CT scans showed
ring-shaped delayed enhancement during the arterial, venous, and delayed
phases. Most HTB cases were single lesions, with the highest incidence
in the right lobe, and the average lesion volume was smaller than that
of PTB. The frequency of granuloma in pathological changes, the overall
share of the lesion area in the HTB group, and the number of foxp3+
cells were significantly higher than in the PTB group. However, no
statistically significant differences were observed between the two
groups’ other pathological features and immune cell numbers. The immune
microenvironment of the normal tissues surrounding the lesion was
further analyzed. The findings showed that the number of macrophages and
foxp3+ cells in the HTB group was significantly higher than in the PTB
group. No significant difference in drug resistance was detected between
the HTB and PTB groups. In conclusion, there are substantial differences
in the characterization of pathological feature and immune
microenvironment between HTB and PTB. The frequency of granuloma and
subsequent overall share of the lesion area was significantly higher in
HTB compared to PTB.</p>
