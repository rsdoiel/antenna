virological and clinical characterization of a Dengue/Zika outbreak in
the Caribbean region of Costa Rica 2017–2018</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The increase in incidence and geographical expansion of viruses
transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue (DENV) and zika
(ZIKV) in the Americas, represents a burden for healthcare systems in
tropical and subtropical regions. These and other under-detected
arboviruses co-circulate in Costa Rica, adding additional complexity to
their management due to their shared epidemiological behavior and
similarity of symptoms in early stages. Since diagnostics of febrile
illness is mostly based on clinical symptoms alone, we gathered
acute-phase serum and urine from 399 samples of acute dengue-like cases
from two healthcare facilities of Costa Rica, during an outbreak of
arboviruses from July 2017 to May 2018, and tested them using molecular
and serological methods. The analyses showed that of the clinically
presumptive arbovirus cases that were reported, only 39.4% (n=153) of
the samples were confirmed positive by RT-PCR to be DENV (DENV (10.3%),
CHIKV (0.2%), ZIKV (27.3%), or mixed infections (1.5%). RT-PCR for other
alphaviruses and flaviviruses, and PCR for Leptospira sp were negative.
Furthermore, to assess flavivirus positivity in post-acute patients, the
negative sera were tested against Dengue-IgM. 20% of sera were found
positive, confounding even more the definitive number of cases, and
emphasizing the need of several distinct diagnostic tools for accurate
diagnostics. Molecular characterization of the prM and E genes from
isolated viruses revealed that the American/Asian genotype of DENV-2 and
the Asian lineage of ZIKV were circulating during this outbreak. Two
different clades of DENV-2 American/Asian genotype were identified to
co-circulate in the same region and a difference in the platelet and
leukocyte count was noted between people infected with each clade,
suggesting a putative distinct virulence. Our study sheds light on the
necessity for healthcare strategies in managing arbovirus outbreaks,
emphasizing the importance of comprehensive molecular and serological
diagnostic approaches, as well as molecular characterization. This
approach aids in enhancing our understanding of the clinical and
epidemiological aspects of arboviral diseases during outbreaks. Our
research highlights the need to strengthen training programs for health
professionals and the need to increase research-based on laboratory
evidence for diagnostic accuracy, guidance, development and
implementation of public health interventions and epidemiological
surveillance.</p>

in virus-like particle-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has
incurred devastating human and economic losses. Vaccination remains the
most effective approach for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nonetheless, the sustained evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants has provoked
concerns among the scientific community regarding the development of
next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Among these, given their safety,
immunogenicity, and flexibility to display varied and native epitopes,
virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines represent one of the most
promising next-generation vaccines. In this review, we summarize the
advantages and characteristics of VLP platforms, strategies for antigen
display, and current clinical trial progress of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
based on VLP platforms. Importantly, the experience and lessons learned
from the development of SARS-CoV-2 VLP vaccines provide insights into
the development of strategies based on VLP vaccines to prevent future
coronavirus pandemics and other epidemics.</p>

advances in gene-editing approaches for tackling antibiotic resistance
threats: a review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance, a known global health challenge, involves the
flow of bacteria and their genes among animals, humans, and their
surrounding environment. It occurs when bacteria evolve and become less
responsive to the drugs designated to kill them, making infections
harder to treat. Despite several obstacles preventing the spread of
genes and bacteria, pathogens regularly acquire novel resistance factors
from other species, which reduces their ability to prevent and treat
such bacterial infections. This issue requires coordinated efforts in
healthcare, research, and public awareness to address its impact on
human health worldwide. This review outlines how recent advances in gene
editing technology, especially CRISPR/Cas9, unveil a breakthrough in
combating antibiotic resistance. Our focus will remain on the
relationship between CRISPR/cas9 and its impact on antibiotic resistance
and its related infections. Moreover, the prospects of this new advanced
research and the challenges of adopting these technologies against
infections will be outlined by exploring its different derivatives and
discussing their advantages and limitations over others, thereby
providing a corresponding reference for the control and prevention of
the spread of antibiotic resistance.</p>

novel web-based risk calculator for predicting surgical site infection
in HIV-positive facture patients: a multicenter cohort study in
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSurgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication in
HIV-positive fracture patients undergoing surgery, leading to increased
morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Accurate prediction of SSI
risk can help guide clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes. However, there is a lack of user-friendly, Web-based
calculator for predicting SSI risk in this patient
population.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and validate a novel
web-based risk calculator for predicting SSI in HIV-positive fracture
patients undergoing surgery in China.MethodA multicenter retrospective
cohort study was conducted using data from HIV-positive fracture
patients who underwent surgery in three tertiary hospitals in China
between May 2011 and September 2023. We used patients from Beijing Ditan
Hospital as the training cohort and patients from Chengdu Public Health
and Changsha First Hospital as the external validation cohort.
Univariate, multivariate logistic regression analyses and SVM-RFE were
performed to identify independent risk factors for SSIs. A web-based
calculator was developed using the identified risk factors and validated
using an external validation cohort. The performance of the nomogram was
evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic
(AUC) curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis
(DCA).ResultsA total of 338 HIV-positive patients were included in the
study, with 216 patients in the training cohort and 122 patients in the
validation cohort. The overall SSI incidence was 10.7%. The web-based
risk calculator (https://sydtliubo.shinyapps.io/DynNom_for_SSI/)
incorporated six risk factors: HBV/HCV co-infection, HIV RNA load, CD4+
T-cell count, Neu and Lym level. The nomogram demonstrated good
discrimination, with an AUC of 0.890 in the training cohort and 0.853 in
the validation cohort. The calibration plot showed good agreement
between predicted and observed SSI probabilities. The DCA indicated that
the nomogram had clinical utility across a wide range of threshold
probabilities.ConclusionOur study developed and validated a novel
web-based risk calculator for predicting SSI risk in HIV-positive
fracture patients undergoing surgery in China. The nomogram demonstrated
good discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility, and can serve as
a valuable tool for risk stratification and clinical decision-making in
this patient population. Future studies should focus on integrating this
nomogram into hospital information systems for real-time risk assessment
and management.</p>

research frontiers in oral cavity vaccines for respiratory diseases: a
roadmap for scientific advancement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Intramuscular vaccines present limitations in eliciting robust
mucosal immunity and preventing respiratory pathogens transmission.
Sublingual vaccine administration offers promising advantages, including
interconnected mucosal protection. Despite these advantages, only a few
clinical trials have explored sublingual vaccines, underscoring the
necessity of optimizing next-generation vaccine formulas. Critical
research priorities include understanding vector behavior in the oral
environment, understanding their interactions with mucosal immunity and
developing formulations enabling sustained mucosal contact to facilitate
efficient transduction. Consequently, tonsil organoids, as
representative human mucosal models, could offer critical insights into
sublingual immunization. Thus, a multi-disciplinary approach integrating
pharmacological, immunological, and manufacturing considerations is
pivotal for sublingual vaccines in targeting pathogen-aggravated
prevalent respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD and lung cancer,
as well as the antimicrobial resistance crisis.</p>

Trypanosoma cruzi pleiotropic protein P21 orchestrates the intracellular
retention and in-vivo parasitism control of virulent Y strain
parasites</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>P21 is a protein secreted by all forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (T.
cruzi) with recognized biological activities determined in studies using
the recombinant form of the protein. In our recent study, we found that
the ablation of P21 gene decreased Y strain axenic epimastigotes
multiplication and increased intracellular replication of amastigotes in
HeLa cells infected with metacyclic trypomastigotes. In the present
study, we investigated the effect of P21 in vitro using C2C12 cell lines
infected with tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes (TCT) of wild-type
and P21 knockout (TcP21−/−) Y strain, and in vivo using an experimental
model of T. cruzi infection in BALB/c mice. Our in-vitro results showed
a significant decrease in the host cell invasion rate by TcP21−/−
parasites as measured by Giemsa staining and cell count in bright light
microscope. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis
showed that TcP21−/− parasites multiplied intracellularly to a higher
extent than the scrambled parasites at 72h post-infection. In addition,
we observed a higher egress of TcP21−/− trypomastigotes from C2C12 cells
at 144h and 168h post-infection. Mice infected with Y strain TcP21−/−
trypomastigotes displayed higher systemic parasitemia, heart tissue
parasite burden, and several histopathological alterations in heart
tissues compared to control animals infected with scrambled parasites.
Therewith, we propose that P21 is important in the host–pathogen
interaction during invasion, cell multiplication, and egress, and may be
part of the mechanism that controls parasitism and promotes chronic
infection without patent systemic parasitemia.</p>

<p>IntroductionClostridioides difficile infections (CDI) continue to
pose a challenge for clinicians. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
is an effective treatment option in CDI. Furthermore, recent and ongoing
studies suggest potential benefits of FMT in other diseases as
well.MethodsWe would like to present a novel protocol for encapsulation
of lyophilized fecal material. Our method provides with better
compliance as well as improved flexibility, storage and
safety.ResultsFMT was conducted in 28 patients with an overall success
rate of 82,14% using apsules containing lyophilized stool. 16 of
patients were given capsules with lessened bacteria counts. The success
rate in this group was 93,75%.DiscussionThe results highlight the still
unanswered questions about the mechanism of action and contribute to a
wider use of FMT in the clinical praxis and in research.</p>

C-reactive protein to albumin ratio as a potential risk indicator of
pneumonia caused by Chlamydia psittaci: a multicenter retrospective
study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe aim of the study was to describe psittacosis
pneumonia and to assess the predictive value of the C-reactive
protein/albumin ratio in psittacosis pneumonia for severity.MethodsData
on psittacosis pneumonia cases diagnosed using metagenomic sequencing
were collected from three hospitals in Shanghai, China from Oct. 2019 to
Oct. 2022. Serum levels of C-reactive protein and albumin were measured
and the C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) was calculated.
Spearman’s correlation analysis, ordered logistic regression analysis,
and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted to
examine the correlation and predictive ability of the three indicators
on the severity of the disease.ResultsA total of 27 patients with
psittacosis pneumonia were enrolled, with an average age of 62 years and
70.4% being male. 44.4% of patients had a clear history of contact with
poultry or birds. The predominant symptom was fever (100%). Patients
treated in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) had a higher
likelihood of experiencing wheezing (88.9% versus 33.3%, P=0.013) and
chest tightness (88.9% vs. 33.3%, P=0.013) than those in the general
ward (Non-RICU). The proportion of patients with pleural effusion was
significantly higher in the RICU compared to the Non-RICU (88.9%
vs. 38.9%, P=0.019). The RICU group had a significantly higher CAR than
the Non-RICU group (9.41 vs. 4.05, P=0.017). This result was accompanied
by higher intubation and ventilator support (33.3% vs. 0.0%, P=0.029),
higher PCT and CRP levels and lower albumin and PaCO2 levels in the RICU
than in the Non-RICU. Logistic regression analysis indicated that CAR
(OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.07–2.06, P=0.017) was risk factor for prolonged
hospitalization (&gt; 14 days).DiscussionElevated serum CAR levels were
found to be associated with a greater risk of severe psittacosis
pneumonia. Consequently, it may serve as an uncomplicated and useful
diagnostic tool for clinicians to promptly and precisely ascertain the
severity of psittacosis pneumonia, ultimately aiding them in devising
the most optimal therapeutic plan.</p>

and avian influenza: a global timeline and review of research on the
impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza on pinniped populations with
particular reference to the endangered Caspian seal (Pusa caspica)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This study reviews chronologically the international scientific and
health management literature and resources relating to impacts of highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses on pinnipeds in order to
reinforce strategies for the conservation of the endangered Caspian seal
(Pusa caspica), currently under threat from the HPAI H5N1 subtype
transmitted from infected avifauna which share its haul-out habitats.
Many cases of mass pinniped deaths globally have occurred from HPAI
spill-overs, and are attributed to infected sympatric aquatic avifauna.
As the seasonal migrations of Caspian seals provide occasions for
contact with viruses from infected migratory aquatic birds in many
locations around the Caspian Sea, this poses a great challenge to seal
conservation. These are thus critical locations for the surveillance of
highly pathogenic influenza A viruses, whose future reassortments may
present a pandemic threat to humans.</p>

progress on the mechanism of exosome-mediated virus infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Exosomes are extracelluar vesicles that facilitate intercellular
communication and are pivotal in post-transcriptional regulation within
cellular gene regulatory networks, impacting pathogen dynamics. These
vesicles serve as crucial regulators of immune responses, mediating
cellular interactions and enabling the introduction of viral pathogenic
regions into host cells. Exosomes released from virus-infected cells
harbor diverse microRNAs (miRNAs), which can be transferred to recipient
cells, thereby modulating virus infection. This transfer is a critical
element in the molecular interplay mediated by exosomes. Additionally,
the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) within
exosomes plays a vital role in virus infection, with ESCRT components
binding to viral proteins to facilitate virus budding. This review
elucidates the roles of exosomes and their constituents in the invasion
of host cells by viruses, aiming to shed new light on the regulation of
viral transmission via exosomes.</p>

assays: implications for diagnosis and treatment monitoring</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesPrecise HDV-RNA detection and quantification are pivotal
for diagnosis and monitoring of response to newly approved treatment. We
evaluate the performance of three HDV RNA detection and quantification
assays.MethodsHepatitis Delta RT-PCR system kit, EurobioPlex HDV assay,
and RoboGene HDV RNA Quantification kit 2.0 were used for testing 151
HBsAg-positive samples, 90 HDV-RNA negative and 61 HDV-RNA positive. We
also evaluated serial dilutions of the WHO international standard for
HDV, PEI 7657/12. All HDV-RNA positive samples were genotyped using a
next-generation sequencing strategy.ResultsQualitative results indicated
a 100% concordance between tests. Quantitative results correlated well,
r2 = 0.703 (Vircell-vs-Eurobio), r2 = 0.833 (Vircell-vs-RoboGene), r2 =
0.835 (Robogene-vs-Eurobio). Bias index was 2.083 (Vircell-vs-Eurobio),
-1.283 (Vircell-vs-RoboGene), and -3.36 (Robogene-vs-Eurobio). Using the
WHO IS, Vircell overestimated the viral load by 0.98 log IU/mL, Eurobio
by 1.46 log IU/mL, and RoboGene underestimated it by 0.98 log IU/mL.
Fifty-nine samples were successfully genotyped (Genotype 1, n=52;
Genotype 5, n=7; Genotype 6, n=1), with similar results for correlation
and bias.ConclusionThis study underscores the necessity of using
reliable HDV-RNA detection and quantification assays, as evidenced by
the high concordance rates in qualitative detection and the observed
variability in quantitative results. These findings highlight the
importance of consistent assay use in clinical practice to ensure
accurate diagnosis and effective treatment monitoring of HDV
infection.</p>

induces aneuploidy-mediated tolerance in Candida albicans that is
dependent on Hsp90 and calcineurin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antifungal resistance and antifungal tolerance are two distinct terms
that describe different cellular responses to drugs. Antifungal
resistance describes the ability of a fungus to grow above the minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a drug. Antifungal tolerance describes
the ability of drug susceptible strains to grow slowly at inhibitory
drug concentrations. Recent studies indicate antifungal resistance and
tolerance have distinct evolutionary trajectories. Superficial
candidiasis bothers millions of people yearly. Miconazole has been used
for topical treatment of yeast infections for over 40 years. Yet, fungal
resistance to miconazole remains relatively low. Here we found different
clinical isolates of Candida albicans had different profile of tolerance
to miconazole, and the tolerance was modulated by physiological factors
including temperature and medium composition. Exposure of non-tolerant
strains with different genetic backgrounds to miconazole mainly induced
development of tolerance, not resistance, and the tolerance was mainly
due to whole chromosomal or segmental amplification of chromosome R. The
efflux gene CDR1 was required for maintenance of tolerance in wild type
strains but not required for gain of aneuploidy-mediated tolerance. Heat
shock protein Hsp90 and calcineurin were essential for maintenance as
well as gain of tolerance. Our study indicates development of
aneuploidy-mediated tolerance, not resistance, is the predominant
mechanism of rapid adaptation to miconazole in C. albicans, and the
clinical relevance of tolerance deserves further investigations.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori infection poses a significant health
burden worldwide, and its virulence factor CagA plays a pivotal role in
its pathogenesis.MethodsIn this study, the interaction between H.
pylori-infected AGS cells and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was
investigated, with a focus on the modulation of CagA-mediated responses,
investigated by western blotting. Both, the dose-dependent efficacy
against H. pylori (growth curves, CFU assay) and the impact of the
nanoparticles on AGS cells (MTT assay) were elucidated.ResultsAGS cells
infected with H. pylori displayed dramatic morphological changes,
characterized by elongation and a migratory phenotype, attributed to
CagA activity. Preincubation of H. pylori with AgNPs affected these
morphological changes in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting a
correlation between AgNPs concentration and CagA function.ConclusionOur
study highlights the nuanced interplay between host-pathogen
interactions and the therapeutic potential of AgNPs in combating H.
pylori infection and offers valuable insights into the multifaceted
dynamics of CagA mediated responses.</p>

analysis of intestinal microbiota composition between free-ranged
captive yak populations in Nimu County</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The intestinal microbiota assumes a pivotal role in modulating host
metabolism, immune responses, overall health, and additional
physiological dimensions. The structural and functional characteristics
of the intestinal microbiota may cause alterations within the host’s
body to a certain extent. The composition of the gut microbiota is
associated with environmental factors, dietary habits, and other
pertinent conditions. The investigation into the gut microbiota of yaks
remained relatively underexplored. An examination of yak gut microbiota
holds promise in elucidating the complex relationship between microbial
communities and the adaptive responses of the host to its environment.
In this study, yak were selected from two distinct environmental
conditions: those raised in sheds (NS, n=6) and grazed in Nimu County
(NF, n=6). Fecal samples were collected from the yaks and subsequently
processed for analysis through 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing
methodologies. The results revealed that different feeding styles result
in significant differences in the Alpha diversity of fungi in the gut of
yaks, while the gut microbiota of captive yaks was relatively conserved.
In addition, significant differences appeared in the abundance of
microorganisms in different taxa, phylum Verrucomicrobiota was
significantly enriched in group NF while Firmicutes was higher in group
NS. At the genus level, Akkermansia, Paenibacillus, Roseburia, Dorea,
UCG_012, Anaerovorax and Marvinbryantia were enriched in group NF while
Desemzia, Olsenella, Kocuria, Ornithinimicrobium and Parvibacter were
higher in group NS (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). There was a significant
difference in the function of gut microbiota between the two groups. The
observed variations are likely influenced by differences in feeding
methods and environmental conditions both inside and outside the pen.
The findings of this investigation offer prospective insights into
enhancing the yak breeding and expansion of the yak industry.</p>

of human microglia and resident T cells in the brain of humanized DRAGA
mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Humanized mouse models are valuable tools for investigating the human
immune system in response to infection and injury. We have previously
described the human immune system (HIS)-DRAGA mice
(HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2RgKO.NOD) generated by infusion of Human
Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched, human hematopoietic stem cells from
umbilical cord blood. By reconstituting human cells, the HIS-DRAGA mouse
model has been utilized as a “surrogate in vivo human model” for
infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
Influenza, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), scrub typhus, and
malaria. This humanized mouse model bypasses ethical concerns about the
use of fetal tissues for the humanization of laboratory animals. Here
in, we demonstrate the presence of human microglia and T cells in the
brain of HIS-DRAGA mice. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that
play pivotal roles against pathogens and cerebral damage, whereas the
brain-resident T cells provide surveillance and defense against
infections. Our findings suggest that the HIS-DRAGA mouse model offers
unique advantages for studying the functions of human microglia and T
cells in the brain during infections, degenerative disorders, tumors,
and trauma, as well as for testing therapeutics in these pathological
conditions.</p>

and validation of a prediction model for mortality in critically ill
COVID-19 patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundEarly prediction of prognosis may help early treatment
measures to reduce mortality in critically ill coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) patients. The study aimed to develop a mortality prediction
model for critically ill COVID-19 patients.MethodsThis retrospective
study analyzed the clinical data of critically ill COVID-19 patients in
an intensive care unit between April and June 2022. Propensity matching
scores were used to reduce the effect of confounding factors. A
predictive model was built using logistic regression analysis and
visualized using a nomogram. Calibration and receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the accuracy and
predictive value of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to
examine the value of the model for clinical interventions.ResultsIn
total, 137 critically ill COVID-19 patients were enrolled; 84 survived,
and 53 died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses
revealed that aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, and
myoglobin levels were independent prognostic factors. We constructed
logistic regression prediction models using the seven least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator regression-selected variables
(hematocrit, red blood cell distribution width-standard deviation,
procalcitonin, AST, creatinine, potassium, and myoglobin; Model 1) and
three independent factor variables (Model 2). The calibration curves
suggested that the actual predictions of the two models were similar to
the ideal predictions. The ROC curve indicated that both models had good
predictive power, and Model 1 had better predictive power than Model 2.
The DCA results suggested that the model intervention was beneficial to
patients and patients benefited more from Model 1 than from Model
2.ConclusionThe predictive model constructed using characteristic
variables screened using LASSO regression can accurately predict the
prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This model can assist
clinicians in implementing early interventions. External validation by
prospective large-sample studies is required.</p>

characteristics, viral dynamics, and antibody response of monkeypox
virus infections among men with and without HIV infection in Guangzhou,
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMonkeypox virus (MPXV) is spreading globally and nearly
half of the infected people were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
positive. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effects of HIV
infection on the outcomes of MPXV infection is urgently needed. This
study aimed to explore the clinical features, viral dynamics, and
antibody response to MPXV infections in men who had sex with men (MSM)
with and without HIV co-infection.Design or methodsMPXV-infected
patients diagnosed by PCR were recruited in this study and were divided
into MPXV and MPXV + HIV groups based on whether they were co-infected
with HIV. Clinical data and samples were collected during of the
hospital stay and follow up interviews. The symptoms and signs,
laboratory examinations, viral shedding in various body fluids or swabs,
antibody dynamics were tracked and compared between the two
groups.ResultsA total of 41 MPXV patients were recruited through June
2023 to September 2023 in Guangzhou. The MPXV group and MPXV + HIV group
comprised 20 and 21 MSM, respectively. Patients in the two groups
exhibited similar clinical characteristics except for pruritus and
eschar, both were significantly fewer in MPXV + HIV group than in MPXV
only group. Among the 355 clinical samples collected, MPXV DNA was
detected in 100% of scabs, 97.4% of skin swabs, and 92.3% of exudate
swabs from lesions, while the positive rate was 87.5% from oropharyngeal
swabs, 59% from saliva, 51.3% from anal swabs, 50% from feces, 30.6%
from urine samples, 37.5% of semen, and 28.2% from sera. Dynamics
analysis revealed that viral DNA was undetectable in most patients 20
days after symptom onset. IgM and IgG antibodies to MPXV were detected
in all patients with 3–5 days earlier in the MPXV group than in the MPXV
+ HIV group.ConclusionThis cohort analysis based on a large outbreak
among MSM in Guangzhou indicated no obvious differences in clinical
symptoms, viral DNA data, but antibody responses were 3–5 days later in
mpox patients with HIV infection.</p>

and mutational analysis of H10N3 avian influenza A virus in China:
potential threats to human health</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In recent years, the avian influenza virus has emerged as a
significant threat to both human and public health. This study focuses
on a patient infected with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus,
admitted to the Third People’s Hospital of Kunming City on March 6,
2024. Metagenomic RNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis were conducted on the patient’s sputum, confirming the H10N3
infection. The patient presented severe pneumonia symptoms such as
fever, expectoration, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
genes of the virus showed that the virus was most closely related to a
case of human infection with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus
found in Zhejiang Province, China. Analysis of amino acid mutation sites
identified four mutations potentially hazardous to human health.
Consequently, this underscores the importance of continuous and vigilant
monitoring of the dynamics surrounding the H10N3 subtype of avian
influenza virus, utilizing advanced genomic surveillance techniques.</p>

osmoregulated metabolism of trehalose contributes to production of type
1 fimbriae and bladder colonization by extraintestinal Escherichia coli
strain BEN2908</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In Escherichia coli, the disaccharide trehalose can be metabolized as
a carbon source or be accumulated as an osmoprotectant under osmotic
stress. In hypertonic environments, E. coli accumulates trehalose in the
cell by synthesis from glucose mediated by the cytosolic enzymes OtsA
and OtsB. Trehalose in the periplasm can be hydrolyzed into glucose by
the periplasmic trehalase TreA. We have previously shown that a treA
mutant of extraintestinal E. coli strain BEN2908 displayed increased
resistance to osmotic stress by 0.6 M urea, and reduced production of
type 1 fimbriae, reduced invasion of avian fibroblasts, and decreased
bladder colonization in a murine model of urinary tract infection. Since
loss of TreA likely results in higher periplasmic trehalose
concentrations, we wondered if deletion of otsA and otsB genes, which
would lead to decreased internal trehalose concentrations, would reduce
resistance to stress by 0.6 M urea and promote type 1 fimbriae
production. The BEN2908ΔotsBA mutant was sensitive to osmotic stress by
urea, but displayed an even more pronounced reduction in production of
type 1 fimbriae, with the consequent reduction in adhesion/invasion of
avian fibroblasts and reduced bladder colonization in the murine urinary
tract. The BEN2908ΔtreAotsBA mutant also showed a reduction in
production of type 1 fimbriae, but in contrast to the ΔotsBA mutant,
resisted better than the wild type in the presence of urea. We
hypothesize that, in BEN2908, resistance to stress by urea would depend
on the levels of periplasmic trehalose, but type 1 fimbriae production
would be influenced by the levels of cytosolic trehalose.</p>
