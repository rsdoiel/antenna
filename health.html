of gut microbiota and metabolomics in the lipid-lowering efficacy of
statins among Chinese patients with coronary heart disease and
hypercholesterolemia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundStatins, being the primary pharmacological intervention for
hypercholesterolemia, exhibit a notable degree of interpatient
variability in their effectiveness, which may be associated with gut
microbiota. This study sought to identify the biomarkers for evaluating
differences in statin efficacy.MethodsA quasi case-control study was
conducted among participants with hypercholesterolemia and coronary
heart disease taking rosuvastatin essential. According to the level of
low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), participants was divided
into the “Up to standard” (US) group and the “Below standard” (BS)
group. 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were applied to
detected the information of gut microbiota and related
metabolites.ResultsA total of 8 US and 8 BS group matched by age and sex
were included in the final analysis. 16S rDNA sequencing results
indicated that the characteristic strains of the US group were
f-Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes and g-Papillibacter, while the
characteristic flora of the BS group were o-C0119, g-Pseudolabrys,
s-Dyella-Marensis and f-Xanthobacaceae. Metabolomic results suggested
that the levels of chenodeoxycholic acid-3-β-D-glucuronide,
1-methylnicotinamide and acetoacetate in stool samples of the US group
were significantly higher than those of the BS group. By identifying the
differentially abundant bacterial taxa, the gut microbiota could
modulate the efficacy of statins through producing enzymes involved in
cholesterol metabolism.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that the
difference in statin efficacy may be related to gut microbiota strains
that can produce short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids and
affect the efficacy of statins by regulating the activities of
cholesterol metabolite-related proteins. Metabolites related to
short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids in the gut are expected
to be biomarkers indicating the efficacy of statins.</p>

sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of sexually transmitted
infections and M. genitalium resistance in Shenzhen: a multicenter
cross-sectional study in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis study aims to determine the etiological,
sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics of STIs, and the level of
resistance in M. genitalium in Shenzhen, a representative first-tier
city of southern China.MethodsA multicenter cross-sectional study was
conducted and 7886 sexually active participants attending STI-related
departments were involved from 22 hospitals. Nine STI-related organisms
including N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium,
HSV-1, HSV-2, M. hominis, U. parvum, and U. urealyticum were
screened.ResultsBeing single or divorced was associated with increased
detection of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, HSV-1, HSV-2
and M. hominis. Lower education level was associated with increased
detection of C. trachomatis, HSV-2 and M. hominis. No insurance coverage
was an independent risk factor for T. vaginalis, M. hominis and U.
parvum positivity. Three resistance-determining regions related to
macrolide and fluoroquinolone were sequenced in 154 M. genitalium
positive samples, among which 90.3% harbored mutations related to
macrolide or fluroquinolone resistance and 67.5% were
multidrug-resistant M. genitalium. A2072G in 23S rRNA and Ser83Ile in
parC were the most common mutations. M. hominis was associated with
manifestations of bacterial vaginosis in female and epididymitis in
male.ConclusionsSingle or divorced individuals, those with lower
education level and individuals without insurance are higher-risk key
populations for STIs. The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant M.
genitalium in Shenzhen is high. Detection of M. hominis increased
significantly with lower education level and no health insurance
coverage, and it is associated with bacterial vaginosis or epididymitis,
indicating that M. hominis deserves further attention.</p>

the role of hypoxia-inducible factors and nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 in regulating macrophage inflammation and
metabolism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The recent birth of the immunometabolism field has comprehensively
demonstrated how the rewiring of intracellular metabolism is critical
for supporting the effector functions of many immune cell types, such as
myeloid cells. Among all, the transcriptional regulation mediated by
Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (NRF2) have been consistently shown to play critical roles in
regulating the glycolytic metabolism, redox homeostasis and inflammatory
responses of macrophages (Mφs). Although both of these transcription
factors were first discovered back in the 1990s, new advances in
understanding their function and regulations have been continuously made
in the context of immunometabolism. Therefore, this review attempts to
summarize the traditionally and newly identified functions of these
transcription factors, including their roles in orchestrating the key
events that take place during glycolytic reprogramming in activated
myeloid cells, as well as their roles in mediating Mφ inflammatory
responses in various bacterial infection models.</p>

of NLRP12 enhances macrophage immune response and alleviates herpes
simplex keratitis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHerpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is a blinding disease
caused by corneal infection of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).
Effective clearance of HSV-1 from the infected cornea is crucial for HSK
management. Macrophages play an important part in the innate immune
defense against viral infections. This study investigates the
immunomodulatory role of NLRP12 in macrophage immune response during
HSV-1 infection.MethodsNLRP12 expression post-infection was assessed in
various macrophage cell lines. Overexpression of NLRP12 was achieved by
lentiviral transfection, and its effect on HSV-1 replication and immune
responses were examined. Mechanistic insights into the role of NLRP12
were explored using immunofluorescence and Western Blot. For in vivo
studies, ocular adoptive transfer of NLRP12-overexpressing bone marrow
derived macrophages (BMDMs) was performed. HSV-1 viral loads, HSK
symptoms, and macrophage-mediated immune responses were
investigated.ResultsA significant decrease in NLRP12 expression
post-infection was observed in various macrophage cell lines.
Overexpression of NLRP12 in macrophages reduced HSV-1 replication.
Mechanistically, overexpression of NLRP12 triggered early and robust
pyroptosis in response to HSV-1 infection, inducing interleukin (IL)-18
production and activating downstream antiviral responses through the
JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In vivo, ocular adoptive transfer of
NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs to mouse corneas alleviated HSK damage and
reduced HSV-1 viral loads. NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs improved
antiviral responses in the cornea and promoted the maturation of
corneal-infiltrating macrophages and dendritic cells. Additionally,
NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs amplified the adaptive immune response in
the submandibular draining lymph nodes.DiscussionThese findings
highlight the role of NLRP12 in macrophage-mediated immune response
against HSV-1 infection and suggest its potential for possible
immunotherapy for HSK.</p>

autoantibodies: a promising biomarker for predicting mortality in
HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure patients with cirrhosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background &amp; aimsHBV infection initiates autoimmune responses,
leading to autoantibody generation. This research explores the role of
autoantibodies in HBV-related Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF),
offering novel perspectives for clinical management.MethodWe applied
immunoprecipitation and iTRAQ techniques to screen for autoantibodies in
serum from HBV-related cirrhosis patients and conducted detection with
conformation- stabilizing ELISA in a cohort of 238 HBV-infected
individuals and 49 health controls. Our results were validated in a
retrospective cohort comprising 106 ACLF patients and further assessed
through immunohistochemical analysis in liver tissues from an additional
10 ACLF cases.ResultsUtilizing iTRAQ, we identified Argonaute1-3
autoantibodies (AGO-Abs) in this research. AGO2-Abs notably increased in
cirrhosis, decompensation, and further in ACLF, unlike AGO1-Abs and
AGO3-Abs. This reflects disease severity correlation. Logistic
regression and COX models confirmed AGO2-Abs as independent prognostic
indicators for decompensated liver cirrhosis (DLC) and ACLF. In the ROC
analysis, AGO2-Abs showed significant diagnostic value for predicting
28- and 90-day mortality (AUROC = 0.853 and 0.854, respectively).
Furthermore, combining AGO2-Abs with the Child-Pugh, MELD, and AARC
scores significantly improved their predictive accuracy (P &lt; 0.05).
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed poorer survival for AGO2-Abs levels above
99.14μg/ml. These findings were supported by a retrospective validation
cohort. Additionally, immunohistochemistry revealed band-like AGO2
expression in periportal liver areas, with AGO2-Abs levels correlating
with total bilirubin, indicating a potential role in exacerbating liver
damage through periportal functions.ConclusionsAGO2-Abs is a robust
biomarker for predicting the mortality of patients with HBV-related
ACLF.</p>

epithelial hyperplasia: an understudied infectious disease affecting
ethnic groups. A mini review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Focal Epithelial Hyperplasia or Multifocal Epithelial Hyperplasia
(MEH), also known as Heck’s disease, is considered a rare pathology of
the oral mucosa associated with human papillomavirus types 13 and 32.
For reasons not fully understood, MEH disproportionally affects specific
populations of indigenous groups around the world. After the first
reports in Native Americans, the epidemiology of the disease has been
described in different geographical regions mainly related to particular
indigenous populations, the majority of the studies are clinical case
reports, but the biological determinants are still unknown. Some
suggested risk factors include chronic irritation caused by smoking, a
galvanic current, vitamin A deficiency, and/or a familial-genetic
predisposition; however, the scientific evidence is not solid due the
scarcity of case-control studies or longitudinal cohorts. In light of
the evidence, further study of the pathology of MEH should be considered
and proper clinical trials for effective treatments should be designed.
The disease warrants further study as it is considered as neglected by
research and it affects rural/remote population groups usually living in
adverse socioeconomic conditions.</p>

detection platform for one-tube simultaneous typing diagnosis of human
respiratory syncytial virus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the most prevalent
pathogen contributing to acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in
infants and young children and can lead to significant financial and
medical costs. Here, we developed a simultaneous, dual-gene and
ultrasensitive detection system for typing HRSV within 60 minutes that
needs only minimum laboratory support. Briefly, multiplex integrating
reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) was
performed with viral RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs as a
template for the amplification of the specific regions of subtypes A
(HRSVA) and B (HRSVB) of HRSV. Next, the Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute
(PfAgo) protein utilizes small 5’-phosphorylated DNA guides to cleave
target sequences and produce fluorophore signals (FAM and ROX). Compared
with the traditional gold standard (RT-qPCR) and direct
immunofluorescence assay (DFA), this method has the additional
advantages of easy operation, efficiency and sensitivity, with a limit
of detection (LOD) of 1 copy/μL. In terms of clinical sample validation,
the diagnostic accuracy of the method for determining the HRSVA and
HRSVB infection was greater than 95%. This technique provides a reliable
point-of-care (POC) testing for the diagnosis of HRSV-induced ARTI in
children and for outbreak management, especially in resource-limited
settings.</p>

protein targeted by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins regulates coronavirus
replication</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionOxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is known for its crucial
role in lipid transport, facilitating cholesterol exchange between the
Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Despite its
established function in cellular processes, its involvement in
coronavirus replication remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, we
investigated the role of OSBP in coronavirus replication and explored
the potential of a novel OSBP-binding compound, ZJ-1, as an antiviral
agent against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a
combination of biochemical and cellular assays to elucidate the
interactions between OSBP and SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (Nsps)
and other viral proteins.ResultsOur findings demonstrate that OSBP
positively regulates coronavirus replication. Moreover, treatment with
ZJ-1 resulted in reduced OSBP levels and exhibited potent antiviral
effects against multiple coronaviruses. Through our investigation, we
identified specific interactions between OSBP and SARS-CoV-2 Nsps,
particularly Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6, which are involved in double-membrane
vesicle formation—a crucial step in viral replication. Additionally, we
observed that Nsp3 a.a.1–1363, Nsp4, and Nsp6 target vesicle-associated
membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein B (VAP-B), which anchors OSBP
to the ER membrane. Interestingly, the interaction between OSBP and
VAP-B is disrupted by Nsp3 a.a.1–1363 and partially impaired by Nsp6.
Furthermore, we identified SARS-CoV-2 orf7a, orf7b, and orf3a as
additional OSBP targets, with OSBP contributing to their
stabilization.ConclusionOur study highlights the significance of OSBP in
coronavirus replication and identifies it as a promising target for the
development of antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses. These findings underscore the potential of OSBP-targeted
interventions in combating coronavirus infections.</p>

analyses of bacterial symbionts in four Sclerodermus (Hymenoptera:
Bethylidae) parasitic wasps, the dominant biological control agents of
wood-boring beetles in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveSclerodermus wasps are important biocontrol agents of a
class of wood borers. Bacterial symbionts influence the ecology and
biology of their hosts in a variety of ways, including the formation of
life-long beneficial or detrimental parasitic infections. However, only
a few studies have explored the species and content of the symbionts in
the Sclerodermus species.MethodsHere, a high-throughput sequencing study
of the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene revealed a high level
of microbial variety in four Sclerodermus waps, and their diversities
and functions were also predictedResultsThe three most prevalent phyla
of microorganisms in the sample were Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and
Proteus. The KEEG pathways prediction results indicated that the three
pathways with the highest relative abundances in the S. sichuanensis
species were translation, membrane transport, and nucleotide metabolism.
These pathways differed from those observed in S. guani, S. pupariae,
and S. alternatusi, which exhibited carbohydrate metabolism, membrane
transport, and amino acid metabolism, respectively. Bacteroides were
found to be abundant in several species, whereas Wolbachia was the most
abundant among S. sichuanensis, with a significant negative correlation
between temperature and carriage rate.ConclusionsThese results offer
insights into the microbial communities associated with the bethylid
wasps, which is crucial for understanding how to increase the
reproductive capacity of wasps, enhance their parasitic effects, and
lower cost in biocontrol.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) and
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-Kp) are rapidly emerging as
opportunistic pathogens that have a global impact leading to a
significant increase in mortality rates among clinical patients.
Anti-virulence strategies that target bacterial behavior, such as
adhesion and biofilm formation, have been proposed as alternatives to
biocidal antibiotic treatments to reduce the rapid emergence of
bacterial resistance. The main objective of this study was to examine
the efficacy of fatty acid-enriched extract (AWME3) derived from the fat
of Black Soldier Fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) in fighting against
biofilms of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and highly virulent Klebsiella
pneumoniae (hvKp) pathogens. Additionally, the study also aimed to
investigate the potential mechanisms underlying this
effect.MethodsCrystal violet (CV) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) assays
show how AWME3 affects the formation of mixed and mature biofilms by the
KP ATCC BAA-2473, KPi1627, and KPM9 strains. AWME3 has shown exceptional
efficacy in combating the hypermucoviscosity (HMV) virulent factors of
KPi1627 and KPM9 strains when tested using the string assay. The
rudimentary motility of MDR KPM9 and KP ATCC BAA-2473 strains was
detected through swimming, swarming, and twitching assays. The cell wall
membrane disturbances induced by AWME3 were detected by light and
scanning electron microscopy and further validated by an increase in the
bacterial cell wall permeability and Lewis acid-base/van der Waals
characteristics of K. pneumoniae strains tested by MATS (microbial
adhesion to solvents) method.ResultsAfter being exposed to 0.5 MIC
(0.125 mg/ml) of AWME3, a significant reduction in the rudimentary
motility of MDR KPM9 and KP ATCC BAA-2473 strains, whereas the treated
bacterial strains exhibited motility between 4.23 ± 0.25 and 4.47 ± 0.25
mm, while the non-treated control groups showed significantly higher
motility ranging from 8.5 ± 0.5 to 10.5 ± 0.5 mm.ConclusionIn
conclusion, this study demonstrates the exceptional capability of the
natural AWME3 extract enriched with a unique combination of fatty acids
to effectively eliminate the biofilms formed by the highly
drug-resistant and highly virulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) pathogens. Our
results highlight the opportunity to control and minimize the rapid
emergence of bacterial resistance through the treatment using AWME3 of
biofilm-associated infections caused by hvKp and CRKp pathogens.</p>

predictive value of peripheral blood cell mitochondrial gene expression
in identifying the prognosis in pediatric sepsis at preschool age</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSepsis represents a severe manifestation of infection often
accompanied by metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction.
Notably, mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and the expression of
specific mitochondrial genes have emerged as sensitive indicators of
mitochondrial function. To investigate the utility of mitochondrial gene
expression in peripheral blood cells for distinguishing severe
infections and predicting associated outcomes, we conducted a
prospective cohort study.MethodsWe established a prospective cohort
comprising 74 patients with non-sepsis pneumonia and 67 cases of sepsis
induced by respiratory infections, aging from 2 to 6 years old. We
documented corresponding clinical data and laboratory information and
collected blood samples upon initial hospital admission. Peripheral
blood cells were promptly isolated, and both total DNA and RNA were
extracted. We utilized absolute quantification PCR to assess mtDNA-CN,
as well as the expression levels of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6.
Subsequently, we extended these comparisons to include survivors and
non-survivors among patients with sepsis using univariate and
multivariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
were constructed to assess the diagnostic potential.ResultsThe mtDNA-CN
in peripheral blood cells was significantly lower in the sepsis group.
Univariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in the expression
of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 in patients with sepsis. However,
multivariate analysis did not support the use of mitochondrial function
in peripheral blood cells for sepsis diagnosis. In the comparison
between pediatric sepsis survivors and non-survivors, univariate
analysis indicated a substantial reduction in the expression of mt-CO1,
mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 among non-survivors. Notably, total bilirubin (TB),
mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 levels were identified as independent risk
factors for sepsis-induced mortality. ROC curves were then established
for these independent risk factors, revealing areas under the curve
(AUCs) of 0.753 for TB (95% CI 0.596–0.910), 0.870 for mt-CO1 (95% CI
0.775–0.965), 0.987 for mt-ND1 (95% CI 0.964–1.000), and 0.877 for
mt-ATP6 (95% CI 0.793–0.962).ConclusionMtDNA-CN and mitochondrial gene
expression are closely linked to the severity and clinical outcomes of
infectious diseases. Severe infections lead to impaired mitochondrial
function in peripheral blood cells. Notably, when compared to other
laboratory parameters, the expression levels of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and
mt-ATP6 demonstrate promising potential for assessing the prognosis of
pediatric sepsis.</p>

removal in Mycobacterium smegmatis triggers broad transcriptional
response to 1,3-propanediol and glucose as sole carbon sources</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe two-component signal transduction systems play an
essential role in the adaptation of bacteria to changing environmental
conditions. One of them is the MnoSR system involved in the regulation
of methylotrophic metabolism in M. smegmatis.MethodsMycobacterium
smegmatis mutant strains ΔmnoS, ΔmnoR and ΔmnoS/R lacking functional
mnoS, mnoR and both genes were generated using a homologous
recombination approach. MnoR recombinant protein was purified by
affinity column chromatography. The present study employs molecular
biology techniques: cloning strategies, global RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR,
EMSA, Microscale thermophoresis, and bioinformatics analysis.Results and
discussionThe ∆mnoS, ∆mnoR, and ∆mnoS/R mutant strains were generated
and cultured in the presence of defined carbon sources. Growth curve
analysis confirmed that inactivation of the MnoSR impairs the ability of
M. smegmatis cells to use alcohols such as 1,3-propanediol and ethanol
but improves the bacterial growth on ethylene glycol, xylitol, and
glycerol. The total RNA sequencing method was employed to understand the
importance of MnoSR in the global responses of mycobacteria to limited
carbon access and in carbon-rich conditions. The loss of MnoSR
significantly affected carbon utilization in the case of mycobacteria
cultured on glucose or 1,3-propanediol as sole carbon sources as it
influenced the expression of multiple metabolic pathways. The numerous
transcriptional changes could not be linked to the presence of evident
MnoR DNA-binding sites within the promotor regions for the genes outside
of the mno operon. This was confirmed by EMSA and microscale
thermophoresis with mutated MnoR binding consensus region. Our
comprehensive analysis highlights the system’s vital role in metabolic
adaptability, providing insights into its potential impact on the
environmental survival of mycobacteria.</p>

RNA GadY in Escherichia coli enhances conjugation system of IncP-1 by
targeting SdiA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Plasmid-mediated conjugation is a common mechanism for most bacteria
to transfer antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The conjugative transfer
of ARGs is emerging as a major threat to human beings. Although several
transfer-related factors are known to regulate this process, small RNAs
(sRNAs)-based regulatory roles remain to be clarified. Here, the
Hfq-binding sRNA GadY in donor strain Escherichia coli (E. coli) SM10λπ
was identified as a new regulator for bacterial conjugation. Two
conjugation models established in our previous studies were used, which
SM10λπ carrying a chromosomally integrated IncP-1α plasmid RP4 and a
mobilizable plasmid pUCP24T served as donor cells, and P. aeruginosa
PAO1 or E. coli EC600 as the recipients. GadY was found to promote
SM10λπ-PAO1 conjugation by base-pairing with its target mRNA SdiA, an
orphan LuxR-type receptor that responds to exogenous N-acylated
homoserine lactones (AHLs). However, SM10λπ-EC600 conjugation was not
affected due to EC600 lacking AHLs synthase. It indicates that the
effects of GadY on conjugation depended on AHLs-SdiA signalling. Further
study found GadY bound SdiA to negatively regulate the global RP4
repressors KorA and KorB. When under ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin
treatment, GadY expression in donor strain was enhanced, and it
positively regulated quinolone-induced SM10λπ-PAO1 conjugation. Thus,
our study provides a novel role for sRNA GadY in regulating
plasmid-mediated conjugation, which helps us better understand bacterial
conjugation to counter antibiotic resistance.</p>

and pathogenicity of Vibrio alginolyticus SWS causing high mortality in
mud crab (Scylla serrata) aquaculture in Hong Kong</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionVibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped
bacterium belonging to the family of Vibrionaceae, a common pathogen in
aquaculture animals, However, studies on its impact on Scylla serrata
(mud crabs) are limited. In this study, we isolated V. alginolyticus SWS
from dead mud crab during a disease outbreak in a Hong Kong aquaculture
farm, which caused up to 70% mortality during summer.MethodsExperimental
infection and histopathology were used to investigate the pathogenicity
of V. alginolyticus SWS in S. serrata and validate Koch’s postulates.
Comprehensive whole-genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis
antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and biochemical characterization
were also performed. ResultsOur findings showed that V. alginolyticus
SWS caused high mortality (75%) in S. serrata with infected individuals
exhibiting inactivity, loss of appetite, decolored and darkened
hepatopancreas, gills, and opaque muscle in the claw. Histopathological
analysis revealed tissue damage and degeneration in the hepatopancreas,
gills, and claw muscle suggesting direct and indirect impacts of V.
alginolyticus SWS infection.ConclusionsThis study provides a
comprehensive characterization of V. alginolyticus SWS as an emerging
pathogen in S. serrata aquaculture. Our findings underscore the
importance of ongoing surveillance, early detection, and the development
of targeted disease management strategies to mitigate the economic
impact of vibriosis outbreaks in mud crab aquaculture.</p>

of cuticular genes in the insect antimicrobial immune response</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Insects are established models for understanding host-pathogen
interactions and innate immune mechanisms. The innate immune system in
insects is highly efficient in recognizing and opposing pathogens that
cause detrimental effects during infection. The cuticular layer which
covers the superficial layer of the insect body participates in host
defense and wound healing by inducing innate immune responses. Previous
studies have started to address the involvement of cuticular genes in
conferring resistance to insect pathogens, particularly those that
infect by disrupting the insect cuticle. For example, the cuticular gene
Transglutaminase (TG) in Drosophila melanogaster plays a structural role
in cuticle formation and blood coagulation and also possesses immune
properties against pathogenic infection. However, more information is
becoming available about the immune function of other cuticular gene
families in insects. In this review, we aim to highlight the recent
advances in insect cuticular immunity and address the necessity of
pursuing further research to fill the existing gaps in this important
field of insect immunology. This information will lead to novel
strategies for the efficient management of agricultural insect pests and
vectors of plant and human disease.</p>

expression of immune response genes in patients with chronic Chagas
disease is shifted toward the levels observed in healthy subjects as a
result of treatment with Benznidazole</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionChagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite
infection, is a potentially life-threatening neglected tropical disease
with a worldwide distribution. During the chronic phase of the disease,
there exists a fragile balance between the host immune response and
parasite replication that keeps patients in a clinically-silent
asymptomatic stage for years or even decades. However, in 40% of
patients, the disease progresses to clinical manifestations mainly
affecting and compromising the cardiac system. Treatment is recommended
in the chronic phase, although there are no early markers of its
effectiveness. The aim of this study is to identify differential
expression changes in genes involved in the immune response in
antigen-restimulated PBMC from chronic patients with Chagas disease due
to benznidazole treatment.MethodsThus, high-throughput real-time qPCR
analysis has been performed to simultaneously determine global changes
in the expression of 106 genes involved in the immune response in
asymptomatic (IND) and early cardiac manifestations (CCC I) Chagas
disease patients pre- and post-treatment with benznidazole.Results and
discussionThe results revealed that 7 out of the 106 analyzed genes were
differentially expressed (4 up- and 3 downregulated) after treatment in
IND patients and 15 out of 106 (3 up- and 12 downregulated) after
treatment of early cardiac Chagas disease patients. Particularly in CCC
I patients, regulation of the expression level of some of these genes
towards a level similar to that of healthy subjects suggests a
beneficial effect of treatment and supports recommendation of
benznidazole administration to early cardiac Chagas disease patients.
The data obtained also demonstrated that both in asymptomatic patients
and in early cardiac chronic patients, after treatment with benznidazole
there is a negative regulation of the proinflammatory and cytotoxic
responses triggered as a consequence of T. cruzi infection and the
persistence of the parasite. This downregulation of the immune response
likely prevents marked tissue damage and healing in early cardiac
patients, suggesting its positive effect in controlling the
pathology.</p>

of IL-8 secretion induced by PEDV infection via NF-κB signaling
pathway</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is associated with severe
enteritis, which contributes to high mortality in piglets. The aim of
this study was to describe molecular mechanisms associated with
proinflammatory cytokine(s) production during PEDV infection. We showed
that infection of porcine intestine epithelial cell clone J2 (IPEC-J2)
with PEDV induces a gradual increase in interleukin 8 (IL-8) production
at different time points, as well as infection of Vero E6 with PEDV. The
secretion of IL-8 in these two cell lines infected with PEDV is related
to the activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, the cells expressing PEDV M or
E protein can induce the upregulation of IL-8. These findings suggest
that the IL-8 production can be the initiator of inflammatory response
by the host cells upon PEDV infection.</p>

atresia: the role of gut microbiome, and microbial metabolites</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease
affecting both the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, potentially
leading to chronic cholestasis and biliary cirrhosis. Despite its
prevalence, the exact mechanisms behind BA development remain
incompletely understood. Recent research suggests that the gut
microbiota and its metabolites may play significant roles in BA
development. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the changing
characteristics of gut microbiota and their metabolites at different
stages of BA in children. It discusses their influence on the host’s
inflammatory response, immune system, and bile acid metabolism. The
review also explores the potential of gut microbiota and metabolites as
a therapeutic target for BA, with interventions like butyrate and gut
microbiota preparations showing promise in alleviating BA symptoms.
While progress has been made, further research is necessary to untangle
the complex interactions between gut microbiota and BA, paving the way
for more effective prevention and treatment strategies for this
challenging condition.</p>

and phenotypic characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in
a Japanese tertiary care hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This study aimed to investigate the bacterial characteristics of
pneumococcal isolates obtained from a tertiary care hospital in Japan.
We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility, possession of macrolide
resistance genes, pneumococcal serogroup/serotype, and sequence type
(ST) of pneumococcal isolates from patients aged 15 years or older
between 2011 and 2020 at Nagasaki University Hospital. Of the 73
isolates analyzed, 86.3% showed resistance to macrolides, and 28.8%,
46.6%, and 11.0% harbored mefA, ermB, and both, respectively. Of the
isolates possessing ermB, 97.6% showed high levels of macrolide
resistance [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, &gt; 16
µg/mL]. Solithromycin (MIC range, 0.03–0.25 µg/mL), regardless of the
presence of macrolide resistance genes, and lascufloxacin (MIC range,
0.06–0.5 µg/mL) showed potent in vitro activity against pneumococci.
Serotype 19A was the most prevalent (six isolates), followed by
serotypes 10A, 15A, and 15B/C (five isolates each). Four serotypes (11A,
19A, 22F, and 23B) and five STs (36, 99, 433, 558, and 3111) were
significantly correlated with the presence of macrolide resistance
genes. All four isolates with serotype 11A/ST99 and three isolates with
serotype 19A/ST3111 harbored both mefA and ermB. No macrolide resistance
genes were detected in either of the two isolates with serotype
22F/ST433, while all ten isolates with serogroup 15 (serotypes 15A and
15B/C, five isolates each) possessed ermB alone. Our study revealed the
bacterial characteristics of the pneumococcal isolates obtained from our
hospital. In vitro activity of solithromycin and lascufloxacin against
these isolates was confirmed.</p>

composition-based deep learning predicts oncogenic potential of
HPVs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) account for more than 30% of cancer
cases, with definite identification of the oncogenic role of viral E6
and E7 genes. However, the identification of high-risk HPV genotypes has
largely relied on lagged biological exploration and clinical
observation, with types unclassified and oncogenicity unknown for many
HPVs. In the present study, we retrieved and cleaned HPV sequence
records with high quality and analyzed their genomic compositional
traits of dinucleotide (DNT) and DNT representation (DCR) to overview
the distribution difference among various types of HPVs. Then, a deep
learning model was built to predict the oncogenic potential of all HPVs
based on E6 and E7 genes. Our results showed that the main three groups
of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma HPVs were clearly separated between/among
types in the DCR trait for either E6 or E7 coding sequence (CDS) and
were clustered within the same group. Moreover, the DCR data of either
E6 or E7 were learnable with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
Either CNN classifier predicted accurately the oncogenicity label of
high and low oncogenic HPVs. In summary, the compositional traits of HPV
oncogenicity-related genes E6 and E7 were much different between the
high and low oncogenic HPVs, and the compositional trait of the
DCR-based deep learning classifier predicted the oncogenic phenotype
accurately of HPVs. The trained predictor in this study will facilitate
the identification of HPV oncogenicity, particularly for those HPVs
without clear genotype or phenotype.</p>
