immune factors involved in the rapid clearance of bacteria from the
midgut of the tick Ixodes ricinus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ticks are obligate hematophagous arthropods that transmit a wide
range of pathogens to humans as well as wild and domestic animals. They
also harbor a non-pathogenic microbiota, although our previous study has
shown that the diverse bacterial microbiome in the midgut of Ixodes
ricinus is quantitatively poor and lacks a core. In artificial
infections by capillary feeding of ticks with two model bacteria
(Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative Pantoea sp.), rapid
clearance of these microbes from the midgut was observed, indicating the
presence of active immune mechanisms in this organ. In the current
study, RNA-seq analysis was performed on the midgut of I. ricinus
females inoculated with either M. luteus or Pantoea sp. or with sterile
water as a control. While no immune-related transcripts were upregulated
by microbial inoculation compared to that of the sterile control,
capillary feeding itself triggered dramatic transcriptional changes in
the tick midgut. Manual curation of the transcriptome from the midgut of
unfed I. ricinus females, complemented by the proteomic analysis,
revealed the presence of several constitutively expressed putative
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are independent of microbial
stimulation and are referred to here as ‘guard’ AMPs. These included two
types of midgut-specific defensins, two different domesticated amidase
effector 2 (Dae2), microplusin/ricinusin-related molecules, two
lysozymes, and two gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductases
(GILTs). The in vitro antimicrobial activity assays of two synthetic
mature defensins, defensin 1 and defensin 8, confirmed their specificity
against Gram-positive bacteria showing exceptional potency to inhibit
the growth of M. luteus at nanomolar concentrations. The antimicrobial
activity of midgut defensins is likely part of a multicomponent system
responsible for the rapid clearance of bacteria in the tick midgut.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of other identified
‘guard’ AMPs in controlling microorganisms entering the tick midgut.</p>

delayed gastric emptying: may gut microbiota play a role?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Postoperative delayed gastric emptying is a prevalent complication
following surgical procedures, imposing heavy physical and financial
burdens on patients. However, current treatment options remain
suboptimal. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have
highlighted that the gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely
associated with postoperative complications. Various factors can disrupt
the gut microbiome after surgery. This review discusses the potential
mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and their metabolites may
contribute to the pathogenesis of postoperative delayed gastric
emptying. However, the current knowledge base is limited in terms of
fully understanding the exact mechanisms involved. It is therefore
evident that further research is required to fully elucidate the role of
the gut microbiome in postoperative delayed gastric emptying, with the
aim of uncovering new possibilities for preventive measures and
therapeutic treatments.</p>

potential role of heparin-binding protein in neonatal sepsis: research
progress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Neonatal sepsis is a major global health challenge, leading to
significant morbidity and mortality in newborns. The search for precise
biomarkers for its early prediction in clinical settings has been
ongoing, with heparin-binding protein (HBP) emerging as a promising
candidate. Originating from granules in neutrophils, HBP is released
into the bloodstream in response to infection and plays a pivotal role
in the body’s inflammatory response. Its significance extends beyond its
inflammatory origins; research indicates dynamic changes in HBP levels
are strongly linked to reduce in-hospital mortality, offering a
prognostic advantage over existing biomarkers. Furthermore, HBP has
demonstrated considerable clinical utility in the early diagnosis and
stratification of neonatal sepsis, suggesting its potential as a
reliable blood marker for early prediction of the disease and its
severity. Its application may extend to guiding the judicious use of
antibiotics in treating newborns, addressing a critical aspect of
neonatal care. Despite these encouraging results, the precise clinical
utility of HBP for diagnosing and treating sepsis in neonates still
demands further clarification through extensive research. This review
delves into the current scientific understanding of HBP’s contribution
to diagnosing, prognosticating, and treating neonatal sepsis, while
considering its future clinical applications.</p>

of Opi3 causes a lipid imbalance that influences the virulence traits of
Cryptococcus neoformans but not cryptococcosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a useful model
for investigating mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis in mammalian hosts.
This pathogen is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis in
immunocompromised patients and is in the critical priority group of the
World Health Organization fungal priority pathogens list. In this study,
we employed a mutant lacking the OPI3 gene encoding a
methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase to characterize the role of
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lipid homeostasis in the virulence of C.
neoformans. We first confirmed that OPI3 was required for growth in
nutrient limiting conditions, a phenotype that could be rescued with
exogenous choline and PC. Additionally, we established that loss of Opi3
and the lack of PC lead to an accumulation of neutral lipids in lipid
droplets and alterations in major lipid classes. The growth defect of
the opi3Δ mutant was also rescued by sorbitol and polyethylene glycol
(PEG), a result consistent with protection of ER function from the
stress caused by lipid imbalance. We then examined the impact of Opi3 on
virulence and found that the dependence of PC synthesis on Opi3 caused
reduced capsule size and this was accompanied by an increase in shed
capsule polysaccharide and changes in cell wall composition. Further
tests of virulence demonstrated that survival in alveolar macrophages
and the ability to cause disease in mice were not impacted by loss of
Opi3 despite the choline auxotrophy of the mutant in vitro. Overall,
this work establishes the contribution of lipid balance to virulence
factor elaboration by C. neoformans and suggests that host choline is
sufficient to support proliferation during disease.</p>

id="potential-treatment-of-glutathione-in-bullfrogs-with-abnormal-hepatic-lipid-metabolism-revealed-by-hepatic-lipid-metabolism-and-serum-metabolomics-analysis">Potential
treatment of glutathione in bullfrogs with abnormal hepatic lipid
metabolism revealed by hepatic lipid metabolism and serum metabolomics
analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWith the continuous growth of bullfrog supply, it has
become an important aquaculture species. Due to the lack of actionable
industry standards and regulation, the misuse of anti-disease drugs and
abnormal liver lipid metabolism in bullfrogs have become a major
obstacle to the development of bullfrog aquaculture industry.
Glutathione is a natural tripeptide that can be synthesized
intracellularly, and its physiological functions mainly include the
treatment of liver diseases, antioxidant, detoxification, anti-tumor,
enhancement of immunity, and delaying aging.MethodsIn this study, the
therapeutic effect of glutathione on bullfrogs with abnormal liver lipid
metabolism was revealed from hepatic lipid metabolism and serum
metabolomics analysis. The survival rate, liver histomorphology, serum
antioxidant enzyme activity, liver lipase activity and serum
metabolomics, liver metabolomics were studied and analyzed by feeding
the bullfrogs with abnormal lipid metabolism with glutathione for 20
days in the NC, FI and GSH groups.ResultsThe results of the study showed
that glutathione was able to repair the liver and improve the survival
rate of bullfrogs with abnormal lipid metabolism; the activity of serum
SOD enzymes was significantly increased; the activities of ACP and AKP
were significantly decreased; the activities of HDL-C and T-CHO were
significantly increased; and the activities of LDL-C, TBA, and TG were
significantly decreased in the liver; the contents of metabolites, such
as PC, PS, and PE were significantly up-regulated, and the levels of
up-regulated Autophagy - other, Necroptosis and ErbB signaling pathway,
and down-regulated Sphingolipid metabolism, D-Amino acid metabolism
metabolic pathway, to some extent The metabolic pathways of Sphingolipid
metabolism and D-Amino acid metabolism were down-regulated to alleviate
the disorders of glycerophospholipid and amino acid metabolism to a
certain extent, thus alleviating the abnormalities of liver lipid
metabolism.DiscussionThe results showed that glutathione could
effectively treat the liver lipid metabolism disorder of bullfrogs,
promote the growth and development of bullfrogs, repair the liver
function, reduce the inflammation, and promote the healthy and green
development of bullfrog industry.</p>

id="cloaking-antibodies-are-prevalent-in-burkholderia-cepacia-complex-infection-and-their-removal-restores-serum-killing">Cloaking
antibodies are prevalent in Burkholderia cepacia complex infection and
their removal restores serum killing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe Burkholderia cepacia complex encompasses a group of
gram-negative opportunistic pathogens that cause chronic lung infections
in people with cystic fibrosis. Distinct from other respiratory
pathogens, Burkholderia causes a unique clinical disease in a subset of
patients known as ‘cepacia syndrome’, fulminant pneumonia accompanied by
bacteraemia and sepsis with a mortality rate of up to 75%. Due to the
bacteraemia associated with this disease, the mechanisms that allow
Burkholderia to resist the bactericidal effects of serum
complement-depending killing are vital. Antibodies usually promote serum
killing; however, we have described ‘cloaking antibodies’, specific for
lipopolysaccharides that paradoxically protect serum-sensitive bacteria
from complement-mediated lysis. Cloaking antibodies that protect
Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in 24%–41% of patients with
chronic lung diseases. The presence of these antibodies is also
associated with worse clinical outcomes. Here, we sought to determine
the relevance of cloaking antibodies in patients with Burkholderia
infection.MethodsTwelve Burkholderia spp. were isolated from nine pwCF
and characterised for susceptibility to healthy control serum. Patient
serum was analysed for the titre of the cloaking antibody. The ability
of the patient serum to prevent healthy control serum (HCS) killing of
its cognate isolates was determined.ResultsWe found that several of the
Burkholderia strains were shared between patients. Ten of the 12
isolates were highly susceptible to HCS killing. Four of nine (44%)
patients had cloaking antibodies that protected their cognate strain
from serum killing. Depleting cloaking antibodies from patient serum
restored HCS killing of Burkholderia isolates.DiscussionCloaking
antibodies are prevalent in patients with Burkholderia pulmonary
infection and protect these strains from serum killing. Removal of
cloaking antibodies via plasmapheresis, as previously described for
individuals with life-threatening Pseudomonas infection, may be a useful
new strategy for those with serious and life-threatening Burkholderia
infection.</p>

the gut microbiota’s effect on temporomandibular joint disorder: a
two−sample Mendelian randomization analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTemporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are highly
prevalent among people. Numerous investigations have revealed the impact
of gut microbiota in many diseases. However, the causal relationship
between Temporomandibular joint disorders and gut microbiota remains
unclear.MethodsGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) refer to the
identification of sequence variations, namely single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), existing across the entire human genome. GWAS data
were collected on gut microbiota and TMD. Then, instrumental variables
were screened through F-values and removal of linkage disequilibrium.
These SNPs underwent mendelian analysis using five mathematical models.
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to further verify the stability of
the results. Pathogenic factors of TMD mediate the causal relationship
between gut microbiota and TMD were explored through a two-step
Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, reverse mendelian analysis
was conducted to account for potential reverse effects.ResultsThe
analysis of the data in this article suggests that some gut microbiota,
including Coprobacter, Ruminococcus torques group, Catenibacterium,
Lachnospiraceae, Turicibacter, Victivallis, MollicutesRF9,
Methanobacteriales, Methanobacteriaceae, FamilyXI, Methanobacteria were
identified as risk factors, while Peptococcaceae provides protection for
TMD.ConclusionThe research reveals the relation of gut microbiota in
TMD. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and
suggest potential therapeutic strategy.</p>
