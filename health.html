insights into the diversity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of
group B Streptococcus clinical isolates from Saudi Arabia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDetailed assessment of the population structure of group
B Streptococcus (GBS) among adults is still lacking in Saudi Arabia.
Here we characterized a representative collection of isolates from
colonized and infected adults.MethodsGBS isolates (n=89) were sequenced
by Illumina and screened for virulence and antimicrobial resistance
determinants. Genetic diversity was assessed by single nucleotide
polymorphisms and core-genome MLST analyses.ResultsGenome sequences
revealed 28 sequence types (STs) and nine distinct serotypes, including
uncommon serotypes VII and VIII. Majority of these STs (n=76) belonged
to the human-associated clonal complexes (CCs) CC1 (33.71%), CC19
(25.84%), CC17 (11.24%), CC10/CC12 (7.87%), and CC452 (6.74%). Major CCs
exhibited intra-lineage serotype diversity, except for the hypervirulent
CC17, which exclusively expressed serotype III. Virulence profiling
revealed that nearly all isolates (94.38%) carried at least one of the
four alpha family protein genes (i.e., alphaC, alp1, alp2/3, and rib),
and 92.13% expressed one of the two serine-rich repeat surface proteins
Srr1 or Srr2. In addition, most isolates harbored the pilus island
(PI)-2a alone (15.73%) or in combination with PI-1 (62.92%), and those
carrying PI-2b alone (10.11%) belonged to CC17. Phylogenetic analysis
grouped the sequenced isolates according to CCs and further subdivided
them along with their serotypes. Overall, isolates across all CC1
phylogenetic clusters expressed Srr1 and carried the PI-1 and PI-2a
loci, but differed in genes encoding the alpha-like proteins. CC19
clusters were dominated by the III/rib/srr1/PI-1+PI-2a (43.48%, 10/23)
and V/alp1/srr1/PI-1+PI-2a (34.78%, 8/23) lineages, whereas most CC17
isolates (90%, 9/10) had the same III/rib/srr2/P1-2b genetic background.
Interestingly, genes encoding the CC17-specific adhesins HvgA and Srr2
were detected in phylogenetically distant isolates belonging to ST1212,
suggesting that other highly virulent strains might be circulating
within the species. Resistance to macrolides and/or lincosamides across
all major CCs (n=48) was associated with the acquisition of erm(B)
(62.5%, 30/48), erm(A) (27.1%, 13/48), lsa(C) (8.3%, 4/48), and mef(A)
(2.1%, 1/48) genes, whereas resistance to tetracycline was mainly
mediated by presence of tet(M) (64.18%, 43/67) and tet(O) (20.9%, 14/67)
alone or in combination (13.43%, 9/67).DiscussionThese findings
underscore the necessity for more rigorous characterization of GBS
isolates causing infections.</p>

and efficacy against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii of a
novel Friunavirus phage from sewage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a new
threat in recent years, owing to its rapidly increasing resistance to
antibiotics and new effective therapies are needed to combat this
pathogen. Phage therapy is considered to be the most promising
alternative for treating CRAB infections. In this study, a novel phage,
Ab_WF01, which can lyse clinical CRAB, was isolated and characterized
from hospital sewage. The multiplicity of infection, morphology,
one-step growth curve, stability, sensitivity, and lytic activity of the
phage were also investigated. The genome of phage Ab_WF01 was 41, 317 bp
in size with a GC content of 39.12% and encoded 51 open reading frames
(ORFs). tRNA, virulence, and antibiotic resistance genes were not
detected in the phage genome. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic
analyses suggest that phage Ab_WF01 is a novel species of the genus
Friunavirus, subfamily Beijerinckvirinae, and family Autographiviridae.
The in vivo results showed that phage Ab_WF01 significantly increased
the survival rate of CRAB-infected Galleria mellonella (from 0% to 70%
at 48 h) and mice (from 0% to 60% for 7 days). Moreover, after day 3
post-infection, phage Ab_WF01 reduced inflammatory response, with
strongly ameliorated histological damage and bacterial clearance in
infected tissue organs (lungs, liver, and spleen) in mouse CRAB
infection model. Taken together, these results show that phage Ab_WF01
holds great promise as a potential alternative agent with excellent
stability for against CRAB infections.</p>

id="modulation-of-campylobacter-jejuni-adhesion-to-biotic-model-surfaces-by-fungal-lectins-and-protease-inhibitors">Modulation
of Campylobacter jejuni adhesion to biotic model surfaces by fungal
lectins and protease inhibitors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Campylobacter jejuni, a Gram-negative bacterium, is one of the most
common causes of foodborne illness worldwide. Its adhesion mechanism is
mediated by several bacterial factors, including flagellum, protein
adhesins, lipooligosaccharides, proteases, and host factors, such as
surface glycans on epithelial cells and mucins. Fungal lectins,
specialized carbohydrate-binding proteins, can bind to specific glycans
on host and bacterial cells and thus influence pathogenesis. In this
study, we investigated the effects of fungal lectins and protease
inhibitors on the adhesion of C. jejuni to model biotic surfaces (mucin,
fibronectin, and collagen) and Caco-2 cells as well as the invasion of
Caco-2 cells. The lectins Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) and
Laccaria bicolor tectonin 2 (Tec2) showed remarkable efficacy in all
experiments. In addition, different pre-incubations of lectins with C.
jejuni or Caco-2 cells significantly inhibited the ability of C. jejuni
to adhere to and invade Caco-2 cells, but to varying degrees.
Pre-incubation of Caco-2 cells with selected lectins reduced the number
of invasive C. jejuni cells the most, while simultaneous incubation
showed the greatest reduction in adherent C. jejuni cells. These results
suggest that fungal lectins are a promising tool for the prevention and
treatment of C. jejuni infections. Furthermore, this study highlights
the potential of fungi as a rich reservoir for novel anti-adhesive
agents.</p>

immune response against vector-borne bunyavirus infection and viral
countermeasures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bunyaviruses are a large group of important viral pathogens that
cause significant diseases in humans and animals worldwide. Bunyaviruses
are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that infect a
wide range of hosts. Upon entry into host cells, the components of
viruses are recognized by host innate immune system, leading to the
activation of downstream signaling cascades to induce interferons (IFNs)
and other proinflammatory cytokines. IFNs bind to their receptors and
upregulate the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs). Many ISGs have antiviral activities and confer an antiviral
state to host cells. For efficient replication and spread, viruses have
evolved different strategies to antagonize IFN-mediated restriction.
Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the
interactions between bunyaviruses and host innate immune response.</p>
