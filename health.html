      <h1>A comparative study on the cleaning efficacy of a pulsed vacuum cleaning and disinfection device on rigid endoscopic instruments in a hospital setting</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      ObjectiveGiven the increasing demand for rapid and reliable instrument reprocessing to support surgical schedules and minimize infection risks, this study aims to explore the cleaning efficacy of a pulsed vacuum cleaning and disinfection device on rigid endoscopic instruments in a comparative hospital setting.MethodsA total of 800 rigid endoscopic instruments scheduled for post-operative cleaning in our hospital’s sterilization supply room between July and December 2024 were included in the study. After pre-treatment, the instruments were divided into two groups, with 400 instruments in each group. The control group used a vacuum ultrasonic cleaner, while the observation group used a pulsed vacuum cleaning and disinfection device. The cleaning time, cleaning effect, protein residue detection, and instrument damage rate were compared between the two groups. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed.ResultsThe cleaning time in the observation group was significantly shorter than that in the control group, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual inspection, magnifying light source, and ATP fluorescence comparison (P>0.05). The protein residue detection in the observation group was lower than that in the control group, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). The instrument damage rate in the observation group was lower than that in the control group, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). The pulsed vacuum device demonstrated significant cost savings, with a lower total cost ($15,984 vs. $21,832) and cost per qualified instrument ($40.26 vs. $55.98) over 400 cycles.ConclusionThe pulsed vacuum cleaning and disinfection device can effectively clean rigid endoscopic instruments and is worthy of clinical promotion as it enhances operational efficiency and upholds high standards of patient safety by ensuring instrument cleanliness.

      <h1>Screening and comparison of in vitro-induced resistant and clinically resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains for eravacycline resistance-related genes</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      ObjectiveTo identify genes related to eravacycline resistance in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Sm) and to provide a theoretical basis for the study of eravacycline resistance mechanisms in Sm and the development of new antibiotics.MethodsThe study employed an integrated omics approach: (1) In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility profiling via broth microdilution to determine baseline MICs for eravacycline and comparator drugs; (2) Induction of resistance in clinical Sm isolates (WJ_4, WJ_14, WJ_18) with low eravacycline MICs through serial passage in escalating drug concentrations; (3) Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of in vitro-induced resistant strains (WJ_4a, WJ_14a, WJ_18a) and a clinical high-MIC isolate (WJ_97); (4) Bioinformatics analyses, including differential gene expression screening (with |log2(fold change)| > 2 and FDR-adjusted p < 0.05), SNP detection via GATK, and copy number variation (CNV) quantification using CCNE-acc to identify and compare resistance-related genetic alterations.ResultsStable eravacycline-resistant strains were successfully induced, exhibiting 8- to 32-fold MIC increases. Transcriptome analysis revealed consistent upregulation of efflux pump genes (smrA, smeD, smeE, smeF) across all induced strains. CNV analysis demonstrated significant smeDEF locus amplification, while nonsynonymous mutations in smeD, smeE, and smeF occurred in WJ_14a (44 mutations) and WJ_18a (3 mutations) but not WJ_4a. The clinical strain WJ_97 showed distinct resistance architecture, including 65 upregulated nonsynonymous mutations (e.g., frameshift in smeF), mutations in smeR, adeF, and vanY-mediated target alteration, alongside a diverse resistance gene profile (41.4% inactivating enzymes, 34.4% efflux pumps). Global downregulation of cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) suggested synergistic multidrug resistance mechanisms.ConclusionsEravacycline resistance in Sm is primarily driven by dysregulation of the smeDEF efflux complex, with in vitro-induced strains relying on CNV amplification and/or coding mutations, while clinical isolates combine these with accessory pathways. This work provides the evidence for CNV as a core resistance driver and highlights evolutionary divergence under clinical pressure, informing future antibiotic development and resistance surveillance strategies.

      <h1>Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1: oncogenic potential and vaccine development strategies</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a highly oncogenic retrovirus recognized as the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Among the key risk factors for ATLL development are high proviral load, reduced anti-Tax immune responses, and elevated levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor. Unlike classical oncogenic viruses, HTLV-1 does not encode proto-oncogenes but instead drives cellular transformation through a combination of mechanisms, including viral gene dysregulation, chromatin remodeling, epigenetic reprogramming, persistent clonal expansion, immune evasion, and RNA-based modifications. Despite growing understanding of these molecular pathways, an effective prophylactic vaccine against HTLV-1 remains unavailable. However, several vaccine strategies including viral vector platforms, mRNA-based candidates, peptide vaccines, and dendritic cell-based approaches have shown promise in preclinical models. In this review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on HTLV-1 oncogenesis, highlight the roles of viral proteins such as Tax and HBZ in immune evasion, and critically examine the state of vaccine development efforts aimed at controlling this neglected human retrovirus.

      <h1>Exploring the role of gut probiotic metabolites in the prevention and treatment of otitis media</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionThe gut microbiota derived metabolites show significant therapeutic effects on otitis media, yet the specific active metabolites and mechanisms involved remain undocumented. The primary objective of the study was to utilise a network pharmacology approach to investigate the active metabolites and underlying mechanisms by which gut microbiota exerts their effects against otitis media.MethodsA set of 110 gut microbiota-derived metabolites was retrieved from the MiMeDB database. Their target genes were identified using SEA (Similarity Ensemble Approach), resulting in 6860 human target genes. Parallelly, a differential expression analysis using the GEO dataset identified dysregulated genes in otitis media. Upon intersecting these with the metabolite target genes, we identified 268 common genes, which likely represent molecular mediators through which microbial metabolites exert its effects in otitis media. PPI interaction was used to identify the 10 hub targets. To understand the post-transcriptional regulation of these common genes, we identified miRNAs targeting them using the multiMiRR package.ResultsThe functional enrichment and disease association analyses of these genes and miRNAs revealed their significant involvement in inflammatory and immune regulatory pathways, many of which are shared with chronic otitis media pathogenesis.DiscussionOverall, this integrative approach established a strong link between gut microbial metabolites, their host gene targets, and miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in otitis media. This study provided comprehensive insights warranting additional research on the therapeutic potential of metabolites for otitis media.

      <h1>IL-10/STAT5 axis suppresses miR-140 to upregulate B7-H4 expression in RAW264.7 cells</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionSchistosomiasis japonica, a zoonotic parasitic disease, induces complex immune regulation during infection. The inflammatory responses and immunosuppressive mechanisms co-exist to maintain immune homeostasis in schistosomiasis. B7-H4 is a critical immune checkpoint molecule that modulates T cell activation and exerts immunosuppressive effects. Our previous investigations revealed that B7-H4 mRNA expression was elevated in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum, with interleukin-10 (IL-10) demonstrating regulatory capacity to enhance B7-H4 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. In this study, we further explore the mechanism underlying IL-10-mediated B7-H4 upregulation.MethodsWestern blot was performed to detect B7-H4 expression levels, both in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum and in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with IL-10. RT-qPCR was performed to screen microRNAs (miR-140 et al.) in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with IL-10. Then dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm that miR-140 can directly bind to the 3’UTR of B7-H4. miR-140 promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells was also detected via dual-luciferase reporter assays. In addition, ChIP was performed to confirm the binding of transcription factors and miR-140 promoter.ResultsNotably, miR-140 was decreased in IL-10-treated microphages, accompanied by B7-H4 expression was upregulated. miR-140 can directly bind to the 3’UTR of B7-H4 and then inhibit the expression of B7-H4 in RAW264.7 cells. Meanwhile, miR-140 mimics can also attenuate IL-10-induced B7-H4 expression in RAW264.7 cells. Then we found that IL-10 may inhibit miR-140 promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells through transcription factors that binding to the - 576/- 94 bp region of the miR-140 promoter. Results by Western blot and ChIP further indicated that IL-10 could downregulate miR-140 promoter activity in a STAT5 dependence manner. After the sequence of STAT5 binding site within the - 456/- 446 bp region of the miR-140 promoter was mutated, IL-10 failed to suppress the activity produced by mutant miR-140 promoter.DiscussionIn summary, IL-10 can inhibit miR-140 through STAT5, thereby upregulating the expression of B7-H4 in RAW264.7 cells. This study may suggest a new mechanism underlying IL-10-mediated B7-H4 upregulation in macrophages.

      <h1>Combination of nucleated red blood cells and inflammatory biomarkers (PCT and CRP) for predicting sepsis and septic shock in children</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionSepsis remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of children with sepsis and septic shock, with emphasis to evaluate the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count in pediatric sepsis and septic shock patients.MethodsWe included a total of 121 children, including 80 with sepsis and 41 with septic shock, who were admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between January 2021 and June 2024.ResultsNo significant differences in sex, age, weight, or basic diseases were observed between the sepsis and septic shock groups (P > 0.05). However, the laboratory findings showed significantly lower platelet counts and hemoglobin levels as well as higher CRP, PCT, NRBC, lactic acid, ALT, CK-MB, urea nitrogen, and APTT levels in the septic shock group (P < 0.05). Poorer outcomes were observed in the septic shock group, with higher rates of disease progression or death (63.4% vs. 31.2%, P < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that the combination of these three biomarkers achieved greater predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.956), outperforming CRP and PCT alone. Compared with those with sepsis, children with septic shock presented worse clinical and laboratory profiles, required more intensive treatments, and had poorer outcomes.ConclussionThe inclusion of the NRBC count, combined with CRP and PCT, significantly increases the predictive efficacy of disease severity or progression, particularly indicative of septic shock, highlighting the potential of this combination for early diagnosis and management in pediatric patients.

      <h1>Meta-analysis of probiotic metabolites in the prevention of gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionMaternal weight gain and metabolic health during pregnancy significantly influence both short- and long-term outcomes for mother and child.MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis included data from 46 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comprising over 12,500 pregnant women across diverse populations.ResultsProbiotic supplementation, especially multispecies formulations, initiated in the first trimester led to a mean reduction in gestational weight gain (GWG) of 1.25 kg (95% CI: −1.78 to −0.72 kg; p < 0.001) compared to controls. Furthermore, postpartum weight retention was reduced by an average of 1.05 kg (95% CI: −1.53 to −0.58 kg; p < 0.001) when probiotic use extended into the postpartum period. Significant improvements were also observed in metabolic markers: fasting glucose decreased by 0.22 mmol/L, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) scores decreased by 0.45 units, and total cholesterol and Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were reduced by 0.28 and 0.17 mmol/L, respectively.DiscussionThese effects were mediated by the modulation of gut microbiota, promoting the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids (butyrate) and reducing systemic inflammation through increased levels of microbial-derived metabolites, including conjugated linoleic acids and indole-3-propionic acid, which enhance gut barrier integrity and metabolic resilience. The heterogeneity in strains, dosage, and duration and pooled analysis consistently favored probiotic intervention. These findings support the use of probiotics as a safe, non-pharmacological strategy to improve metabolic outcomes during pregnancy. Future studies should focus on personalized probiotic interventions and long-term maternal–child health effects.

      <h1>Expanding structural insights into DNA packaging apparatus and endolysin LysSA05 function of Epsilon15 bacteriophage</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      The rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) foodborne pathogens, particularly Salmonella spp., necessitates alternative antimicrobial solutions. Phage therapy offers a promising solution against MDR Gram-negative infections; however, its clinical application is constrained by the presence of endotoxins, residual cellular debris, the risk of horizontal gene transfer by temperate phages, and an incomplete understanding of how phage structural integrity influences infectivity and enzyme function. In this study, we present a structural and functional analysis of temperate bacteriophage Epsilon15 (ϵ15), focusing on its DNA packaging and injection machinery, along with characterization of the dual-acting endolysin LysSA05. Iodixanol-purified virions suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), under conditions optimized to preserve virion stability, were analyzed using graphene oxide (GO)-supported cryo-electron microscopy. This approach resolved the full asymmetric architecture of ϵ15, revealing a detailed internal nucleic acid organization with at least eight concentric layers radially and approximately 28 axially compacted layers within the capsid. The DNA packaging machinery, comprising the core, portal, and hub, was resolved at high resolution, including a 42 nm-long and 18 nm-wide injection channel anchored by a dodecameric portal complex visualized at ~7 Å resolution. Concurrently, we characterized LysSA05, a dual-acting endolysin harboring a glycoside hydrolase 19 (GH19) catalytic domain accommodating peptidoglycan (PG) residues N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) through structural docking, indicating plausible binding interactions that promote hydrolysis support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), discriminant analysis (DA), artificial neural network (ANN) and physicochemical scanning identified an amphipathic helix (residues 59-112) with predicted antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-like properties. Biochemical validation confirmed that LysSA05 destabilizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and permeabilizes the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria independently of permeabilizers, with enhanced efficacy observed upon co-treatment with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citric acid. In summary, our findings elucidate key structural features of ϵ15 relevant to infection and genome delivery, while positioning LysSA05 as a promising enzybiotic candidate against MDR Gram-negative pathogens.

      <h1>Proteomics and phosphoproteomics of freshwater mollusk carcasses reveal novel insights as potential food source</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      Cipangopaludina chinensis, Radix auricularia, and Nodularia douglasiae are common freshwater mollusks widely distributed in lakes and rivers across China. In this study, (DIA) Data - independent acquisition method was used to analyze the proteomics and phosphoproteomics among three species. The results showed that a total of 1,382 proteins were identified from mollusk carcasses, with 492 proteins were quantitively analyzed. These proteins are mainly involved in amino acid nutrition and metabolism, including glutamate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and tyrosinase copper-binding domain-containing protein. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the identified proteins are primarily involved in carbon metabolism, microbial metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and RAS signaling pathways. Notably, this study offers valuable insights into the differential protein expression of proteins across species. Furthermore, proteomics analysis revealed several novel proteins, which helps to improve our understanding of amino acid metabolism, protein diversity, and signaling pathways in these freshwater mollusks.

      <h1>Detection of Ureaplasma parvum in amniotic fluids via reanalysis of prenatal copy number variation sequencing data: an exploratory study</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundDetecting microbes in amniotic fluids via amniocentesis represents the standard method for diagnosing intrauterine infections. Given its similarity to metagenomic next-generation sequencing, copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) data may also contain microbial sequences. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the feasibility of prenatal CNV-seq for detecting Ureaplasma parvum (U. parvum) in amniotic fluids and to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes in U. parvum-positive cases.MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled 2419 singleton pregnant women who underwent genetic amniocentesis for fetal CNV-seq testing and completed the follow-up with documented pregnancy outcomes. The CNV-seq data were reanalyzed to extract the read counts of U. parvum from each sample’s raw data, and reads per million (RPM) was used to quantify its relative abundance.ResultsThe prevalence of asymptomatic intrauterine U. parvum positivity in this cohort was 1.4% (33/2419), with read counts ranging 1 to 30423 and RPM from 0.09 to 3580.65 by reanalysis of CNV-seq data. There was a statistically significantly higher risk for early spontaneous preterm labor (<32 gestational weeks; P<0.001) and preterm premature rupture of the membranes (P<0.001) in women with positive U. parvum compared to negative cases. Among U. parvum positive cases, six cases (6/33, 18.2%) had relatively higher read counts ranging from 2483 to 30423, with corresponding RPM of 406.45 to 3580.65. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were exclusively observed among women with high reads of U. parvum as opposed to those with low reads. Four cases with high U. parvum reads in amniotic fluids, not treated with antibiotics, showed a latency period of 6 to 10 weeks from positive detection to the onset of clinical manifestations.ConclusionsCNV-seq may be a feasible method for detecting intraamniotic U. parvum infection. High abundance of asymptomatic U. parvum in amniotic fluids are statistically associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, highlighting its importance in preliminary screening.

      <h1>Silver nanoparticles as next-generation antimicrobial agents: mechanisms, challenges, and innovations against multidrug-resistant bacteria</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      The escalating prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria presents a critical global health challenge, necessitating the urgent development of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have emerged as promising antimicrobial agents due to their broad-spectrum activity, unique physicochemical properties, and multiple mechanisms of bacterial inhibition. Their nanoscale size, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) make them highly effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. AgNPs exert their antimicrobial effects through diverse mechanisms, including membrane disruption, protein and DNA interactions, enzymatic inhibition, and interference with bacterial metabolic pathways. Despite their potent antibacterial activity, concerns regarding bacterial adaptation, cytotoxicity, and non-specific interactions have prompted extensive research into innovative delivery systems to enhance AgNP efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. This review comprehensively explores the synthesis methods and physical properties of AgNPs, emphasizing their antimicrobial mechanisms and emerging resistance patterns. Additionally, we discuss advanced targeted delivery approaches, including surface functionalization, biopolymer encapsulation, liposomal carriers, and stimuli-responsive nanoplatforms, which enhance the stability, selectivity, and controlled release of AgNPs. These strategies not only improve AgNP bioavailability but also reduce host toxicity and prevent bacterial resistance development. Furthermore, we highlight future directions in AgNP-based antimicrobial therapy, such as combinatorial treatments with antibiotics, advanced nanostructure modifications, and the integration of AgNPs into wound dressings, coatings, and biomedical devices. By synthesizing recent advancements, this review underscores the transformative potential of AgNPs as next-generation antimicrobial agents to combat MDR bacterial infections. Addressing the current limitations and optimizing AgNP formulations will be crucial for their successful clinical translation and for mitigating the global antibiotic resistance crisis.

      <h1>Synergistic antibacterial effects of postbiotics combined with linezolid and amikacin against nosocomial pathogens</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      Background and AimThe global rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has rendered many conventional antibiotics less effective, particularly against nosocomial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. This study investigated the antimicrobial and synergistic effects of postbiotics derived from Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus thermophilus, administered alone or in combination with either linezolid (for S. aureus) or amikacin (for Gram-negative strains).Materials and methodsPostbiotics were obtained through anaerobic fermentation, followed by centrifugation and filtration. Cytotoxicity was assessed via MTT assays on Vero cell lines. Infection models involving pathogen-specific adhesion and invasion assays were used, with CFU/mL quantification and statistical evaluation by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test.ResultsThe postbiotics exhibited potent antimicrobial activity across all tested pathogens. Combined with linezolid, the dual and triple postbiotic formulations significantly enhanced antibacterial effects against S. aureus from the early hours of incubation. Similarly, combinations with amikacin produced potent synergistic effects against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. mirabilis, particularly in triple combinations involving L. casei and L. bulgaricus. Postbiotics sometimes outperformed antibiotics, such as ST+LC postbiotics against P. mirabilis. These findings suggest that postbiotics can enhance antibiotic efficacy-possibly by modulating membrane permeability, disrupting biofilms, or altering bacterial communication systems. Their low cytotoxicity and pathogen-specific responses indicate that postbiotics are safe and may be tailored for targeted use.ConclusionsIn conclusion, postbiotic-antibiotic combinations, especially with linezolid and amikacin, present promising low-toxicity, synergistic therapeutic strategies. These results lay a strong foundation for advancing microbiome-based adjunct therapies to combat AMR in clinical settings.

      <h1>Comprehensive molecular epidemiology of BVDV in yaks (Bos gruniens) in Qinghai, China: high prevalence and dominance of BVDV-1u</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionBovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a major pathogen affecting livestock health in China. However, the current epidemiological status in yaks (Bos grunniens), particularly in Qinghai Province, remains insufficiently understood.MethodsIn the present study, a comprehensive serological and molecular investigation of BVDV in yaks was conducted across broad geographic areas of eight administrative regions including Yushu, Guoluo, Huangnan, Hainan, Haidong, Haixi, Haibei, and Xining in Qinghai Province.ResultsThe results revealed widespread BVDV exposure in Qinghai yak, with an overall antibody prevalence of 84.52% (1158/1370) and substantial herd variation (12.00~98.07%). Active infections were confirmed through antigen detection, revealing prevalence ranging from 0.34% (Haixi) to 4.90% (Huangnan). Genetic characterization identified two circulating subgenotypes: BVDV-1a (n=3) and the predominant BVDV-1u (n=30), with the latter dominating across all regions.DiscussionThese results highlight the endemic circulation of BVDV in Qinghai yak populations and uncover unexpected genetic diversity, emphasizing the need for control measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of BVDV infection in yaks in high-altitude pastoral systems.

      <h1>Wuling powder ameliorates diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in mice by modulating gut mucosal microbiota and alleviating intestinal inflammation</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      ObjectivesWuling powder has been widely used for the clinical treatment of IBS-D, but the microecological mechanism has not been found. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of Wuling powder on intestinal mucosal microbiota in mice with diarrhea predominant-irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing.MethodsMice were randomly divided into normal control group (Mc), model control group (Mm), and<br>treatment group (Mt). The IBS-D model was induced via Folium sennae gavage and acute restraint stress, and treatment was conducted with Wuling powder. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and milk fat globule EGF factor 8 (MFGE8) were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Intestinal mucosal DNA was extracted for 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to analyze microbial community alterations. We analyzed the characteristics of the intestinal mucosal microbiota and explored the potential link between the intestinal mucosal microbiota and the inflammatory response.ResultsCompared with the Mc group, the Mm group presented markedly elevated serum TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations (p<0.001; p<0.001) and significantly decreased MFGE8 levels (p<0.01). In contrast, the Mt group presented significant reductions in TNF-α and IL-6 (p<0.05; p<0.05) and a pronounced increase in MFGE8 (p<0.01) relative to those in the Mm group. After treatment with Wuling powder, the abundance and diversity of the intestinal mucosal microbiota were restored. The characteristic genus Sporosarcina was significantly positively correlated with MFGE8, and Paludibaculum was significantly negatively correlated with TNF-α and IL-6.ConclusionWuling powder may inhibit the occurrence of an inflammatory response by reducing the TNF-α and IL-6 levels and increasing the MFGE8 level and may achieve the effect of treating IBS-D by regulating the composition, structure, and function of the intestinal mucosal microbiota, which provides new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of IBS-D via Wuling powder.

      <h1>Exploring the potential of photodynamic therapy in overcoming multidrug resistance: mechanisms, synergies, and clinical advancements in infectious diseases</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      Multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacterial and fungal pathogens poses a growing global health crisis, rendering many conventional antimicrobial therapies ineffective. The rise of MDR strains complicates treatment, prolongs illness, increases healthcare costs, and contributes to higher mortality rates. Mechanisms driving MDR include enzymatic drug inactivation, target modification, efflux pump activity, decreased permeability, and biofilm formation—often fueled by horizontal gene transfer and selective pressure from antimicrobial overuse. In response to the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising, non-traditional approach. PDT utilizes a photosensitizing agent, light of a specific wavelength, and oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that inflict oxidative damage on microbial or cancer cells. This mechanism circumvents conventional resistance pathways, offering targeted, minimally invasive, and effective treatment for infections and malignancies. PDT is particularly adept at penetrating biofilms and resistant microbial populations, thus broadening its clinical applicability. In addition to direct microbial eradication, PDT may stimulate immune responses and demonstrates a favorable safety profile compared to traditional antibiotics or chemotherapy. Furthermore, advances in Antimicrobial Blue Light (aBL) and next-generation photosensitizers enhance PDT’s effectiveness while minimizing resistance development. This review explores the biological mechanisms underlying MDR, the principles and evolution of PDT, and its synergistic potential in managing infectious diseases. By addressing critical gaps in antimicrobial therapy, PDT stands out as a transformative modality in the ongoing battle against drug-resistant pathogens.

      <h1>One mechanism of Sishen Pill on diarrhea with kidney Yang deficiency syndrome: influencing metabolic function by intestinal microorganisms and enzyme activity mediates the gut-kidney axis</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionSishen Pill (SSP), a classic TCM formula, warms the kidney and spleen, astringes the intestine, and stops diarrhea. Emerging evidence suggests that diarrhea with KYDS is linked to gut microbiota imbalance and altered intestinal enzyme activities. At the same time, SSP has been shown to regulate gut microbiota, improve metabolism, and alleviate intestinal disorders. This research investigates how SSP prevents and treats diarrhea by studying the interaction between SSP and intestinal microorganisms.MethodsIn a murine model of diarrhea induced by adenine and Foliuem sennae co-administration, we collected various biospecimens, including intestinal mucosa (ileum and colon), luminal contents, serum, and major organs (kidney, spleen) for comprehensive mechanistic analyses. Techniques such as microbial culture, enzyme activity assays, and HE staining were employed to assess cultivable microbial colony counts, enzyme activity, relevant metabolic indicators, oxidative stress markers, and to observe kidney tissue sections.ResultsThe results indicated that SSP treatment significantly reduced uric acid levels, Escherichia coli (E. coli) count, and amylase activity compared to the spontaneous recovery (MC) group, while the spleen and thymus index, total bacterial count, sucrase activity in contents, protease activity and microbial activity in mucosa were significantly higher than the measurements in MC group. Significant differences were observed in alanine aminotransferase level, Lactobacillus count, Bifidobacterium count, sucrase activity, and microbial activity between the SSP and blank control groups. Serum uric acid levels showed a positive correlation with E. coli colony count and a negative correlation with Lactobacillus colony count. Additionally, total bacterial colony count was negatively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase levels.ConclusionsThe SSP may alleviate diarrhea with kidney Yang deficiency syndrome by reducing E. coli count, enhancing specific enzyme activities, and regulating organ indices and oxidative stress, with the regulatory effects on organ indices and oxidative stress potentially associated with its modulation of E. coli and enzyme activity. This cascade of microbial-enzymatic regulation likely contributes to the normalization of organ indices (e.g., spleen and thymus indices) and alleviation of oxidative stress, as reflected by enhanced superoxide dismutase activity. These findings highlight the multitarget therapeutic potential of SSP in addressing dysfunction in the intestinal-microbiome-enzymatic-organ axis in diarrhea with kidney Yang deficiency syndrome.

      <h1>Dysbiosis of gut and urinary microbiota in urolithiasis patients and post-surgical cases</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundResearch on the microbial roles in urolithiasis primarily focuses on the intestinal microbiota. This study analyzed urine and fecal samples from three cohorts: healthy controls (Control), patients with urinary stones (US), and postoperative patients (PS). We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing analysis to evaluate the variations in microbial communities among these groups during urinary stone production and therapy processes.ResultsIn fecal microbiota, alpha diversity was lower in the stone group versus the control group, with the postoperative group showing the lowest diversity. The β diversity analysis revealed some differences in the microbial community structure of individuals with different health conditions. LEfSe and Wilcoxon analyses were utilized to discover species that exhibited significant differences between groups. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides are more abundant in patients with stones. The increased abundance of Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae, Rumenococcaceae, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella is associated with a reduced risk of kidney stones.ConclusionsAlterations in urinary and intestinal microbiota may indicate urolithiasis status and treatment response. Future studies should explore microbiota modulation (e.g., probiotics) as an adjunctive strategy, while antibiotic stewardship is warranted to minimize microbiota disruption.

      <h1>Establishment of reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification with lateral flow dipstick for the rapid visual detection of Getah virus</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionGetah virus (GETV) is a globally spreading zoonotic mosquito-borne virus that primarily affects horses and pigs, causing significant economic losses in the livestock industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic methods to manage future outbreaks.MethodsIn this study, we developed a nucleic acid detection assay, reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification with lateral flow dipstick (RT-RAA-LFD), for the rapid and convenient detection of GETV.ResultsThe RT-RAA-LFD assay could be completed at 40°C for 15 min. Under optimal reaction conditions, the assay demonstrated excellent specificity, with no cross-reactivity observed with other clinically relevant swine pathogens. It achieved a broad detection range and a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.53 × 102 copies/μL, which was lower than that of RT-PCR (5.53 × 103 copies/μL) assay and slightly higher than that of qRT-PCR (5.53 × 101 copies/μL) assay for GETV. When testing 21 blood samples, the results of RT-RAA-LFD were fully consistent with those of the RT-PCR and qRT-PCR assays. In testing 45 tissue samples, the Kappa value for consistency between RT-RAA-LFD and RT-PCR was 0.776 (P < 0.001), with a concordance rate of 95.6% (43/45). The Kappa value for consistency between RT-RAA-LFD and qRT-PCR was 0.845 (P < 0.001), with a concordance rate of 97.8% (44/45).ConclusionsIn conclusion, the RT-RAA-LFD assay shows great potential as a efficient and user-friendly diagnostic tool for GETV screening, particularly in laboratories with limited resources and equipment.

      <p>
      ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish a multiplex molecular point-of-care assay called fastNTM incorporating an ultra-fast sample pre-treatment for direct identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and 8 non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) commonly prioritized in clinical settings, and to evaluate its performance in 149 clinical confirmed mycobacterial-positive samples.MethodsThe study was divided into two stages: a pilot study to establish the methodology and a clinical validation study to evaluate its performance. In the pilot study, we established the fastNTM and analyzed its performance regarding limits of detection, reproducibility, specificity and efficiency. The clinical validation study was performed using 149 clinical confirmed mycobacterial-positive samples, with 16S rRNA identification as the reference standard. The complete process, from patient to result, was accomplished within 90 minutes.ResultsOf the 149 positive clinical mycobacterial cultures analyzed, 136 were within the designed targets. Among these 136 cultures, 133 samples were correctly identified by fastNTM, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.79%.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that fastNTM with its high accuracy rate are capable to rapidly and effectively differentiate between MTBC and the major NTM species.

      <h1>Colistimethate sodium is efficacious and safe for the management of sepsis in hematological diseases patients: a retrospective study in China</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      PurposePatients afflicted with hematological diseases are at an elevated risk of infection, with the potential for the development of sepsis. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness and safety of colistimethate sodium (CMS) in the management of sepsis in Chinese patients with hematological diseases.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted on hematological diseases patients diagnosed as sepsis and treated with CMS at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between November 2021 and July 2023. Demographics, clinical presentation, causative organisms, clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. The univariate and multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictive factors for clinical effectiveness and renal insufficiency.ResultsA total of 81 hematological patients diagnosed with sepsis were included, the mean (change in sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score) ΔSOFA when utilizing CMS was 3.90 ± 2.10. Following CMS treatment, a clinical effectiveness rate was observed in 62.96% of patients, while the bacteriological eradication rate was 60.23%. Additionally, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 29.63%. The median length of stay in the ICU and total in-hospital stay was 13.5 and 33 days, respectively. AEs were reported in 16 patients (19.75%), including 15 (18.52%) renal insufficiency, 1 (1.23%) hepatic insufficiency, and 1 (1.23%) rash. The multivariate analysis of clinical effectiveness indicated that a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, a higher Charlson comorbidity index, the relapse or refractory of hematological diseases, septic shock, and the use of mechanical ventilation was independently associated with a poor clinical effectiveness. The univariate analysis of renal insufficiency demonstrated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, aplastic anemia, and gastrointestinal infection had a statistically significant impact on renal function.ConclusionsThe findings of our study demonstrated that CMS was an efficacious treatment for sepsis in Chinese patients with hematological diseases, while concurrently exhibiting an acceptable toxicity profile.

      <h1>Endometrial microbiome during early pregnancy among women with and without chronic endometritis: a pilot study</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionAlthough chronic endometritis (CE) is strongly associated with infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the specific microbiome of women with CE who can conceive remain unclear.MethodsThis study recruited 100 participants aged 18 to 45 years with spontaneously conceived pregnancy who opted for pregnancy termination, detected their endometrial microbiome by 16S rRNA, and made a diagnosis of CE.ResultsAmong them, 19 were diagnosed with CE. There was a comparable microbial composition within the endometrium between women with and without CE. The relative abundance of Sphingomonas (21%) and Pseudomonas (8%) were the same in both groups. Compared to women without CE, women with CE exhibited higher abundance of Faecalibacterium (6.5% vs 3.8%), Escherichia-Shigella (3.3% vs 2.6%), Akkermansia (1.65% vs 1.1%), and lower abundance of Lactobacillus (10% vs 14%), and Corynebacterium (1.35% vs 2.15%) at the genus level. Streptococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Akkermansia and Finegoldia exhibited significant interactions with other microbiome in participants with CE.DiscussionIn women with CE, reproductive potential may be associated with the compositional stability of the endometrial microbiome, whereas an imbalance in the abundance of these microbes may be linked to their pregnancy outcomes.

      <h1>Identification of an Aeromonas hydrophila strain as a new mosquito pathogen</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      The gut microbiome plays a major role in promoting organismal homeostasis. Mosquito microbiota influences various aspects of host physiology such as immunity, development and vector competence. Most studies addressing mosquito microbiota consist of microbial diversity profiling and rarely investigate the effects of individual bacteria on host physiology. This remains an important gap of knowledge, especially since not all naturally occurring gut microbes are passive commensals. Here, we identify a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas hydrophila that causes mortality to both Culex pipiens and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes upon ingestion. In addition, we show that A. hydrophila breaches the gut epithelium and gains access to the hemolymph. Parallel to gut damage, we detect a significant increase in the number of proliferative cells in the midguts of A. hydrophila fed mosquitoes. Moreover, we find that this bacterium induces a local immune response in the gut leading to the production of anti-microbial peptides. Finally, whole genome sequencing of the isolated strain revealed that it possesses an arsenal of virulence and resistance genes, which provides mechanistic insights into its mosquitocidal activity. This study reports a novel mosquito pathogen and highlights how a bacterial species inhabiting the gut can impact the host’s survival and homeostasis.

      <h1>Gingipains disrupt bone homeostasis via dual regulation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis through exosomal miR-146a-5p/TRAF6 signaling</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundGingipains are virulence factors released by Porphyromonas gingivalis that contribute to periodontal destruction by disrupting bone metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the dual effects of gingipains on bone metabolism by examining their impact on osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis, hypothesizing that gingipains regulate these processes via direct and exosomal pathways involving microRNA signaling.MethodsClinical samples of gingival crevicular fluid, subgingival plaque, and gingival tissues were collected from 15 patients with stage III-IV periodontitis and 15 healthy controls. The effects of gingipains on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and RAW264.7 macrophages were assessed using cell proliferation assays, qPCR, western blot, microarray analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. A rat periodontitis model was used to validate the findings in vivo.ResultsPeriodontitis patients exhibited elevated levels of lysine- and arginine-specific gingipains, C5a, and RANKL (p < 0.05). Gingipains inhibited BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner while promoting osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 macrophages through BMSCs-derived exosomes. Gingipains reduced the levels of miR-146a-5p in exosomes, which enhanced osteoclast differentiation through the miR-146a-5p/TRAF6 signaling pathway. Animal models confirmed that gingipains aggravated alveolar bone loss, which was mitigated by miR-146a-5p overexpression.ConclusionGingipains disrupt bone metabolism by inhibiting BMSCs osteogenesis and promoting osteoclastogenesis through communication via exosomes. Targeting miR-146a-5p offers a potential therapeutic approach to counter gingipain-induced periodontal destruction.

      <h1>Microbiota and enteric nervous system crosstalk in diabetic gastroenteropathy: bridging mechanistic insights to microbiome-based therapies</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      Diabetes mellitus has emerged as a global public health crisis, with over half of patients experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that exacerbate glucose fluctuations and impair quality of life. While prior research on the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE) focused primarily on autonomic neuropathy, particularly involving the vagus nerve, recent studies have shifted toward the impairment of the enteric nervous system (ENS). As the largest autonomous neural network governing GI motility independent of central control, structural and functional abnormalities of the ENS constitute the fundamental pathological basis for DGE. This review first delineates gut microbial alterations in diabetes and mechanisms by which dysbiosis compromises the integrity of the ENS. Second, we analyze how microbiota-derived metabolites (short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, tryptophan), gut hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, ghrelin), and neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, nitric oxide) multitarget the ENS—collectively establishing the “microbiota-ENS axis” as the central hub for GI sensorimotor control. Finally, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical evidence for microbiome-targeted therapies (probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation) in alleviating DGE symptoms and repairing ENS while outlining translational challenges and future research priorities.

      <h1>Mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives of mitochondrial dysfunction of macrophages in periodontitis</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      Periodontitis is a global inflammatory oral disease, and plaque-induced host excessive immune response is recognized as a major cause of its pathogenesis. In recent years, the relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction to periodontitis has been increasingly investigated, particularly with respect to macrophages, the key immune cells in the periodontal immune microenvironment. Mitochondrial dysfunction drives macrophage M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation through mechanisms such as metabolic reprogramming, reactive oxygen species release, abnormal mitophagy, abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis and damaged mitochondrial dynamic. In addition, mitochondrial transfer in the periodontitis setting has been reported in several researches. In this review, we highlight the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on macrophages in the periodontitis setting and summarize emerging therapeutic strategies for targeting mitochondria in periodontitis, including antioxidants, modulators of metabolic reprogramming, nanomaterials and photodynamic therapy.

      <h1>Diagnostic performance and clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in suspected central nervous system infections: a prospective comparative study</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic performance and clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections.Methodsprospective study was conducted from December 2019 to January 2024, enrolling 110 patients with suspected CNS infections. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were subjected to mNGS, conventional biochemistry, and culture. Clinical features and outcomes were compared between patients confirmed with CNS infections and those without.ResultsOf the enrolled patients, 69 were diagnosed with CNS infections. mNGS identified pathogens in 62 cases (77.11%), including 54 clinically confirmed true positives (49.09%), significantly surpassing traditional CSF culture (6.36%). mNGS reported results within 24 hours, considerably shorter than the 72~120 hours required for culture. Compared to the non-infection group, patients with CNS infections had significantly higher ICU admission(ICUA) rates, prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and elevated rates of antibiotic adjustment and mNGS positivity (P<0.05). CSF turbidity, cell count, and protein levels were significantly elevated, while glucose and chloride levels were reduced. Logistic regression identified mNGS, CSF protein, and glucose levels as independent predictors of CNS infection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy for continuous CSF variables over binary ones, with mNGS showing robust performance [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.794].ConclusionmNGS offers rapid and accurate pathogen detection, outperforming conventional methods in sensitivity and turnaround time, and provides valuable guidance for individualized antimicrobial treatment in CNS infections.

      <h1>The relationship between immune cell infiltration and necroptosis gene expression in sepsis: an analysis using single-cell transcriptomic data</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundSepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It remains a significant medical challenge due to its high mortality rates and requires a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms. This study aims to elucidate the differential expression of necroptosis-related genes in sepsis and their impact on immune characteristics.MethodsWe obtained gene expression profiles and single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, and functional enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler package for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were conducted to explore pathway enrichments. Immune cell infiltration differences between sepsis (SE) and healthy control (HC) groups were quantified using the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. Differential marker genes between SE and HC groups were identified by single-cell data analysis using the Seurat and SingleR packages.ResultsOur results revealed 849 necroptosis-related DEGs, with 843 upregulated and 16 downregulated in the SE group. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression identified 22 key DEGs, including CTSS, MAPK8, and MPRIP. Among these, 157 necroptosis-related DEGs were consistently identified between SE and HC groups. GO analysis indicated significant enrichment in biological processes such as the regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways and IκB kinase/NF-κB signaling. KEGG pathway analysis revealed involvement in necroptosis, apoptosis, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. GSVA demonstrated that Wnt signaling was upregulated in the SE group. Significant differences in immune cell infiltration were observed between sepsis and healthy control groups, particularly in activated B cells and CD4 T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 33,287 cells categorized into 26 clusters, with neutrophils predominating. Key necroptosis genes such as CTSS, TXN, MYH9, FPR1, FMR1, and MPRIP exhibited differential expression patterns across various immune cell types.ConclusionsOur integrated bioinformatics approach provides insights into the role of necroptosis-related genes in sepsis pathogenesis and their influence on immune responses. These findings improve our understanding of sepsis mechanisms and may guide future therapeutic strategies targeting necroptosis pathways.

      <h1>Ferroptosis and mitochondrial ROS are central to SARS-CoV-2-induced hepatocyte death</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundAlthough COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the Huh7.5 cell model.MethodsHuh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection, and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways was probed using chemical inhibitors.ResultsBoth SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics. Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.

      <h1>Correlation of intestinal bacteria, fungi and dietary nutrient intake in NAFLD patients with spleen deficiency syndrome</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundSpleen deficiency syndrome (SDS) is one of the primary Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes in Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Diet influences NAFLD and SDS through the intestinal microbiota. The current study aimed to investigate the interrelationships of intestinal bacteria, fungi and dietary nutrient intake in NAFLD patients with SDS.MethodsThe NAFLD TCM Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Scale was administered to evaluate the TCM clinical symptoms of NAFLD patients. The Spleen Deficiency PRO Scale and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) were employed to respectively diagnose spleen deficiency syndrome and assess dietary nutrient intake, energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII), and dietary diversity scores (DDS) in NAFLD patients. Subsequently, stool samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 region sequencing to analyze the interrelationships among target intestinal bacteria, fungi, and dietary nutrient intake.ResultsThe NAFLD TCM PRO Scale indicated that the average score for symptoms related to SDS in NAFLD patients was 4.13 ± 0.40. Compared with NAFLD patients without SDS, those with SDS had insufficient dietary nutrient intake of diet-derived antioxidants such as carotene and folic acid, stronger pro-inflammatory effects of food, and reduced dietary diversity (P < 0.05). Additionally, sufficient dietary diversity was identified as a protective factor against SDS in NAFLD (OR: 0.424; 95% CI: 0.309, 0.583; P < 0.001). 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 region sequencing results showed that Collinsella (LDA = 3.947, P = 0.046) and Rhizopus (LDA = 3.196, P = 0.01) were enriched in NAFLD patients with SDS, whereas Intestinimonas was markedly increased in NAFLD patients without SDS (LDA = 2.015, P = 0.02). Correlation analysis demonstrated that Gemmiger and Rhizopus were significantly positively correlated (r = 0.778, P < 0.001), as were Candida and Segatella (r = 0.569, P < 0.001). Intestinimonas was positively correlated with the intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients such as dietary fiber, vitamin C, and iron (0.2 < r < 0.5, P < 0.05), while niacin intake was negatively correlated with Rhizopus abundance (r = -0.39, P = 0.025).ConclusionSymptoms related to SDS are common in patients with NAFLD. The independent and interactive effects of intestinal bacteria and fungi might have collectively influenced the immune function and inflammation levels in NAFLD patients with SDS. These processes were likely associated with the intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients, as well as niacin.

      <h1>Respiratory diseases and the gut microbiota: an updated review</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      The gut microbiota constitutes a vital ecosystem within the human body playing a pivotal role in immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis. Emerging research underscores a sophisticated interplay between the gut and lungs, termed the “gut-lung axis.” Gut microbes exert influence over pulmonary immunity and metabolism via immune mediators (e.g., cytokines and interleukins), metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and direct microbial translocation. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in a spectrum of respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute lung injury (ALI), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) and tuberculosis (TB). Although multi-omics technologies have elucidated certain mechanisms underlying the gut-lung axis, numerous pathways remain to be fully delineated. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of gut microbiota and their metabolites in respiratory diseases and assesses their therapeutic potential. Future investigations should prioritize strategies to restore and maintain microbial homeostasis, such as dietary modifications, probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation to pioneer novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. These summaries of advances in gut microbiology research promise better management and exploration of therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases.

      <h1>Predictive analysis of all-cause mortality of previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients complicated by hypertension</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      ObjectiveTo investigate the risk factors for all-cause mortality of previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients complicated by hypertension and construct a predictive model.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of inpatients with previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by hypertension from 2019 to 2021 in Changsha Central Hospital. Patients’ survival status and cardiovascular events were collected through telephone follow-up. LASSO regression was utilized to screen predictive variables, and binary logistic regression identified mortality risk factors. A predictive nomogram model was developed using R software, and its precision and reliability were verified.ResultsAmong the 1,014 patients, there were 100 (9.86%) deaths and 82 (8.09%) cardiovascular events. LASSO regression screened out 13 predictive variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking history, sputum bacteriology, pleural effusion, coronary heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were independent risk factors. Based on the training set data, a nomogram prognostic model was developed, showing an AUC of 0.712 (95% CI: 0.777-0.847), with 50.0% sensitivity and 84.3% specificity. The model’s fit was confirmed through internal and external validations.ConclusionThe prediction model constructed in this study has high predictive ability and satisfactory clinical efficacy, and can provide an effective individualized prediction tool for assessing all-cause mortality risk in patients with previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by hypertension.

      <h1>Evolution, dissemination, and genetic dynamics of the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM in China</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundBlaNDM, which encodes a metallo-β-lactamase that can hydrolyze most β-lactam antibiotics, has become a serious public health concern in China. It is crucial to investigate the evolution, dissemination, and genetic dynamics of blaNDM to develop potential strategies to control the proliferation of blaNDM.MethodsIn this study, we collected 1021 blaNDM-positive isolates, which features 67 new genomes from our laboratory and 954 genomes from NCBI. Through epidemiological big data analysis, phylogenetic tree-based geographic transmission analysis, and upstream-downstream genetic clustering evolution analysis, we systematically analyzed the evolution, dissemination, and genetic dynamics of blaNDM-positive bacteria.ResultsAnalysis results indicate that blaNDM-5 is gradually supplanting blaNDM-1 in China and Acinetobacter has been replaced as the primary blaNDM-harboring genus by the Enterobacter, Escherichia, and Klebsiella, which are both within the Enterobacteriaceae family and more easily transmitted among humans. Furthermore, blaNDM-positive bacteria exhibit a distinct livestock-environment-human transmission cycle, while the phylogenetic diversity of blaNDM and tet(X)-co-carrying genera is progressively expanding with concomitantly enhanced resistance phenotypes. Currently, the predominant blaNDM-positive bacterial strains have likely disseminated from southwest China to coastal regions. We further identified multiple transposon structures beyond Tn125 that may facilitate blaNDM transfer.ConclusionsThe diversity of the blaNDM and its carrier bacterial strains is continuously increasing, and its transmission range is also expanding. Of greater concern, super-resistant strains co-harboring blaNDM and tet(X) genes exhibit high potential for imminent emergence in human populations. Considering that the blaNDM-carrier bacteria are increasingly adapted to inter-human spread, the analysis results above can provide methodological and data support for epidemiological surveillance, tracing, and early warning alerts.

      <h1>Deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 fosters intracellular Staphylococcus aureus survival</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      BackgroundIntracellular invasion and persistence of Staphylococcus aureus can lead to chronic infection and is an effective strategy for the pathogen to evade the host immune response and antibiotic therapy. Selective ubiquitination of bacterial surfaces via E3 ubiquitin ligases is a mechanism by which host cells combat intracellular bacteria and target them for autophagosomal degradation. However, knowledge of the E3 ligases involved in intracellular recognition of S. aureus is still very limited.MethodsWe studied A549 lung epithelial cells during S. aureus infection, focusing on the role of the E3 ligase leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1 (LRSAM1). We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate LRSAM1-deficient A549 cells and monitored intracellular bacterial survival, activation of host cellular signalling pathways related to cytokine production, and host cell death during S. aureus infection.ResultsIn LRSAM1-deficient host cells we observed a significant increase in intracellular bacterial load, which was accompanied by an increased host cell death and elevated secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Despite induced selective autophagy, LRSAM1 knockout host cells were incapable of lowering and eliminating the pathogen, which seems to be caused by the reduced ubiquitination of the bacterial surface.ConclusionThe results indicate a significant role of LRSAM1 in the clearance of intracellular S. aureus. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the host cellular responses to S. aureus infection and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat intracellularly persistent S. aureus.

      <h1>Puf4 -mediated oxidative stress virulence attenuation in Cryptococcus neoformans</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      IntroductionCryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous environmental fungal pathogen whose pathogenicity is closely linked to its ability to adapt to host environments. The RNA-binding protein Puf4 plays a key role in regulating the cell wall of C. neoformans. However, the specific mechanisms by which Puf4 regulates metabolism and virulence remain unclear.MethodsIn this study, we systematically investigated the role of Puf4 in the metabolism and virulence of C. neoformans using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), biochemical analysis, and in vivo animal experiments.ResultsColony-spotting assay assays show that Puf4 affects the cell membrane and oxidative stress. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Puf4 was enriched in key metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. Biochemical analysis revealed that Puf4 overexpression led to significant increases in both total carbohydrate and glycogen content. Additionally, the Puf4-overexpressing strain showed elevated ROS levels, and reduced resistance to antimycin A, indicating decreased oxidative stress tolerance. Notably, Puf4 overexpression resulted in reduced capsule size and decreased L-DOPA production, accompanied by downregulated expression of the capsule-associated gene CAP10 and the melanin biosynthesis gene LAC1. In vivo animal experiments further confirmed that the virulence of the Puf4-overexpressing strain was significantly attenuated.DiscussionThese findings suggest that Puf4 may serve as a regulator linking metabolic status and pathogenic potential in C. neoformans, although the underlying mechanisms require further elucidation.

      <h1>Morphology and molecular phylogeny of Dothideomycetes fungi associated with Dracaena plants</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology)
      <p>
      Dracaena species are widely recognized for their exceptional drought tolerance, making them ideal candidates for sustainable landscaping and ecological restoration in arid regions. Limestone outcrops hosting Dracaena are unique ecosystems characterized by extreme environmental conditions such as nutrient-poor substrates. Thus, they provide valuable opportunities for studying fungal diversity and their adaptations. Despite their ecological importance, knowledge concerning fungal communities associated with limestone-inhabiting Dracaena species remains limited, particularly within the diverse biogeographic contexts of Thailand. Microfungal samples were collected from dead wood and leaves of Dracaena species across seven provinces in Thailand (Chiang Rai, Kanchanaburi, Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Ratchaburi, Songkhla, and Tak). Fungal taxa were identified and characterized through detailed morphological examinations combined with multi-gene phylogenetic analyses using Actin (act), Internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (LSU), translation elongation fac-tor 1-alpha (tef1-α), and beta-tubulin (tub) gene regions. This study documents eleven fungal taxa isolated from Dracaena substrates, belonging to seven families across five fungal orders. Three new species viz. Cladosporium dracaenae, C. dracaenicola and Torula dracaenae were described, and eight new host records were established (Bipolaris coffeana, Curvularia lunata, Lasiodiplodia bruguierae, L. lignicola, L. thailandica, Longididymella clematidis, Ochroconis musae and Zasmidium citrigriseum). Species de-scriptions, color photographic plates, phylogenetic trees and updated taxonomic notes are provided for all isolated taxa. The findings advance the current understanding of microfungal diversity associated with limestone outcrop habitats and Dracaena species, contributing to broader ecological and conservation efforts. By revealing novel fungal species and previously undocumented host-fungus interactions, this study underscores the rich but underexplored fungal biodiversity of limestone ecosystems in Thailand.

      BackgroundPrompt identification and management of donor-derived infections post-kidney transplantation are critical. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogens within donor organ preservation fluids and recipient wound drainage fluids, with a comparison made against conventional culture methods.MethodsThis study involved 141 kidney transplant patients (May 1st, 2020 to Jan 31st, 2024). Donor organ preservation fluids and recipient wound drainage fluids were collected and analyzed by mNGS and conventional culture. Pathogen detection differences between mNGS and culture were evaluated. The antibiotic adjustment and infectious complications of the recipients were recorded.ResultsFor organ preservation fluids, the positive rate of convention culture were lower than that of mNGS (24.8% (35/141) vs 47.5% (67/141), p<0.05). For recipient wound drainage fluids, the positivity rate of convention culture were lower than that of mNGS (2.1% (3/141) vs 27.0% (38/141), p<0.05). Compared to traditional culture-based methods, mNGS demonstrated a significantly higher positive detection rate for the combination of ESKAPE pathogens and/or fungi (28.4% (40/141) vs 16.3% (23/141) p< 0.05). Of the pathogens detected through convention culture, mNGS was capable of detecting 79.2% (19/24) of combinations comprising Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, yet it detected only 22.2% (2/9) of Gram-positive bacteria, and 55.6% (5/9) of fungi. Certain clinically atypical pathogens, mainly Mycobacterium, Clostridium tetanus, and parasites, can solely be detected via mNGS. The rehospitalization rate due to infections was 13.5% (19/141), while the donor-derived infection rate amounted to 2.8% (4/141). Guided by mNGS and bacterial culture results, adjustments were made to antibiotic administration, with no severe vascular complications arising.ConclusionsBy employing mNGS to analyze drainage fluids and organ preservation fluids, highly pathogenic and atypical pathogenic microorganisms can be rapidly identified with high throughput. While limitations exist in detecting fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, mNGS are need to be jointly applied with conventional culture under current conditions.
