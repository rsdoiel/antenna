agalactiae isolated from clinical mastitis cases on large dairy farms in
north China: phenotype, genotype of antimicrobial resistance and
virulence genes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Streptococcus agalactiae (Strep. agalactiae) is bovine mastitis
pathogen and has thus became a matter of concern to dairy farms
worldwide in terms of economic loss. The aims of this study were to (a)
determine virulence genes, and (b) characterize the antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) profiles and AMR genes and (c) figure out the
relationship between AMR phenotypes and genotypes of Strep. agalactiae
isolated from dairy cows in north China. A total of 20 virulence genes
and 23 AMR genes of 140 isolates collected from 12 farms in six
provinces were studied. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 10
veterinary commonly used antimicrobials were tested using the broth
microdilution method. Results showed that all the isolates harbored the
virulence genes lacIV, gapC, and dltA. The isolates that harbored the
genes lacIII, fbsA, hylB, and cfb exhibited the high prevalence
(99.29%), followed by isolates that harbored lacI (98.57%), bibA
(97.86%), cylE (97.14%), lacII (92.14%), cspA (52.14%), pavA (25%), bca
(2.14%), and scpB (0.71%). The fbsB, lmb, spbI, bac, and rib genes were
not detected. The virulence patterns of B (fbsA_cfb_cylE_
hylB_bibA_cspA_ gapC_dltA_lacIII/IV) and C (fbsA_cfb_ bibA _ gapC_
dltA_lacIV) were dominant, accounting for 97.86% of the isolates. The
following AMR genes were prevalent: pbp1A (97.14%), tet(M) (95.00%), lnu
(A) (80.71%), erm (B) (75.00%), tet(O) (72.14%), blaZ (49.29%), tet(S)
(29.29%), blaTEM (25.71%), erm (A) (17.14%), erm (C) (13.57%), tet (L)
(10.71%), linB (2.86%), and erm (TR) (2.86%). The pbp2b, mecA1, mecC,
lnu (D), erm (F/G/Q), and mef (A) genes were not detected. Eighty
percent of the isolates harbored AMR genes and were highly resistant to
tetracycline, followed by macrolides (10.71%), lincosamides (9.29%) and
Î²-lactams (4.29%). In conclusion, isolates only exhibited well
correlation between tetracyclines resistance phenotype and genotype, and
almost all isolates harbored intact combination of virulence genes.</p>

study of chicken lung transcriptome to understand the host immune
response during Newcastle disease virus challenge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNewcastle disease is one of the significant issues in the
poultry industry, having catastrophic effects worldwide. The lung is one
of the essential organs which harbours Bronchus-associated lymphoid
tissue and plays a vital role in the immune response. Leghorn and
Fayoumi breeds are known to have differences in resistance to Newcastle
disease. Along with genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also
known to regulate various biological pathways through gene
regulation.MethodsThis study analysed the lung transcriptome data and
identified the role of genes and long non-coding RNAs in differential
immune resistance. The computational pipeline, FHSpipe, as used in our
previous studies on analysis of harderian gland and trachea
transcriptome was used to identify genes and lncRNAs. This was followed
by differential expression analysis, functional annotation of genes and
lncRNAs, identification of transcription factors, microRNAs and finally
validation using qRT-PCR.Results and discussionA total of 8219 novel
lncRNAs were identified. Of them, 1263 lncRNAs and 281 genes were
differentially expressed. About 66 genes were annotated with either an
immune-related GO term or pathway, and 12 were annotated with both. In
challenge and breed-based analysis, most of these genes were upregulated
in Fayoumi compared to Leghorn, and in timepoint-based analysis, Leghorn
challenge chicken showed downregulation between time points. A similar
trend was observed in the expression of lncRNAs. Co-expression analysis
has revealed several lncRNAs co-expressing with immune genes with a
positive correlation. Several genes annotated with non-immune pathways,
including metabolism, signal transduction, transport of small molecules,
extracellular matrix organization, developmental biology and cellular
processes, were also impacted. With this, we can understand that Fayoumi
chicken showed upregulated immune genes and positive cis-lncRNAs during
both the non-challenged and NDV-challenge conditions, even without viral
transcripts in the tissue. This finding shows that these
immune-annotated genes and coexpressing cis-lncRNAs play a significant
role in Fayoumi being comparatively resistant to NDV compared to
Leghorn. Our study affirms and expands upon the outcomes of previous
studies and highlights the crucial role of lncRNAs during the immune
response to NDV.ConclusionThis analysis clearly shows the differences in
the gene expression patterns and lncRNA co-expression with the genes
between Leghorn and Fayoumi, indicating that the lncRNAs and
co-expressing genes might potentially have a role in differentiating
these breeds. We hypothesise that these genes and lncRNAs play a vital
role in the higher resistance of Fayoumi to NDV than Leghorn. This study
can pave the way for future studies to unravel the biological mechanism
behind the regulation of immune-related genes.</p>

of bacteriophage therapy for difficult-to-treat musculoskeletal
infections: a bench-to-bedside perspective</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Given the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance, scientists
are urgently seeking adjunct antimicrobial strategies, such as phage
therapy (PT). However, despite promising results for the treatment of
musculoskeletal infections in our center, crucial knowledge gaps remain.
Therefore, a prospective observational study (PHAGEFORCE) and a
multidisciplinary approach was set up to achieve and optimize
standardized treatment guidelines. At our center, PT is strictly
controlled and monitored by a multidisciplinary taskforce. Each phage
treatment follows the same pathway to ensure standardization and data
quality. Within the PHAGEFORCE framework, we established a testing
platform to gain insight in the safety and efficacy of PT,
biodistribution, phage kinetics and the molecular interaction between
phages and bacteria. The draining fluid is collected to determine the
phage titer and bacterial load. In addition, all bacterial isolates are
fully characterized by genome sequencing to monitor the emergence of
phage resistance. We hereby present a standardized bench-to-bedside
protocol to gain more insight in the kinetics and dynamics of PT for
musculoskeletal infections.</p>

features and prognostic utility of neutrophil in severe patients with
Klebsiella pneumoniae infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundNeutrophil plays a pivotal role in the management of
Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Delineate the clinical characteristics
and prognostic utility of neutrophil in severe patients with K.
pneumoniae infection are crucial for clinical management and prognostic
assessment.MethodsK. pneumoniae patients with different infection sites
were enrolled from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and
eICU Collaborative Research Database. Temporal variations of neutrophil
counts within 30 days of clinical onset were examined using locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing curves. Logistic regression analysis was
performed to assess the relationship between neutrophil counts and
hospital mortality.ResultsA total of 1,705 patients caused by K.
pneumonia were included in the study. The non-survivor group exhibited a
comparatively older age and a higher proportion of K. pneumoniae
infections originating from respiratory and bloodstream sources compared
to the survivor group (38.4% vs 21.1%, p&lt;0.0001, and 15.1% vs 10.3%,
p=0.021). Patients combined with multiple drug resistance strains,
respiratory infection, liver disease, and above 60 years exhibited a
specific dynamic process of neutrophil levels. Neutrophils counts peaked
at admission and 1-2 weeks later. There was a âUâ-shaped relationship
between neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.ConclusionsNeutrophils
in K. pneumoniae infected patients have distinctive features and dynamic
clinical trajectories. Close monitoring of severe patients infected with
K. pneumoniae upon admission and during the first 1-2 weeks after
admission is of utmost importance, particularly for patients with a
neutrophil count exceeding 8.0Ã109/L.</p>

id="the-influence-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection-on-acute-coronary-syndrome-and-lipid-metabolism-in-the-chinese-ethnicity">The
influence of Helicobacter pylori infection on acute coronary syndrome
and lipid metabolism in the Chinese ethnicity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients frequently present a
relatively high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.
H. pylori was previously hypothesized to induce ACS through the
regulation of lipid levels. However, the risk of H. pylori-induced ACS
varies significantly among different ethnic groups, and the associations
between H. pylori and lipid parameters remain unclear. This study aimed
to systematically assess the risk of ACS in Chinese populations with H.
pylori infection while also evaluating the effects of H. pylori on lipid
parameters.Materials and methodsA hospital-based caseâcontrol study
involving 280 participants was conducted. Immunoblotting was used for
the detection and genotyping of H. pylori. The associations between H.
pylori and ACS, as well as lipid parameters, were analyzed via the
chi-square test and a multiple logistic regression model.ResultsH.
pylori infection significantly increased the risk of ACS among all
participants (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.04, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.76â9.25, P &lt; 0.05), with no associations with virulence
factors (cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) or vacuole toxin geneA
(VacA)). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant increase in the risk
of ACS among the elderly population aged 56â64 years with H. pylori
infection. Additionally, a substantial association was observed between
H. pylori and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). No significant
differences were found in lipid parameters, including low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol
(TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the LDL/HDL
ratio, between individuals positive and negative for H. pylori
infection. Similar results were observed between the ACS group and the
control group.ConclusionsOur study has demonstrated for the first time
that H. pylori does not significantly impact lipid metabolism but
increases the risk of ACS fourfold in the Chinese population (OR = 4.04,
95% CI: 1.76â9.25). Furthermore, the virulence factors of H. pylori
(CagA and VacA) may not be involved in the mechanisms by which they
promote the development of ACS. This finding provides additional
evidence for the association between H. pylori and ACS among different
ethnic groups and refutes the biological mechanism by which H. pylori
affects ACS through lipid metabolism regulation. Regular screening for
H. pylori and eradication treatment in elderly individuals and those at
high risk for ACS may be effective measures for reducing the incidence
of ACS. Future research should include multicenter randomized controlled
trials and explore host genetics and the effects of H. pylori on the gut
microbiota as potential biological pathways linking H. pylori and
ACS.</p>

nucleatum induces invasive growth and angiogenic responses in malignant
oral keratinocytes that are cell line- and bacterial
strain-specific</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic commensal of the oral cavity
recently reported to be associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal
tract and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we
investigate the impact on oral keratinocytes of infection with a
genetically diverse set of strains of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum
recovered from patients with oral dysplasia (n=6). We employed H357 oral
keratinocytes derived from a stage 1 OSCC and H376 cells derived from a
stage 3 OSCC. Adhesion phenotypes were strain specific, with 3/6
clinical isolates examined exhibiting higher adherence to the stage 3
H376 cell line. Conversely, intracellular invasion was greatest in the
H357 cells and was associated with specific transcriptional responses
including autophagy and keratinization. Infection of both H357 and H376
cell lines induced transcriptional and cytokine responses linked to
cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. F. nucleatum infection induced
greater levels of MMP9 secretion in the H376 cell line which was
associated with enhanced motility and invasion phenotypes. Additionally,
the degree of F. nucleatum induced invasive growth by H376 cells varied
between different clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
Blockage of CCL5 signalling using the inhibitor metCCL5 resulted in
reduced keratinocyte invasion. F. nucleatum infection also induced
expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine MCP-1 and the angiogenic
growth factor VEGF-A resulting in increased capillary-like tube
formation in HUVEC cells, most significantly in H376 cells. Treatment of
HUVEC cells with resveratrol, a VEGF-A signalling inhibitor,
significantly attenuated F. nucleatum induced tube formation. Our data
indicate that the outcomes of F. nucleatum-oral cell interactions can
vary greatly depending on the bacterial genotype and the malignant
phenotype of the host cell.</p>

in the epidemiological patterns of respiratory syncytial virus and human
metapneumovirus infection among pediatric patients and their correlation

<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the prevalence of respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among pediatric
patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) in southern China
both pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, as well as identify associated
risk factors for severe infections.MethodsThe study conducted a
real-time PCR analysis on hospitalized children with ARTI from 2012 to
2023, specifically targeting RSV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens.
Additionally, demographic data was collected during this
analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of RSV occurs triennially, and likewise,
the temporal pattern of hMPV outbreaks mirrors that of RSV. The peak
infection rates of RSV and hMPV occurred during and following the
implementation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures. The
incidence of RSV infection exhibited bimodal peaks in 2022, while hMPV
demonstrated seasonal peaks during the spring, fall, and winter periods
post-COVID-19 pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an
upward trend in the proportion of female patients and patients aged one
year and older presenting with ARTI, RSV infections, and hMPV
infections. Infant (OR = 4.767, 95%CI: [3.888â5.846], p &lt; 0.0001),
presence of co-infection (OR = 0.540, 95%CI: [0.404â0.722], p &lt;
0.0001), and existence of comorbidities (OR = 1.582, 95%CI:
[1.285â1.949], p &lt; 0.0001) was the risk ratio for the severity of RSV
infection. Children infected with hMPV under the age of 1 year (OR =
0.322, 95%CI: [0.180 â 0.575], p &lt; 0.0001), as well as those with
comorbidities (OR = 8.809, 95%CI: [4.493 â 17.272], p &lt; 0.0001), have
a higher risk of developing severe illness.ConclusionThe changing
epidemiological patterns have the potential to lead to widespread severe
outbreaks among children, particularly those with underlying medical
conditions who may experience more severe symptoms. Conducting
surveillance for pneumoviridae viruses in children is an imperative
measure to establish a robust foundation for future epidemic prevention
and treatment strategies.</p>

the power of short-chain fatty acids in ameliorating intestinal mucosal
immunity: a new porcine nutritional approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a subset of organic fatty acids with
carbon chains ranging from one to six atoms in length, encompass
acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These compounds are the endproducts
of dietary fiber fermentation, primarily catalyzed by the glycolysis and
pentose phosphate pathways within the gut microbiota. SCFAs act as
pivotal energy substrates and signaling molecules in the realm of animal
nutrition, exerting a profound influence on the intestinal, immune
system, and intestinal barrier functions. Specifically, they contibute
to 60-70% of the total energy requirements in ruminants and 10-25% in
monogastric animals. SCFAs have demonstrated the capability to
effectively modulate intestinal pH, optimize the absorption of mineral
elements, and impede pathogen invasion. Moreover, they enhance the
expression of proteins associated with intestinal tight junctions and
stimulate mucus production, thereby refining intestinal tissue
morphology and preserving the integrity of the intestinal structure.
Notably, SCFAs also exert anti-inflammatory properties, mitigating
inflammation within the intestinal epithelium and strengthening the
intestinal barrierâs defensive capabilities. The present review
endeavors to synthesize recent findings regarding the role of SCFAs as
crucial signaling intermediaries between the metabolic activities of gut
microbiota and the status of porcine cells. It also provides a
comprehensive overview of the current literature on SCFAsâ impact on
immune responses within the porcine intestinal mucosa.</p>
