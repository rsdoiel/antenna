id="an-insight-into-the-vaginal-microbiome-of-infertile-women-in-bangladesh-using-metagenomic-approach">An
insight into the vaginal microbiome of infertile women in Bangladesh
using metagenomic approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe dysbiosis of vaginal microbiota is recognized as a
potential underlying factor contributing to infertility in women. This
study aimed to compare the vaginal microbiomes of infertile and fertile
women to investigate their relationship with infertility.
MethodsMetagenomic analysis was conducted on samples from 5 infertile
and 5 fertile individuals using both amplicon 16S and metagenomics
shotgun sequencing methods.Results and discussionIn the infertile group,
the bacterial community was primarily represented by three major
bacterial genera: Lactobacillus (79.42%), Gardnerella (12.56%) and
Prevotella (3.33%), whereas, the fertile group exhibited a more diverse
composition with over 8 major bacterial genera, accompanied by
significantly reduced abundance of Lactobacillus (48.79%) and
Gardnerella (6.98%). At the species level, higher abundances of L.
iners, L. gasseri and G. vaginalis were observed in the infertile group.
Regarding the microbiome composition, only one fertile and two infertile
subjects exhibited the healthiest Community State Types, CST-1, while
CST-3 was observed among two infertile and one fertile subject, and
CST-4 in three other fertile and one infertile subject. Overall, alpha
diversity metrics indicated greater diversity and lower species richness
in the control (fertile) group, while the infertile group displayed the
opposite trend. However, beta-diversity analysis did not show distinct
clustering of samples associated with any specific group; instead, it
demonstrated CST-type specific clustering. Shotgun metagenomics further
confirmed the dominance of Firmicutes, with a greater abundance of
Lactobacillus species in the infertile group. Specifically, L. iners and
G. vaginalis were identified as the most dominant and highly abundant in
the infertile group. Fungi were only identified in the control group,
dominated by Penicillium citrinum (62.5%). Metagenome-assembled genomes
(MAGs) corroborated read-based taxonomic profiling, with the taxon L.
johnsonii identified exclusively in disease samples. MAG identities
shared by both groups include Shamonda orthobunyavirus, L. crispatus,
Human endogenous retrovirus K113, L. iners, and G. vaginalis.
Interestingly, the healthy microbiomes sequenced in this study contained
two clusters, Penicillium and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, not found in
the public dataset. In conclusion, this study suggests that lower
species diversity with a higher abundance of L. iners, L. gasseri and G.
vaginalis, may contribute to female infertility in our study datasets.
However, larger sample sizes are necessary to further evaluate such
association.</p>

influences multiple diseases by regulating gut microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Acupuncture, an important green and side effect-free therapy in
traditional Chinese medicine, is widely use both domestically and
internationally. Acupuncture can interact with the gut microbiota and
influence various diseases, including metabolic diseases,
gastrointestinal diseases, mental disorders, nervous system diseases,
and other diseases. This review presents a thorough analysis of these
interactions and their impacts and examines the alterations in the gut
microbiota and the potential clinical outcomes following acupuncture
intervention to establish a basis for the future utilization of
acupuncture in clinical treatments.</p>

role of M cells in enteroid infection by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Infection of ruminants such as cattle with Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne’s disease, a disease characterized
by chronic inflammation of the small intestine and diarrhoea. Infection
with MAP is acquired via the faecal-to-oral route and the pathogen
initially invades the epithelial lining of the small intestine. In this
study we used an in vitro 3D mouse enteroid model to determine the
influence of M cells in infection of the gut epithelia by MAP, in
comparison with another bacterial intestinal pathogen of veterinary
importance, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The differentiation
of M cells in the enteroid cultures was induced by stimulation with the
cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and the
effects on MAP and Salmonella uptake and intracellular survival were
determined. The presence of M cells in the cultures correlated with
increased uptake and intracellular survival of Salmonella, but had no
effect on MAP. Interestingly neither pathogen was observed to
preferentially accumulate within GP2-positive M cells.</p>

id="a-prediction-model-for-secondary-invasive-fungal-infection-among-severe-sars-cov-2-positive-patients-in-icu">A
prediction model for secondary invasive fungal infection among severe
SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in ICU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over seven
million deaths, and IFI can further complicate the clinical course of
COVID-19. Coinfection of COVID-19 and IFI (secondary IFI) pose
significant threats not only to healthcare systems but also to patient
lives. After the control measures for COVID-19 were lifted in China, we
observed a substantial number of ICU patients developing
COVID-19-associated IFI. This creates an urgent need for predictive
assessment of COVID-19 patients in the ICU environment for early
detection of suspected fungal infection cases.MethodsThis study is a
single-center, retrospective research endeavor. We conducted a
case-control study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) positive patients. The cases consisted of patients who
developed any secondary IFI during their ICU stay at Jilin University
China-Japan Union Hospital in Changchun, Jilin Province, China, from
December 1st, 2022, to August 31st, 2023. The control group consisted of
SARS-CoV-2 positive patients without secondary IFI. Descriptive and
comparative analyses were performed, and a logistic regression
prediction model for secondary IFI in COVID-19 patients was established.
Additionally, we observed an increased incidence of COVID-19-associated
pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) during this pandemic. Therefore, we
conducted a univariate subgroup analysis on top of IFI, using non-CAPA
patients as the control subgroup.ResultsFrom multivariate analysis, the
prediction model identified 6 factors that are significantly associated
with IFI, including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than
2 weeks (aOR=4.14, 95% CI 2.03-8.67), fever (aOR=2.3, 95%CI 1.16-4.55),
elevated log IL-6 levels (aOR=1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.43) and prone position
ventilation (aOR=2.38, 95%CI 1.15-4.97) as independent risk factors for
COVID-19 secondary IFI. High BMI (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2) (aOR=0.85, 95% CI
0.75-0.94) and the use of COVID-19 immunoglobulin (aOR=0.45, 95% CI
0.2-0.97) were identified as independent protective factors against
COVID-19 secondary IFI. The Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) area under
the curve (AUC) of this model was 0.81, indicating good
classification.ConclusionWe recommend paying special attention for the
occurrence of secondary IFI in COVID-19 patients with low BMI (BMI &lt;
28 kg/m2), elevated log IL-6 levels and fever. Additionally, during the
treatment of COVID-19 patients, we emphasize the importance of
minimizing the duration of broad-spectrum antibiotic use and highlight
the potential of immunoglobulin application in reducing the incidence of
IFI.</p>
