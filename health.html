of phage-based decontamination in respiratory intensive care unit
environments using ddPCR and 16S rRNA targeted sequencing
techniques</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of hospital-acquired
infections (HAIs), primarily spread through environmental contamination
in hospitals. The effectiveness of current chemical disinfectants is
waning due to emerging resistance, which poses environmental hazards and
fosters new resistance in pathogens. Developing environmentally friendly
and effective disinfectants against multidrug-resistant organisms is
increasingly important.MethodsThis study developed a bacteriophage
cocktail targeting two common carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
(CRKP) strains, ST11 KL47 and ST11 KL64. The cocktail was used as an
adjunctive disinfectant in a hospital’s respiratory intensive care unit
(RICU) via ultrasonic nebulization. Digital PCR was used to quantify
CRKP levels post-intervention. The microbial community composition was
analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the intervention’s impact on
overall diversity.ResultsThe phage cocktail significantly reduced CRKP
levels within the first 24 hours post-treatment. While a slight increase
in pathogen levels was observed after 24 hours, they remained
significantly lower than those treated with conventional disinfectants.
16S rRNA sequencing showed a decrease in the target pathogens’ relative
abundance, while overall species diversity remained stable, confirming
that phages selectively target CRKP without disrupting ecological
balance.DiscussionThe findings highlight the efficacy and safety of
phage-based biocleaners as a sustainable alternative to conventional
disinfectants. Phages selectively reduce multidrug-resistant pathogens
while preserving microbial diversity, making them a promising tool for
infection control.</p>

the plasma metabolome responsible for mediating immune cell action in
severe COVID-19: a Mendelian randomization investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe immune response regulates the severity of COVID-19
(sCOVID-19). This study examined the cause-and-effect relationship
between immune cell traits (ICTs) and the risk of severe COVID-19.
Additionally, we discovered the potential role of plasma metabolome in
modulating this risk.MethodsEmploying data from a genome-wide
association study (GWAS), we conducted a two-sample Mendelian
randomization (MR) assessment of 731 genetic ICTs and sCOVID-19 (5,101
cases, 1,383,241 controls) incidence. The MR analysis was utilized to
further quantitate the degree of plasma metabolome-mediated regulation
of immune traits in sCOVID-19.ResultsThe inverse variance weighted
method recognized 2 plasma metabolites (PMs) responsible for casual
associations between immune cells and sCOVID-19 risk. These included
Tridecenedioate (C13:1-DC) which regulated the association between CD27
on IgD- CD38br (OR 0.804, 95% CI 0.699–0.925, p = 0.002) and sCOVID-19
risk (mediated proportion: 18.7%); arginine to citrulline ratio which
controlled the relationship of CD39 on monocyte (OR 1.053, 95% CI
1.013–1.094, p = 0.009) with sCOVID-19 risk (mediated proportion:
-7.11%). No strong evidence that genetically predicted sCOVID-19
influenced the aforementioned immune traits.ConclusionIn this study, we
have successfully identified a cause-and-effect relationship between
certain ICTs, PMs, and the likelihood of contracting severe COVID-19.
Our findings can potentially improve the accuracy of COVID-19 prognostic
evaluation and provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms
of the disease.</p>

mechanism of autophagy in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a
significant pathogen affecting the swine industry globally, has been
shown to manipulate host cell processes, including autophagy, to
facilitate its replication and survival within the host. Autophagy, an
intracellular degradation process crucial for maintaining cellular
homeostasis, can be hijacked by viruses for their own benefit. During
PRRSV infection, autophagy plays a complex role, both as a defense
mechanism of the host and as a tool exploited by the virus. This review
explores the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying autophagy induction under PRRSV infection, its impact on
virus replication, and the potential implications for viral pathogenesis
and antiviral strategies. By synthesizing the latest research findings,
this article aims to enhance our understanding of the intricate
relationship between autophagy and PRRSV, paving the way for novel
therapeutic approaches against this swine pathogen.</p>

and application of quadruplex real time quantitative PCR method for
differentiation of Muscovy duck parvovirus, Goose parvovirus, Duck
circovirus, and Duck adenovirus 3</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMuscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV), Goose parvovirus (GPV),
Duck circovirus, (DuCV) and Duck adenovirus 3 (DAdV-3) are important
pathogens that cause high morbidity and mortality in ducks, causing huge
economic loss for the duck industry.MethodsThe present study, a
quadruplex one-step real time quantitative PCR method for the detection
of MDPV, GPV, DuCV, and DAdV-3 was developed. ResultsThe results showed
that assay had no cross-reactivity with other poultry pathogens [Duck
plague virus (DPV), Duck tembusu virus (DTMUV), H6 avian influenza virus
(H6 AIV), New duck reovirus (NDRV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), H4
avian influenza virus (H4 AIV), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Muscovy duck
reovirus (MDRV), Egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV), Pasteurella multocida
(P. multocida)]. The sensitivity result showed that the limits of
detection for MDPV, GPV, DuCV, and DAdV-3 were 10, 10, 1 and 10
copies/µl, respectively; The coefficients of variation intra- and
inter-method was 1-2%; The range of linear (109 to 103 copies/µL)
demonstrated the R2 values for MDPV, GPV, DuCV, and DAdV-3 as 0.9975,
0.998, 0.9964, and 0.996, respectively. The quadruplex real time
quantitative PCR method efficiency was 90.30%, 101.10%, 90.72%, and
90.57% for MDPV, GPV, DuCV, and DAdV-3, respectively. 396 clinical
specimens collected in some duck sausages from June 2022 to July 2023
were simultaneously detected using the established quadruplex real time
quantitative PCR method and the reported assays. The detection rates for
MDPV, GPV, DuCV, and DAdV-3 were 8.33% (33/396), 17.93% (71/396), 33.58%
(133/396), and 29.04% (115/396), respectively. The agreement between
these assays was greater than 99.56%.DiscussionThe developed quadruplex
real-time quantitative PCR assay can accurately detect these four
viruses infecting ducks, providing a rapid, sensitive, specific and
accurate technique for clinical testing.</p>

next-generation sequencing targeted and metagenomic next-generation
sequencing for pulmonary infection in HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected
individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundWhen individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) experience pulmonary infections, they often exhibit severe
symptoms and face a grim prognosis. Consequently, early, rapid, and
accurate pathogen diagnosis is vital for informing effective treatment
strategies. This study aimed to use metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS) and targeted mNGS (tNGS) to elucidate the
characteristics of pulmonary infections in HIV and non-HIV
individuals.MethodsThis study enrolled 90 patients with pulmonary
infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases of The First Hospital
of Jilin University from June 2022 to May 2023, and they were divided
into HIV (n=46) and non-HIV (n=44) infection groups. Their
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for mNGS analysis to
evaluate the differences in pulmonary infection pathogens, and tNGS
detection was performed on BALF samples from 15 HIV-infected
patients.ResultsA total of 37 pathogens were identified in this study,
including 21 bacteria, 5 fungi, 5 viruses, 5 mycobacteria, and 1
mycoplasma. The sensitivity of mNGS was 78.9% (71/90), which is
significantly higher than that of conventional methods (CTM) (39/90,
P=1.5E-8). The combination of mNGS with CTM can greatly enhance the
sensitivity of pathogen detection. The prevalence of Pneumocystis
jirovecii (82.6% vs. 9.1%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (58.7% vs. 0%), and
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (17.4% vs. 2.3%) was significantly higher in
the HIV infection group than in the non-HIV infection group (P&lt;0.05).
Although no statistically significant difference was observed, the
detection rate of Mycobacteria was higher in HIV-infected patients
(17.4%) than in the non-HIV group (6.8%). Furthermore, the tNGS results
of BALF from 15 HIV-infected patients were not entirely consistent with
the mNGS results., and the concordance rate of tNGS for the detection of
main pathogens reached 86.7% (13/15).ConclusionNext-generation
sequencing (NGS) can accurately detect pathogens in the BALF of patients
with pulmonary infection. The sensitivity of tNGS is comparable to that
of mNGS. Therefore, this technique should be promoted in the clinic for
better patient outcomes.</p>

liposomes induce a phagosome acidification-dependent and ROS-mediated
intracellular killing of Mycobacterium abscessus in human
macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is an opportunistic nontuberculous
mycobacterium responsible of difficult-to-treat pulmonary infections in
vulnerable patients, such as those suffering from Cystic Fibrosis (CF),
where it represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
Additionally, due to the intrinsic extensive antimicrobial resistance
spectrum displayed by this species and the side effects reported for
some available antibiotics, the therapeutic management of such
infections remains extremely difficult. In the present study, we show
that phosphatidylserine liposomes (PS-L) enhance intracellular
mycobacterial killing of Mab infected human macrophages with functional
or pharmacologically inhibited cystic fibrosis conductance regulator
(CFTR), by a mechanism involving phagosome acidification and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production. Additionally, PS-L significantly reduce
proinflammatory response of Mab infected macrophages in terms of NF-kB
activation and TNF-α production, irrespective of CFTR inhibition.
Altogether, these results represent the proof of concept for a possible
future development of PS-L as a therapeutic strategy against
difficult-to-treat Mab infection.</p>
