novel small RNA regulates Locus of Enterocyte Effacement and
site-specific colonization of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7
in gut</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a contagious foodborne
pathogen that specifically colonizes the human large intestine, which is
regulated by different environmental stimuli within the gut.
Transcriptional regulation of EHEC virulence and infection has been
extensively studied, while the posttranscriptional regulation of these
processes by small RNAs (sRNAs) remains not fully understood. Here we
present a virulence-regulating pathway in EHEC O157:H7, in which the
sRNA EvrS binds to and destabilizes the mRNA of Z2269, a novel
transcriptional regulator. In turn, Z2269 indirectly activates the
expression of LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) pathogenicity island
through the master regulator Ler. Importantly, the expression of EvrS is
modulated by environmental oxygen levels. EvrS also exhibits lower
expression in the colon compared to the ileum, influencing the
site-specific colonization of EHEC O157:H7 in mice. These results
indicate that the oxygen status within the intestine may regulate the
expression of EvrS, thereby modulating virulence factors of EHEC and
contributing to successful infection in vivo. This study has broader
implications for understanding sRNA functions in spatiotemporal
virulence control of EHEC and may provide novel strategies to prevent
EHEC infections.</p>

the vaginal microbiome among women with different genotypes of human
papillomavirus infection in remote Andaman islands</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a viral infection, and its
acquisition and persistence are significantly influenced by the vaginal
microbiota. Understanding and comparing the vaginal microbiome of HPV
infected women in Andaman and Nicobar Islands is crucial.MethodsThe
study involved collecting vaginal swabs and extracting DNA using the
QIAamp DNA Minikit. The DNA was then subjected to PCR amplification to
confirm HPV infection. illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform was utilized to
perform sequencing utilizing 2 x 250 paired end chemistry. Taxonomic
analysis was performed and Bacterial abundance plots were generated and
samples were grouped based on demographic parameters, pap test
diagnosis, and genotypes. To assess diversity, samples were rarefied to
49,000 sequence reads per sample, and alpha and beta diversity metrics
were calculated.ResultsThe study analyzed the presence of 21 assigned
phyla, with Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and
Proteobacteria emerging as the predominant taxa. At the genus level,
Lactobacillus and Gardnerella dominated across all samples. Gardnerella
was significantly more abundant in HPV-positive (22.40%) compared to
HPV-negative samples (10.04%). Symptomatic group of HPV-positive samples
had Gardnerella, and unclassified Coriobacteriaceae being dominant. In
terms of bacterial diversity, the study found statistically significant
association when comprising individuals aged 21 to 30 years to those
aged 31 to 40 years.ConclusionMost research concluded that exposure to
HPV can boost bacterial diversity in vagina compared to healthy women,
increasing the risk of cervical cancer development. Current study
highlights the importance of vaginal microbiome associated with high and
low risk HPV, various age group as well as the symptomatic and
asymptomatic cases of HPV infected women in South Andaman.</p>

insights into the genome dynamics of Clostridioides difficile associated
with antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and genomic adaptations among
clonal lineages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundClostridioides difficile is a significant cause of
healthcare-associated infections, with rising antimicrobial resistance
complicating treatment. This study offers a genomic analysis of C.
difficile, focusing on sequence types (STs), global distribution,
antibiotic resistance genes, and virulence factors in its chromosomal
and plasmid DNA.MethodsA total of 19,711 C. difficile genomes were
retrieved from GenBank. Prokka was used for genome annotation, and
multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) identified STs. Pan-genome analysis
with Roary identified core and accessory genes. Antibiotic resistance
genes, virulence factors, and toxins were detected using the CARD and
VFDB databases, and the ABRicate software. Statistical analyses and
visualizations were performed in R.ResultsAmong 366 identified STs, ST1
(1,326 isolates), ST2 (1,141), ST11 (893), and ST42 (763) were
predominant. Trends of genome streamlining included reductions in
chromosomal length, gene count, protein-coding genes, and pseudogenes.
Common antibiotic resistance genes—cdeA (99.46%), cplR (99.63%), and
nimB (99.67%)—were nearly ubiquitous. Rare resistance genes like
blaCTX-M-2, cfxA3, and blaZ appeared in only 0.005% of genomes.
Vancomycin susceptibility-reducing vanG cluster genes were detected at
low frequencies. Virulence factors showed variability, with highly
prevalent genes such as zmp1 (99.62%), groEL (99.60%), and rpoB/rpoB2
(99.60%). Moderately distributed genes included cwp66 (54.61%) and slpA
(79.02%). Toxin genes tcdE (91.26%), tcdC (89.67%), and tcdB (89.06%)
were widespread, while binary toxin genes cdtA (26.19%) and cdtB
(26.26%) were less common. Toxin gene prevalence, particularly tcdA and
tcdB, showed a gradual decline over time, with sharper reductions for
cdtA and cdtB. Gene presence patterns (GPP-1) for resistance, virulence,
and toxin genes were primarily linked to ST2, ST42, and
ST8.ConclusionThis study highlights C. difficile’s adaptability and
genetic diversity. The decline in toxin genes reflects fewer toxigenic
isolates, but the bacterium’s increasing preserved resistance factors
and virulence genes enable its rapid evolution. ST2, ST42, and ST8
dominate globally, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring.</p>

microbiota: pathogenic roles and implications in atopic dermatitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and inflammatory skin disorder
characterized by impaired barrier function and imbalanced immunity.
Recent advances have revealed that dysbiosis of skin microbiota plays
important roles in the pathogenesis and development of AD. Meanwhile,
endogenous and external factors contribute to the dysbiosis of skin
microbiota in AD. Additionally, various treatments, including topical
treatments, phototherapy, and systemic biologics, have demonstrated
positive impacts on the clinical outcomes, alongside with the
modulations of cutaneous microbiota in AD patients. Importantly,
therapeutics or products regulating skin microbiota homeostasis have
demonstrated potential for AD treatment in early clinical studies. In
this review, we underline changes of the skin microbiota correlated with
AD. Meanwhile, we provide an overview of the skin microbiota regarding
its roles in the pathogenesis and development of AD. Finally, we
summarize therapeutic strategies restoring the skin microbial
homeostasis in AD management.</p>

epitopes in Staphylococcal Protein-A an immuno-informatics approach to
combat MDR-MRSA infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a
significant challenge in clinical environments due to its resistance to
standard antibiotics. Staphylococcal Protein A (SpA), a crucial
virulence factor of MRSA, undermines host immune responses, making it an
attractive target for vaccine development. This study aimed to identify
potential epitopes within SpA that could elicit robust immune responses,
ultimately contributing to the combat against multidrug-resistant (MDR)
MRSA.MethodsThe SpA protein sequence was retrieved from the UniProt
database, with various bioinformatics tools employed for epitope
prediction. T-cell epitopes were identified using the Tepitool server,
focusing on high-affinity interactions with prevalent human leukocyte
antigens (HLAs). B-cell epitopes were predicted using the BepiPred tool.
Predicted epitopes underwent docking studies with HLA molecules to
evaluate binding properties. In-silico analyses confirmed the
antigenicity, promiscuity, and non-glycosylated nature of the selected
epitopes.ResultsSeveral T and B cell epitopes within SpA were
identified, showcasing high binding affinities and extensive population
coverage. A multi-epitope vaccine construct, linked by synthetic linkers
and an adjuvant, was modelled, refined, and validated through various
bioinformatics assessments. The vaccine candidate was subsequently
docked with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) to evaluate its potential for
immunogenicity.ConclusionThis study lays the groundwork for developing
epitope-based vaccines targeting SpA in MRSA, identifying promising
candidates for experimental validation and contributing to innovative
immunotherapeutic strategies against MRSA infections.</p>

cell responses to Candida albicans biofilm-derived extracellular
vesicles</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Candida albicans is a prevalent fungal pathogen responsible for
infections in humans. As described recently, nanometer-sized
extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by C. albicans play a crucial role
in the pathogenesis of infection by facilitating host inflammatory
responses and intercellular communication. This study investigates the
functional properties of EVs released by biofilms formed by two C.
albicans strains—3147 (ATCC 10231) and SC5314—in eliciting host
responses. We demonstrate the capability of C. albicans EVs to trigger
reactions in human epithelial and immune cells. The involvement of EVs
in pathogenesis was evidenced from the initial stages of infection,
specifically in adherence to epithelial cells. We further established
the capacity of these EVs to induce cytokine production in the
epithelial A549 cell line, THP-1 macrophage-like cells, and
blood-derived monocytes differentiated into macrophages. Internalization
of EVs by THP-1 macrophage-like cells was confirmed, identifying
macropinocytosis and phagocytosis as the most probable mechanisms, as
demonstrated using various inhibitors that target potential vesicle
uptake pathways in human cells. Additionally, C. albicans EVs and their
cargo were identified as chemoattractants for blood-derived neutrophils.
After verification of the in vivo effect of biofilm-derived EVs on the
host, using Galleria mellonella larvae as an alternative model, it was
demonstrated that vesicles from C. albicans SC5314 increased mortality
in the injected larvae. In conclusion, for both types of EVs a
predominantly pro-inflammatory effect on host was observed, highlighting
their significant role in the inflammatory response during C. albicans
infection.</p>

id="association-between-d-dimer-to-lymphocyte-ratio-and-in-hospital-all-cause-mortality-in-elderly-patients-with-sepsis-a-cohort-of-1123-patients">Association
between D-dimer to lymphocyte ratio and in hospital all-cause mortality
in elderly patients with sepsis: a cohort of 1123 patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe D-dimer to lymphocyte ratio (DLR), a novel inflammatory
biomarker, had been shown to be related to adverse outcomes in patients
with various diseases. However, there was limited research on the
relationship between the DLR and adverse outcomes in patients with
infectious diseases, particularly those with sepsis. Therefore, this
study aimed to explore the association between the DLR and in hospital
all-cause mortality in elderly patients with sepsis.MethodsA total of
1123 patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were included in
this study. The patients were categorized into quartiles (Q1-Q4) based
on their DLR values. The primary outcomes included hospital mortality
and ICU mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare
all-cause mortality among the four DLR groups. The association between
DLR and all-cause mortality in patients with sepsis was further
elucidated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.ResultsThe study included
participants with a median age of 75 (65-84) years, with 707 (63.0%)
being male. The rates of hospital mortality and ICU mortality were 33.7%
and 31.9%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis highlighted a
significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality among patients with
elevated DLR values (log-rank p &lt; 0.001). ROC curve analyses revealed
that DLR had a stronger ability to predict hospital mortality and ICU
mortality in patients with sepsis than D-dimer or Lym. Multivariable Cox
proportional hazards analyses revealed DLR as an independent predictor
of hospital death [per 1 SD increase in DLR: HR (95% CI): 1.098
(1.020-1.181); p = 0.013] and ICU death [per 1 SD increase in DLR: HR
(95% CI): 1.095 (1.017-1.180); p = 0.017] during the hospital
stay.ConclusionsA higher DLR value was associated with hospital and ICU
all-cause death in elderly patients with sepsis. This finding
demonstrated that the DLR could be a convenient and useful prognostic
marker for sepsis prognosis.</p>

insights into freshwater ascomycetes: discovery of novel species in
diverse aquatic habitats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>During investigations of freshwater fungi in Hunan and Yunnan
provinces, China, Chaetopsina yunnanensis sp. nov. (Nectriaceae),
Parafuscosporella hunanensis sp. nov. (Fuscosporellaceae), and
Pleurotheciella yunnanensis sp. nov. (Pleurotheciaceae) were discovered
on submerged decaying wood and branches. Based on phylogenetic analyses,
C. yunnanensis formed a separate branch with Chaetopsina pinicola and
nested among other Chaetopsina species in Nectriaceae (Hypocreales).
Furthermore, hitherto known Chaetopsina beijingensis shared the same
branch with Chaetopsina fulva, a type species of the genus,
demonstrating their conspecific status. Therefore, C. beijingensis is
formally synonymized under C. fulva, with an amended species
circumscription. Pa. hunanensis formed a well-separated subclade with
the ex-type strain of Parafuscosporella mucosa and clustered with other
Parafuscosporella within Fuscosporellaceae (Fuscosporellales). In
addition, the genus Parafuscosporella is treated as distinct from
Vanakripa due to a lack of phylogenetic evidence in clarifying their
congeneric status with the latter. Pl. yunnanensis is found to be sister
to Pleurotheciella saprophytica, forming a subclade with Pleurotheciella
dimorphospora within the Pleurotheciaceae (Pleurotheciales).
Morphologically, C. yunnanensis fits well with the generic concept of
Chaetopsina in forming a holomorphic state with hyphomycetous asexual
morph producing pigmented, setiform conidiophores, phialidic
conidiogenous cells, hyaline conidia, and nectria-like sexual morph. Pa.
hunanensis fits well with Parafuscosporella in having acrogenous,
apiosporous, versicolored, obovoid to obpyriform conidia. In contrast,
Pl. yunnanensis resembles Pl. dimorphospora in forming asexual
dimorphism with two types of conidia (Type I, brown,
muriform/phragmosporous conidia; Type II, hyaline,
amerosporous/didymorsporous conidia). The novelty of taxa is explained
with detailed descriptions, photo-micrographic illustrations,
polymorphism, and multigene phylogenetic analyses of Bayesian inference
and maximum likelihood criteria.</p>

propionate is a signature of insulin resistance in polycystic ovary
syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the roles of fecal short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).MethodsThe levels of SCFAs
(acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in 83 patients with PCOS and 63
controls were measured, and their relationships with various metabolic
parameters were analyzed. Intestinal microbiome analysis was conducted
to identify relevant bacteria. The study took place at the Center for
Reproductive Medicine at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University
in Shenyang, from 5 February to 23 May 2023. Logistic regression
analyses were used to investigate the relationships between SCFAs, PCOS,
and PCOS-related insulin resistance (IR). Differences in bacterial
populations between women with PCOS-IR and those with PCOS-non-insulin
resistance (NIR) were identified using linear discriminant analysis
effect Size (LEfSe). The relationships between bacteria and fecal
propionate levels were explored through linear regression analyses. The
potential of fecal propionate and microbial profiles as biomarkers for
insulin resistance in PCOS patients was assessed using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsHigher fecal
propionate levels were observed in patients with PCOS compared to
controls (p = 0.042) and in PCOS-IR compared to PCOS-NIR (p = 0.009).
There was no significant difference in fecal propionate levels between
the IR and NIR subgroups of women in the control group (p &gt; 0.05).
Additionally, higher fecal propionate levels were associated with IR in
PCOS (p = 0.039; OR, 1.115; 95% CI, 1.006–1.237). The abundance of
Prevotella copri and Megamonas funiformis was higher in PCOS-IR women
compared to PCOS-NIR women (LDA score &gt; 3) and correlated with fecal
propionate levels (adjusted R² = 0.145, p &lt; 0.001). The area under
the curve (AUC) for propionate and the combined presence of P. copri and
M. funiformis in predicting PCOS was 78.0%, with a sensitivity of 78.5%
and a specificity of 72.4%. Pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism
were significantly enriched in the microbiota of the PCOS-IR population
but not in the control IR group.ConclusionsHigher fecal propionate
levels correlate with PCOS-related insulin resistance. P. copri and M.
funiformis might be key functional bacteria. Therefore, the combination
of propionate levels and the abundance of these two bacteria may serve
as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in PCOS patients.
Regulation of the intestinal microbiome might be beneficial for the
metabolic health of women with PCOS.</p>

bursal disease virus affecting interferon regulatory factor 7 signaling
through VP3 protein to facilitate viral replication</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-mediated type I interferon
antiviral response is crucial for regulating the host following viral
infection in chickens. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a
double-stranded RNA virus that induces immune suppression and high
mortality rates in chickens aged 3-6 weeks. Previous studies have shown
that IBDV infection antagonizes the type I interferon production to
facilitate viral replication in the cell, and IRF7 signaling might play
an important role. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable IBDV
to block the IRF7 pathway remain unclear. In this study, we found that
IRF7 and IFN-β expression were suppressed in DF-1 cells during infection
with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV), but not with attenuated IBDV, while
the virus continued to replicate. Overexpression of IRF7 inhibits IBDV
replication while knocking down IRF7 promotes IBDV replication.
Overexpression of IRF7 couldn’t compensate the IRF7 protein level in
vvIBDV-infected cells, which suggested that IRF7 protein was degraded by
IBDV infection. By using inhibitors, the degradation of IRF7 was found
to be related to the proteasome pathway. Further study revealed that
IRF7 was observed to interact and colocalize with the IBDV VP3 protein.
Consistent with IBDV infection results, IBDV VP3 protein was observed to
inhibit the IRF7-IFN-β expression, affect the degradation of IRF7
protein via proteasome pathway. All these results suggest that the IBDV
exploits IRF7 by affecting its expression and proteasome degradation via
the viral VP3 protein to facilitate viral replication in the cells.
These findings revealed a novel mechanism that IBDV uses to evade host
antiviral defense.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis study aims to utilize proteomics, bioinformatics,
and machine learning algorithms to identify diagnostic biomarkers in the
serum of patients with acute and chronic brucellosisMethodsProteomic
analysis was conducted on serum samples from patients with acute and
chronic brucellosis, as well as from healthy controls. Differential
expression analysis was performed to identify proteins with altered
expression, while Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
was applied to detect co-expression modules associated with clinical
features of brucellosis. Machine learning algorithms were subsequently
used to identify the optimal combination of diagnostic biomarkers.
Finally, ELISA was employed to validate the identified proteins.ResultsA
total of 1,494 differentially expressed proteins were identified,
revealing two co-expression modules significantly associated with the
clinical characteristics of brucellosis. The Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) algorithm identified six proteins that were concurrently present
in both the differentially expressed and co-expression modules,
demonstrating promising diagnostic potential. After ELISA validation,
five proteins were ultimately selected.DiscussionThese five proteins are
implicated in the innate immune processes of brucellosis, potentially
associated with its pathogenic mechanisms and chronicity. Furthermore,
we highlighted their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for brucellosis.
This study further enhances our understanding of brucellosis at the
protein level, paving the way for future research endeavors.</p>

of antibiotic prophylaxis on gut microbiota in colorectal surgery:
insights from an Eastern European stewardship study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntibiotic overuse is driving a global rise in antibiotic
resistance, highlighting the need for robust antimicrobial stewardship
(AMS) initiatives to improve prescription practices. While
antimicrobials are essential for treating sepsis and preventing surgical
site infections (SSIs), they can inadvertently disrupt the gut
microbiota, leading to postoperative complications. Treatment methods
vary widely across nations due to differences in drug choice, dosage,
and therapy duration, affecting antibiotic resistance rates, which can
reach up to 51% in some countries. In Romania and the Republic of
Moldova, healthcare practices for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis differ
significantly despite similarities in genetics, culture, and diet.
Romania’s stricter healthcare regulations result in more standardized
antibiotic protocols, whereas Moldova’s limited healthcare funding leads
to less consistent practices and greater variability in treatment
outcomes.MethodsThis study presents the results of a prospective
cross-border investigation involving 86 colorectal cancer patients from
major oncological hospitals in Romania and Moldova. We analyzed fecal
samples collected from patients before and 7 days post-antibiotic
treatment, focusing on the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.ResultsOur
findings indicate that inconsistent antibiotic prophylaxis
policies—varying in type, dosage, or therapy duration—significantly
impacted the gut microbiota and led to more frequent dysbiosis compared
to stricter prophylactic antibiotic practices (single dose, single
product, limited time).DiscussionWe emphasize the need for standardized
antibiotic prophylaxis protocols to minimize dysbiosis and its
associated risks, promoting more effective antimicrobial use,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>

identification through bronchoscope in intensive care unit – a
retrospective, databased cohort study</h2>

<p>IntroductionInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) increases the risk
of mortality of critically ill patients. Diagnostic criteria
specifically targeting patients in intensive care units(ICUs) have been
developed to improve diagnostic sensitivity. This study investigated
health outcomes among patients in ICUs with Aspergillus isolates
identified using bronchoscopy.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study
obtained data from the Chang Gung Research Database of Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital. Patients admitted to the ICU between January 2017 and
December 2022 who received bronchoalveolar lavage were enrolled.
Patients with a fungus culture yielding Aspergillus spp. isolates or who
had an Aspergillus galactomannan antigen index value of &gt;1.0 were
categorized into the Aspergillus-positive group.ResultsA total of 2372
patients were enrolled, and 146 patients (6.16%) tested positive for
Aspergillus. Of the patients who tested positive for Aspergillus, 37.67%
had a positive culture result, and 77.4% had a positive galactomannan
antigen result. Patients with Aspergillus isolates were more likely to
have a recent influenza infection, concurrent bacterial sepsis, and a
cavitation and to die in hospital (in-hospital mortality rate 58.9%
vs. 48.57%, P = 0.016).DiscussionIdentifying Aspergillus through
bronchoscopy in the ICU is associated with higher mortality rates than
in patients who test negative for Aspergillus. Galactomannan antigen
from bronchoalveolar lavage may provide higher diagnostic
sensitivity.</p>
