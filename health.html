of targeted next-generation sequencing for pathogens diagnosis and drug
resistance prediction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pulmonary
infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecently, targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) have
been extensively utilized for the identification of pathogens in
pulmonary infections, there have been some studies systematically
evaluating differences in the efficacy of tNGS and conventional
microbiological tests (CMTs) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
specimens.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 203 patients
with pulmonary infections treated in one tertiary hospital from July
2023 to February 2024. BALF specimens underwent parallel testing via
tNGS and CMTs. Pathogen detection consistency, the drug resistance genes
concordance with phenotypic drug sensitivity, and clinical impact of
tNGS-guided therapy adjustments were analyzed. Furthermore, two patients
with complex infections were selected for tNGS microbiological
surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of monitoring severe
pneumonia.ResultsThis study included 205 confirmed infectious BALF
specimens (two patients were tested twice). tNGS identified 56 putative
pathogens, compared to 20 by CMTs, with a significantly higher positive
rate (99.5% vs. 35.6%, P&lt;0.0001). The detection of pathogenic
microorganisms using tNGS showed a high concordance rate with the
results of CMTs. tNGS-guided therapy adjustments occurred in 17.2%
(35/203) of patients. Resistance gene predictions aligned with the drug
sensitivity results in 40% (6/15) of carbapenem-resistant organisms
(CROs) and 80% (4/5) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) cases. Additionally, for monitored two patients with severe
pneumonia, the tNGS results were consistent with the culture and imaging
test results during treatment.ConclusionsThe application of tNGS
highlights its promise and significance in identifying potential
pathogens, predicting drug resistance, and providing guidance for
anti-infection therapies for severe pneumonia. It can be at least a
complementary approach to CMTs reporting.</p>

analysis of microbiome and host transcriptome revealed correlations
between tissue microbiota and tumor progression in early-stage papillary
thyroid carcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEmerging evidences suggest that microorganisms in the
tumor microenvironment play important roles in tumor occurrence and
progression. However, the microbial distribution in the papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissue and its relationship with PTC are
unclear.MethodsWe performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and RNA-Seq to
characterize the tissue microbiome and transcriptome between the tumor
and paracancerous tissue, respectively. The association analysis between
microbes and host gene expression were conducted to screen the potential
microbe-gene/cell interactions.ResultsWe found that the tumor tissues
indeed harbored complex microbial communities, which showed significant
differences in microbial and functional composition between the tumor
and para-cancerous tissues. A set of differential microbial genera were
identified to be significantly associated with the clinical factors,
such as Planococcus enriched in tumor tissue, Limnobacter in T1a stage
and Cutibacterium in N1b stage. 793 differential expressed genes were
also identified, which are mainly enriched with functions related to
cell-cell communication and extracellular matrix. In terms of the immune
cell composition, 8 differential immune cell types were further
identified, suggesting a significant immune response in PTC. Finally,
association analysis identified 5 pairs of microbe-gene association and
1 pair of microbe-cell with significance, which were all involved in the
tumorigenesis and tumor progression via inflammation-related
pathways.ConclusionsIn addition to characterizing the tissue microbiome
and host gene expression in PTC patients, we further explored the roles
of microbe-gene/cell interactions in PTC. The results provide candidate
biomarkers for exploring the molecular mechanisms of tissue microbiome
in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of PTC.</p>

report of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus exposure in human and
livestock populations, Center Region, Cameroon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread, tick-borne
viral infection present in many African countries. Its epidemiology and
impact on public health remain poorly understood in Cameroon. The main
objective of the current study was to investigate the circulation of
CCHF virus (CCHFV) in ruminants (cattle and goats), humans, and ticks
collected simultaneously in a study area of Akonolinga, a health
district in the central region of Cameroon. From the 15 to 28 July 2024,
a cross-sectional study was conducted in Akonolinga, by collecting
survey data and serum samples (from humans, goats, and cattle) and
picking ticks from cattle and goats. This study included 100 randomly
selected households from eight localities. Data were also collected
using questionnaires to assess CCHFV seropositivity-associated factors.
Individual characteristics of 189 goats and 246 cattle were collected
and the data geo-referenced. To assess the prevalence of CCHF,
serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and molecular
(real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR) methods were used to detect
antibodies targeting CCHF viral nucleoprotein and CCHFV-specific RNA in
collected sera, respectively. The presence of CCHFV-specific RNA was
also assessed in tick homogenate using real-time RT PCR. The overall
CCHFV seroprevalence was 1.9% [95% CI (1.02%–3.64%)] in humans, 10.9% [n
= 42; 95% CI (8.15%–14.38%)] in cattle, and 3.38% [n = 5; 95% CI
(1.45%–7.66%)] in goats. Seroprevalence in cattle increased
significantly with age. A total of 554 ticks were collected from 162 of
the 386 (42%) cattle examined, with Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus
being the dominant species. CCHFV RNA was detected in two sera of women
sampled. Phylogenetic analysis of a small portion of the L segment
classified the strain within the African genotype III. This study
reported, for the first time, the proven exposure of the human
population to CCHFV in central Cameroon, showing strong evidence that
CCHFV is infecting humans. Serological analyses revealed exposure of
cattle and goats to CCHFV-strains collected in the same geographical
area. These results demonstrate the potential risk of CCHF emergence in
the human population, especially in rural areas in close vicinity with
animals.</p>

id="porphyromonas-gingivalis-induced-periodontitis-promotes-neuroinflammation-and-neuronal-loss-associated-with-dysfunction-of-the-brain-barrier">Porphyromonas
gingivalis-induced periodontitis promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal
loss associated with dysfunction of the brain barrier</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIn our previous study, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.
gingivalis)-induced periodontitis caused cognitive impairment which was
associated with abnormal amyloid β (Aβ) metabolite in the brain. The
brain barrier is critical in maintaining homeostasis, controlling influx
and efflux transport and regulating waste clearance. However, the
specific role of the brain barrier in linking periodontitis to cognitive
function remains unclear.MethodsA murine model of periodontitis-induced
cognitive impairment was constructed via oral topical application of P.
gingivalis. Neuroinflammation was observed by detecting the expression
of proinflammatory cytokines and glia activation. Western blot (WB),
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to
detect the expression of tau-related molecules and neuronal loss. WB,
Evans blue staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) function including the infiltration of P.
gingivalis and immune cells, and BBB permeability. The changes of
meningeal lymphatic drainage were observed using an in vivo animal
imaging system and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). The effect of P. gingivalis on lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs) was further verified using IF and RT-PCR.ResultsP.
gingivalis-induced periodontitis exacerbated cognitive impairment by the
upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and glia activation. In the
brain of periodontitis mice, p-Akt and p-GSK3β levels were reduced,
leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss including cell
bodies and neurites. P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis enhanced BBB
permeability, promoted P. gingivalis and immune cell infiltration, and
downregulated the expression of Occludin and ZO-1. In addition, the
meningeal lymphatic drainage was impaired and the mRNA levels of
lymphangiogenesis-related factor LYVE1 were decreased in the dura matter
of periodontitis mice. After P. gingivalis infection, the inflammatory
response was increased, and LYVE1 and ZO1 expression was decreased in
LECs.ConclusionsPeriodontitis aggravated neuroinflammation and neuronal
loss which was associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. The impaired
meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLV) and disrupted BBB affected the brain
barrier function, further inhibiting the clearance of pathogenic
substances and enhancing immune cell infiltration in periodontitis mice.
These results indicated that brain barrier dysfunction may be the link
between periodontitis and cognitive impairment.</p>

multi-omics study of magnesium sulfate to improve prognosis in
sepsis-related encephalopathy: integrating clinical data-driven network
pharmacology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) constitutes a
significant neurological manifestation of sepsis, characterized by high
mortality rates and posing a critical threat to patient outcomes.
Magnesium sulfate has multiple effects in the nervous system, including
neuroprotection, sedation, anticonvulsant activity, enhanced
neuroplasticity, anti - inflammation and promotion of nerve repair. It
can regulate calcium homeostasis, exert antioxidant effects, and reduce
the release of inflammatory factors, thereby alleviating neuronal damage
and neurological deficits. This study integrated MIMIC-IV database and
network pharmacology to explore magnesium sulfate’s neuroprotective
mechanisms and clinical impact on SAE outcomes.MethodsRetrospective data
from 4,650 SAE patients in MIMIC-IV 3.0 were analyzed. Propensity score
matching balanced covariates. Cox models and Kaplan-Meier curves
evaluated magnesium sulfate’s association with 28-day all-cause
mortality (ACM). Network pharmacology identified magnesium sulfate’s
core targets and pathways.Results4183 patients (89.96%) received
magnesium sulfate during ICU, while 467 (10.04%) did not receive. The
28-day ACM in patients with SAE was 11.05%. After propensity score
matching participants with and without magnesium sulfate administration
had 28-day ACM of 17.29% and 30.42%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001).
Magnesium sulfate administration was associated with reduced 28-day ACM.
Subgroup analysis revealed this association differed in several
stratification. Network pharmacology revealed magnesium sulfate targets
TNF, IL6, IL1B and CXCL8, modulating pathways including inflammatory
response, immune regulation, and cellular stress.ConclusionsMagnesium
sulfate use correlates with improved SAE survival, particularly those
with comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute kidney
injury, and using vasoconstrictors, likely through multi-target
modulation of inflammatory response and immune regulation. Prospective
studies are needed for validation.</p>

respiratory tract co-infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and
respiratory syncytial virus shapes microbial landscape and clinical
outcomes in children</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundLower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), which are most
commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), pose a substantial global health burden in
children. However, the causal pathways of bacterial-viral co-infections,
particularly the mechanisms by which commensal microbiota could modulate
SP-RSV-associated LRTI outcomes remain to be elucidated.MethodsA
population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on children aged
0–18 years who were admitted to Beijing Children’s Hospital and Baoding
Children’s Hospital in China from September 2021 to August 2022.
Children with LRTI who underwent respiratory pathogen testing were
divided into SP single infection and SP-RSV co-infection groups, with
sex- and time-matched non-LRTI children as controls. Sputum and LRT
secretion samples were collected for microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA
sequencing, and child characteristics were obtained from medical records
and pharmacy data.ResultsA total of 125 children with LRTI (84 with SP
infection and 41 with SP-RSV co-infection) and 87 children without LRTI
were recruited for this study. We found that LRT microbiota composition
was strongly related to age, with a more pronounced increase in Shannon
index within the first 5 years of life. Children with SP and RSV
infection exhibited significantly altered microbiota composition in
comparison to children without LRTI, particularly a higher abundance of
Streptococcus. The competitive interactions among respiratory bacteria
were found to be more complex in the SP single-infection group and
simpler in the SP-RSV co-infection group.ConclusionOur findings show
that RSV co-infection exacerbates SP-induced LRTI microbiota disorder
and disease severity. This study may help us to better understand the
characteristics of SP-RSV interaction and provide direction for the
pathogen diagnosis of LRTI.</p>

comprehensive evaluation of a novel targeted-sequencing workflow for
Mycobacterium species identification and anti-tuberculosis
drug-resistance detection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAlthough several World Health Organization–endorsed
targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) assays exist for tuberculosis
(TB) drug-resistance detection, their target selection and diagnostic
accuracy vary widely. In this study, we developed a novel tNGS workflow
(the TB Pro assay) and evaluated its performance in identifying
Mycobacterium species and predicting drug resistance.MethodsThe TB Pro
assay was validated for identifying 10 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex (MTBC) and 39 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species, as
well as predicting resistance to 4 first-line and 13 second-line anti-TB
drugs. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined using 11 reference
strains spiked in sputum. The prediction of resistance to
anti-tuberculous drugs/drug classes was compared with phenotypic drug
susceptibility testing (pDST) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using
435 clinical isolates.ResultsThe assay demonstrated high sensitivity
with a calculated LOD of 3.0 CFU/ml for MTB and 1.4–16.2 CFU/ml for most
NTMs, except for Mycobacterium intracellulare with 117.9 CFU/ml. Using
pDST as the reference standard, the sensitivity of the TB Pro assay for
the detection of resistance ranged from 74.3% (ethambutol) to 94.4%
(rifampicin), with specificity values &gt;98% for all drugs. Compared
with WGS, the sensitivity of the TB Pro assay was over 98.0% for all
drugs except pyrazinamide (66.7%), and the specificity values were all
nearly 100.0%. Directly on sputum, the TB Pro assay showed 100%
agreement with smear- and culture-positive sputum
specimens.ConclusionsThe TB Pro assay represents a sensitive and
specific solution for simultaneous mycobacterial identification and
comprehensive drug-resistance profiling, performing robustly on both
cultured isolates and direct clinical specimens.</p>
