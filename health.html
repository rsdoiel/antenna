id="evaluation-of-immune-sensor-responses-to-a-viral-small-noncoding-rna">Evaluation
of immune sensor responses to a viral small noncoding RNA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGammaherpesviruses are widespread pathogens causing
persistent infections linked to the development of numerous types of
lymphomas in humans. During latency, most of the viral protein-coding
genes are suppressed, facilitating evasion of adaptive immune
recognition of protein antigens. In contrast, many noncoding RNA (ncRNA)
molecules are expressed in infected cells and can regulate key cellular
pathways while simultaneously evading adaptive immune recognition. To
counteract this, many cells express internal pattern recognition
receptors that can intrinsically sense ongoing infections and initiate
cellular defenses. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a valuable
model to study in vivo aspects of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. The
MHV68 ncRNA TMER4 (tRNA-miRNA-encoding RNA 4) promotes lymph node egress
of infected B cells: in the absence of TMER4, MHV68-infected B cells
accumulate in the lymph node in a manner similar to B cells activated
through specific antigen encounter.MethodWe hypothesized that TMER4 may
alter intrinsic immune activation. In research described here, we aimed
to explore the immunomodulatory functions of TMER4 by evaluating its
impact on signaling through the critical immune sensors Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4), TLR3, TLR7, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I
(RIG-I). To accomplish this, we developed a system to test noncoding
RNAs using commercially available reporter cell lines. We optimized the
experimental procedure to ensure ncRNA expression and to quantify immune
sensory molecule induction or inhibition by the expressed ncRNA.Results
and discussionExpression of TMER4 RNAs from plasmid constructs did not
alter TLR or RIG-I signaling. This study provides a clear experimental
framework that can be applied to test other small ncRNAs for their
impact on various innate immune sensor proteins.</p>

bacteria: an etiological agent in human pathological conditions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Through complex interactions with the hostâ€™s immune and physiological
systems, gut bacteria play a critical role as etiological agents in a
variety of human diseases, having an impact that extends beyond their
mere presence and affects the onset, progression, and severity of the
disease. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these microbial
interactions is crucial to improving our understanding of disease
pathogenesis and creating tailored treatment methods. Correcting
microbial imbalances may open new avenues for disease prevention and
treatment approaches, according to preliminary data. The gut microbiota
exerts an integral part in the pathogenesis of numerous health
conditions, including metabolic, neurological, renal, cardiovascular,
and gastrointestinal problems as well as COVID-19, according to recent
studies. The crucial significance of the microbiome in disease
pathogenesis is highlighted by this role, which is comparable to that of
hereditary variables. This review investigates the etiological
contributions of the gut microbiome to human diseases, its interactions
with the host, and the development of prospective therapeutic
approaches. To fully harness the benefits of gut microbiome dynamics for
improving human health, future research should address existing
methodological challenges and deepen our knowledge of microbial
interactions.</p>

analysis of the impact of Gemmatimonas, Rhodothermus, and Sutterella on
drug and treatment response in colorectal cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundColorectal cancer is the third most prevalent cancer across
the globe. Despite a diversity of treatment methods, the recurrence and
mortality rates of the disease remain high. Recent studies have revealed
a close association of the gut microbiota with the occurrence,
development, treatment response, and prognosis of colorectal
cancer.ObjectiveThis study aims to integrate transcriptome and
microbiome data to identify colorectal cancer subtypes associated with
different gut microbiota and evaluate their roles in patient survival
prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug treatment
response.MethodsAn integrated analysis of microbiome data was conducted
on samples of colorectal cancer from public databases. Based on this,
two tumor subtypes (C1 and C2) closely associated with patient survival
prognosis were identified and a risk score model was constructed. The
survival status, clinical parameters, immune scores, and other features
were analyzed in-depth, and the sensitivity of various potential drugs
was examined.ResultsA thorough examination of microbiome information
obtained from colorectal cancer patients led to the identification of
two primary tumor clusters (C1 and C2), exhibiting notable variations in
survival outcomes. Patients with the C1 subtype were closely associated
with better prognosis, while those with the C2 subtype had higher gut
microbial richness and poorer survival prognosis. A predictive model
utilizing the microbiome data was developed to accurately forecast the
survival outcome of patients with colorectal cancer. The TME scores
provided a biological basis for risk assessment in high-risk (similar to
the C2 subtype) patient cohorts. Evaluation of the sensitivity of
different subtypes to various potential drugs, indicated the critical
importance of personalized treatment. Further analysis showed good
potential of the developed risk-scoring model in predicting immune
checkpoint functions and treatment response of patients, which may be
crucial in guiding the selection of immunotherapy strategies for
patients with colorectal cancer.ConclusionThis study, through a
comprehensive analysis of colorectal cancer microbiome, immune
microenvironment, and drug sensitivity, enhances the current
understanding of the multidimensional interactions of colorectal cancer
and provides important clinical indications for improving future
treatment strategies. The findings offer a new perspective on improving
treatment response and long-term prognosis of patients with CRC through
the regulation of microbiota or the utilization of biomarkers provided
by it.</p>

id="bacteriophage-mediated-approaches-for-biofilm-control">Bacteriophage-mediated
approaches for biofilm control</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Biofilms are complex microbial communities in which planktonic and
dormant bacteria are enveloped in extracellular polymeric substances
(EPS) such as exopolysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and DNA. These
multicellular structures present resistance to conventional
antimicrobial treatments, including antibiotics. The formation of
biofilms raises considerable concern in healthcare settings, biofilms
can exacerbate infections in patients and compromise the integrity of
medical devices employed during treatment. Similarly, certain bacterial
species contribute to bulking, foaming, and biofilm development in water
environments such as wastewater treatment plants, water reservoirs, and
aquaculture facilities. Additionally, food production facilities provide
ideal conditions for establishing bacterial biofilms, which can serve as
reservoirs for foodborne pathogens. Efforts to combat antibiotic
resistance involve exploring various strategies, including bacteriophage
therapy. Research has been conducted on the effects of phages and their
individual proteins to assess their potential for biofilm removal.
However, challenges persist, prompting the examination of refined
approaches such as drug-phage combination therapies, phage cocktails,
and genetically modified phages for clinical applications. This review
aims to highlight the progress regarding bacteriophage-based approaches
for biofilm eradication in different settings.</p>

effects of antimicrobial components of the human-derived composite
amnion-chorion membrane on bacterial growth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe human-derived amnion-chorion membrane (ACM) has
endogenous antimicrobial properties, which are important for preventing
the colonization and survival of oral bacteria on exposed membranes.
This project aimed to decipher the underlying mechanism by identifying
the components of ACM that confer antibacterial properties. In addition,
the antimicrobial efficacy of these identified components on oral
bacteria was assessed.MethodsFour antimicrobial proteins, histone
H2A/H2B, cathelicidin LL-37, lactoferrin, and lysozyme, were identified
via mass spectrometry in ACM. These proteins were then assessed for
their efficacy in killing Streptococcus gordonii Challis. Log-phased
bacterial cells were cultured with the commercially available proteins
that were identified in ACM, either individually or in combination, at
different concentrations. After incubation for 8 or 24 hours, the
bacteria were stained with a live/dead viability kit and analyzed via
confocal microscopy.ResultsThe combination of these proteins effectively
killed S. gordonii in a dose-dependent fashion after 8 or 24 hours of
incubation. When each protein was tested individually, it killed S.
gordonii at a much lower efficacy relative to the combinations. The
synergistic effects of the antimicrobial protein combinations were also
observed in both the viable cell count recovery and minimum inhibitory
concentration assays.DiscussionBy shedding light on the mechanisms in
the ACMâ€™s antimicrobial property, this study may raise more awareness of
the potential benefit of utilization of a membrane with endogenous
antimicrobial properties in regeneration surgeries.</p>

RNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN1 modulates human malaria gene expression
during intraerythrocytic development</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPlasmodium falciparum is the most damaging malaria
pathogen and brings a heavy burden to global health. Host switching and
morphological changes in P. falciparum are dependent on an effective
gene expression regulatory system. C5 methylation of cytosines is a
common RNA modification in eukaryotes, and the NSUN family are essential
m5C modification executors. Currently, little is known about this family
in Plasmodium spp. In this study, we focus on exploring the function of
PfNSUN1 protein.MethodsAn efficient CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique
was applied to construct the PfNSUN1 knockdown strain. The knockdown
efficiency was confirmed by growth curves and western blot experiments.
The knockdown transcriptome data was acquired to find differentially
expressed genes, and target genes of PfNSUN1 protein were identified by
RNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing
experiments.ResultsThe efficiency of PfNSUN1 protein down-regulated was
about 34%. RNA-seq data revealed that differentially expressed genes
were mainly down-regulated. And there were 224, 278, 556 genes that were
down-regulated with more than 2-fold changes and p-adj&lt;0.05 at ring,
trophozoite and schizont stages, respectively. PfNSUN1 protein was
significantly enriched on 154 target genes, including 28S ribosomal RNA
and pfap2-g5 transcription factor.DiscussionPfNSUN1 is a crucial RNA
post-transcriptional modification protein in P. falciparum. It plays a
pivotal role in regulating gene expression and parasite growth by
targeting 28S ribosomal RNA and pfap2-g5 transcription factor.</p>

susceptibility, molecular epidemiology, and clinical risk factors of
Candida glabrata in intensive care unit in a Chinese Tertiary
Hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe increasing incidence and high mortality rate of Candida
glabrata infection in ICU patients is an important issue. Therefore, it
is imperative to investigate the antifungal susceptibility profiles and
epidemiological characteristics in local regions.MethodsHerein,
antifungal susceptibility testing was conducted to determine the minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of eight antifungal drugs. Multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) was used to study the strain genotype,
geographical distribution, and susceptibility to antifungal agents among
C. glabrata isolates. The mechanism of echinocandin resistance was
explored by sequencing the FKS1 and FKS2 genes (encoding 1,3-Î²-D-glucan
synthases) of echinocandin-resistant C. glabrata strains. Moreover, we
further investigated the clinical manifestations and the various risk
factors of patients infected with C. glabrata in the ICU.ResultsWe
selected 234 C. glabrata isolates from 234 patients in the ICU randomly
for the follow-up study. Cross-resistance was found among the ICU C.
glabrata isolates. Analysis using MLST showed that the genetic diversity
among the C. glabrata isolates was low. Furthermore, sequence type
showed no correlation with the antifungal resistance profiles, but was
associated with geographical distribution. We also revealed novel
mutations in FKS1 (S629P) and FKS2 (W1497stop) that mediated high-level
echinocandin resistance (MIC &gt;8 Âµg/mL). More than 14 daysâ€™ stay in
ICU (P=0.007), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II
(APACHE-II) score (P=0.024), prior antifungal exposure (P=0.039) and
lung disease (P=0.036) were significantly associated with antifungal
resistant/non-wild-type C. glabrata infection.ConclusionOur study shed
light on the antifungal susceptibility, molecular epidemiology, and
clinical risk factors of C. glabrata in the ICU of a Chinese Tertiary
Hospital. Importantly, we revealed the molecular mechanism of
echinocandin resistance. These results highlight the significance of
continued surveillance in ICUs and provide data support for the
treatment of C. glabrata in clinics.</p>
