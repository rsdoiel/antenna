disorders and gut-brain interactions: exploring the therapeutic
potential of pycnogenol through microbial-metabolic-neural networks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), characterized by cognitive
impairments and behavioral abnormalities, represent a clinically diverse
group of conditions typically emerging during childhood or adolescence.
Major subtypes encompass autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and epilepsy. The
pathogenesis of these disorders involves multifactorial interactions
between genetic susceptibility (Shank3 mutations in ASD), environmental
triggers (prenatal toxins), neurotransmitter dysregulation (dopamine
(GA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems) and immune dysregulation.
Growing research highlights the gut-brain axis disruption as a potential
contributor to NDDs pathophysiology, though systematic evaluation of
therapeutic approaches targeting this axis and related gastrointestinal
comorbidities (GIDs) remains limited. This review comprehensively
examines the pathological mechanisms underlying ADHD, ASD, and epilepsy,
while analyzing the reciprocal relationship between gut-brain axis
dysregulation and GID manifestations in NDDs. Notably, abnormal
activation of key signaling pathways including NF-κB, MAPK and
PI3K/AKT/mTOR is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NDDs. We
further propose pycnogenol (PYC), a polyphenol extract of pine bark, as
a natural compound with multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant, can directly or indirectly affect the function of the
gut-brain axis by regulating the structure of the intestinal microbial
community (increasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and
butyric acid-producing bacteria) and its metabolites, providing a new
strategy for the treatment of NDDs.</p>

and AliD of nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae enhance virulence
in a Galleria mellonella model of infection by contributing to reactive
oxygen species resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (NESp) are
isolated worldwide. Due to the lack of capsule in NESp strains the
current vaccines, that target the pneumococcal capsule are ineffective.
Some NESp contain the oligopeptide transporters AliC and AliD which are
required for virulence through unknown mechanisms. AliC and AliD have
been previously shown to reduce rates of phagocytosis and alter the
transcriptome and proteome of MNZ41. We hypothesize that oligopeptide
regulated genes are responsible for reduced phagocytosis and increased
survival through resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS).MethodsTo
test this a mutant library of AliC and AliD regulated genes was used in
in vitro and in vivo models. ROS resistance was tested through
quantifying bacterial counts after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
A modified surface killing assay was also used to calculate resistance
to phagocytosis of our mutant library. A Galleria mellonella larvae
model of infection was used to determine survival curve
analyses.ResultsTwo mutant genes in our library, ∆lytFN1 (CDT04) and
∆mgtC (CDT05), displayed greater sensitivity to H2O2 killing and
phagocytosis compared to wildtype MNZ41. Deletion of AliD in an
AliD-expressing encapsulated strain reduced virulence.ConclusionThis
research demonstrates that proteins encoded by genes regulated by AliC
and AliD alter susceptibility to host-derived mechanisms for bacterial
clearance and increases bacterial survival in response to ROS.</p>

progressive pulmonary abscess initially misdiagnosed as lung cancer: the
role of Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Pulmonary abscess is a serious infectious disease characterized by
localized lung tissue necrosis, primarily caused by anaerobic or
facultative anaerobic bacterial infections. While the Streptococcus
anginosus group (SAG) is a well-established pathogen in pulmonary
abscess formation, recent findings suggest that strict anaerobes such as
Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra can also contribute to
deep-seated infections. However, their role in rapidly progressive
pulmonary abscesses has not been previously documented. Here, we present
a case of a rapidly progressive pulmonary abscess caused by
Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Parvimonas micra in an immunocompetent
patient, initially misdiagnosed as lung cancer. This case highlights the
importance of differentiating infectious lung lesions from malignancies
and underscores the clinical utility of metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS) in diagnosing rare anaerobic infections, offering
valuable insights for precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</p>

activity of cell-free supernatant of Lactobacillus crispatus M247: a
promising treatment against vaginal infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Lactobacillus crispatus is renowned for its antimicrobial properties,
and some strains are used to treat vaginal dysbiosis, although the
mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial properties remain elusive. We
isolated L. crispatus M247 (LcM247) from a commercially available
probiotic product Crispact® and tested its antimicrobial activity
against selected pathobionts such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae,
Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans using both cocultures and
testing the antimicrobial activity of cell-free supernatant (CFS)
obtained from the culture of the probiotic strain. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that CFS antimicrobial activity is pH dependent and that it
is not affected by temperature and proteinase K treatment. Proteomic
analysis suggests that this activity is mediated by S-layer secreted
proteins. In a series of in vitro infection models, we infected
Henrietta Lacks’ cervical eukaryotic cancer cells (HeLa) with E. coli,
S. agalactiae and C. albicans at specific multiplicities of infection
(MOIs) before the administration of LcM247, CFS, gentamicin or
fluconazole alone or in combination with LcM247/CFS. We observed a
slight decrease in the microbial burden following LcM247 administration,
while treatment with CFS significantly reduced microbial growth compared
to control and antimicrobial compounds. These results highlight the
antimicrobial properties of LcM247 and its CFS and the likely mechanism
of action that contributes to the eradication of common pathobionts. We
show that actively replicating LcM247 is less efficient than its CFS, so
the oral administration of LcM247 may result in treatment failure.
Finally, the use of CFS may result in an upswing of the host
Lactobacillus strains and promote the engraftment of Lactobacillus
probiotic treatments.</p>

emerging roles of ubiquitin-like modifications in regulating HIV
replication and host defense</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>As a post-translational modification (PTM) mechanism analogous to
ubiquitination, ubiquitin-like (UBL) modification plays a crucial
regulatory role in virus-host interactions. With the increasing
discovery of UBL modification types, their roles in diverse biological
process, including HIV infection, have gained growing attention. Rather
than merely serving as anti-HIV defenses or being exploited by the
virus, UBLs often exert dual roles by modulating both host restriction
factors and viral proteins, thereby impacting key steps of HIV life
cycle, immune evasion, and intracellular signaling. This article
summarizes recent advances on the contribution of UBLs in regulating HIV
replication and host defense, highlighting their indispensable roles in
arms races between HIV and host, aiming to provide a theoretical
framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies against HIV-1
targeting virus-host interactions.</p>

vivo RNA-seq and infection model reveal the different infection and
immune characteristics of B. pertussis strains in China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionVarious strains emerged in B. pertussis re-emergence, the
pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms remain elusive. We aimed to
explore the relationship between the in vivo transcriptome and
colonization advantage of various pertussis clinical strains during the
B. pertussis re-emergence.MethodsFour pertussis strains were isolated
from clinically suspected cases by active surveillance. The phylogenetic
relationships of clinical strains and global isolates were compared by a
genome-wide SNP-based phylogenetic tree and allele genotyping. LC-MS/MS
analysis and binding affinity detection allowed the identification of
expression and antigenicity of pertactin. The characteristics of
infection and immunity of clinical strains were compared in a BALB/c
mouse aerosol challenge model. In vivo RNA-seq analysis was performed in
NSG mouse model to describe the transcriptome during infection, and
verified by detecting biofilm formation and paraquat
tolerance.ResultsThe partial pertactin-deficient strain BP-L2 was first
reported. It showed significantly enhanced tracheal colonization
compared to both CS and BP-L1 strains in naive mice (P &lt; 0.0001
vs. CS) and exhibited superior fitness over BP-L1 in immunized mice (P
&lt; 0.001). BP-L1 showed superior lung colonization (P &lt; 0.0001) and
tissue-resident memory T cell induction versus BP-L2 and CS (P &lt;
0.001). Colonization dominance of BP-L1 in lungs and BP-L2 in trachea
aligned with the pathological injury (P &lt; 0.05) and the inflammatory
cytokine enhancement (IL-6 in lungs of BP-L1 group, P &lt; 0.01). In
vivo RNA-seq results revealed that BP-L2 significantly upregulated relA
(log2FC = 2.1, FDR P-value = 0.019) and sodA (log2FC =2.4, FDR P-value =
8.61E-06) compared to BP-L1, functionally linked to enhanced stringent
response and oxidative stress defense. BP-L1 exhibited significant in
vivo bipA upregulation over BP-L2 (log2FC = 1.8, FDR P-value = 0.027)
without concurrent biofilm enhancement (P = 0.51 vs. BP-L2).
Furthermore, the BP-L2 and BP-L3 strains of the same ptxP1-ptxA1-fhaB3
lineage showed significantly higher paraquat tolerance than other
strains (P &lt; 0.001), showing extremely high SODs
activity.ConclusionThe emerging pertussis strains exhibit different
colonization advantages in the trachea or lungs, which will influence
the transmission patterns of the clinical strains. The tracheal
colonization advantage of the partial pertactin-deficient strain may be
associated with the overexpression of the relA and sodA in vivo
infection.</p>

of an infectious clone of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis
virus and a study on the location and function of accessory protein
3</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionTransmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as the
causative agent of TGE, causes huge economic losses in the pig industry
worldwide.MethodsIn this study, we successfully constructed a reverse
genetic system for the TGEV TH-98 strain and rescued the recombinant
virus rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA based on this system.ResultsThe results showed
that ORF3 is a non-structural protein and does not exist in mature
virions. Therefore, rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA induced inflammatory cytokine
expression in IPEC-J2 cells, but the expression levels were
significantly lower than those triggered by TH-98 and rTH-98, indicating
that TGEV ORF3 may play a critical role in inducing the host immune
response. To detect whether the exogenous protein expressed in the
rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA has immunogenicity, the results showed that the levels
of antibodies were significantly increased in mice. rTH-98-Δ3-COE-HA can
induce a specific immune response in the host body against its expressed
exogenous proteins.Discussion and conclusionOur study provides important
clues for revealing the role of ORF3 in virus replication and
pathogenesis, laying a theoretical and material foundation for the
construction of recombinant viral multi-valent vaccines.</p>

parvula outer membrane vesicles increase ICAM-1+ neutrophils exhibiting
elevated NET formation via ROS–PAD4 signaling</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundVeillonella parvula (V. parvula), as an anaerobic
Gram-negative coccus, produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to promote
bacterial colonization and periodontitis progress. Neutrophils are the
first immune cells during bacterial stimulation, while neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs) are the early triggers in the progress of
periodontitis. However, the interactions between neutrophils and V.
parvula are still unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the
effects and underlying mechanisms of V. parvula OMVs on
neutrophils.MethodsNeutrophil migration, apoptosis, and phagocytosis and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed following
stimulation with V. parvula OMVs. The differential gene expression in
neutrophils was characterized using RNA sequencing. The correlation
between intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression and NET
formation was verified through flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.
The NET formation-associated components, including cell-free DNA,
neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and the PAD4 expression were
analyzed. The frequencies of the ICAM-1+ neutrophils and NET formation
were evaluated in neutrophils pretreated with CYBB or PAD4
inhibitors.ResultsNeutrophils exhibited robust migration, increased
apoptosis, and ROS production following exposure to V. parvula OMVs. No
significant differences were observed in neutrophil phagocytosis. RNA
sequencing analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression of
Icam-1 mRNA. And higher ICAM-1+ neutrophils in the V. parvula OMVs group
enhanced the levels of NET formation via activation of ROS-PAD4
signaling pathway.ConclusionsV. parvula OMVs were initially found to
increase the population of ICAM-1+ neutrophils, which subsequently
exhibited elevated NET formation via the ROS–PAD4 signaling pathway.
This study elucidates a novel pathogenic mechanism of V. parvula OMVs
and highlights the potential of targeting ICAM-1+ neutrophils as a
therapeutic approach for chronic periodontitis.</p>

Mannheimia haemolytica</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) cause mastitis in sheep,
acute sepsis in newborn lambs, and co-infections with various pathogens,
leading to bovine respiratory disease syndrome (BRDS), these infections
have resulted in significant economic losses to both domestic and
international farming industries. An in-depth understanding of the
pathogenic mechanisms of M. haemolytica is crucial for the prevention
and control of this disease. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) play a vital
role in bacterial pathogenesis, serving as key mediators of interactions
between Gram-negative bacteria and their hosts. However, the specific
role of OMVs in the pathogenic process of M. haemolytica remains poorly
understood. To address this, we isolated OMVs from the Mannheimia
haemolytica Type A5 strain (MH-5) using ultracentrifugation and
subsequently characterized their secretory properties, protein
composition, and immunogenicity through electron microscopy, liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and cellular
experiments. The electron microscopy results indicated that the MH-5
strain secreted OMVs under natural growth conditions. Proteomic and
bioinformatics analyses revealed that these OMVs contained 282 proteins,
with significant enrichment in proteins related to immunity, iron
metabolism, and catalytic activity. Cellular experiments demonstrated
that, compared to the control group, the OMVs group exhibited a
significant increase in the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
with secretion levels increasing in a dose-dependent manner, thereby
enhancing the inflammatory response. These findings lay the groundwork
for further exploration of the role of OMVs in the pathogenesis of M.
haemolytica and provide insights for the development of effective
vaccines and antibiotics against this pathogen.</p>

id="prevalence-and-related-factors-of-tbhiv-co-infection-among-hospitalized-children-with-tuberculosis-in-southwest-china">Prevalence
and related factors of TB/HIV co-infection among hospitalized children
with tuberculosis in Southwest China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the prevalence of TB/HIV
co-infection in pediatric TB patients in southwest China and its
associated variables.MethodsPediatric TB patients were recruited from
January 2014 to September 2024 in southwest China, based on etiology or
clinical confirmation. Hospitalization records were extracted for each
patient.ResultsAmong 2,607 pediatric TB patients with an average age of
9.58 ± 4.08 years, 39 (1.5%) were HIV-positive. The TB/HIV co-infection
group male-to-female ratio was 2:1, higher than the TB-only group
1.19:1. The highest proportion of TB/HIV co-infection was in the 5-9
years age group (43.6%), while the 10-14 years age group accounted for
the highest proportion of TB-alone cases (57.5%). In terms of population
distribution, the Yi ethnic group had the highest proportion of TB/HIV
co-infection cases (43.6%), while the Tibetan group had the highest
proportion of TB-alone cases (51.1%). Extrapulmonary TB in the TB/HIV
co-infection group primarily involved abdominal and pericardial sites,
whereas the TB-alone infection group had more cases of lymphadenitis and
pleural TB. The length of hospitalization (&gt;14 days) in the TB/HIV
co-infection group (74.4%) was significantly longer than in the TB-alone
infection group (51.7%). Over the past 11 years, most pediatric TB/HIV
co-infection cases were from the eastern-central and southern-central
regions of Sichuan, particularly the southern Liangshan Yi Autonomous
Prefecture. The number of children with TB-alone infections increased
gradually during this period. No significant difference in the number of
pediatric TB/HIV co-infection cases was observed over the 11
years.ConclusionPediatric TB/HIV co-infection in southwest China
predominantly affects middle-aged and young boys, with a higher
co-infection rate than the national average. The central and southern
regions of Sichuan have a relatively high proportion of cases. Public
health efforts should focus on strengthening awareness, screening, and
early diagnosis of TB and HIV in children in high-risk areas to prevent
further infections.</p>

of metabolites analysis for patients with granulomatous lobular
mastitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGranulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM) is a type of
non-puerperal mastitis (NPM) associated with autoimmune factors.
Previous studies suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a role
in the pathological process of GLM; however, the specific role of gut
microbiota metabolites in this process remains unclear. Therefore, this
study aimed to investigate the gut metabolic characteristics of
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) in patients with GLM, a type of
NPM.MethodsStool samples were collected from 35 patients with GLM and 26
healthy control (HC) subjects. These samples underwent targeted
metabolomic analysis to measure SCFA and 16s rRNA high-throughput
sequencing to assess gut microbiota composition and differences between
the groups.ResultsGas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS) analysis
revealed that the content of SCFA-butanoic acid in the feces of patients
with GLM was higher than that in the HC group. Notably, significant
differences in metabolic pathways were observed between the HC and GLM
groups. High-throughput sequencing results showed that the richness and
diversity of gut microbiota in patients with GLM were significantly
lower than those in healthy individuals. In addition, 53 bacterial
species were found to differ significantly in abundance between the two
groups. Moreover, the level of isohexanoic acid in the feces of patients
with GLM with recurrence disease was significantly higher than that of
patients without recurrence.ConclusionsPatients with GLM exhibit
disturbances in gut butanoic acid metabolism and significant differences
in gut microbiota structure compared to healthy individuals.</p>

viruses rewire the epigenome in human cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Viruses contribute to approximately 15–20% of global cancer cases,
yet the full spectrum of their oncogenic mechanisms continues to be
uncovered. Beyond the classical roles of genome integration, chronic
inflammation, and immune evasion, mounting evidence reveals that
oncogenic viruses—including the human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein–Barr
virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Human
T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)—profoundly reshape the host
epigenome to establish persistent infection and promote tumorigenesis.
These viruses orchestrate widespread and durable changes in DNA
methylation, histone modification, chromatin accessibility, and
non-coding RNA expression, silencing tumor suppressors, deregulating
oncogenic pathways, and inducing stemness-like phenotypes. In this
review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of how distinct oncogenic
viruses modulate the epigenetic landscape across tissue contexts, with a
focus on cervical, hepatic, and lymphoepithelial cancers. We also
explore how these virus-induced epigenetic “scars” may persist after
viral clearance and highlight recent advances in therapeutic targeting.
Emerging therapeutic strategies that integrate oncolytic virotherapy,
epigenetic drugs, and immune modulation through combinational therapy
offer synergistic mechanisms to overcome immune resistance and
epigenetic silencing in virus-induced cancers. These integrated
approaches hold transformative potential for more durable and targeted

of Beauvericin’s activity and mode of action against all life stages of
L. tropica for cutaneous Leishmaniasis therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundLeishmaniasis, particularly its cutaneous form caused by
Leishmania tropica, remains a significant global health concern due to
the limitations of current treatments, including drug resistance,
toxicity, and inconsistent efficacy. This study investigates the
potential of Beauvericin (BEA), a fungal secondary metabolite, as an
alternative antileishmanial agent.ObjectivesThis study investigates the
potential of Beauvericin (BEA), a fungal secondary metabolite, as an
alternative antileishmanial agent.MethodsWe assessed the efficacy of BEA
against different developmental stages of L. tropica using in vitro
assays and an in vivo Galleria mellonella infection model. The ability
of L. tropica to develop resistance to BEA and its effects on the
parasite’s gene expression profile were also examined.ResultsBEA
exhibited potent antileishmanial activity with equipotency across both
promastigote and amastigote stages of L. tropica, with IC50 values of
0.25 µM and 0.27 µM, respectively, significantly lower than those of
miltefosine. Mechanistically, BEA acts as a calcium ionophore, inducing
a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels, which serves as the
primary cytotoxic event. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that
BEA-induced calcium dysregulation triggers secondary cellular responses
involving calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and stress response,
contributing to its multifaceted mechanism of action. The G. mellonella
model demonstrated that BEA significantly reduced parasite burden,
improved survival rates. Notably, BEA showed a slower rate of resistance
development compared to ML, indicating its potential as a more
sustainable treatment option.ConclusionsBEA is a promising candidate for
antileishmanial therapy, demonstrating superior efficacy, a broad
mechanism of action, and a favorable resistance profile compared to ML.
Further investigations in mammalian models are warranted to validate
BEA’s potential as a novel, cost-effective treatment for
leishmaniasis.</p>

and cancer: unveiling the complex role of fungal infections in tumor
biology and therapeutic resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cancer remains one of the most significant causes of mortality across
the world. Despite remarkable advancements made in early detection,
therapeutic strategies, and the advent of immunotherapy in recent years,
numerous challenges continue to hinder optimal outcomes. The development
and progression of cancer are driven not only by genetic and epigenetic
alterations within tumor cells but also by dynamic interactions
occurring with the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME). It is a
highly complex milieu composed of tumor cells, non-tumor stromal cells,
extracellular matrix components, immune cells, blood vessels, and
diverse signaling molecules. Emerging evidence underscores the pivotal
role of fungi in influencing cancer biology, including initiation,
progression, immune evasion, and the modulation of TME. Fungi, which are
omnipresent microorganisms, have traditionally been considered
opportunistic pathogens. However, recent research highlights their
broader impact on host immunity and their potential contributions to
cancer pathogenesis. For instance, in patients with cancer, fungal
infections not only exacerbate clinical complications but also create
conditions conducive to tumor growth, metastasis, and immune escape by
altering the immune microenvironment. In addition, fungal-derived
metabolites and their interactions with host immune pathways can
significantly modulate the efficacy of immunotherapies. These findings
have spurred interest in exploring antifungal strategies as adjunctive
approaches in cancer management, positioning antifungal therapy as a
burgeoning area of oncological research. This review provides an
in-depth exploration of the complex interplay between fungi and cancer.
It examines the multifaceted role of fungal infections in tumor biology,
the mechanisms through which fungi reshape the TME through immune
modulation and their influence on immune-evasion strategies and
therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, the potential for integrating
antifungal therapies into comprehensive cancer treatment regimens has
been highlighted, offering insights into novel avenues for improving
patient outcomes.</p>

gut microbiota dynamics in obese individuals from cross-sectional
data</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionObesity affects approximately 39% of adults worldwide.
While gut microbiota has been linked to obesity, most research has
focused on static taxonomic composition rather than the dynamic
interactions between microbial taxa.MethodsWe applied BEEM-Static, a
generalized Lotka-Volterra model, to cross-sectional 16S rRNA gut
microbiome data from six public datasets, comprising 2,435 profiles from
lean and obese individuals.ResultsA total of 57 significant microbial
interactions were identified in obese individuals (79% negative),
compared to 37 in lean individuals (92% negative). For example,
Bacteroidetes showed a stronger inhibitory effect on Firmicutes in obese
individuals (−0.41) than in lean ones (−0.26). Firmicutes and
Proteobacteria exhibited consistently higher carrying capacities in
obese populations.DiscussionThese findings suggest that microbial
interaction networks—not just taxonomic abundance—play a key role in
obesity-related dysbiosis. Our approach enables the inference of
microbiota dynamics from a single time point, paving the way for
tailored dietary interventions, which we refer to as Optibiomics.</p>

of the diagnostic capabilities of tNGS and mNGS for pathogens causing
lower respiratory tract infections: a prospective observational
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>AimsPathogens in lower respiratory tract infections(LRTI) are
complex. Conventional microbiological testings(CMTs) are time-consuming
and inaccurate. mNGS is widely used to overcome these issues. tNGS, as
an emerging NGS technology, has uncertain diagnostic efficacy.Materials
and methods136 suspected LRTI patients were included from January 2022
to February 2024 from the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care
Medicine at Jiangsu Province People’s Hospital,China.We simultaneously
submitted the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) for mNGS, tNGS and
conventional microbial testing (CMTs) and compared the pathogen
diagnostic efficacy of mNGS, and tNGS.ResultsA total of 136 patients
were included, and there was no statistically significant difference in
the detection sensitivity(74.75% VS 78.64%, p&gt;0,05) and
specificity(81.82% vs 93,94%,p&gt;0.05) between mNGS and tNGS. However,
tNGS has a higher sensitivity(27.94% vs 17.65%,p=0.043)and
specificity(88.78% vs 84.82%,p=0.048) for fungi. According to our
diagnostic criteria, tNGS successfully identified 3 cases of
Pneumocystis jirovecii(P. jirovecii) individually. In addition, both
tNGS and mNGS detected chlamydia psittaci whereas CMTs were unable to
detect it.ConclusionstNGS demonstrates diagnostic efficacy for pathogens
in lower respiratory tract infections that is comparable to mNGS.
However, tNGS has specific advantages in the detection of fungi.
Considering the cost-effectiveness of tNGS, it is recommended to
implement tNGS clinically for patients with lower respiratory tract
infections.</p>

profiling reveals RetS-mediated regulation of type VI secretion system
and host cell responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes
chronic infections, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The type VI secretion
system (T6SS) is a primary virulence factor of P. aeruginosa in chronic
infections. The objective of this study was to elucidate the regulatory
mechanisms and pathogenic effects of the T6SS during P. aeruginosa
infection, utilizing transcriptome sequencing and functional assays. We
found that T6SS expression is elevated in P. aeruginosa isolated from
chronically infected patients. Deletion of the retS gene activates P.
aeruginosa PAO1 T6SS while repressing T3SS in vitro. Bacterial and
cellular transcriptome sequencing analyses showed that T6SS genes were
upregulated, while T3SS genes were downregulated in the ΔretS mutant.
Additionally, the expression levels of the fimbriae gene cupC, the
histidine phosphotransfer protein hptC (PA0033), and the transcription
factor PA0034 were significantly increased. Subsequent experiments
revealed that adhesion mediated by cupC enhances the contact-killing
activity of the T6SS. Deletion of the hptC-PA0034 operon results in the
down-regulation of cupC expression. The ΔretSΔcupC and ΔretSΔhptC-PA0034
mutants exhibited reduced cytotoxicity compared to the ΔretS mutant,
similar to the ΔretSΔclpV1ΔclpV2 mutant. The ΔretS infection increased
cell death, inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and reactive
oxygen species compared to a T6SS-inactive strain. Importantly, our
study demonstrates that the T6SS activates the PDE4C pathway in
epithelial cells, leading to significant cellular alterations. The
application of PDE inhibitors effectively mitigates cell damage and
inflammatory responses. These findings highlight the critical role of
T6SS in modulating host cell signaling and suggest potential therapeutic
strategies for conditions associated with T6SS-mediated
inflammation.</p>

pharmacovigilance reports of hepatitis A inactivated and hepatitis B
(recombinant) vaccine: insights from disproportionality analysis of the
vaccine adverse event reporting system</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatitis A Inactivated and Hepatitis B (Recombinant)
Vaccine (Hep AB) was approved for use in 2001. Hep AB demonstrates
satisfactory efficacy in protecting the public from hepatitis virus
infections. However, there is a lack of recent real-world report on its
adverse events (AEs).MethodsWe retrieved US AE reports related to Hep AB
vaccination from VAERS for the period 2020-2024. We used four
algorithms: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio
(PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and
Multi-Item Gamma-Poisson Shrinkage (MGPS) to examine AE signals. The ROR
and PRR algorithms have higher sensitivity but lower specificity.
However, BCPNN and MGPS compensate for this limitation. Combining all
four algorithms helps reduce false-positive signals. In addition to the
general population, we also focused on reports stratified by
gender.ResultsWe retrieved 1,640 eligible reports from VAERS. In the
general population, we identified two AE signals at the System Organ
Classification (SOC) level. Additionally, we found 39 AE signals at the
Preferred Term (PT) level. Among these, endocrine disorders were
identified for the first time as AE signals. In the subsequent gender
stratified analysis, more AE signals were identified in females compared
to males. Notably, signals for endocrine disorders (autoimmune
thyroiditis and Graves’ disease) were detected in females, whereas no
such signals were found in males.ConclusionsWe conducted a comprehensive
examination of the recent AE reports for Hep AB and identified
unexpected AEs, particularly in females. These findings will provide
valuable insights into future evidence-based surveillance strategies of
Hep AB.</p>

and diagnostic insights into brucellar arthritis: a single-center
retrospective cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThis study evaluates the diagnostic value of etiological
and serological testing in distinguishing brucellosis arthropathy from
other inflammatory joint diseases.MethodsA retrospective analysis was
conducted on 68 cases of brucellosis arthropathy diagnosed between 2012
and 2024, alongside 60 non-infected controls. Bacterial cultures were
performed using blood, joint fluid-blood bottle culture, and joint
tissue samples, with microbial identification via VITEK Compact-II or
MALDI-TOF MS. Clinical features, serological results (Standard
Agglutination Test [SAT] and Rose Bengal Test [RBT]), and imaging
findings were analyzed. The diagnostic performance of biomarkers was
assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves.ResultsAmong the 68 cases, 22 (32.4%) were confirmed by bacterial
culture, with Brucella melitensis identified as the causative agent.
Joint fluid-blood bottle culture was the most effective method (62.2%),
with a mean detection time of 74.8 ± 17.9 hours (range: 41–110 hours) in
aerobic bottles. Blood culture and joint tissue culture yielded positive
results in 40.9% and 4.5% of cases, respectively. Brucellosis
arthropathy accounted for 7.5% of total brucellosis cases, predominantly
affecting males (67.6%) with a median age of 43.1 ± 13.2 years.
Brucellosis arthropathy infection median time were 90[30,343] days. The
knee joint was the most commonly affected site (64.7%), followed by the
hip (20.6%) and sacroiliac joints (10.3%). Imaging revealed septic
arthritis (20.7%), joint effusion (31.0%), bone destruction (12.0%),
degenerative changes (10.3%), and prosthetic joint infection (6.9%). The
sensitivity for Brucella culture, SAT, and RBT were 69.7%, 87.7%, and
91.2%, respectively, with a combined sensitivity of 92.6%. ROC analysis
identified CRP as a highly sensitive and specific biomarker (cutoff:
4.07 mg/mL; sensitivity: 84.2%, specificity: 72.2%; Z = 5.568, p &lt;
0.001). All patients were treated with doxycycline and rifampicin for 3
months, with 34% requiring surgical intervention. The prognosis was
satisfactory in all cases.ConclusionsBrucellosis arthropathy, often
chronic and predominantly affecting the knee and hip joints, presents
with septic arthritis, joint effusion, and bone destruction on imaging.
Diagnosis can be effectively achieved through aerobic joint fluid-blood
bottle culture, SAT, and RBT. Early diagnosis and combined
medical-surgical management yield favorable outcomes.</p>

id="pathogens-that-infect-mammalian-cells-via-sulfonated-glycosaminoglycans">Pathogens
that infect mammalian cells via sulfonated glycosaminoglycans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Sulfonated glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate and dermatan
sulfate, form major components of the cell surface and extracellular
matrix, and display vital roles in mammalian physiology, including
growth and development. The identification of specific binding to
different glycosaminoglycans by a variety of pathogens has led to
increased interest in this mechanism for understanding infection. Over
the past four decades there have been more than 300 studies on various
pathogens that utilize glycosaminoglycans in their infection process.
Currently, no articles have collated all known pathogens that use this
process. So it is timely that this article provides an overview of all
known pathogens that use glycosaminoglycans to enhance their binding
and/or infection in human cells. This was done by using the search terms
“sulfate/sulphate” “pathogen”, “virus”, “bacteria”, “parasite”,
“infection” and “glycosaminoglycans” to curate peer-reviewed and
relevant original research articles from PubMed. This search found that
glycosaminoglycans are used in the infection process for 59 viruses, 28
bacteria, and 8 other pathogens (i.e. parasitic protozoa, prions). These
findings highlight the conserved and widespread use of
glycosaminoglycans for enhancing pathogen infection. In addition, the
curated list of pathogens in this study provides a resource for future
studies to consider potential therapeutic approaches for targeted
disruption of the interaction between pathogens and
glycosaminoglycans.</p>

pathogen-driven neonatal late-onset sepsis: a modification to the murine
cecal slurry</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNeonatal sepsis is a major cause of neonatal morbidity
and mortality. Reliable animal models are essential to our understanding
of late-onset sepsis, but notable limitations exist in the current
standard murine cecal slurry model. We sought to refine the existing
model by using an injection of known stock slurry (“NEC’teria”) cultured
from an infant who died of necrotizing enterocolitis to better mimic
sepsis following the translocation of neonatal specific bacterial
pathogens from the intestine into the peritoneum.MethodsTo induce
sepsis, neonatal mice (P7 and P14 – P16) were given an intraperitoneal
injection of varying concentrations of NEC’teria, while sham controls
received an injection of PBS. Mice were monitored for survival and
tissue samples, serum, and peritoneal washes were collected for further
assessment of inflammation, immune response, and intestinal injury. Ceca
were collected for microbiome analysis.ResultsWhile the polymicrobial
cecal slurry from adult mice contained common healthy gut microbes,
NEC’teria is composed of bacteria, primarily from the Enterobacteriaceae
and Enterococcaceae families, that are common causes of late-onset
sepsis. NEC’teria exposure significantly increased serum inflammatory
cytokines, resulted in intestinal injury, altered the microbiome
composition, and induced significant changes in local and systemic
immune cell expression. Sepsis-induced mortality, inflammation, and
intestinal injury were live-bacteria dependent and could be attenuated
by administration of an antibiotic one hour after bacterial
injection.DiscussionOur modification to the cecal slurry neonatal sepsis
model resulted in a consistent sepsis-related mortality and phenotypic
changes in neonatal mouse pups that resembled the changes that occur in
human preterm infants who develop late-onset sepsis. Our pathogenic
slurry is highly relevant to neonatal sepsis, as it is comprised of
bacterial families found commonly in septic neonates. We expect our
model to be highly reproducible between institutions, due to the
standardized bacterial dose and characterized stock solution.</p>

resistance prediction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pulmonary
infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRecently, targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) have
been extensively utilized for the identification of pathogens in
pulmonary infections, there have been some studies systematically
evaluating differences in the efficacy of tNGS and conventional
microbiological tests (CMTs) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
specimens.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 203 patients
with pulmonary infections treated in one tertiary hospital from July
2023 to February 2024. BALF specimens underwent parallel testing via
tNGS and CMTs. Pathogen detection consistency, the drug resistance genes
concordance with phenotypic drug sensitivity, and clinical impact of
tNGS-guided therapy adjustments were analyzed. Furthermore, two patients
with complex infections were selected for tNGS microbiological
surveillance to evaluate the efficacy of monitoring severe
pneumonia.ResultsThis study included 205 confirmed infectious BALF
specimens (two patients were tested twice). tNGS identified 56 putative
pathogens, compared to 20 by CMTs, with a significantly higher positive
rate (99.5% vs. 35.6%, P&lt;0.0001). The detection of pathogenic
microorganisms using tNGS showed a high concordance rate with the
results of CMTs. tNGS-guided therapy adjustments occurred in 17.2%
(35/203) of patients. Resistance gene predictions aligned with the drug
sensitivity results in 40% (6/15) of carbapenem-resistant organisms
(CROs) and 80% (4/5) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) cases. Additionally, for monitored two patients with severe
pneumonia, the tNGS results were consistent with the culture and imaging
test results during treatment.ConclusionsThe application of tNGS
highlights its promise and significance in identifying potential
pathogens, predicting drug resistance, and providing guidance for
anti-infection therapies for severe pneumonia. It can be at least a
complementary approach to CMTs reporting.</p>

between tissue microbiota and tumor progression in early-stage papillary
thyroid carcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEmerging evidences suggest that microorganisms in the
tumor microenvironment play important roles in tumor occurrence and
progression. However, the microbial distribution in the papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissue and its relationship with PTC are
unclear.MethodsWe performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and RNA-Seq to
characterize the tissue microbiome and transcriptome between the tumor
and paracancerous tissue, respectively. The association analysis between
microbes and host gene expression were conducted to screen the potential
microbe-gene/cell interactions.ResultsWe found that the tumor tissues
indeed harbored complex microbial communities, which showed significant
differences in microbial and functional composition between the tumor
and para-cancerous tissues. A set of differential microbial genera were
identified to be significantly associated with the clinical factors,
such as Planococcus enriched in tumor tissue, Limnobacter in T1a stage
and Cutibacterium in N1b stage. 793 differential expressed genes were
also identified, which are mainly enriched with functions related to
cell-cell communication and extracellular matrix. In terms of the immune
cell composition, 8 differential immune cell types were further
identified, suggesting a significant immune response in PTC. Finally,
association analysis identified 5 pairs of microbe-gene association and
1 pair of microbe-cell with significance, which were all involved in the
tumorigenesis and tumor progression via inflammation-related
pathways.ConclusionsIn addition to characterizing the tissue microbiome
and host gene expression in PTC patients, we further explored the roles
of microbe-gene/cell interactions in PTC. The results provide candidate
biomarkers for exploring the molecular mechanisms of tissue microbiome
in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of PTC.</p>

<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread, tick-borne
viral infection present in many African countries. Its epidemiology and
impact on public health remain poorly understood in Cameroon. The main
objective of the current study was to investigate the circulation of
CCHF virus (CCHFV) in ruminants (cattle and goats), humans, and ticks
collected simultaneously in a study area of Akonolinga, a health

a cross-sectional study was conducted in Akonolinga, by collecting
survey data and serum samples (from humans, goats, and cattle) and
picking ticks from cattle and goats. This study included 100 randomly
selected households from eight localities. Data were also collected
using questionnaires to assess CCHFV seropositivity-associated factors.
Individual characteristics of 189 goats and 246 cattle were collected
and the data geo-referenced. To assess the prevalence of CCHF,
serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and molecular
(real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR) methods were used to detect
antibodies targeting CCHF viral nucleoprotein and CCHFV-specific RNA in
collected sera, respectively. The presence of CCHFV-specific RNA was
also assessed in tick homogenate using real-time RT PCR. The overall
CCHFV seroprevalence was 1.9% [95% CI (1.02%–3.64%)] in humans, 10.9% [n
= 42; 95% CI (8.15%–14.38%)] in cattle, and 3.38% [n = 5; 95% CI
(1.45%–7.66%)] in goats. Seroprevalence in cattle increased
significantly with age. A total of 554 ticks were collected from 162 of
the 386 (42%) cattle examined, with Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus
being the dominant species. CCHFV RNA was detected in two sera of women
sampled. Phylogenetic analysis of a small portion of the L segment
classified the strain within the African genotype III. This study
reported, for the first time, the proven exposure of the human
population to CCHFV in central Cameroon, showing strong evidence that
CCHFV is infecting humans. Serological analyses revealed exposure of
cattle and goats to CCHFV-strains collected in the same geographical
area. These results demonstrate the potential risk of CCHF emergence in
the human population, especially in rural areas in close vicinity with
animals.</p>

gingivalis-induced periodontitis promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal
loss associated with dysfunction of the brain barrier</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIn our previous study, Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.
gingivalis)-induced periodontitis caused cognitive impairment which was
associated with abnormal amyloid β (Aβ) metabolite in the brain. The
brain barrier is critical in maintaining homeostasis, controlling influx
and efflux transport and regulating waste clearance. However, the
specific role of the brain barrier in linking periodontitis to cognitive
function remains unclear.MethodsA murine model of periodontitis-induced
cognitive impairment was constructed via oral topical application of P.
gingivalis. Neuroinflammation was observed by detecting the expression
of proinflammatory cytokines and glia activation. Western blot (WB),
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to
detect the expression of tau-related molecules and neuronal loss. WB,
Evans blue staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) function including the infiltration of P.
gingivalis and immune cells, and BBB permeability. The changes of
meningeal lymphatic drainage were observed using an in vivo animal
imaging system and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR). The effect of P. gingivalis on lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs) was further verified using IF and RT-PCR.ResultsP.
gingivalis-induced periodontitis exacerbated cognitive impairment by the
upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and glia activation. In the
brain of periodontitis mice, p-Akt and p-GSK3β levels were reduced,
leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss including cell
bodies and neurites. P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis enhanced BBB
permeability, promoted P. gingivalis and immune cell infiltration, and
downregulated the expression of Occludin and ZO-1. In addition, the
meningeal lymphatic drainage was impaired and the mRNA levels of
lymphangiogenesis-related factor LYVE1 were decreased in the dura matter
of periodontitis mice. After P. gingivalis infection, the inflammatory
response was increased, and LYVE1 and ZO1 expression was decreased in
LECs.ConclusionsPeriodontitis aggravated neuroinflammation and neuronal
loss which was associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. The impaired
meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLV) and disrupted BBB affected the brain
barrier function, further inhibiting the clearance of pathogenic
substances and enhancing immune cell infiltration in periodontitis mice.
These results indicated that brain barrier dysfunction may be the link
between periodontitis and cognitive impairment.</p>

multi-omics study of magnesium sulfate to improve prognosis in
sepsis-related encephalopathy: integrating clinical data-driven network
pharmacology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) constitutes a
significant neurological manifestation of sepsis, characterized by high
mortality rates and posing a critical threat to patient outcomes.
Magnesium sulfate has multiple effects in the nervous system, including
neuroprotection, sedation, anticonvulsant activity, enhanced
neuroplasticity, anti - inflammation and promotion of nerve repair. It
can regulate calcium homeostasis, exert antioxidant effects, and reduce
the release of inflammatory factors, thereby alleviating neuronal damage
and neurological deficits. This study integrated MIMIC-IV database and
network pharmacology to explore magnesium sulfate’s neuroprotective
mechanisms and clinical impact on SAE outcomes.MethodsRetrospective data
from 4,650 SAE patients in MIMIC-IV 3.0 were analyzed. Propensity score
matching balanced covariates. Cox models and Kaplan-Meier curves
evaluated magnesium sulfate’s association with 28-day all-cause
mortality (ACM). Network pharmacology identified magnesium sulfate’s
core targets and pathways.Results4183 patients (89.96%) received
magnesium sulfate during ICU, while 467 (10.04%) did not receive. The
28-day ACM in patients with SAE was 11.05%. After propensity score
matching participants with and without magnesium sulfate administration
had 28-day ACM of 17.29% and 30.42%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001).
Magnesium sulfate administration was associated with reduced 28-day ACM.
Subgroup analysis revealed this association differed in several
stratification. Network pharmacology revealed magnesium sulfate targets
TNF, IL6, IL1B and CXCL8, modulating pathways including inflammatory
response, immune regulation, and cellular stress.ConclusionsMagnesium
sulfate use correlates with improved SAE survival, particularly those
with comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute kidney
injury, and using vasoconstrictors, likely through multi-target
modulation of inflammatory response and immune regulation. Prospective
studies are needed for validation.</p>

respiratory tract co-infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and
respiratory syncytial virus shapes microbial landscape and clinical
outcomes in children</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundLower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), which are most
commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), pose a substantial global health burden in
children. However, the causal pathways of bacterial-viral co-infections,
particularly the mechanisms by which commensal microbiota could modulate
SP-RSV-associated LRTI outcomes remain to be elucidated.MethodsA
population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on children aged
0–18 years who were admitted to Beijing Children’s Hospital and Baoding
Children’s Hospital in China from September 2021 to August 2022.
Children with LRTI who underwent respiratory pathogen testing were
divided into SP single infection and SP-RSV co-infection groups, with
sex- and time-matched non-LRTI children as controls. Sputum and LRT
secretion samples were collected for microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA
sequencing, and child characteristics were obtained from medical records
and pharmacy data.ResultsA total of 125 children with LRTI (84 with SP
infection and 41 with SP-RSV co-infection) and 87 children without LRTI
were recruited for this study. We found that LRT microbiota composition
was strongly related to age, with a more pronounced increase in Shannon
index within the first 5 years of life. Children with SP and RSV
infection exhibited significantly altered microbiota composition in
comparison to children without LRTI, particularly a higher abundance of
Streptococcus. The competitive interactions among respiratory bacteria
were found to be more complex in the SP single-infection group and
simpler in the SP-RSV co-infection group.ConclusionOur findings show
that RSV co-infection exacerbates SP-induced LRTI microbiota disorder
and disease severity. This study may help us to better understand the
characteristics of SP-RSV interaction and provide direction for the
pathogen diagnosis of LRTI.</p>

comprehensive evaluation of a novel targeted-sequencing workflow for
Mycobacterium species identification and anti-tuberculosis
drug-resistance detection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAlthough several World Health Organization–endorsed
targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) assays exist for tuberculosis
(TB) drug-resistance detection, their target selection and diagnostic
accuracy vary widely. In this study, we developed a novel tNGS workflow
(the TB Pro assay) and evaluated its performance in identifying
Mycobacterium species and predicting drug resistance.MethodsThe TB Pro
assay was validated for identifying 10 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex (MTBC) and 39 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species, as
well as predicting resistance to 4 first-line and 13 second-line anti-TB
drugs. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined using 11 reference
strains spiked in sputum. The prediction of resistance to
anti-tuberculous drugs/drug classes was compared with phenotypic drug
susceptibility testing (pDST) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using
435 clinical isolates.ResultsThe assay demonstrated high sensitivity
with a calculated LOD of 3.0 CFU/ml for MTB and 1.4–16.2 CFU/ml for most
NTMs, except for Mycobacterium intracellulare with 117.9 CFU/ml. Using
pDST as the reference standard, the sensitivity of the TB Pro assay for
the detection of resistance ranged from 74.3% (ethambutol) to 94.4%
(rifampicin), with specificity values &gt;98% for all drugs. Compared
with WGS, the sensitivity of the TB Pro assay was over 98.0% for all
drugs except pyrazinamide (66.7%), and the specificity values were all
nearly 100.0%. Directly on sputum, the TB Pro assay showed 100%
agreement with smear- and culture-positive sputum
specimens.ConclusionsThe TB Pro assay represents a sensitive and
specific solution for simultaneous mycobacterial identification and
comprehensive drug-resistance profiling, performing robustly on both
cultured isolates and direct clinical specimens.</p>
