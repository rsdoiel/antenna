adaptation to fluconazole: comparative insights into tolerance and
resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntifungal resistance and tolerance are distinct
responses exhibited by fungi when exposed to drugs. While considerable
research has focused on azole tolerance in the human pathogen Candida
albicans, studies in other fungal species remain limited.ObjectiveThis
study aims to conduct a comparative investigation of the adaptation of
the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans to
fluconazole in vitro.MethodsWe performed experiments using laboratory
strains of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans to evaluate their fluconazole
tolerance and resistance under varying temperature conditions. High
concentrations of fluconazole were administered, and subsequent changes
in fungal phenotypes were analyzed through techniques such as
transcriptome analysis and monitoring of petite formation.ResultsOur
results revealed that fluconazole tolerance is present in wild-type
strains of S. cerevisiae and is influenced by temperature, albeit in a
manner opposite to that observed in C. albicans. Importantly, when
subjected to high concentrations of fluconazole, S. cerevisiae strains
developed resistance without displaying tolerance; all resistant
adaptors identified were petites. Chemical induction of petite formation
led to an increase in resistance accompanied by a decrease in
tolerance.ConclusionTranscriptome analysis indicated that petites
up-regulated efflux mechanisms while down-regulating most ERG genes.
This suggests that, unlike petite-negative C. albicans, petite-positive
S. cerevisiae swiftly transitions to a petite phenotype upon exposure to
fluconazole, resulting in enhanced resistance but diminished tolerance.
This evolutionary divergence emphasizes the need for additional studies
on fluconazole tolerance in other pathogenic fungi.</p>

of multidrug-resistant bacteria and their molecular mechanisms found in
small animal veterinary practices in Portugal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIntensive medical care provided in companion animal
practices carries the potential risk of selecting and disseminating
multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). However, data on infection,
prevention and control standards specific to small animal veterinary
practices (SAVPs) remains limited. The goal of our work was to evaluate
the environmental contamination and staff carriage by MDROs in
veterinary practices across Portugal.MethodsFourteen SAVPs were
enrolled. Environmental samples were collected from critical areas such
as operating room, wards and pre-operative area. Veterinary team members
voluntarily gave nasal, hand and rectal swabs. All samples were screened
for the presence of, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-
and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRS). Whole-genome sequencing
was performed for carbapenem resistant strains.ResultsEnvironmental
evaluation by surface swabs revealed that 6.5% (n=32/490) were
contaminated with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter spp. (n=5) and IMP-8-producing
Pseudomonas juntendi (n=2) strains were described on different locations
of different SAVPs. Moreover, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=12) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3) strains were also found on multiple
surfaces of different SAVPs. Three human samples (two rectal, one hand)
had carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains by OprD mutations, while
S. maltophilia strains were recovered from four samples (two rectal, two
hands). One nasal swab was positive for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae ST11. Only one SAVP surface was positive for the newly typed
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST9220-II. MRSA
nasal carriage was found in 14% of samples (n=9/64), with an equal
prevalence of ST22-IV and ST8-VI. As for hand samples, MRSA was present
in 10.7% (n=4/38), with a predominance of ST8-VI.DiscussionThese
emerging data indicate that SAVPs may significantly contribute to the
dissemination of MDROs. To address this, rigorous infection, prevention
and control (IPC) measures should be implemented, alongside educational
workshops directed to all veterinary staff as well as to veterinary and
nursing students.</p>

id="apoptosis-inhibitor-of-macrophage-suppress-immune-responses-via-il-10-production-and-delay-bacterial-clearance-in-mycobacterium-avium-infection">Apoptosis
inhibitor of macrophage suppress immune responses via IL-10 production
and delay bacterial clearance in Mycobacterium avium infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections, including Mycobacterium
avium, are increasingly recognized as a growing public health concern,
even among immunocompetent individuals. These infections are a
significant cause of chronic pulmonary disease, and they are
characterized by the formation of foamy macrophages (FMs) that
facilitate bacterial persistence. Previously, we reported that apoptosis
inhibitor of macrophage (AIM), a protein secreted by macrophages,
promotes lipid droplet accumulation in M. avium-infected macrophages.
However, the precise role of AIM in modulating immune responses remains
unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of AIM on FM
formation, bacterial burden, and immune response in M. avium-infected
mice by comparing AIM knockout (KO) mice with wild-type mice.
Histological analysis revealed a reduction in FM formation in AIM KO
mice, accompanied by decreased lipid droplet accumulation and altered
expression of lipid metabolism-related genes. Furthermore, AIM KO mice
exhibited a reduced bacterial load in the lungs, highlighting decreased
cytokine production, including IL-1β, compared to wild-type mice. In
addition, the analysis of the immune cells of AIM KO mice using flow
cytometry revealed an increase in M1 macrophages and IFN-γ-producing T
cells, as well as a decrease in M2 macrophages and interleukin 10
(IL-10)-producing T cells. The reduced expression of CD36 and PD-L1 in
macrophages from AIM KO mice further supports the skewing toward an M1
phenotype. In vitro experiments with bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) confirmed reduced bacterial growth and lipid droplet formation
in AIM KO BMDMs, which was restored by AIM and IL-10 treatment. These
findings suggest that AIM contributes to the promotion of FM formation
by establishing an immunosuppressive environment that promotes the
establishment of M. avium through IL-10 production.</p>
