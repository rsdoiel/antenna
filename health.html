Stones?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: The Kidney Dietitian</p>
<p>
Is this true? Can drinking soda cause kidney stones? Are dark sodas
worse than others? Unfortunately, yes. Drinks that are sweetened with
sugar, such as soda, are associated with an increased risk of kidney
stones. Diet cola may also cause stone formation. However, non-cola diet
soda may have some beneficial ingredients. Read on to learn […]

endogenous retroviruses and exogenous viral infections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The human genome harbors many endogenous retroviral elements, known
as human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which have been integrated
into the genome during evolution due to infections by exogenous
retroviruses. Accounting for up to 8% of the human genome, HERVs are
tightly regulated by the host and are implicated in various
physiological and pathological processes. Aberrant expression of HERVs
has been observed in numerous studies on exogenous viral infections. In
this review, we focus on elucidating the potential roles of HERVs during
various exogenous viral infections and further discuss their
implications in antiviral immunity.</p>

evolution of fluconazole resistance and tolerance in Candida
glabrata</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWith the growing population of immunocompromised
individuals, opportunistic fungal pathogens pose a global health threat.
Candida species, particularly C. albicans and non-albicans Candida
species such as C. glabrata, are the most prevalent pathogenic fungi.
Azoles, especially fluconazole, are widely used therapeutic
options.ObjectiveThis study investigates how C. glabrata adapts to
fluconazole, with a focus on understanding the factors regulating
fluconazole tolerance and its relationship to resistance.MethodsThis
study compared the factors regulating fluconazole tolerance between C.
albicans and C. glabrata. We analyzed the impact of temperature on
fluconazole tolerance, and requirement of calcineurin and Hsp90 for
maintenance of fluconazole tolerance. We isolated colonies from edge,
inside and outside of inhibition zone in disk diffusion assays. And we
exposed C. glabrata strain to high concentrations of fluconazole and
investigated the mutants for development of fluconazole resistance and
tolerance.ResultsWe found temperature modulated tolerance in the
opposite way in C. albicans strain YJB-T1891 and C. glabrata strain CG4.
Calcineurin and Hsp90 were required for maintenance of fluconazole
tolerance in both species. Colonies from inside and outside of
inhibition zones did not exhibited mutated phenotype, but colonies
isolated from edge of inhibition zone exhibited diverse phenotype
changes. Moreover, we discovered that high concentrations (16-128 μg/mL)
of fluconazole induce the simultaneous but parallel development of
tolerance and resistance in C. glabrata, unlike the sole development of
tolerance in C. albicans.ConclusionThis study highlights that while
tolerance to fluconazole is a common response in Candida species, the
specific molecular mechanisms and evolutionary pathways that lead to
this response vary between species. Our findings emphasize the
importance of understanding the regulation of fluconazole tolerance in
different Candida species to develop effective therapeutic
strategies.</p>

of Thitarodes host genes influences dimorphic transition of
Ophiocordyceps sinensis in the host hemolymph</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The Chinese cordyceps, a unique parasitic complex of
Thitarodes/Hepialus ghost moths and Ophiocordyceps sinensis fungus in
the Tibetan Plateau, is a highly valuable biological resource for
medicine and health foods in Asian countries. Efficient system for
artificial cultivation of Chinese cordyceps relies on understanding the
gene functions involved in the induction of growing blastospores into
hyphae in the larval hemolymph of insect host, during O. sinensis
infection. Transcriptome analysis and ribonucleic acid interference (RNA
interference) method were employed to identify the key differentially
expressed genes and to demonstrate their functions in Thitarodes
xiaojinensis. Key larval genes critical for O. sinensis blastospore
development or filamentation were identified. Nine of the 20 top
upregulated genes encoded cuticles proteins, indicating that these
proteins highly activated when the larval hemolymph was full of
blastospores. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of five larval
genes such as Flightin, larval cuticle protein LCP-30, 26-hydroxylase
(CYP18A1), cuticle protein 18.6, isoform B, and probable chitinase 3
significantly stimulated the dimorphic transition from blastospores to
prehyphae in O. sinensis in the larval hemolymph after 120 h after
injection. The expressions of these genes determined by quantitative
real-time PCR were suppressed in various levels from 38.64% to 91.54%,
compared to the controls. These results demonstrated that injection of
the siRNAs of key upregulated genes into the larval hemolymph containing
high load of blastospores caused the gene silence in T. xiaojinensis
larvae and induced the fungal transition from blastospores to prehyphae,
providing novel knowledge on the regulation of O. sinensis fungal
dimorphism by Thitarodes host and cues for further study of Thitarodes
biology and commercial cultivation of Chinese cordyceps.</p>

progress of traditional Chinese medicine on the treatment of diarrhea by
regulating intestinal microbiota and its metabolites based on
renal-intestinal axis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Intestinal microbiota and its metabolites are involved in many
physiological processes of the human body and play a vital role in
maintaining human health. The occurrence of kidney disease can cause
intestinal microbiota imbalance, resulting in diarrhea. The change of
intestinal microbiota and its metabolites content can aggravate renal
function injury, which has a bidirectional regulating effect. The theory
of renal-intestinal axis further clarified that the impaired renal
function is related to the imbalance of intestinal microorganisms, and
the impaired intestinal barrier is related to the accumulation of toxin
products. Because of its unique therapeutic advantages, Traditional
Chinese Medicine can treat diarrhea by enhancing the growth of
beneficial bacteria, inhibiting pathogenic bacteria and immune
regulation, and slow down the continuous deterioration of kidney
disease. This paper focuses on the relationship between intestinal
microbiota and its metabolites and diarrhea, the influence of
Traditional Chinese Medicine on intestinal microbiota in the treatment
of diarrhea, and the role of intestinal microbiota and its metabolites
in the renal-intestinal axis. It provides a theoretical basis for
Traditional Chinese Medicine to regulate intestinal microbiota and its
metabolites based on the renal-intestinal axis theory to treat
nephrology-induced diarrhea, and also provides a new idea and method for
Traitional Chinese Medicine to treat nephrology-induced diarrhea.</p>

a retromer component, is a key factor in secretion, motility, and tissue
invasion by Entamoeba histolytica</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In humans and Drosophila melanogaster, the functional convergence of
the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery
that is in charge of selecting ubiquitinated proteins for sorting into
multivesicular bodies, and the retromer, that is the complex responsible
for protein recycling to the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus. ESCRT
and retromer complexes are codependent for protein sorting recycling,
degradation, and secretion. In this article, we studied the EhVps35 C
isoform (referred to as EhVps35), that is the central member of the
Entamoeba histolytica retromer, and its relation with the ESCRT
machinery during sorting and protein recycling events and their
involvement virulence. Our findings revealed that EhVps35 interacts with
at least 300 proteins that participate in multiple cellular processes.
Laser confocal and transmission electronic microscopy images, as well as
secretion assays, revealed that EhVps35 is secreted in vesicles together
with EhVps23 and EhADH (both ESCRT machinery proteins). In addition,
immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and molecular docking assays
revealed the relationship among EhVps35 and other ESCRT machinery
proteins. Red blood cell stimulus increased EhVps35 secretion, and the
knockdown of the Ehvps35 gene in trophozoites reduced their capacity to
migrate and invade tissues. This also impacts the cellular localization
of ubiquitin, EhVps23 (ESCRT-I), and EhVps32 (ESCRT-III) proteins,
strongly suggesting their functional relationship. Our results, taken
together, give evidence that EhVps35 is a key factor in E. histolytica
virulence mechanisms and that it, together with the ESCRT machinery
components and other regulatory proteins, is involved in vesicle
trafficking, secretion, migration, and cell proliferation.</p>

SUMO-specific proteases regulate HAdV-C5 E1B-55K SUMOylation and
virus-induced cell transformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Various viral proteins are post-translationally modified by
SUMO-conjugation during the human adenovirus (HAdV) replication cycle.
This modification leads to diverse consequences for target proteins as
it influences their intracellular localization or cell transformation
capabilities. SUMOylated HAdV proteins include the multifunctional
oncoprotein E1B-55K. Our previous research, along with that of others,
has demonstrated a substantial influence of yet another adenoviral
oncoprotein, E4orf6, on E1B-55K SUMOylation levels. Protein SUMOylation
can be reversed by cellular sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs). In
this study, we investigated the interaction of E1B-55K with cellular
SENPs to understand deSUMOylation activities and their consequences for
cell transformation mediated by this adenoviral oncoprotein. We show
that E1B-55K interacts with and is deSUMOylated by SENP 1, independently
of E4orf6. Consistent with these results, we found that SENP 1 prevents
E1A/E1B-dependent focus formation in rodent cells. We anticipate these
findings to be the groundwork for future studies on adenovirus-host
interactions, the mechanisms that underlie E1B-55K SUMOylation, as well
as the role of this major adenoviral oncoprotein in HAdV-mediated cell
transformation.</p>

and genomic characterization of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales
bloodstream infections in patients with hematologic malignancies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCarbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) bloodstream
infections (BSIs) pose a significant risk to patients with hematologic
malignancies, yet the distinct features and outcomes of these infections
are not thoroughly understood.MethodsThis retrospective study examined
the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with
Enterobacterales BSIs at the Hematology Department of Fujian Medical
University Union Hospital from 2018 to 2022. Whole-genome sequencing was
conducted on 45 consecutive CRE BSI isolates during this period.ResultsA
total of 301 patients with Enterobacterales BSIs were included, with 65
(21.6%) cases of CRE and 236 (78.4%) cases of carbapenem-susceptible
Enterobacterales (CSE). CRE infections accounted for 16.9% to 26.9% of
all Enterobacterales BSIs, and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae (CRKP) was the predominant strain. The most frequent sequence
type (ST) and carbapenemase among CRKP were ST11 (68.6%) and blaKPC-2
(80.0%), respectively. Perianal infections, multiple infection foci, and
a history of multiple hospitalizations, ICU stays, and prior CRE
infections were identified as risk factors for CRE BSIs. Patients in the
CRE group experienced significantly higher proportions of
infection-related septic shock (43.1% vs. 19.9%, P &lt; 0.0003) and
30-day all-cause mortality (56.9% vs. 24.6%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared to
those in the CSE group. Patient’s age and disease subtypes, strain
subtypes, and antimicrobial treatment regimens significantly influenced
survival in patients with CRE BSIs.ConclusionsCRE BSIs are a frequent
complication in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing
treatment and are associated with poor survival rates. A comprehensive
understanding of risk factors and ongoing surveillance of prevalent
strains are essential for the effective management of these
infections.</p>

gut microbiota: emerging biomarkers and potential treatments for
infertility-related diseases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Infertility is a disease of impaired fertility. With socioeconomic
development, changes in human lifestyles, and increased environmental
pollution, the problem of low human fertility has become increasingly
prominent. The incidence of global infertility is increasing every year.
Many factors lead to infertility, and common female factors include
tubal factors, ovulation disorders, endometriosis, and immune factors.
The gut microbiota is involved in many physiological processes, such as
nutrient absorption, intestinal mucosal growth, glycolipid metabolism,
and immune system regulation. An altered gut flora is associated with
female infertility disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),
endometriosis (EMs), and premature ovarian failure (POF). Dysbiosis of
the gut microbiota directly or indirectly contributes to the development
of female infertility disorders, which also affect the homeostasis of
the gut microbiota. Identifying the etiology and pathogenesis of
infertility in patients is the focus of reproductive medicine
physicians. We studied the developmental mechanism between the gut
microbiota and PCOS, EMs, and POF from a new perspective, providing new
ideas for diagnosing and treating female infertility diseases and
specific reference values for eugenics.</p>

<p>Sepsis, a disease with high incidence, mortality, and treatment
costs, has a complex interaction with the gut microbiota. With advances
in high-throughput sequencing technology, the relationship between
sepsis and intestinal dysbiosis has become a new research focus.
However, owing to the intricate interplay between critical illness and
clinical interventions, it is challenging to establish a causal
relationship between sepsis and intestinal microbiota imbalance. In this
review, the correlation between intestinal microecology and sepsis was
summarized, and new therapies for sepsis intervention based on
microecological target therapy were proposed, and the shortcomings of
bacterial selection and application timing in clinical practice were
addressed. In conclusion, current studies on metabolomics, genomics and
other aspects aimed at continuously discovering potential probiotics are
all providing theoretical basis for restoring intestinal flora
homeostasis for subsequent treatment of sepsis.</p>

drugs successfully repurposed against Leishmania based on machine
learning predictions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Drug repurposing is a promising approach towards the discovery of
novel treatments against Neglected Tropical Diseases, such as
Leishmaniases, presenting the advantage of reducing both costs and
duration of the drug discovery process. In previous work, our group
developed a Machine Learning pipeline for the repurposing of
FDA-approved drugs against Leishmania parasites. The present study is
focused on an in vitro validation of this approach by assessing the
antileishmanial effects of 10 predicted drug candidates. First, we
evaluated the drugs’ activity against promastigotes from two strains of
L. infantum and one of L. major, which caused distinct clinical
manifestations, using an MTT assay. The standard anti-Leishmania drug
Amphotericin B was used as a positive control. Five molecules
demonstrated anti-Leishmania effects, out of which Acebutolol,
Prilocaine and Phenylephrine are described herein for the first time.
When tested on promastigote growth, Acebutolol displayed IC50 values
ranging from 69.28 to 145.53 µg/mL. Prilocaine exhibited IC50 values
between 33.10 and 45.81 µg/mL. Phenylephrine, on the other hand,
presented IC50 values &gt;200 µg/mL. The two remaining drugs, Dibucaine
and Domperidone, exhibited significantly low IC50 values varying between
0.58 and 1.05 µg/mL, and 6.30 and 8.17 µg/mL, respectively. Both
compounds were previously described as anti-Leishmania agents in vivo.
All five compounds demonstrated no notable cytotoxic effects on
THP-1-derived macrophages at the IC50 concentrations, allowing for their
testing on the intracellular form of L. major and L. infantum parasites.
Interestingly, all compounds exhibited antileishmanial activity on
amastigotes with enhanced IC50 values compared to the corresponding
promastigotes. Noticeably, Dibucaine and Domperidone displayed IC50
values of at most 1.99 µg/mL. Acebutolol, Prilocaine and Phenylephrine
showed IC50 values ranging from 13.84 to 66.81 µg/mL. Our previously
published Computer-Aided repositioning pipelines of FDA-approved drugs
as antileishmanial agents identified Dibucaine and Domperidone as
candidates in support of previous in vivo studies. This study
consolidates such findings through the in vitro validation against 2
Leishmania species, highly prevalent in Africa and Middle East, and
reveals Acebutolol, Prilocaine, and Phenylephrine as novel
anti-Leishmania effectors, confirming the relevance of our approach and
calling for further investigations.</p>

characteristics of BTLA/HVEM axis expression on Tregs and its impact on
the expansion and attributes of Tregs in patients with active pulmonary
tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) remains one of the deadliest
infectious diseases. Understanding PTB immunity is of potential value
for exploring immunotherapy for treating chemotherapy-resistant PTB.
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key players that impair
immune responses to Mycobacteria tuberculosis (MTB). Currently, the
intrinsic factors governing Treg expansion and influencing the
immunosuppressive attributes of Tregs in PTB patients are far from
clear.MethodsHere, we employed flow cytometry to determine the frequency
of Tregs and the expression of B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and
its ligand, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), on Tregs in patients with
active PTB. Furthermore, the expression of conventional T cells and of
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) on Tregs
in patients with active PTB was determined. We then examined the
characteristics of BTLA/HVEM expression and its correlation with Treg
frequency and PD-L1 and PD-1 expression on Tregs in PTB
patients.ResultsThe frequency of Tregs was increased in PTB patients and
it had a relevance to PTB progression. Intriguingly, the axis of
cosignal molecules, BTLA and HVEM, were both downregulated on the Tregs
of PTB patients compared with healthy controls (HCs), which was the
opposite of their upregulation on conventional T cells. Unexpectedly,
their expression levels were positively correlated with the frequency of
Tregs, respectively. These seemingly contradictory results may be
interpreted as follows: the downregulation of BTLA and HVEM may
alleviate BTLA/HVEM cis-interaction-mediated coinhibitory signals
pressing on naïve Tregs, helping their activation, while the BTLA/HVEM
axis on effector Tregs induces a costimulatory signal, promoting their
expansion. Certainly, the mechanism underlying such complex effects
remains to be explored. Additionally, PD-L1 and PD-1, regarded as two of
the markers characterizing the immunosuppressive attributes and
differentiation potential of Tregs, were upregulated on the Tregs of PTB
patients. Further analysis revealed that the expression levels of BTLA
and HVEM were positively correlated with the frequency of PD-1+Tregs and
PD-L1+Tregs, respectively.ConclusionOur study illuminated distinct
characteristics of BTLA/HVEM axis expression on Tregs and uncovered its
impact on the expansion and attributes of Tregs in patients with active
PTB. Therefore, blockade of the BTLA/HVEM axis may be a promising
potential pathway to reduce Treg expansion for the improvement of
anti-MTB immune responses.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases represent a significant global health challenge,
with bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasitic protozoa being significant
causative agents. The shared symptoms among diseases and the emergence
of new pathogen variations make diagnosis and treatment complex.
Conventional diagnostic methods are laborious and intricate,
underscoring the need for rapid, accurate techniques. Aptamer-based
technologies offer a promising solution, as they are cost-effective,
sensitive, specific, and convenient for molecular disease diagnosis.
Aptamers, which are single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences, serve as
nucleotide equivalents of monoclonal antibodies, displaying high
specificity and affinity for target molecules. They are structurally
robust, allowing for long-term storage without substantial activity
loss. Aptamers find applications in diverse fields such as drug
screening, material science, and environmental monitoring. In
biomedicine, they are extensively studied for biomarker detection,
diagnostics, imaging, and targeted therapy. This comprehensive review
focuses on the utility of aptamers in managing infectious diseases,

<p>Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by decreased bone mineral density
(BMD) and increased fracture risk, poses a significant global health
burden. Recent research has shed light on the bidirectional relationship
between gut microbiota (GM) and bone health, presenting a novel avenue
for understanding OP pathogenesis and developing targeted therapeutic

GM-bone axis, exploring the impact of GM on OP development and
management. We elucidate established risk factors and pathogenesis of
OP, delve into the diversity and functional changes of GM in OP.
Furthermore, we examine experimental evidence and clinical observations
linking alterations in GM composition or function with variations in BMD
and fracture risk. Mechanistic insights into microbial mediators of bone
health, such as microbial metabolites and products, are discussed.
Therapeutic implications, including GM-targeted interventions and
dietary strategies, are also explored. Finally, we identify future
research directions and challenges in translating these findings into

insights into UTIs: from pathophysiology to precision diagnosis and
management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common infectious
disease, predominantly impacting women with 150 million individuals
affected globally. It increases the socio-economic burden of society and
is mainly caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., and Staphylococcus spp. The severity of
the infection correlates with the host factors varying from acute to
chronic infections. Even with a high incidence rate, the diagnosis is
mainly based on the symptoms, dipstick analysis, and culture analysis,
which are time-consuming, labour-intensive, and lacking sensitivity and
specificity. During this period, medical professionals prescribe
empirical antibiotics, which may increase the antimicrobial resistance
rate. Timely and precise UTI diagnosis is essential for addressing
antibiotic resistance and improving overall quality of life. In response
to these challenges, new techniques are emerging. The review provides a
comprehensive overview of the global burden of UTIs, associated risk
factors, implicated organisms, traditional and innovative diagnostic
methods, and approaches to UTI treatment and prevention.</p>

real time PCR for distinction between Pneumocystis jirovecii
infection/colonization in hospitalized patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIdentification of the opportunistic fungus Pneumocystis
jirovecii in respiratory specimens presents challenges, particularly in
differentiating between colonization and active infection. The present
study assessed a probe-based real time PCR (qPCR) diagnostic
effectiveness in patients with diverse underlying conditions,
particularly those with COVID-19 and pulmonary insufficiency.MethodsTo
set up the qPCR, clinical samples from 281 patients with respiratory
ailments were tested. Subsequently, a descriptive study was conducted on
112 patients with pulmonary insufficiency with and without COVID-19
suspected of P. jirovecii infection. All specimens were subjected to DNA
extraction followed by nested PCR and qPCR targeting the mitochondrial
large subunit (mtLSU)-rRNA gene.ResultsBased on nested PCR and qPCR, P.
jirovecii was identified in 40 out of 281 patients, with slight
variations in positive samples observed across dilutions. Three patients
who tested positive in nested PCR yielded negative results in
probe-based qPCR. Conversely, three patients who tested positive in
probe-based qPCR yielded negative results in nested PCR. Considering
nested PCR as the golden standard, probe-based qPCR demonstrated good
diagnostic performance, with 92.5% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity.
Based on cycle threshold (Ct) values, the positive cases were
categorized: ≤32 as infection, &gt;35 as colonization, and a grey zone
between these values (32 &lt; X ≤ 35). The analysis of 112 PCP-suspected
patients revealed a prevalence ranging from 6.25% (nested PCR) to 7%
(probe-based qPCR).ConclusionsThis study suggested Ct values to
differentiate Pneumocystis pneumonia/colonization in immunocompromised
patients. To further augment the diagnostic sensitivity, it is
recommended to integrate qPCR results with clinical parameters and
biomarkers to offer a more precise understanding of Pneumocystis-related
conditions.</p>

of vaginal microbiota with the onset, severity, and type of symptoms of
genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGenitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes the
symptoms and signs resulting from the effect of estrogen deficiency on
the female genitourinary tract, including genital, urinary, and sexual
symptoms. However, besides estrogen deficiency, little is known about
the etiology of GSM. The objective of this study was to investigate the
effects of vaginal microbiota dysbiosis on the occurrence and
development of GSM in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.MethodsIn
total, 96 women were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and clinical
data were collected. GSM symptoms were divided into three types:
genital, urological, and sexual symptoms. Full-length 16S rRNA gene
sequencing using the third-generation PacBio sequencing technology was
performed to analyze the vaginal microbiome using vaginal swabs of
non-GSM and GSM women with different types of GSM symptoms. Live
Lactobacillus Capsule for Vaginal Use (LLCVU) treatment was used to
verify the effects of Lactobacillus on GSM symptoms.ResultsWe found that
83.58% (56/67) of women experienced GSM symptoms in the perimenopausal
and postmenopausal stages. Among these women with GSM, 23.21% (13/56),
23.21% (13/56), and 53.57% (30/56) had one type, two types, and three
types of GSM symptoms, respectively. The richness and diversity of
vaginal microbiota gradually increased from reproductive to
postmenopausal women. There were significant differences in vaginal
microbial community among non-GSM women and GSM women with different
types of symptoms. Lactobacillus was found to be negatively associated
with the onset, severity, and type of GSM while some bacteria, such as
Escherichia-shigella, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Enterococcus,
Peptoniphilus_harei, and Streptococcus, were found to be positively
associated with these aspects of GSM, and these bacteria were especially
associated with the types of genital and sexual symptoms in GSM women.
LLCVU significantly relieved genital symptoms and improved the sexual
life of GSM women in shortterm observation.ConclusionsThe onset,
severity, and type of GSM symptoms may be associated with changes in
vaginal microbiota in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Vaginal
microbiota dysbiosis probably contributes to the occurrence and
development of GSMsymptoms, especially vaginal and sexual symptoms.
Lactobacillus used in the vagina may be a possible option for
non-hormonal treatment of GSM women with genital and sexual
symptoms.Clinical Trial

relationship between gut microbiota and insulin-like growth factor 1: a
bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe causal relationship between gut microbiota and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) remains unclear. The purpose of
this study was to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota
and IGF-1 in men and women.MethodsSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
related to gut microbiota were derived from pooled statistics from large
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) published by the MiBioGen
consortium. Pooled data for IGF-1 were obtained from a large published
GWAS. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, primarily
using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. Additionally, we
performed sensitivity analyses to enhance the robustness of our results,
focusing on assessing heterogeneity and pleiotropy.ResultsIn forward MR
analysis, 11 bacterial taxa were found to have a causal effect on IGF-1
in men; 14 bacterial taxa were found to have a causal effect on IGF-1 in
women (IVW, all P &lt; 0.05). After false discovery rate (FDR)
correction, all bacterial traits failed to pass the FDR correction. In
reverse MR analysis, IGF-1 had a causal effect on nine bacterial taxa in
men and two bacterial taxa in women respectively (IVW, all P &lt; 0.05).
After FDR correction, the causal effect of IGF-1 on order
Actinomycetales (PFDR= 0.049) remains in men. The robustness of the IVW
results was further confirmed after heterogeneity and pleiotropy
analysis.ConclusionOur study demonstrates a bidirectional causal link
between the gut microbiota and IGF-1, in both men and women.</p>

biofilms: a review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Microbial biofilms play a pivotal role in microbial infections and
antibiotic resistance due to their unique properties, driving the urgent
need for advanced methodologies to study their behavior comprehensively
across varied environmental contexts. While electrochemical biosensors
have demonstrated success in understanding the dynamics of biofilms,
scientists are now synergistically merging these biosensors with
microfluidic technology. This combined approach offers heightened
precision, sensitivity, and real-time monitoring capabilities, promising
a more comprehensive understanding of biofilm behavior and its
implications. Our review delves into recent advancements in
electrochemical biosensors on microfluidic chips, specifically tailored
for investigating biofilm dynamics, virulence, and properties. Through a
critical examination of these advantages, properties and applications of
these devices, the review highlights the transformative potential of
this technology in advancing our understanding of microbial biofilms in
different settings.</p>

meningitidis activates pyroptotic pathways in a mouse model of
meningitis: role of a two-partner secretion system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>There is evidence that in infected cells in vitro the meningococcal
HrpA/HrpB two-partner secretion system (TPS) mediates the exit of
bacteria from the internalization vacuole and the docking of bacteria to
the dynein motor resulting in the induction of pyroptosis. In this study
we set out to study the role of the HrpA/HrpB TPS in establishing
meningitis and activating pyroptotic pathways in an animal model of
meningitis using a reference serogroup C meningococcal strain, 93/4286,
and an isogenic hrpB knockout mutant, 93/4286ΩhrpB. Survival experiments
confirmed the role of HrpA/HrpB TPS in the invasive meningococcal
disease. In fact, the ability of the hrpB mutant to replicate in brain
and spread systemically was impaired in mice infected with hrpB mutant.
Furthermore, western blot analysis of brain samples during the infection
demonstrated that: i. N. meningitidis activated canonical and
non-canonical inflammasome pyroptosis pathways in the mouse brain; ii.
the activation of caspase-11, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D was markedly
reduced in the hrpB mutant; iii. the increase in the amount of IL-1β and
IL-18, which are an important end point of pyroptosis, occurs in the
brains of mice infected with the wild-type strain 93/4286 and is
strongly reduced in those infected with 93/4286ΩhrpB. In particular, the
activation of caspase 11, which is triggered by cytosolic
lipopolysaccharide, indicates that during meningococcal infection
pyroptosis is induced by intracellular infection after the exit of the
bacteria from the internalizing vacuole, a process that is hindered in
the hrpB mutant. Overall, these results confirm, in an animal model,
that the HrpA/HrpB TPS plays a role in the induction of pyroptosis and
suggest a pivotal involvement of pyroptosis in invasive meningococcal
disease, paving the way for the use of pyroptosis inhibitors in the
adjuvant therapy of the disease.</p>

between pathogenic E.coli O78-induced intestinal epithelial barrier
damage and Zonulin expression levels in yaks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>To explore whether the intestinal damage of yak colibacillosis
resulted from the regulation of Zonulin expression by its pathogenic
bacteria, the overexpression and interference plasmids of Zonulin were
designed and cultured in Tranwell after cell transfection. Then qRT-PCR
and Western blot were used to detect the results of cell transfection,
200 mL 1×105 CFU/mL E.coli O78 was added for 4 hours, transmembrane
resistance was measured by transmembrane resistance meter, FD4
fluorescence concentration in the lower chamber was detected by enzyme
labeling instrument, bacterial translocation was measured by CFU
counting method, and epithelial mucin (MUC1, MUC2) and tight junction
protein (FABP2, Occludin, ZO-1) were detected by qRT-PCR.ResultsThe
Zonulin gene overexpression and knockout cell lines were successfully
constructed, the TEER value of the barrier of Zonulin overexpression
cell lines began to decrease at 1 h after the addition of E.coli O78 and
reached the lowest value at 4 h, and the TEER value of Zonulin
interference cell lines decreased within 1-4 h after the addition of
E.coli O78. At 4 h, the FD4 passing capacity of Zonulin overexpression
cell lines was significantly higher than that of interfering cell lines,
reaching twice as much as siRNA-1. The amount of bacterial translocation
in overexpressed cell lines increased rapidly within 1-4 h, and the
concentration of E.coli in the lower chamber was significantly higher
than that in the siRNA-1 group at 4 h, but there was no significant
change in the siRNA-1 group in the 1-4 h. There was no significant
change in the mRNA level of MUC1 in Zonulin overexpression and
interference cell lines after the addition of E.coli O78. In the
overexpression group, the mRNA levels of MUC2, Occludin, and ZO-1 were
significantly decreased, and the mRNA level of FABP2 was increased
considerably. These results suggest stimulate epithelial cells to
secrete Zonulin protein. Many Zonulin proteins regulate the opening of
tight junction structures, reduce the transmembrane resistance of the
cell barrier, and improve the permeability of the cell barrier and the
amount of bacterial translocation.</p>

contamination with carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in
healthcare settings in Fiji: a potential source of infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThere are multiple ongoing outbreaks of carbapenem
resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAb) infection in Fiji’s hospitals.
CRAb is able to colonize and persist on various hospital surfaces for
extended periods. We conducted a study to understand the extent of
hospital environmental contamination and phylogenetic links with
clinical isolates.MethodsSwabs were collected from high-touch surfaces
at Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) September 2021 and December
2022; Lautoka Hospital (LTKH) August 2022; and Labasa Hospital (LBSH)
November 2022. All bacterial isolates were identified, and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) performed; isolates resistant to
carbapenems and producing a carbapenemase underwent whole genome
sequencing. Comparison was made to clinical isolates obtained from CWMH
in 2016–2017 and 2019–2021 and from LTKH and LBSH from
2020–2021.ResultsFrom the 180 environmental samples collected, ten
(5.6%) CRAb were isolated; no other carbapenem-resistant gram-negative
organisms were isolated. Seven (70%) of the CRAb were isolated from CWMH
and three (30%) from LTKH; no CRAb were isolated from LBSH. Of the seven
CWMH CRAb, two were sequence type 2 (ST2), three ST25, and two ST499.
All LTKH isolates were ST499. The two environmental CRAb ST2 isolates
were closely genetically linked to isolates obtained from patients in
CWMH, LTKH, and LBSH 2020–2021. Similarly, the three environmental CRAb
ST25 isolates were closely genetically linked to isolates obtained from
patients admitted to CWMH in 2019–2021 and LBSH in 2020. The
environmental CRAb ST499 isolates represented two distinct clones, with
clone 1 comprising two genetically identical isolates from CWMH and
clone 2 the three isolates from LTKH. Although no genetic linkages were
observed when comparing environmental ST499 isolates to those from CWMH
patients in 2020–2021, both clone 1 isolates were genetically identical
to an isolate obtained from a patient admitted during the sampling
period.ConclusionOur study highlights the contamination of high-touch
surfaces within Fiji hospitals with CRAb, suggesting that these may
serve as important sources for CRAb. Phylogenetic linkages to CRAb
isolated from patients since 2019 underscores the persistence of this
resistant pathogen in hospital settings and the ongoing risk for
hospital-acquired infections.</p>
