oxide-producing monocyte-myeloid suppressor cells expand and accumulate
in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of Yersinia
enterocolitica-infected mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionYersinia enterocolitica (Ye) is a Gram-negative bacterium
that causes gastrointestinal infections. The myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs) constitute a cellular population with the capacity of
inducing the specific suppression of T cells. Although there is evidence
supporting the role of MDSCs in controlling the immune responses in
several bacterial infections, its role during Ye infection has not yet
been reported. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to analyze
MDSCs after oral Ye infection.MethodsC57BL/6 wild-type mice were
infected with Ye WAP-314 serotype O:8. The proliferation of splenocytes
and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) cells was measured as well as the
levels of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in culture supernatants. The
frequency and subsets of MDSCs were analyzed in the intestinal mucosa
and spleen by flow cytometry. Furthermore, monocytic-MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs)
and polymorphonuclear-MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) were purified from the spleen of
infected mice and their suppressor activity was evaluated in co-cultures
with purified T cells.Resultswe observed a marked expansion of
CD11b+Gr-1+ cells, a phenotype consistent with MDSCs, in the spleen and
intestinal mucosa of Ye-infected mice. Interestingly, a robust
proliferation of splenocytes and MLN cells was observed only when the
MDSCs were depleted or the NO production was blocked. In addition, we
determined that only Mo-MDSCs had the ability to suppress T-cell
proliferation.ConclusionOur results highlight a mechanism by which Ye
may induce suppression of the immune responses. We suggest that
NO-producing Mo-MDSCs expand and accumulate in MLN and spleen of
Ye-infected mice. These cells can then suppress the T-cell function
without interfering with the anti-bacterial effector response. Instead,
these immature myeloid cells may perform an important function in
regulating the inflammatory response and protecting affected
tissues.</p>

or contrary? The effects of Qiwei Baizhu Powder and its bioactive
compounds on mucosa-associated microbiota of mice with
antibiotic-associated diarrhea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Qiwei Baizhu Powder (QWBZP) has been proven effective in treating
antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and the mechanism is associated
with regulating the gut microbiota. However, the role of the bioactive
compounds of QWBZP in regulating the gut microbiota is still unclear. In
this study, 24 mice were divided into a normal control group (N), a
model group (R), a QWBZP decoction group (TW), and a QWBZP-TG group
(TG). AAD mouse models were established by mixed antibiotic
administration. After modeling, mice in the TW group and TG group were
treated with QWBZP decoction and QWBZP-TG, respectively. Mice in the N
group and R group were gavaged with sterile water. 16S rRNA gene
sequencing was used to investigate the changes of mucosa-associated
microbiota (MAM) in the small intestine of mice. Moreover, the levels of
diamine oxidase (DAO), D-Lactate, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA),
interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were
detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The
results showed that QWBZP-TG significantly altered the diversity,
structure, and abundance of MAM in the AAD mice. QWBZP-TG exerted a
stronger suppression effect on Escherichia and Clostridium compared with
QWBZP decoction. Meanwhile, QWBZP-TG downregulated the abundance of
Lactobacillus, which elicited an opposite effect to QWBZP decoction.
Prevotella was the signature bacteria that responded to the QWBZP-TG
intervention. Furthermore, both QWBZP decoction and QWBZP-TG decreased
the levels of DAO, D-Lactate, sIgA, IL-6, and TNF-α in the AAD mice. The
role of glycosides is to help QWBZP ameliorate diarrhea symptoms by
inhibiting the proliferation of diarrhea-associated bacteria, reducing
inflammation and regulating immunity.</p>

macrophage-derived exosomes prevents HBV-HCC migration and invasion via
regulating miR-106b-3p/PCGF3/PI3K/AKT signaling axis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundStudies revealed that exosomes from IFN-α-treated liver
non-parenchymal cells (IFN-exo) mediate antiviral activity. MiR-106b-3p
has been shown to play a paradoxical role in disease progressing from
different studies. However, its specific role in HBV-related
hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) and the underlying mechanism remains
unclear.MethodHuh7 cells transient transfected with plasmids of HBV-C2
and B3 were co-cultured with IFN-exo. Cell supernatants were collected
to detect miR-106b-3p, HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA levels. Cell
proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed. The
putative targets of miR-106b-3p were identified by a dual-luciferase
reporter system. The expression of PCGF3, migratory proteins(MMP2/9),
and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related proteins were assessed by
western blot. The expression of PCGF3 mRNA was quantitative analyzed by
using 52 pairs of paraffin-embedded tissues from HCC patients.
siRNAs-PCGF3 were used to knocked-down PCGF3 expression.ResultsThe
expression of miR-106b-3p was significantly higher in THP-1 cells and
supernatants treated with IFN-exo than those untreated. Significantly
increased expression of miR-106b-3p and decreased expression of HBsAg
and HBV DNA were observed in Huh7-C2/B3 cells treated with IFN-exo. In
addition, miR-106b-3p was directly target to PCGF3. Scratch healing
assay and transwell assay showed that either IFN-exo or miRNA-106-3p
over-expression, or siRNAs-PCGF3 inhibited migration and invasion of
Huh7-C2/B3 cells, and subsequently resulted in suppression of p-AKT/AKT
and p-PI3K/PI3K. Notably, the expression level of PCGF3 was
significantly lower in HBeAg (+)-HCC tumor tissues than HBeAg (-)-HCC
tumor.ConclusionIFN-α-induced macrophage-derived miR-106b-3p inhibits
HBV replication, HBV- Huh7 cells migration and invasion via regulating
PCGF3/PI3K/AKT signaling axis. miR-106b-3p and PCGF3 were potential
biomarkers in the prevention and treatment of HBV-HCC.</p>
