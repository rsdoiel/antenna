between Helicobacter pylori infection and visceral fat area in diabetic
populations: the mediating role of insulin resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundObesity has become a global health concern, particularly in
relation to abdominal fat which is associated with various diseases. The
connection between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and obesity is still
debated, with limited research on the link between H. pylori and
visceral fat. This study aimed to examine the correlation between H.
pylori infection and visceral fat area (VFA) among participants.MethodsA
total of 18,076 individuals participated in this study, undergoing
assessments of VFA, physical parameter measurements, and serum
examinations. Bioelectrical impedance was used to analyze VFA, with the
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index indicating levels of insulin resistance
(IR) in the population. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized
to determine the factors influencing VFA, while a generalized additive
model was employed to assess potential non-linear associations between
the TyG index and VFA.ResultsH. pylori was recognized as a contributing
factor to VFA exclusively within diabetic populations. In these
populations, a significant nonlinear relationship existed between the
TyG index and VFA. Furthermore, mediation analysis indicated that the
TyG index acted as a mediator in the relationship between H. pylori and
VFA.ConclusionH. pylori is closely associated with VFA in individuals
with diabetes, with IR serving as a mediating factor in the relationship
between H. pylori and VFA.</p>

progress on diagnostic techniques for different Babesia species in
persistent infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Babesiosis, a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Babesia protozoa,
poses significant infection risks across mammalian species. Clinical
manifestations in vertebrate hosts range from spontaneous abortion to
fatal outcomes, with immunocompromised individuals potentially
transmitting the pathogen through blood products or transplanted organs,
thereby amplifying epidemiological risks. Effective disease management
carries substantial public health implications for livestock production,
companion animal welfare, and food safety in endemic regions. In global
endemic zones, conventional diagnostic approaches combine morphological
identification of Babesia spp. with complementary serological assays.
Contemporary molecular diagnostics, particularly nucleic acid
amplification techniques, have emerged as valuable adjunctive tools. A
critical challenge in veterinary practice involves persistent
subclinical carriers among treated livestock populations, necessitating
precise parasite speciation for effective transmission control. This
review synthesizes recent advancements in babesiosis detection
methodologies, with particular emphasis on their implementation in
clinical microbiology laboratories. This article introduces the latest
progress in Babesiosis detection technology and its application in
clinical microbiology laboratories, to provide a theoretical and
practical basis for the comprehensive prevention and control of
Babesiosis.</p>

characteristics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
co-infection in COVID-19 pneumonia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) stands as a
pervasive and important pathogen in the co-infections during the
COVID-19 pandemic given its high morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to characterize MRSA isolates obtained from COVID-19 pneumonia
with MRSA co-infection patients during the COVID-19 pandemic wave in
China from 2022 to 2024. Fifty MRSA isolates collected form COVID-19
pneumonia with MRSA co-infection patients (MRSA-COC) and 50 MRSA
isolates collected from MRSA pneumonia patients without COVID-19
(MRSA-CON) were enrolled in this study. Whole-genome sequencing, genomic
epidemiology and comparative analysis were conducted to explore
differences of MRSA isolates between two groups. Patients with MRSA-COC
were significantly older (P=0.0492), had higher rates of severe
pneumonia progression (P=0.0006), and carried greater comorbidity
burdens. The time from hospital admission to MRSA detected was
significantly shorter in MRSA-COC patients than in MRSA-CON patients
(P=0.0141). Furthermore, MRSA-COC patients demonstrated significantly
higher mortality rates compared with MRSA-CON patients (44% vs. 18%,
P=0.0049). However, genomic analysis revealed no statistically
significant differences in antimicrobial resistance gene or virulence
factor genes between the MRSA-COC and MRSA-CON isolates. CC5 emerged as
the predominant clone in both groups, with significantly higher
prevalence in MRSA-COC isolates (88% vs. 66%, P=0.0090). The
tst-positive ST5-MRSA-II strain was associated with concerning mortality
rates in both MRSA-COC (50%) and MRSA-CON (20%) patients, underscoring
the critical need for enhanced surveillance in MRSA pneumonia.</p>

regia and Pfaffia paniculata extracts: implications for periodontal
disease treatment and correlation with Alzheimer’s risk</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontal disease (PD) is a significant global health concern,
affecting approximately 19% of the world’s population. It is one of the
most prevalent diseases today, causing substantial socio-economic
impacts and diminished quality of life. Recent research has also
revealed a potential link between PD and Alzheimer’s disease. This study
investigated the antimicrobial effects of Juglans regia and Pfaffia
paniculata extracts against P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis, bacteria
that cause PD and are related to Alzheimer’s risk. The study also
assessed the impact of these extracts on macrophage metabolic activity,
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, and genotoxicity. The
phytochemical analysis of the extract was carried out first.
Antimicrobial activity was performed using the M11-A7 protocol (CLSI)
for planktonic cultures on monotypic biofilms matured for 168 hours in
anaerobiosis. Cell viability analysis was carried out using MTT on mouse
macrophages (RAW 264-7), as well as genotoxicity assessment using
micronuclei. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using ELISA
method, checking the cytokines IL-6, IL-1B, TNF-alpha, IL-17 and IL-10.
Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of Miquelianin, Regiolone
and Gallic Acid in J. regia extract. For the P. paniculata extract, we
identified the glycosides Pfaffoside C, Pfaffoside A,
3-O-β-D-glycopyranosyl-oleanolic acid and Beta-ecdysone. Antimicrobial
activity revealed a MBC of 1.73 for the extract of J. regia and 0.48 for
P. paniculata against P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis. All biofilms
were reduced by more than 89% after treatment with the extracts for 5
min. Cytotoxicity evaluations revealed that cell viability remained
above 50% at concentrations up to 0.216 mg/ml for J. regia and 0.015
mg/ml for P. paniculata. Neither extract exhibited genotoxicity.
Furthermore, both demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity by promoting
the production of the cytokine IL-10. In conclusion, the antimicrobial
and anti-inflammatory activities of J. regia and P. paniculata extracts
suggest their potential as treatments for oral dysbiosis, which may
contribute to a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

lactoferricin exerts antibacterial activity against four Gram-negative
pathogenic bacteria by transforming its molecular structure</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The emergence and development of pathogenic bacterial resistance to
antibiotics pose significant challenges to human health. Antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) are considered promising alternatives to conventional
antibiotics. Lactoferricin (Lfcin), a cationic AMP located in the
N-terminal region of lactoferrin, serves as the antimicrobial active
center of the intact protein. The presence of two cysteines in Lfcin
allows for the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which may
influence its molecular structure and antibacterial function. To
investigate this hypothesis, we synthesized, purified, and identified
bovine Lfcin along with two derivatives: Lfcin with a disulfide bond
(Lfcin DB) and a mutated form that cannot form the disulfide bond (Lfcin
C36G). We analyzed the circular dichroism spectra of these peptides
under varying ionic and hydrophobic conditions, while their tertiary
structures were predicted using AlphaFold3. Results indicated that
increased ionic strength reduced the random coil ratios across all
peptides. The secondary structure of Lfcin showed similar percentages
with Lfcin C36G in the H2O and similar ratios with Lfcin DB under
hydrophobic conditions. AlphaFold3-predicted models revealed two
distinct structures: one predominantly adopting α-helix conformations
and the other characterized by β-sheet topology. Furthermore, we
evaluated the antibacterial activity of the peptides against four
Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella gallinarum. The
synthetic peptides demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial activity,
with Lfcin exhibiting superior efficacy compared to its derivatives. Our
findings suggest that Lfcin can reversibly interconvert between two
distinct molecular states under varying ionic strengths and hydrophobic
effects, with the resulting structural transformations enhancing its
antibacterial function.</p>

of MAGLUMI syphilis test for accurate detection of syphilis antibodies
in blood donors and suspected syphilis cases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe diagnosis of syphilis is critical to initiate treatment
at an early stage and control the syphilis epidemic. The serological
detection of treponemal antibodies is recommended in the reverse
sequence screening algorithm as the first screening test.Study
designSerum samples from 5,081 unselected blood donors and 213
hospitalized patients were collected to evaluate the diagnostic
specificity. To assess the diagnostic sensitivity, 487 positive samples
were collected. 405 cross-interference samples were tested to evaluate
analytical specificity. All samples were tested with the MAGLUMI
Syphilis (Chemiluminescence immunoassay, CLIA) Test and the obtained
results were compared with the Abbott ARCHITECT Syphilis TP reference
test.ResultsThe diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the MAGLUMI
Syphilis (CLIA) Test was 99.96% (95% CI, 99.87-99.99%) and 100.00% (95%
CI, 99.22-100.00%), respectively. The analytical specificity and the
analytical sensitivity of the Test was 100.00% and 2.529 mIU/ml,
respectively. No significant interference and cross-reactivity were
observed in a number of potential factors.ConclusionsThe performance of
the MAGLUMI Syphilis (CLIA) Test makes it suited for identification of
treponemal antibodies in screening populations as well as patients
presenting with suspicion of syphilitic infection.</p>

haem-iron dependence of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae: an avenue
for future therapeutic development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major respiratory
pathogen that imposes a substantial disease burden, globally. Further
amplifying the burden of NTHi-associated infections is the rapidly
expanding spectrum and prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and the lack
of an effective vaccination strategy. In 2017, the World Health
Organization list of “priority pathogens”, highlighted the urgent need
for new therapeutic agents against NTHi. Consequently, alternative
preventative or treatment approaches that do not rely on antibiotic
susceptibility or stable vaccine targets are becoming more attractive.
The nutritional dependency for haem/iron at all stages of NTHi
pathogenesis exposes a vulnerability that may be exploited for the
development of such therapies. This review explores the role of
haem/iron in all facets of NTHi pathogenesis, the host-bacterial
competition for this vital nutrient, and the therapeutic potential of
strategies that interfere with its acquisition.</p>

id="protein-lysine-acetylation-regulates-oral-microorganisms">Protein
lysine acetylation regulates oral microorganisms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are integral to the
regulation of protein function, stability, and cellular processes.
Lysine acetylation, a widespread PTM, has been extensively characterized
for its role in eukaryotic cellular functions, particularly in
metabolism, gene expression, and disease progression. However, its
involvement in oral microbiota remains inadequately explored. This
review examines the emerging significance of lysine acetylation in
modulating oral microbial communities. The oral cavity, characterized by
its unique anatomical and environmental conditions, serves as a dynamic
habitat where microbiota interact with host factors such as diet, immune
response, pH, and the level of oxygen. Lysine acetylation enables
bacterial adaptation to these fluctuating conditions, influencing
microbial metabolism, virulence, and stress responses. For example,
acetylation of lactate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus mutans reduces its
acidogenicity and aciduricity, which decreases its cariogenic potential.
In diverse environmental conditions, including hypoxic or anaerobic
environments, acetylation regulates energy utilization pathways and
enzyme activities, supporting bacterial survival and adaptation.
Additionally, acetylation controls the production of extracellular
polysaccharides (EPS), which are essential for biofilm formation and
bacterial colonization. The acetylation of virulence factors can
modulate the pathogenic potential of oral bacteria, either enhancing or
inhibiting their activity depending on the specific context and
regulatory mechanisms involved. This review also explores the
interactions between acetylation and other PTMs, highlighting their
synergistic or antagonistic effects on protein function. A deeper
understanding of lysine acetylation mechanisms in oral microbiota could
provide valuable insights into microbial adaptation and pathogenesis,
revealing potential therapeutic targets for oral diseases.</p>

Porphyromonas gingivalis RNA-binding protein is required for growth in
high levels of zinc and persistence with host cells</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The oral periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis must adapt to
an ever-changing environment to survive and cause disease. So far, most
of the efforts concerning the regulatory mechanisms employed by the
bacterium centered on DNA-binding regulators. Although global regulatory
mechanisms employing RNA-binding proteins (RBP) are reported in most
forms of life so far, such mechanism of regulation remains unknown in
the oral Bacteroidetes group. Examination of the genome of P. gingivalis
led to the discovery of a putative RBP with the RNA recognition motif 1
(RRM-1) designated here RbpPg1 (RNA-binding protein Porphyromonas
gingivalis 1). The recombinant form of the protein-bound RNA and
RNA-pull down identified a zinc exporter transcript as the most enriched
one in agreement with the higher levels of zinc in the absence of the
protein. Deletion of RbpPg1 reduced the ability of the bacterium to grow
with 0.5 mM zinc. The RgpB protein level and the Arg-X protease activity
was reduced in both iron replete and iron deplete conditions in the
mutant strain when compared to the wild type. Lys-X protease activity
was reduced, although Kgp protein levels were not altered by deletion of
RbpPg1. The mutant grew better in hemin-deplete conditions when compared
to the wild type. Finally, RbpPg1 was indispensable for the bacterium to
survive with host cells. We have determined that both the transcriptome
and proteome are affected by the deletion of RbpPg1 and found that the
major group of proteins with elevated expression were the ones
associated with response to environmental stress changes, while proteins
mediating metabolic processes were downregulated. Overall, the first RBP
characterized in P. gingivalis plays a significant role in the biology
of the bacterium and differs from RBPs in other Gram-negative bacteria.

<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori infection causes histopathologic changes in
gastric epithelial cells, resulting in conditions such as gastritis,
gastric ulcers, and ultimately, gastric cancer. To date, various
experimental models, including cell lines and animal studies, have been
employed to investigate these pathological processes. However, each
model presents its limitations. This study compared the re-cultured
three-dimensional organoids from infected single cells, apical-out, and
two-dimensional (2D) organoids models to better understand the
mechanisms underlying the epithelial changes caused by H. pylori
infection in the human stomach. Thus, we analyzed the epithelial cell
responses, inflammatory mediator expressions, apical-junctional complex
alterations, and H. pylori infection interactions in these organoid
models. Moreover, we revealed that the high accessibility and
experimental efficiency of the apical-out and 2D models enable easier
manipulation and faster analysis of H. pylori infection compared to the
single-cell infection model. These results indicate the potential of
various organoid models in H. pylori infection studies to provide
essential data that help in understanding the mechanisms of epithelial
changes and in developing new therapeutic strategies for gastric
pathology.</p>

in sRNA-mediated regulation of Salmonella infection in the host</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Salmonella is a foodborne pathogen that enters the host’s body
through contaminated food and water, leading to gastroenteritis and
systemic diseases. It is a significant veterinary and human pathogen
capable of infecting both humans and animals, with substantial impacts
on public health, human well-being, and the economic development of the
livestock and poultry farming industry. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs),
typically 50–500 nucleotides (nt) in length, have been identified in
various bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Brucella, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Salmonella. These sRNAs play crucial roles in regulating
diverse physiological processes within bacteria. This review emphasizes
recent advances in understanding how sRNAs regulate the virulence of
Salmonella spp, such as the discovery of novel sRNAs like SaaS and new
regulatory mechanisms of known sRNAs like RyhB-1/RyhB-2 and SdsR/Spot
42. It also outlines critical future directions, including exploring the
multifaceted functions of sRNAs in lifestyle or infection phase
transitions, fully elucidating their roles in regulating the host immune
response, studying the combined actions of multiple sRNAs on host
pathogenesis and expanding research to more Salmonella serotypes and
diverse animal models. Through these efforts, this review aims to
enhance our understanding of Salmonella sRNAs and their infection
mechanisms.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen and is
posing significant global health challenge through climate change. WNV,
transmitted between birds and Culex mosquitoes, has significantly
expanded northward in recent years, leading to outbreaks across Europe
and North America. This review explores the recent advancements and
therapeutic strategies targeting WNV’s structural and non-structural
(NS) proteins, which play critical roles in viral replication and
pathogenesis. Promising candidates include peptide-based inhibitors,
monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules that disrupt protein-protein
interactions. Most of current findings are derived from in silico
methods or in vitro assays, with limited validation through in vivo
studies. Although no vaccines are currently available for humans,
several have been approved for horses, and development efforts are
ongoing. The growing threat of WNV underscores the urgent need for
validated antiviral therapies and scalable vaccines, especially
considering its increasing geographic range and public health
impact.</p>

AKI from ICU: a retrospective cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) carries a
disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rate. While the
synergism between dysregulated host response and renal vulnerability is
increasingly recognized, the multifactorial drivers of poor prognosis
remain poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
prognosis and clinical characteristics of patients with pathogenic
microorganism-positive SA-AKI.MethodUsing a retrospective analysis
approach, we extracted populations from the Medical Information Mart for
Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database that fulfilled the diagnostic
criteria for confirmed sepsis with microbiological evidence of
pathogenic organisms, and patients were divided into two cohorts
according to with or without AKI. The severity of the disease in the two
groups was collected for evaluation, and the clinical indicators and
prognostic results of the patients were evaluated. The objective of this
study was to explore the risk factors affecting the prognosis of
patients with pathogenic microorganism-positive SA-AKI.OutcomeThe
hospital mortality rate of AKI in patients with pathogenic
microbial-positive sepsis was 18.96%. Further analysis showed that the
use of vasoactive drug therapy, high lactate level, SAPS II score, SAPS
III score, LODS score, and clinical indicators of prolonged hospital
stay were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients
with pathogenic microorganism-positive SA-AKI. Among them, SAPS III
score plays an important role in predicting the prognosis of sepsis
patients with AKI. Further studies found that lactate level was
positively correlated with SAPS II score, SAPS III score, and LODS
score.ConclusionThe use of vasoactive drug therapy, high lactate level,
SAPS II score, SAPS III score, and LODS score plays an important role in
assessing the prognosis of patients with pathogenic
microorganism-positive SA-AKI, and multivariate comprehensive assessment
is significant in predicting the prognosis of sepsis AKI patients.</p>

<p>The human respiratory system is vulnerable to viral infections. The
influenza virus family alone accounts for one billion reported cases
annually, some of which are severe and can be fatal. Among these,
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause the most severe symptoms and course of
disease. IAV has been a major health concern, especially since the
emergence of the potentially pandemic avian H5N1 strain. However,
despite the knowledge that IAVs recognize terminally attached sialic
acids on the host cell surface for cell entry, the involvement of other
glycans during early infection remains to be elucidated. In particular,
the involvement of the alveolar epithelial glycocalyx as a last line of
defense is often overlooked. Studying early infection of any virus in
real time remains a challenge due to the currently available model
systems and imaging techniques. Therefore, we extensively compare the
use of different 3D cell systems and provide an overview of currently
available scaffold-based and scaffold-free air-liquid interface (ALI)
models. In addition, we discuss in detail the preferred use of a
recently developed 3D organ tissue equivalent (OTE) model incorporating
solubilized extracellular matrix components (sECM) to study viral
interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) during the early stages of
IAV infection. We further discuss and recommend the use of various
synthetic virus models over IAV virions to reduce complexity by focusing
only on surface protein interactions while simultaneously lowering the
required biosafety levels, including, but not limited to virus-like
particles (VLPs) or DNA origami. Finally, we delve into potential
labeling strategies for IAV or IAV-like particles by reviewing internal
and external labeling strategies with quantum dots (QDs) and potential
GAG labeling, combined with a recommendation to combine high spatial
resolution imaging techniques with high temporal resolution tracking,
such as single virus tracking.</p>

factors released by extracellular vesicles from Cryptococcus
neoformans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cryptococcus neoformans, a prominent opportunistic pathogen, is
equipped with unique mechanisms to evade host immune defenses, notably
through its capsule and the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs).
Despite significant understanding of its pathogenesis, the precise role
of EVs in virulence and their molecular components remain underexplored.
This review synthesizes current research on the virulence factors
encapsulated within EVs of Cryptococcus, highlighting their contribution
to fungal survival and pathogenicity. By analyzing the biochemical
composition of these vesicles, we found the presence of enzymes (e.g.,
Urease, laccase), toxins (e.g. Melanin), and genes (e.g. Ssa1)
associated with pathogenicity factors. Furthermore, we discuss the
implications of these findings for developing therapeutic interventions.
This work advances the field by providing a comprehensive overview of
EV-mediated mechanisms in Cryptococcus, offering new insights into
potential targets for antifungal strategies.</p>

the integrated quorum sensing system its potential role in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Since its discovery, Quorum Sensing (QS), a form of bacterial
communication, has been the focus of numerous studies aimed at
unravelling the mechanisms behind this intricate process. Bacterial QS
relies on releasing low molecular weight signals known as autoinducers
(AIs). When these AIs reach a threshold concentration, they activate
coordinated genetic expression of pathogenic and bacterial survival
mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s QS has been extensively studied due
to its incidence and clinical significance in a wide range of human
infections. Several decades ago, three QS systems, named Las, Rhl, and
Pqs, were identified and have since then become the focus of numerous
research studies and the target of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies. However, a fourth QS-related system was more recently
proposed that it has been the subject of debate. Named “integrated
quorum sensing” (Iqs), interconnects the previously mentioned systems
with the phosphate stress response. The associated AI has been
identified as 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-thiazole-4-carbaldehyde, also known as
IQS. This discovery has sparked a controversial discussion about its
biosynthetic origin and whether it truly functions as an intercellular
communication system. In this review, we critically discuss the
different hypotheses, and its biological relevance while presenting key
findings of the Iqs system.</p>

“proto” type galectin expressed in striped bass (Morone saxatilis)
tissues is released to epidermal mucus and binds to bacterial and mucus
glycans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Like all aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, teleost fish are
subject to the constant pressure of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic
organisms present in the environmental interface that can potentially
cause disease. Numerous defense molecules, including galectins, have
been isolated from the skin and gut tissues of several marine and
freshwater fish species. To provide new insights into the potential
role(s) of galectins in the teleost fish innate immune system, we
carried out studies on the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), a keystone
fish species in Chesapeake Bay. We purified from epidermal skin mucus,
and skin and muscle tissue, a 15-kDa galectin that we designated
Msgal1-L1 (M. saxatilis galectin1-like protein 1). Both the transcript
sequence and gene organization of Msgal1-L1 suggested a close
relationship to the zebrafish galectin Drgal1-L2 and other proto type
galectins from vertebrates, including the mammalian galectin-1. Glycan
microarray analysis of Msgal1-L1 revealed a binding preference for
Galβ1,4GlcNAc, and a homology structural model identified the amino
acids involved in ligand recognition, both observations consistent with
proto type galectins. Immunohistological examination localized Msgal1-L1
to epithelial and macrophage-/fibroblast-like cells in mucosal tissues,
including skin and gill. The preliminary localization of Msgal1-L1 in
free macrophage-like cells in epidermal mucus was corroborated by
immunofluorescence analysis of macrophages isolated from head kidney.
Msgal1-L1 binds in a carbohydrate-specific manner to O-glycosylated
components of epidermal mucus. Msgal1-L1 agglutinated environmental
bacterial species and strains, some of which are recognized fish
pathogens, such as Vibrio and Edwardsiella spp. A microbial microarray
analysis revealed that it preferentially binds to bacterial
exopolysaccharides (e.g., Streptococcus and Shigella spp.) as well as
various lipopolysaccharide O-antigen serotypes of Proteus spp. A
preliminary solid-phase assay showed that Msgal1-L1 strongly bound
Streptococcus sp., but very weakly to Mycobacterium marinum, an endemic
pathogen of striped bass in Chesapeake Bay. Taken together, this
evidence suggests that Msgal1-L1 may function in defense recognition
against environmental bacteria by agglutinating and/or cross-linking
them to mucus oligosaccharides to immobilize them within the epidermal
mucus film and prevent their access to the fish epithelial cell surface.
M. marinum would evade this defense mechanism to reach and infect the
fish skin epithelial layer.</p>

tuberculosis: lysosome-centric insights into pathogenesis and
therapies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is a widely spread disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb). The pathogenicity of the pathogen is closely
associated with the immune defense mechanisms of the host cells. As key
cellular degradation and metabolic centers, lysosomes critically
regulate tuberculosis infection. When Mtb invades the host, it is taken
up by macrophages and enters phagosomes. Subsequently, the phagosomes
fuse with lysosomes and form phagolysosomes, which eliminate the
pathogenic bacteria through the acidic environment and hydrolytic
enzymes within lysosomes. However, Mtb can interfere with the normal
functions of lysosomes through various strategies. It can secrete
specific factors (such as ESAT-6, ppk-1, and AcpM) to inhibit the
acidification of lysosomes, enzyme activity, and the fusion of
phagosomes and lysosomes, thereby enabling Mtb proliferation within host
cells. An in-depth exploration of the mechanism of the interaction
between Mtb and lysosomes will both uncover bacterial immune evasion
strategies and identify novel anti-tuberculosis therapeutic targets.</p>

Helicobacter pylori infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori is a stomach-dwelling bacterium with a crude
global prevalence of nearly 45% in adults and 35% in children and
adolescents. Chronic H. pylori infection and the resulting inflammation
are major causes of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.
Since its discovery in 1982, various animal models have been proposed to
recreate the specific pathophysiological interactions between H. pylori
and the human host. These infection models have been instrumental in
dissecting the key drivers of H. pylori colonization, persistence and
mediators of host immune responses. However, a comprehensive
understanding of the molecular triggers for malignant transformation of
the gastric mucosa is still lacking. Vaccine development in this area
has stalled, as promising candidates identified through animal studies
have failed in advanced human clinical trials. Currently, H. pylori
eradication is heavily reliant on different antimicrobial agents. As
with other bacterial pathogens, the growing antimicrobial resistance in
H. pylori remains a major challenge, making eradication therapy
increasingly complex and prolonged, over time. Recent drug approvals
have mostly been for newer combinations of conventional antibiotics and
proton pump inhibitors. Thus, the development of novel treatments and
innovative models are crucial for advancing the drug development
pipeline. This review encompasses the development and recent advances in
animal and non-animal models of H. pylori gastric infection and its
applications in investigating novel therapeutics and vaccine
candidates.</p>

of a rapid point-of-care dengue virus type 2 infection diagnostic assay
using recombinase polymerase amplification and lateral flow device</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDengue virus (DENV) is the most rapidly spreading
arbovirus globally, with over half of the world’s population at risk of
infection. Early and rapid detection is crucial to ensure timely patient
care, reduce healthcare burden, and prevent severe disease progression.
However, conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques are often
unsuitable for low-resource settings due to their equipment and
procedural demands.MethodsWe evaluated a real-time reverse transcription
recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the sensitive
and specific detection of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2). The assay was tested
using both Twista fluorometer and lateral flow detection (LFD) formats.
Analytical sensitivity was determined by probit regression, while
specificity was assessed against unrelated viruses and other
flaviviruses. Clinical validation was performed using serum, cell
culture, and FTA® card samples. Assay robustness was evaluated under
varying temperatures and after freeze-thaw cycles.ResultsThe RT-RPA
assay reliably amplified DENV2 at concentrations as low as 50 copies per
reaction, with LOD₉₅ estimated at 38.48 copies (Twista) and 50.37 copies
(LFD). No cross-reactivity was observed with respiratory syncytial
virus, influenza, rabbit herpes virus, West Nile virus, or other DENV
serotypes (DENV1, DENV3, DENV4). The assay successfully detected
multiple DENV2 strains and maintained performance across 33°C–40°C and
after repeated freeze-thaw cycles. RNA extracted from FTA® cards was
successfully amplified. Clinical validation confirmed accurate detection
in serum and cell culture samples, while DENV3-positive blood samples
tested negative, reinforcing specificity.DiscussionThe RT-RPA/LFD assay
offers a rapid, sensitive, and specific tool for DENV2 detection,
compatible with low-resource and field-based settings. Its simplicity,
robustness, and portability make it a promising approach for
point-of-care diagnostics and outbreak surveillance in endemic
regions.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe intratumoral microbe-host interaction plays crucial
role in the development of cancer. The microbiome can influence cancer
development by modulating inflammation, immune responses and metabolic
pathways. Therefore, we aim to delineate the landscape and role of
intratumoral microbiota in cervical cancer (CC).MethodsThe presence of
bacterial community in CC tissues was confirmed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). Then 16s rRNA and RNA-Seq were used to
characterize the composition of intratumoral microbiota. Combined with
cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) data from the Tumor Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA), the clinical signatures of intratumoral microbiota
and DEGs were further analyzed. Finally, the effect of the up-regulated
Fibrinogen beta chain (FGB) expressed fragment peptide on the biological
behavior of cancer was verified in vitro.ResultsWe found the composition
heterogeneity of bacteria in CC tumors. Pseudomonas was most highly
enriched in CC tissues and grouped according to the relative abundance
level. The clinical characteristics of patients with relatively high
abundance of Pseudomonas had the higher levels of fibrinogen and lower
levels of white blood cell (WBC) and albumin (ALB) expression. Combining
transcriptome data from the two our collective CC and TCGA-CESC cohorts,
we found that Pseudomonas abundance was significantly associated with
fibrinogen beta peptide expression and worse overall survival in CC
patients. In vitro experiment revealed that Pseudomonas could promote
the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells through
overexpression of FGB.ConclusionsWe characterized the composition of the
intratumoral microbiota in CC tissues and identified the most
significantly differentially abundant bacteria between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues. Our findings provide novel insights into the
relationship between intratumoral Pseudomonas and the tumorigenesis of
CC. A deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its
associated microbiota may reveal new potential therapeutic targets and
improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying
a peculiar resistance phenotype in Klebsiella pneumoniae, characterized
by reduced susceptibility to cefepime compared to
ceftazidime.MethodsAntimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid
conjugation experiments, whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatic
analyses were employed to characterize the resistance phenotype and
identify genetic determinants.ResultsA total of 20 K. pneumoniae strains
exhibiting peculiar resistance phenotypes were collected and analyzed.
Ten distinct sequence types (STs) were identified, including ST25
(4/20), ST967 (3/20), ST65 (2/20), ST133 (2/20), ST48 (2/20), ST353
(1/20), ST628 (1/20), ST753 (1/20), ST792 (1/20), and ST254 (1/20). All
strains were resistant to FEP (MIC50 = 128 µg/mL) but not to CAZ (MIC50
= 8 µg/mL). This resistance was primarily attributed to the presence of
the blaCTX-M-3 (14/20) and blaOXA-10 (3/20). Conjugation experiments
demonstrated that 5 out of 14 blaCTX-M-3-positive K. pneumoniae strains
successfully acquired transconjugants, which exhibited the same peculiar
resistance phenotype. PCR analysis confirmed that the conjugates
contained the IncFII plasmid. To further elucidate the genetic basis of
the resistance phenotype, whole-genome long-read sequencing was
performed on three blaCTX-M-3-positive K. pneumoniae strains. The
sequencing results confirmed that blaCTX-M-3 was located on the IncFII
plasmid, and analysis of its genetic environment revealed a frequent
association with mobile genetic elements such as IS26, ISEcp1, and
Tn3.DiscussionThe primary driver of this phenotype in K. pneumoniae is
the presence of the IncFII plasmid carrying blaCTX-M-3, which contrasts
with the resistance mechanisms often reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
exhibiting similar phenotypes. This study emphasizes the critical role
of plasmid-mediated resistance in the spread of multidrug resistance in
K. pneumoniae and provides insights into strategies for combating
resistance in these pathogens.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSince the first discovery and reporting of the COVID - 19
pandemic towards the end of 2019, the virus has rapidly propagated
across the world. This has led to a remarkable spike in the number of
infections. Even now, doubt lingers over whether it has completely
disappeared. Moreover, the issue of restoring normal life while ensuring
safety continues to be a crucial challenge that public health agencies
and people globally are eager to tackle.MethodsTo thoroughly understand
the epidemic’s outbreak and transmission traits and formulate timely
prevention measures to fully safeguard human lives and property, this
paper presents an agent - based model incorporating individual - level
factors.ResultsThe model designates Xi’an—where a characteristic disease
outbreak occurred—as the research area. The simulation results
demonstrate substantial consistency with official records, effectively
validating the model’s applicability, adaptability, and
generalizability. This validated capacity enables accurate prediction of
epidemic trends and comprehensive assessment of disease
risks.DiscussionFrom late 2021 to early 2022, it employs a one - to -
one population simulation approach and simulates epidemic impacts and
disease risks. Initially, using building statistical data in the study
area, the model reconstructs the local real - world geographical
environment. Leveraging data from the seventh national population
census, it also replicates the study area’s population characteristics.
Next, the model takes into account population mobility, contact tracing,
patient treatment, and the diagnostic burden of COVID - 19 - like
influenza symptoms. It integrates epidemic transmission impact
parameters into the model framework. Eventually, the model’s results are
compared with official data for validation, and it’s applied to
hypothetical scenarios. It provides scientific theoretical tools to
support the implementation of government - driven prevention and control
measures. Additionally, it facilitates the adjustment of individual
behavioral guidelines, promoting more effective epidemic management.</p>

of PfUT impairs the parasite’s proteostasis and reduces its growth
rate</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The proteome of Plasmodium falciparum exhibits a marked propensity
for aggregation. This characteristic results from the parasite’s AT-rich
genome, which encodes numerous proteins with long asparagine-rich
stretches and low structural complexity, which lead to abundant
intrinsically disordered regions. While this poses challenges for the
parasite, the propensity for protein aggregation may also serve
functional roles, such as stress adaptation, and could therefore be
exploited by targeting it as a potential vulnerable spot in the
pathogen. Here, we overexpressed an aggregation-prone segment of the P.
falciparum ubiquitin transferase (PfUTf), an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein
that has been previously demonstrated to regulate the stability of
parasite proteins involved in invasion, development and drug metabolism.
Overexpression of PfUTf in P. falciparum had evident phenotypic effects
observed by transmission electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence
microscopy, increased endogenous protein aggregation, disrupted
proteostasis, and caused significant growth impairment in the parasite.
Combined with dihydroartemisinin treatment, PfUTf overexpression had a
synergistic effect that further compromised the parasite´s viability,
linking protein aggregation to proteasome dysfunction. Changes in the
distribution of aggregation-prone proteins, shown by the altered
subcellular fluorescent pattern of the new investigational aggregated
protein dye and antiplasmodial compound YAT2150 in the overexpressing P.
falciparum line, highlighted the critical balance between protein
aggregation, stress responses, and parasite viability, suggesting
proteostasis-targeting therapies as a good antimalarial strategy.</p>

<p>Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) ranks as a primary enterovirus associated
with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (HA). Given its
significant role in these diseases, there is an urgent need for an
efficient identification method. This study presents a novel visual
approach based on the reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction
(RT-PSR) for the rapid detection of CVA6. We designed an RT-PSR assay
that targets and amplifies a segment of the VP1 gene. Hydroxy naphthol
blue (HNB) is incorporated as the detection agent in this assay. To
evaluate the performance of the RT-PSR assay, we analyzed 142 clinical
throat swab samples. The results were benchmarked against those obtained
using quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction
(qRT - PCR). The RT-PSR assay operates at 65°C for 60 minutes and
exhibits a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. When tested against other
viruses, it consistently yielded negative results, demonstrating its
high specificity. Moreover, the RT - PSR assay showed excellent
agreement with a commercial qRT - PCR kit. In conclusion, by using HNB
as an indicator, the RT - PSR assay emerges as a straightforward and
highly sensitive method for detecting CVA6 in symptomatic throat
samples. This approach holds great potential for improving the diagnosis
and surveillance of CVA6 - related diseases.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>It is argued that commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory tract
(URT) protect against pathogen colonization and infection, including
respiratory viruses. Given that the microbiome can mediate immune
modulation, a link between the URT microbiome (URTM) and COVID-19
susceptibility and severity is expected. This 16S metagenomics
cross-sectional study assessed URTM composition, metabolic prediction,
and association with laboratory biomarkers in non-COVID-19 pneumonia
(NO-CoV), moderate (M-CoV), severe (S-CoV) COVID-19 patients, as well as
COVID-19-negative, asymptomatic (NC) patients. The S-CoV group exhibited
reduced URTM diversity, primarily due to a decreased abundance of
eubiotic taxa. Some of these taxa (e.g., Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp.)
were also associated with inflammatory biomarkers. Multiple metabolic
pathways (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, vitamin B12) linked to immune
response, antiviral activity, and host susceptibility showed decreased
abundance in S-CoV. These pathways could suggest potential alternatives
for the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19, providing reassurance
about the progress in understanding and treating this disease.</p>

<p>IntroductionChlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a major sexually
transmitted pathogen with severe complications. Using Chlamydia
muridarum (CM) as a model, this study evaluates the attenuated mutant
Chlamydia muridarum (CM-pGP3S) as a novel rectal vaccine to protect
against genital tract infection and pathology.MethodsFemale C57BL/6 mice
were rectally immunized with low (1×103), middle (1×105), or high
(1×107) doses of CM-pGP3S. Mice were challenged intravaginally with
wild-type Chlamydia muridarum 63 days post-immunization. Protection was
assessed via genital Chlamydia shedding, hydrosalpinx incidence
(gross/histopathology), serum IgG, fecal IgA, and T cell responses. Gut
microbiota stability was analyzed using qPCR.ResultsCM-pGP3S
immunization significantly reduced CM-WT genital shedding duration (3–7
days vs. 21 days in controls, p &lt; 0.01) and hydrosalpinx incidence
(0% vs. 80% in controls, p &lt; 0.01). Elevated systemic and mucosal
immunity were observed, including higher serum IgG (1:100–1:1600
dilutions, p &lt; 0.05–0.01) and fecal IgA (p &lt; 0.05–0.01). CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells exhibited increased IFN-γ (p &lt; 0.01), while CD8+ T cells
showed elevated TNF-α and IL-2 (p &lt; 0.05). No colitis or significant
gut microbiota disruption occurred post-immunization.DiscussionRectal
CM-pGP3S vaccination induces robust transmucosal immunity, protecting
against genital Chlamydia infection and pathology without
gastrointestinal adverse effects. This highlights its potential as a
safe and effective mucosal vaccine strategy to combat CT genital tract

role of periostin (OSF-2) in the cytoadherence phenomena mediated by
malaria parasites</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe pathogenesis of severe malaria is primarily
attributed to the cytoadherence properties of Plasmodium-infected
erythrocytes (IRBC), which include rosetting and IRBC-endothelial
cytoadherence. These cytoadherence events are influenced by various
parasite- and host-derived factors. Previously, antibodies against human
periostin (OSF-2), an inflammation-associated protein, were reported to
inhibit rosetting. In this study, we aimed to characterize the
OSF-2-mediated cytoadherence in infections caused by Plasmodium
falciparum (the most fatal human malaria parasite) and P. knowlesi (an
emerging, potentially fatal zoonotic malaria
parasite).MethodsLaboratory-adapted P. falciparum and P. knowlesi
isolates were cultured, and the late-stage parasites were purified for
experiments using recombinant human OSF-2.ResultsWe found that OSF-2 at
a concentration of 200 ng/ml induced rosette-stimulation in both
parasite species. Furthermore, we demonstrated the serum dependency of
OSF-2-mediated rosetting. The rosette-stimulating effect of OSF-2 was
completely abolished when IRBC were treated with a low concentration of
trypsin. This suggests a role for P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (PfEMP1) in OSF-2-mediated rosetting by P. falciparum, and
reveals the trypsin-sensitive nature of the P. knowlesi-derived ligands
involved in OSF-2-mediated rosetting. We also found that OSF-2-mediated
rosetting was independent of the ABO blood group. Additionally, we
demonstrated the ability of OSF-2 to disrupt the IRBC-endothelial
binding.DiscussionThis work contributes to our understanding of the
host-parasite interactions in malaria pathobiology.</p>

encephalopathy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction
that is caused by sepsis without direct brain injury or central nervous
system infection and is manifested as anxiety-like behavior and
cognitive dysfunction. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, on the other hand,
is a bidirectional communication network between the gut and the brain
that modulates host behavior and cognitive function in many ways and is
of central importance in the preservation of general health and
homeostasis. Given the functional roles attributed to the
microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), contemporary research is progressively
focused on elucidating relationships between SAE and alterations in
compositional and quantitative intestinal microbiota profiles. This
review consolidates interdisciplinary insights from immunology,
microbiology, neuroendocrine signaling, and neural pathophysiology to
evaluate the mechanistic contribution of the MGBA to the relief of
cognitive impairments in SAE. By unifying these perspectives, with the
aim of preventing or enhancing SAE-related neurological dysfunction for
the formulation of MGBA-targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

between oral dysbiosis and Parkinson’s disease: a systematic review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The oral cavity serves as the gateway to the human organism, hosting
a diverse community of microorganisms that coexist in a state of
symbiosis. Disruption of this balance leads to oral dysbiosis, a
condition associated with infections and oral pathologies, which may
contribute to the etiopathogenesis of systemic disorders such as
Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized
by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. While oral dysbiosis is
recognized as a risk factor and an aggravating element for Parkinson’s
disease, it is not regarded as a direct cause. This systematic review
aims to synthesize existing research exploring the potential
relationship between oral dysbiosis and the development of Parkinson’s
disease. Following a comprehensive analysis, 12 studies were selected,
comprising 11 case-control studies and one observational analytical
study. These studies investigated the composition of oral microbiota in
different sample groups, revealing a higher abundance of pathogenic oral
bacteria in individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The findings
suggest that oral dysbiosis may influence both the onset of Parkinson’s
disease and the progression of symptoms such as cognitive decline. These
results pave the way for future research, particularly regarding
alterations in oral microbiota as potential biomarkers for early
diagnosis and disease monitoring.Systematic review

and identification of protein interacting with goose astrovirus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionGoose Astrovirus (GoAstV), a recently identified member
of the Astroviridae family in China, predominantly affects goslings,
resulting in substantial economic losses to the goose farming industry
due to its high infection and mortality rates. Currently, the infection
mechanism and pathogenesis of GoAstV remain unknown.MethodsGiven this,
the Viral Overlay Protein Blot Assay was utilized to identify and
characterize proteins on the LMH (Leghorn Male Hepatoma) cell
membrane that interact with Goose Astrovirus. The identities of the
candidate proteins were determined via LC-MS mass spectrometry analysis,
bioinformatics analysis, and UniProt database search. The interaction
between HSPA5 and the astrovirus protein was further validated in vitro
through Western blot and Coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Finally,
bioinformatics tools such as SWISSMODEL, AlphaFold, and ZDOCK were
employed to construct and analyze the docking complex model between the
candidate protein and GoAstV protein, including their key binding
residue sites.ResultsWe successfully identified a 70 kDa protein in the
plasma membrane protein extracts of LMH cells and confirmed the identity
of this candidate protein as HSPA5. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments
further validated the interaction between HSPA5 and astrovirus proteins.
Subsequently, we successfully predicted the docking complex model of
HSPA5 protein with GoAstV protein. Further prediction of the binding
residue sites revealed that seven residues of the GoAstV-P2 protein
(THR124, ILE22, VAL24, TRP51, PRO66, GLN100, and VAL125) and twelve
residues of the HSPA5 protein (ARG2, HIS3, LEU4, LEU6, ALA7, LEU8, LEU9,
LEU10, LEU11, ASP411, VAL413, and LEU415) may be involved in the
interaction between these two proteins.DiscussionOur research results
have preliminarily elucidated the interaction mechanisms between viral
proteins and receptors, facilitating exploration from multiple angles of
the roles of candidate protein in the process of GoAstV infecting host
cells. This provides a theoretical basis for further identification of
GoAstV receptors and clarification of its infection mechanisms.</p>

proteins of the Porphyromonas genus show diversity in heme-binding
properties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionBacteria of the Porphyromonas genus, belonging to the
Bacteroidota phylum, colonize various host niches in health and disease.
As heme auxotrophs, they rely on heme uptake for iron and protoporphyrin
IX. A key heme acquisition system in Porphyromonas gingivalis is the Hmu
system, where the hemophore-like HmuYPg protein plays a major role.
HmuYPg coordinates heme-iron using two histidines, whereas other known
HmuY proteins produced by other Bacteroidota members prefer a pair of
histidine-methionine or two methionines. Some of them bind heme via the
protoporphyrin ring without heme-iron coordination, similar to the P.
gingivalis HusA protein.MethodsThis study used bioinformatics,
spectroscopic, and electrophoretic methods to compare the genomic
organization of the Hmu system and the structural and functional
properties of HmuY proteins within the Porphyromonas genus.Results and
DiscussionWe revealed variations in the heme-binding properties of
proteins belonging to the HmuY family and susceptibility to
modifications in their heme-binding pockets. These findings suggest that
HmuY proteins may have undergone evolutionary adaptations to enhance
bacterial survival in the human microbiome, contributing to dysbiosis
and disease development. These evolutionary changes may explain the
superior heme-binding ability of P. gingivalis HmuYPg compared to HmuY
homologs produced by other Porphyromonas species.</p>

Adverse Event Reporting System from 2005 to 2023</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundProbiotics are recognized as beneficial foods, but adverse
reactions reported by individuals still exist. This study aims to
analysis adverse events (AE) related to probiotics from the FAERS
database from the first quarter (Q1) of 2005 to the fourth quarter (Q4)
of 2023.MethodsThe AE data related to probiotic from the 2005 Q1 to the
2023 Q4 were collected. R language was applied to analyze the
standardized AE data and three algorithms including the reporting odds
ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and the empirical
Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) were used to identify AE signals.ResultsIn
this study, 10,698,312 reports were collected from the FAERS database,
of which 74 probiotic-related adverse events were reported. About one
third of the reported cases were older than 60 years.36.36% of the
reported cases required Hospitalization. A total of 285 preference terms
(PTS) and 15 system organ classes (SOC) were identified. In the overall
analysis, only 9 PTs and 2 SOCs met significant disproportionality for
all three algorithms simultaneously. SOCs included Gastrointestinal
disorders (N=97, ROR=5.3, PRR=3.84, EBGM=3.84) and Hepatobiliary
disorders (N=9, ROR =3.39, PRR=3.32, EBGM=3.32). PTs included
Gastrointestinal pain (ROR=77.76, PRR=76.69, EBGM=76.63), Hypophagia
(ROR=24.13, PRR=23.88, EBGM=28.88), and Hepatobiliary disorders (N=97,
ROR=5.3, PRR=3.84, EBGM=3.84) and Flatulence (ROR=23.75, PRR=23.28,
EBGM=23.27) were the top four highest. Meanwhile, s found new unique
adverse signals such as Agitation (ROR=12.48, PRR=12.32, EBGM=12.32) and
Anxiety (ROR=4.10, PRR=4.04, EBGM=4.04). Additionally, subgroup analyses
were performed to identify AE signals based on gender and age.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders (N=6, ROR=3.21, PRR=3.04, EBGM=3.04)
and Asthenia (N=3, ROR=5.9, PRR=5.71, EBGM=5.71) were unique AE signal
for the male group.ConclusionAlthough, the risk of adverse reactions
arising from the application of probiotics cannot be ignored. However,
However, the results of this FAERS-based study continue to support the
overall safety of probiotic preparations. It is necessary to pay
attention to the potential influence of factors such as gender and age
on the effects and adverse reactions of probiotic application in basic
research and clinical application.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, defined by their conserved RBCC
domain architecture, play key roles in various cellular processes and
virus-host interactions. In this review, we focus on Class VI TRIM
proteins, including TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33, highlighting the
distinct functional attributes of their RING, B-BOX1, B-BOX2, COILED
COIL, PHD, and BRD domains in viral infection. Through multiple sequence
alignment, we delineate both the conserved and divergent features within
this subclass, underscoring the uniqueness of Class VI TRIM protein.
Additionally, we explore the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of
Class VI TRIM proteins including their functional differences in
modulating viral infection. Moreover, we examine the C-VI TRIM protein
complexes and their significant contributions to the antiviral response.
Furthermore, we discuss small molecule ligands targeting Class VI TRIM
domains, with a focus on druggable structural motifs. Understanding the
multi-domain features of TRIM proteins is crucial for developing
effective antiviral strategies and the therapeutic modulation of their
activity.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The family Ganodermataceae encompasses several genera, including the
widely studied Ganoderma, which is prominent in traditional medicine for
its therapeutic properties. Species within this family, particularly
Ganoderma lucidum, have been valued for centuries in regions such as
China, Korea, and Japan for enhancing vitality, longevity, and overall
health. However, the taxonomy of Ganodermataceae remains complex, with
ongoing debates about species identification and classification. Members
of this family are globally distributed, with the Lower Mekong
Basin—comprising Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam—offering optimal
conditions for their growth due to its warm, humid climate. In the Lower
Mekong Basin, the species of Ganodermataceae are significant for their
medicinal applications in treating conditions such as bronchitis,
hepatitis, diabetes, and cancer. They also hold significant economic
value, being used in products like teas, dietary supplements, and
cosmetics. Ganoderma lucidum is particularly notable as a high-value
market product in this region. Recent research has revealed a rich
diversity of Ganodermataceae species in the region, highlighting their
ecological roles, medicinal properties, and importance in plant
pathology, particularly in addressing diseases in crops such as oil
palm. These findings underscore the need for further research into the
taxonomy, ecological functions, and potential applications of
Ganodermataceae species. Advancing our understanding will support
sustainable utilization, conservation efforts, and the maximization of
their medicinal and commercial benefits.</p>

resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group and genetic diversity of
Escherichia coli isolated from Tibetan pig farms in Garze Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionTo investigate the correlations among antibiotic
resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group, and genetic diversity,
providing essential data for Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection
prevention and control in Tibetan pigs.MethodsA total of 244 E. coli
isolates were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using
the microdilution method. PCR was used to detect antibiotic resistance
genes (ARGs), virulence genes, and phylogenetic groups. Genetic
diversity was analyzed using enterobacterial repetitive element
sequence-based PCR. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 5-12, a
representative strain with multidrug resistance and strong
biofilm-forming ability, harboring abundant virulence genes, was
selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to validate PCR
results.ResultsAmong the 244 isolates, 84.43% showed multidrug
resistance (MDR), with the highest resistance rates for chloramphenicol
(99.59%), sulfadiazine (96.31%), and sulfamethoxazole (93.85%).
Twenty-five ARGs were detected, with ant(3’)-Ia, blaTEM, aac(3’)-II,
floR, and qnrS exceeding 80% detection rates. Integrase genes intl1 and
intl2 were found in 90.16% and 15.16% of isolates, respectively.
Seventeen virulence genes were detected; bcsA (98.77%), fimC (89.75%),
and agn43 (59.43%) were the most prevalent. A total of 106 virulence
patterns were identified, with agn43/bcsA/fimC being predominant
(17.92%). Most strains belonged to phylogenetic group A (45.90%),
followed by B1 (34.43%), while 29 strains were unclassified. Sixty-four
isolates were identified as diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC), predominantly
enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 90.63%). Biofilm-forming ability was
categorized as strong (4.69%), moderate (21.88%), weak (59.38%), or
absent (14.06%). Clustering based on 61.2% similarity grouped the 64 DEC
into five clusters, with 84.38% in cluster II, which contained all
strong biofilm producers.DiscussionAntimicrobial resistance profiles of
EAEC 5–12 confirmed that primarily confer resistance through antibiotic
efflux, target alteration, and reduced permeability. These findings will
contribute to further understanding the positive correlation between
antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in E. coli from Tibetan pig
farms, shedding light on the rational use of antimicrobial agents and
tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis in Tibetan pig breeding in
Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China.</p>

sequencing-based early microbiological response: a proof-of-concept
prospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesVentilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections
(VA-LRTIs) cause significant mortality. This study was assigned to
explore the association between early microbiological responses defined
by quantitative targeted amplicon-based next-generation sequencing
(QtNGS) and clinical outcomes in patients with Acinetobacter
baumannii-dominant VA-LRTI.Measurements and main resultsA prospective
observational study including 34 participants was conducted to assess
the probability of predicting clinical outcomes using sequencing-based
early microbiological response. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs)
were collected at admission and 3 days post-treatment from these
patients for QtNGS to determine the relative quantification ratio (RQR)
of A. baumannii. Patients were categorized into survival (n=26) and
non-survival (n=8) groups. The RQR was calculated as the quantification
of A. baumannii determined by QtNGS after treatment to pretreatment. RQR
significantly increased on day 4 in the non-survival group (median
5.285), and decreased in the survival group (median 0.1864). Receiver’s
operation characteristic curves revealed that an RQR ≥1.41 was
predictive of poor outcomes, with an area under the curve of 0.9471
(0.8759-1). The accuracy of the RQR determined by QtNGS was further
evaluated by retesting the same specimen using digital droplet PCR, and
the linear correlation was confirmed in the RQR calculated by two
methods. The 23 patients with RQR&lt;1.41 all survived for 28 days,
whereas the survival rate for the 11 patients with RQR ≥1.41 was 27.27%.
RQR was significantly and positively correlated with the length of ICU
stay in survivors.ConclusionsThe RQR of A. baumannii detected by QtNGS
correlates with the prognosis of VA-LRTI patients.</p>
