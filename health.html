identification in ticks and yaks from Zoige County, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background:Ticks represent a significant vector for the transmission
of infectious diseases, with the prevalence of tick-borne diseases
becoming a prominent global health concern in recent decades. Anaplasma
spp., Rickettsia spp., and Piroplasma have been identified as
significant pathogens with the potential to impact human and animal
health. However, there is a dearth of data concerning the prevalence of
these pathogens in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China.MethodsIn this
study, a total of 643 Dermacentor silvarum and 314 Haemaphysalis
longicornis were identified through the application of morphological and
molecular identification techniques on 957 ticks collected from yaks in
Zoige County. The assessed of Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Theileria
spp., and Babesia spp. was assessed in 957 ticks and 96 blood samples
collected from yaks.ResultsSignificant discrepancies were observed in
the positivity rates for the four pathogens among the tick species and
sampling sites. The identification of different species within the four
pathogens was based on the analysis of the 16S rRNA of Anaplasma spp.,
the ompA and ompB genes of Rickettsia spp., and the 18S rRNA of
Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. The prevalence ranges of the four
pathogens are 9.9-50.2%, 29.5-100%, 16.2-46.4%, and 14.5-58.4%,
respectively.ConclusionIn view of the growing zoonotic risks, further
investigations into the prevalence of additional pathogens in ticks and
animals, including livestock, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, are
essential.</p>

ovarian cancer-associated microbiome contributes to the tumor’s
inflammatory microenvironment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>A growing body of research has established a correlation between
tumors and persistent chronic inflammatory infiltration. As a primary
instigator of inflammation, the majority of microbiomes naturally
residing within our bodies engage in a mutually beneficial symbiotic
relationship. Nevertheless, alterations in the microbiome’s composition
or breaches in the normal barrier function can disrupt the internal
environment’s homeostasis, potentially leading to the development and
progression of various diseases, including tumors. The investigation of
tumor-related microbiomes has contributed to a deeper understanding of
their role in tumorigenesis. This review offers a comprehensive overview
of the microbiome alterations and the associated inflammatory changes in
ovarian cancer. It may aid in advancing research to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the ovarian cancer-associated microbiome,
providing potential theoretical support for the future development of
microbiome-targeted antitumor therapies and early screening through
convenient methods.</p>

mycobacteria enhance the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway to induce
immunosuppression and facilitate pulmonary colonization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM)
infections alongside tuberculosis (TB) underscores a pressing public
health challenge. Yet, the mechanisms governing their infection within
the lung remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic
sequencing, metabolomic sequencing, machine learning classifiers,
SparCC, and MetOrigin methods to profile bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) samples from NTM/TB patients. Our aim is to unravel the intricate
interplay between lung microbial communities and NTM/Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infections. Our investigation reveals a discernible
reduction in the compositional diversity of the lung microbiota and a
diminished degree of mutual interaction concomitant with NTM/TB
infections. Notably, NTM patients exhibit a distinct microbial community
characterized by marked specialization and notable enrichment of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, driving pronounced
niche specialization for NTM infection. Simultaneously, these microbial
shifts significantly disrupt tryptophan metabolism in NTM infection,
leading to an elevation of kynurenine. Mycobacterium intracellulare,
Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, Mycobacterium abscessus, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in the metabolic pathways
associated with the conversion of indole to tryptophan via tryptophan
synthase within NTM patients. Additionally, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
converts tryptophan into kynurenine, fostering an immunosuppressive
milieu during NTM infection. This strategic modulation supports
microbial persistence, enabling evasion from immune surveillance and
perpetuating a protracted state of NTM infection. The elucidation of
these nuanced microbial and metabolic dynamics provides a profound
understanding of the intricate processes underlying NTM and TB
infections, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and
management.</p>
