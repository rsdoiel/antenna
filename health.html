id="genetic-diversity-of-plasmodium-malariae-in-sub-saharan-africa-a-two-marker-genotyping-approach-for-molecular-epidemiological-studies">Genetic
diversity of Plasmodium malariae in sub-Saharan Africa: a two-marker
genotyping approach for molecular epidemiological studies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPlasmodium malariae is the most common non-falciparum
species in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, data on its genetic
diversity is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to establish a P. malariae
genotyping approach based on size polymorphic regions that can be easily
applied in molecular epidemiological studies.MethodsFour potential
genotyping markers, Pm02, Pm09, P. malariae thrombospondin-related
anonymous protein (pmtrap), and P. malariae merozoite surface protein
fragment 2 (pmmsp1 F2) were amplified via nested PCR and analysed using
automated capillary gel electrophoresis.ResultsWe observed the highest
allelic diversity for pmtrap (MOI = 1.61) and pmmsp1 F2 (He = 0.81).
Further applying the two markers pmtrap and pmmsp1 F2 on a different
sample set of 21 P. malariae positive individuals followed up over one
week, we saw a high consistency in their performance. The results show a
large complexity and high dynamics of P. malariae infections in the
asymptomatic Gabonese study population.DiscussionWe successfully
implemented a new genotyping panel for P. malariae consisting of only
two markers: pmtrap and pmmsp1 F2. It can be easily applied in other
settings to investigate the genotype diversity of P. malariae
populations, providing further important data on the molecular
epidemiology of this parasite species.</p>

id="the-rna-chaperone-hfq-has-a-multifaceted-role-in-edwardsiella-ictaluri">The
RNA chaperone Hfq has a multifaceted role in Edwardsiella ictaluri</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Edwardsiella ictaluri is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular
bacterium that causes enteric septicemia in catfish (ESC). The RNA
chaperone Hfq (host factor for phage Qβ replication) facilitates gene
regulation via small RNAs (sRNAs) in various pathogenic bacteria.
Despite its significance in other bacterial species, the role of hfq in
E. ictaluri remains unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the role
of hfq in E. ictaluri by creating an hfq mutant (EiΔhfq) through
in-frame gene deletion and characterization. Our findings revealed that
the Hfq protein is highly conserved within the genus Edwardsiella. The
deletion of hfq resulted in a significantly reduced growth rate during
the late exponential phase. Additionally, EiΔhfq displayed a diminished
capacity for biofilm formation and exhibited increased motility. Under
acidic and oxidative stress conditions, EiΔhfq demonstrated impaired
growth, and we observed elevated hfq expression when subjected to in
vitro and in vivo stress conditions. EiΔhfq exhibited reduced survival
within catfish peritoneal macrophages, although it had no discernible
effect on the adherence and invasion of epithelial cells. The infection
model revealed that hfq is needed for bacterial persistence in catfish,
and its absence caused significant virulence attenuation in catfish.
Finally, the EiΔhfq vaccination completely protected catfish against
subsequent EiWT infection. In summary, these results underscore the
pivotal role of hfq in E. ictaluri, affecting its growth, motility,
biofilm formation, stress response, and virulence in macrophages and
within catfish host.</p>

detection of human cytomegalovirus by multienzyme isothermal rapid
amplification and lateral flow dipsticks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common viral
infection seen in newborns. The major route of transmission for acquired
human cytomegalovirus infection is breast milk from mothers who are HCMV
seropositive to the infants. Thus, a rapid, economical, and simple
method to perform HCMV test in breast milk is crucial and necessary for
preventing acquired HCMV infection, especially in underdeveloped regions
with limited laboratory resources.MethodsIn this study, an effective
technique for the detection of HCMV was constructed by combining
multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification (MIRA) and lateral flow
chromatography strip (LFD). Primers for the conserved HCMV sequence UL83
were utilized for MIRA-LFD testing.ResultsOur results showed that the
entire MIRA reaction could be completed in 12 minutes at 37°C, and LFD
outcomes could be observed visibly after 10 minutes. The detection
sensitivity of this method reached 50 copy/μl. Samples of breast milk
were examined to compare MIRA-LFD and conventional qPCR. The accuracy of
MIRA-LFD was 100%.DiscussionThe straightforward, rapid, economic
features of the test can provide the significant advantages for the
prevention of breast milk-acquired cytomegalovirus infection,
particularly in resource-limited locations with high seroprevalence of
cytomegalovirus.</p>

of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter
baumannii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Patients with severe carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
(CRAB) infections currently face significant treatment challenges. When
patients display signs of infection and the clinical suspicion of CRAB
infections is high, appropriate treatment should be immediately
provided. However, current treatment plans and clinical data for CRAB
are limited. Inherent and acquired resistance mechanisms, as well as
host factors, significantly restrict options for empirical medication.
Moreover, inappropriate drug coverage can have detrimental effects on
patients. Most existing studies have limitations, such as a restricted
sample size, and are predominantly observational or non-randomized,
which report significant variability in patient infection severity and
comorbidities. Therefore, a gold-standard therapy remains lacking.
Current and future treatment options of infections due to CRAB were
described in this review. The dose and considerable side effects
restrict treatment options for polymyxins, and high doses of
ampicillin-sulbactam or tigecycline appear to be the best option at the
time of initial treatment. Moreover, new drugs such as durlobactam and
cefiderocol have substantial therapeutic capabilities and may be
effective salvage treatments. Bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides
may serve as alternative treatment options in the near future. The
advantages of a combination antimicrobial regimen appear to predominate
those of a single regimen. Despite its significant nephrotoxicity,
colistin is considered a primary treatment and is often used in
combination with antimicrobials, such as tigecycline,
ampicillin-sulbactam, meropenem, or fosfomycin. The Infectious Diseases
Society of America (IDSA) has deemed high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam,
which is typically combined with high-dose tigecycline, polymyxin, and
other antibacterial agents, the best option for treating serious CRAB
infections. A rational combination of drug use and the exploration of
new therapeutic drugs can alleviate or prevent the effects of CRAB
infections, shorten hospital stays, and reduce patient mortality.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo explore the underlying mechanisms the airway microbiome
contributes to Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease(AECOPD).MethodsWe enrolled 31 AECOPD patients and 26 stable COPD
patients, their sputum samples were collected for metagenomic and RNA
sequencing, and then subjected to bioinformatic analyses. The expression
of host genes was validated by Quantitative Real-time PCR(qPCR) using
the same batch of specimens.ResultsOur results indicated a higher
expression of Rothia mucilaginosa(p=0.015) in the AECOPD group and
Haemophilus influenzae(p=0.005) in the COPD group. The Different
expressed genes(DEGs) detected were significantly enriched in “type I
interferon signaling pathway”(p&lt;0.001, q=0.001) in gene function
annotation, and “Cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway”(p=0.002, q=0.024),
“Toll-like receptor signaling pathway”(p=0.006, q=0.045), and “TNF
signaling pathway”(p=0.006, q=0.045) in KEGG enrichment analysis. qPCR
amplification experiment verified that the expression of OASL and IL6
increased significantly in the AECOPD group.ConclusionPulmonary bacteria
dysbiosis may regulate the pathogenesis of AECOPD through innate immune
system pathways like type I interferon signaling pathway and Toll-like
receptor signaling pathway.</p>

Limosilactobacillus reuteri KUB-AC5 decreases urothelial cell invasion
and enhances macrophage killing of uropathogenic Escherichia coli in
vitro study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionBacterial urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the
most common infectious diseases worldwide. The rise of
multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) UTI
cases is a significant threat to healthcare systems. Several probiotic
bacteria have been proposed as an alternative to combat MDR UTI. Lactic
acid bacteria in the genus Limosilactobacillus are some of the most
studied and used probiotics. However, strain-specific effects play a
critical role in probiotic properties. L. reuteri KUB-AC5 (AC5),
isolated from the chicken gut, confers antimicrobial and immunobiotic
effects against some human pathogens. However, the antibacterial and
immune modulatory effects of AC5 on UPEC have never been
explored.MethodsHere, we investigated both the direct and indirect
effects of AC5 against UPEC isolates (UTI89, CFT073, and clinical MDR
UPEC AT31) in vitro. Using a spot-on lawn, agar-well diffusion, and
competitive growth assays, we found that viable AC5 cells and cell-free
components of this probiotic significantly reduced the UPEC growth of
all strains tested. The human bladder epithelial cell line UM-UC-3 was
used to assess the adhesion and pathogen-attachment inhibition
properties of AC5 on UPEC.Results and discussionOur data showed that AC5
can attach to UM-UC-3 and decrease UPEC attachment in a dose-dependent
manner. Pretreatment of UPEC-infected murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells
with viable AC5 (multiplicity of infection, MOI = 1) for 24 hours
enhanced macrophage-killing activity and increased proinflammatory
(Nos2, Il6, and Tnfa) and anti-inflammatory (Il10) gene expression.
These findings indicate the gut-derived AC5 probiotic could be a
potential urogenital probiotic against MDR UTI.</p>

of tick-borne bacterial pathogens in Germany—has the situation changed
after a decade?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionTick-borne pathogens, such as Borreliella spp.,
Rickettsia spp., and Anaplasma spp., are frequently detected in Germany.
They circulate between animals and tick vectors and can cause mild to
severe diseases in humans. Knowledge about distribution and prevalence
of these pathogens over time is important for risk assessment of human
and animal health.MethodsIxodes ricinus nymphs were collected at
different locations in 2009/2010 and 2019 in Germany and analyzed for
tick-borne pathogens by real-time PCR and sequencing.ResultsBorreliella
spp. were detected with a prevalence of 11.96% in 2009/2010 and 13.10%
in 2019 with B. afzelii and B. garinii as dominant species. Borrelia
miyamotoi was detected in seven ticks and in coinfection with B. afzelii
or B. garinii. Rickettsia spp. showed a prevalence of 8.82% in 2009/2010
and 1.68% in 2019 with the exclusive detection of R. helvetica. The
prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 1.00% in 2009/2010 and 7.01% in 2019.
A. phagocytophilum was detected in seven tick samples. None of the
nymphs were positive for C. burnetii.DiscussionHere, observed changes in
prevalence were not significant after a decade but require longitudinal
observations including parameters like host species and density,
climatic factors to improve our understanding of tick-borne
diseases.</p>

a PAAR-domain containing protein, plays roles in the fitness and
virulence of Acinetobacter baumannii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundType VI secretion system (T6SS) is widely present in
Gram-negative bacteria and directly mediates antagonistic prokaryote
interactions. PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine repeats) proteins
have been proven essential for T6SS-mediated secretion and target cell
killing. Although PAAR proteins are commonly found in A. baumannii,
their biological functions are not fully disclosed yet. In this study,
we investigated the functions of a PAAR protein termed TagP
(T6SS-associated-gene PAAR), encoded by the gene ACX60_RS09070 outside
the core T6SS locus of A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978.MethodsIn this
study, tagP null and complement A. baumannii ATCC 17978 strains were
constructed. The influence of TagP on T6SS function was investigated
through Hcp detection and bacterial competition assay; the influence on
environmental fitness was studied through in vitro growth, biofilm
formation assay, surface motility assay, survivability in various
simulated environmental conditions; the influence on pathogenicity was
explored through cell adhesion and invasion assays, intramacrophage
survival assay, serum survival assay, and G. melonella Killing assays.
Quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were utilized to
observe the global impact of TagP on bacterial status.ResultsCompared
with the wildtype strain, the tagP null mutant was impaired in several
tested phenotypes such as surface motility, biofilm formation, tolerance
to adverse environments, adherence to eukaryotic cells, endurance to
serum complement killing, and virulence to Galleria melonella. Notably,
although RNA-Seq and proteomics analysis revealed that many genes were
significantly down-regulated in the tagP null mutant compared to the
wildtype strain, there is no significant difference in their
antagonistic abilities. We also found that Histone-like nucleoid
structuring protein (H-NS) was significantly upregulated in the tagP
null mutant at both mRNA and protein levels.ConclusionsThis study
enriches our understanding of the biofunction of PAAR proteins in A.
baumannii. The results indicates that TagP involved in a unique
modulation of fitness and virulence control in A. baumannii, it is more
than a classic PAAR protein involved in T6SS, while how TagP play roles
in the fitness and virulence of A. baumannii needs further investigation
to clarify.</p>

and mechanisms targeting Enterococcus faecalis biofilms associated with
endodontic infections: a comprehensive review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Enterococcus faecalis is one of the main microorganisms that infects
root canals, ranking among the most prevalent microorganisms associated
with endodontic treatment failure. Given its pervasive presence in
persistent endodontic infections, the successful elimination of
Enterococcus faecalis is crucial for effective endodontic treatment and
retreatment. Furthermore, Enterococcus faecalis can form biofilms -
defense structures that microbes use to fight environmental threats.
These biofilms confer resistance against host immune system attacks and
antibiotic interventions. Consequently, the presence of biofilms poses a
significant challenge in the complete eradication of Enterococcus
faecalis and its associated disease. In response, numerous scholars have
discovered promising outcomes in addressing Enterococcus faecalis
biofilms within root canals and undertaken endeavors to explore more
efficacious approaches in combating these biofilms. This study provides
a comprehensive review of strategies and mechanisms for the removal of
Enterococcus faecalis biofilms.</p>

of Amblyomma americanum microRNAs in response to Ehrlichia chaffeensis
infection and their potential role in vectorial capacity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a subset of small noncoding
RNAs and carry tremendous potential for regulating gene expression at
the post-transcriptional level. They play pivotal roles in distinct
cellular mechanisms including inhibition of bacterial, parasitic, and
viral infections via immune response pathways. Intriguingly, pathogens
have developed strategies to manipulate the host’s miRNA profile,
fostering environments conducive to successful infection. Therefore,
changes in an arthropod host’s miRNA profile in response to pathogen
invasion could be critical in understanding host-pathogen dynamics.
Additionally, this area of study could provide insights into discovering
new targets for disease control and prevention. The main objective of
the present study is to investigate the functional role of
differentially expressed miRNAs upon Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a tick-borne
pathogen, infection in tick vector, Amblyomma americanum.MethodsSmall
RNA libraries from uninfected and E. chaffeensis-infected Am. americanum
midgut and salivary gland tissues were prepared using the Illumina
Truseq kit. Small RNA sequencing data was analyzed using miRDeep2 and
sRNAtoolbox to identify novel and known miRNAs. The differentially
expressed miRNAs were validated using a quantitative PCR assay.
Furthermore, a miRNA inhibitor approach was used to determine the
functional role of selected miRNA candidates.ResultsThe sequencing of
small RNA libraries generated &gt;147 million raw reads in all four
libraries and identified a total of &gt;250 miRNAs across the four
libraries. We identified 23 and 14 differentially expressed miRNAs in
salivary glands, and midgut tissues infected with E. chaffeensis,
respectively. Three differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-87, miR-750,
and miR-275) were further characterized to determine their roles in
pathogen infection. Inhibition of target miRNAs significantly decreased
the E. chaffeensis load in tick tissues, which warrants more in-depth
mechanistic studies.ConclusionsThe current study identified known and
novel miRNAs and suggests that interfering with these miRNAs may impact
the vectorial capacity of ticks to harbor Ehrlichia. This study
identified several new miRNAs for future analysis of their functions in
tick biology and tick-pathogen interaction studies.</p>

analysis of gut microbiome and its metabolites in ACE2-knockout and
ACE2-overexpressed mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAberrant activation of the classic renin–angiotensin system
(RAS) and intestinal micro dysbiosis adversely affect insulin resistance
(IR), dyslipidemia, and other metabolic syndrome markers. However, the
action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and gut health in
systemic homeostasis vary, and their interaction is not completely
understood.MethodsWe adopted a combinatory approach of metabolomics and
fecal 16S rRNA analysis to investigate gut microbiota and metabolite in
two different mouse models, ACE2 knockout (ACE2 KO) mice and the
ACE2-overexpressing obese mice.Results16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed
that ACE2 influences microbial community composition and function, and
ACE2 KO mice had increased Deferribacteres, Alcaligenaceae,
Parasutterella, Catenibacterium, and Anaerotruncus, with decreased
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (Marvinbryantia and
Alistipes). In contrast, ACE2-overexpressed mice exhibited increased
anti-inflammatory probiotic (Oscillospiraceae, Marinifilaceae, and
Bifidobacteriaceae) and SCFA-producing microbes (Rikenellaceae,
Muribaculaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Odoribacter, and Alistipes) and
decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillaceae,
Erysipelotrichaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Metabolome analysis indicated
differential metabolites in ACE2 KO and ACE2-overexpression mice,
especially the glucolipid metabolism-related compounds. Furthermore,
correlation analysis between gut microbiota and metabolites showed a
dynamic mutual influence affecting host health.ConclusionOur study
confirms for the first time a significant association between ACE2
status and gut microbiome and metabolome profiles, providing a novel
mechanism for the positive effect of ACE2 on energy homeostasis.</p>

analysis in systemic microbial-induced experimental periodontal disease
in mice with different susceptibility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThe study delved into the epigenetic factors associated with
periodontal disease in two lineages of mice, namely C57bl/6 and
Balb/c. Its primary objective was to elucidate alterations in the
methylome of mice with distinct genetic backgrounds following systemic
microbial challenge, employing high-throughput DNA methylation analysis
as the investigative tool.MethodsPorphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)was orally
administered to induce periodontitis in both Balb/c and C57bl/6 lineage.
After euthanasia, genomic DNA from both maxilla and blood were subjected
to bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification and genome-wide DNA
methylation analysis using the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System coupled
with the Illumina Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip.ResultsOf
particular significance was the distinct methylation profile observed
within the Pg-induced group of the Balb/c lineage, contrasting with both
the control and Pg-induced groups of the C57bl/6 lineage. Utilizing
rigorous filtering criteria, we successfully identified a substantial
number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across various
tissues and comparison groups, shedding light on the prevailing
hypermethylation in non-induced cohorts and hypomethylation in induced
groups. The comparison between blood and maxilla samples underscored the
unique methylation patterns specific to the jaw tissue. Our
comprehensive methylome analysis further unveiled statistically
significant disparities, particularly within promoter regions, in
several comparison groups.ConclusionThe differential DNA methylation
patterns observed between C57bl/6 and Balb/c mouse lines suggest that
epigenetic factors contribute to the variations in disease
susceptibility. The identified differentially methylated regions
associated with immune regulation and inflammatory response provide
potential targets for further investigation. These findings emphasize
the importance of considering epigenetic mechanisms in the development
and progression of periodontitis.</p>

<p>AimsThis study is designed to generalize and depict the research
hotspots of endophthalmitis through bibliometric methods and software
and analyze the evolutive tendency of the work on this severe disease
over the past 30 years.MethodsThis study employed a rigorous
bibliometric approach. We identified all endophthalmitis-related

the co-cited journals, and the keywords co-occurrence network. This
robust methodology ensures the reliability and validity of the study’s
findings.ResultsA total of 2960 publications, including 2695 articles
and 265 reviews, were included in this bibliometric study. There has
been no shortage of endophthalmitis-related publications since 1993,
with an apparent upward trend during recent years. Possible correlations
with the COVID-19 pandemic are also analyzed. These studies were
finished by 11,048 authors from 75 countries worldwide, with the United
States in the lead. In the keyword co-occurrence network, except for the
endophthalmitis term, cataract surgery becomes the keyword with the
highest frequency. Different categories of endophthalmitis, including
postoperative, post-injection, post-traumatic, and endogenous
endophthalmitis, and antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapies of
infectious endophthalmitis, are discussed by categories. From the
perspective of the timeline, postoperative and post-injection
endophthalmitis were the dominant forms before and after the year 2000,
respectively. Co-citation analyses reveal that the Endophthalmitis
Vitrectomy Study (EVS) conducted in 1995 provides pivotal guidance for
later research. Diverse pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Coagulase-negative
Staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, Viridians Streptococci, and
Bacillus cereus) or fungi (e.g., Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium)
contribute to varying treatment principles and clinical prognosis, which
should be taken seriously. In addition, intravitreal and intracameral
antibiotics are the mainstay for treating and preventing infectious
endophthalmitis, respectively.ConclusionOur bibliometric analysis
provides an overview of dynamic evolution and structural relationships
in the research field of endophthalmitis. The displayed hotspots and
developmental directions have reference values for future
investigation.</p>

mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus arrhizus diagnosis via metagenomics
next-generation sequencing: a case report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is a rare, invasive, and
fatal fungal disease that is often easily misdiagnosed in the early
stages due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations and adequate
auxiliary examinations. Early diagnosis and timely therapy are essential
for successful treatment. In this report, we presented a 46-year-old man
with diabetes who experienced gradual vision loss, right ptosis,
swelling, and headaches that progressively worsened to death within 4
days after admission. It was finally confirmed as a fungal Rhizopus
arrhizus infection by metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS).
Our report has proved that mNGS testing should be strongly recommended
in highly suspected patients.</p>

TRIM proteins’ role in antiviral defense against influenza A virus and
respiratory coronaviruses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, identified as E3 ubiquitin
ligases, participate in various viral infections through ubiquitylation,
ISGylation, and SUMOylation processes. Respiratory viruses, particularly
influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs), have
severely threatened public health with high morbidity and mortality,
causing incalculable losses. Research on the regulation of TRIM proteins
in respiratory virus infections is crucial for disease prevention and
control. This review introduces TRIM proteins, summarizes recent
discoveries regarding their roles and molecular mechanisms in IAV and
CoVs infections, discusses current research gaps, and explores potential
future trends in this rapidly developing field. It aims to enhance
understanding of virus–host interactions and inform the development of
new molecularly targeted therapies.</p>

endocarditis - a stone left after the pandemic cascade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Infective endocarditis is a rare disease in children. The etiology is
mainly bacterial. However, viral infective endocarditis, possibly
related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
has also been reported. The pathophysiological principle of the
connection between the two entities seems to be attributed to the
transient immune deficiency of the body during the infection.
Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is reported in the literature as a direct
cardiopathic virus. Therefore, the new coronavirus seems to have the
ability to affect both the intact cardiac tissue and the previously
damaged one both during the acute episode and at a distance from it.
Consequently, we propose to review the main pathophysiological aspects
of pediatric cardiac damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The ultimate goal is
to deepen existing knowledge, broaden the horizon of understanding and
analysis regarding the systemic damage induced by viral infections, and
strengthen an information base from which to start a meta-analysis.
Next, we performed a non-systematized screening of the specialized
literature with reference to cases of endocarditis in the pediatric
population, reported in the period 2020–2023. From the total of articles
found, we chose to include in the review a number of 6 case reports,
including a number of 7 patients (5 children and 2 adolescents).
Analysis of reports suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could play a role
in the development of endocarditis, either directly through active
infection or indirectly through a post-infectious immune response. Also,
pre-existing conditions and complex medical history predispose to an
increased risk of developing a severe, complicated form of endocarditis.
Also, the lack of data on the vaccination history and the failure to
categorize the infection depending on the type of antibodies (IgM or
IgG) in some studies represent a major bias in the reports. The latter
make it difficult to evaluate the influence of vaccination and the
impact of acute versus chronic infection on the course of cases.</p>

stability of acquired drug resistance and resistance associated
mutations in the fungal pathogen Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida
glabrata)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The limited number of available antifungal drugs and the increasing
number of fungal isolates that show drug or multidrug resistance pose a
serious medical threat. Several yeast pathogens, such as Nakaseomyces
glabratus (Candida glabrata), show a remarkable ability to develop drug
resistance during treatment through the acquisition of genetic
mutations. However, how stable this resistance and the underlying
mutations are in non-selective conditions remains poorly characterized.
The stability of acquired drug resistance has fundamental implications
for our understanding of the appearance and spread of drug-resistant
outbreaks and for defining efficient strategies to combat them. Here, we
used an in vitro evolution approach to assess the stability under
optimal growth conditions of resistance phenotypes and
resistance-associated mutations that were previously acquired under
exposure to antifungals. Our results reveal a remarkable stability of
the resistant phenotype and the underlying mutations in a significant
number of evolved populations, which conserved their phenotype for at
least two months in the absence of drug-selective pressure. We observed
a higher stability of anidulafungin resistance over fluconazole
resistance, and of resistance-conferring point mutations as compared
with aneuploidies. In addition, we detected accumulation of novel
mutations in previously altered resistance-associated genes in
non-selective conditions, which suggest a possible compensatory role. We
conclude that acquired resistance, particularly to anidulafungin, is a
long-lasting phenotype, which has important implications for the
persistence and propagation of drug-resistant clinical outbreaks.</p>

fatal pneumonia and bacteremia due to Aeromonas dhakensis in an
immunocompetent man: a case report and literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAeromonas dhakensis is associated with soft tissue
infection, bacteremia and gastroenteritis. Involvement of respiratory
system in adults is extremely rare. We report a case of fulminant
pneumonia and bacteremia due to A. dhakensis in a patient without
underlying diseases.Case presentationA 26-year-old man became ill
suddenly with pneumonia after swimming in a river. Despite intensive
support measures in the intensive care unit, he died 13 hours after
admission and 4 days after his first symptoms. Autopsy showed abundant
Gram-negative bacteria, massive inflammatory cell infiltration, edema,
necrosis and hemorrhage in lung tissue. A. dhakensis was isolated from
blood culture taken at admission and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
after intubation. Moreover, A. dhakensis was also detected in lung
tissue by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay. The
infection may have come from river water.ConclusionIn patients who
develop a fulminant pneumonia after contacting an aquatic environment,
A. dhakensis should be alerted and mNGS may aid in the detection of
aquatic pathogens by being more sensitive and specific versus
traditional bacterial culture.</p>

derivatives ameliorate the intestinal inflammation and pathogenic gut
microbiome changes in the model of infectious colitis through
antibacterial activity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Coumarin, a phenolic compound, is a secondary metabolite produced by
plants such as Tanga and Lime. Coumarin derivatives were prepared via
Pechmann condensation. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo
experiments to determine the antimicrobial and gut immune-regulatory
functions of coumarin derivatives. For the in vitro antimicrobial
activity assay, coumarin derivatives C1 and C2 were selected based on
their pathogen-killing activity against various pathogenic microbes. We
further demonstrated that the selected coumarin derivatives disrupted
bacterial cell membranes. Next, we examined the regulatory function of
the coumarin derivatives in gut inflammation using an infectious colitis
model. In an in vivo infectious colitis model, administration of
selected C1 coumarin derivatives reduced pathogen loads, the number of
inflammatory immune cells (Th1 cells and Th17 cells), and inflammatory
cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-1b) in the intestinal tissue after pathogen
infection. In addition, we found that the administration of C1 coumarin
derivatives minimized abnormal gut microbiome shift-driven pathogen
infection. Potential pathogenic gut microbes, such as Enterobacteriaceae
and Staphylococcaceae, were increased by pathogen infection. However,
this pathogenic microbial expansion was minimized and beneficial
bacteria, such as Ligilactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus, increased
with C1 coumarin derivative treatment. Functional gene enrichment
assessment revealed that the relative abundance of genes associated with
lipid and nucleotide metabolism was reduced by pathogen infection;
however, this phenomenon was not observed in C1 coumarin
derivative-treated animals. Collectively, our data suggest that C1
coumarin derivative is effective antibacterial agents that minimize
pathogen-induced gut inflammation and abnormal gut microbiome modulation
through their antibacterial activity.</p>
