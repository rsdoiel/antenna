id="screening-and-identification-of-protein-29-of-echinococcus-granulosus-interacting-molecules">Screening
and identification of protein 29 of Echinococcus granulosus interacting
molecules</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEg.P29 is a specific protein of E.granulosus metacestod,
and has been able to induce high levels of protection in mice and sheep
against challenge with protoscolex of E.granulosus. Therefore, Eg.P29
plays a crucial role in the growth and development of the E. granulosus
metacestode. However, the function of Eg.P29 remains unknown. During the
process life, protein is commonly with other proteins to form a complex
network of interactions to play the function. In this study, we
identified the interacting molecules of Eg.P29 for foundation to
exploring the function of Eg.P29 in E. granulosus
metacestode.MethodsSome basic information about Eg.P29 through
bioinformatics software. A total of 50 molecules interacting with Eg.P29
were screened by three immunoprecipitation-combined liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry intersections. The
Eg.P29/pEGFP-C1 vector was transfected into cells to observe the
morphological changes. Seven molecules as actin and actin-related
proteins were screened using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes analyses, and the effects of Eg.P29 on them were
verified at the mRNA and protein levels. Interacting proteins of Eg.P29
were identified by yeast two-hybrid assay and immunoprecipitation. The
localization and distribution of Eg.P29 and Eg.actin on protoscolex were
observed by immunohistochemistry.ResultsEg.P29 is a soluble cytoplasmic
protein containing a BAR structural domain that may play a role in actin
polarity and endocytosis. Cells in the Eg.P29 group showed marked
morphological changes in the form of rounded, or oval shapes, which were
attributed to changes in actin distribution. Seven molecules interacting
with Eg.P29 were mainly actin and actin-related proteins (ACTG1, ACTN4,
VCL, ARPC1A, LIMA1, FLNB and MYH10), and their mRNA and protein levels
were significantly affected by Eg.P29. Yeast two-hybridization
experiments showed that VCL did not interact with Eg.P29, whereas the
other molecules interacted with Eg.P29. The interaction of LIMA1 and
actin with Eg.P29 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally,
Eg.P29 and Eg.actin had the same histological location on rostellum, and
suckers of the protoscolex. Additionally, the seven molecules were all
discovered their homologous proteins in E.granulosus and formed a
network of interacting proteins.DiscussionIn this study, we confirmed
LIMA1 and actin were Eg.P29-interacting molecules, they were forming a
compound regulation system to affect cytoskeleton formation. And we also
deduced that Eg.P29 interacts with Eg.actin in E. granulosus, which
collaborate to affect the activity and development of protoscolex. These
aspects warrant further in-depth study.</p>

encephalitis virus-associated human microglia induce cell death of human
microvascular endothelial cells in receptor-independent infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe neurotropic virus Japanese encephalitis virus invades
the human central nervous system, inducing neuroinflammation and further
disruption of the blood-brain barrier. JEV interacts with various cell
types of the blood-brain barrier including the endothelial cells. The
present work aims to investigate impact of receptor-dependent and
independent infection of human microvascular endothelial cells by
Japanese encephalitis virus.MethodsReceptor-dependent infection was
achieved using cell-free virus while receptor-independent infection was
by co-culture of microvascular endothelial cells with virus-associated
microglia.ResultsWhile both receptor-dependent and independent
infections of human microvascular endothelial cells led to virus
propagation, only receptor-independent infection induced cell death of
human microvascular endothelial cells. While the CX3CR1-CX3CL1 axis was
inefficient in blocking virus rescue and protecting endothelial cell
from cell death, transcriptomics analysis identified Tumour Necrosis
Factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand and receptors as potential key
player leading to endothelial cell death.DiscussionOverall, our findings
demonstrate that human microvascular endothelial cells supply virus
propagation and Japanese encephalitis virus-associated microglia greatly
contribute to endothelial cell death, an important component of the
blood brain barrier integrity. Importantly, Tumour Necrosis
Factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand and receptors represents a
promising therapeutic target preventing microvascular endothelial cell
death after neuroinvasion.</p>

fluid fibrin degradation product can be used as a new auxiliary marker
for periprosthetic joint infection diagnosis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundWhile the value of blood coagulation markers, such as
D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, platelet count/mean platelet volume ratio (PC/MPV),
and Fibrin Degradation Product (FDP), in the diagnosis of periprosthetic
joint infection (PJI) has been explored in recent years, the
significance of synovial fluid coagulation markers in PJI diagnosis
remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the potential
value of synovial fluid D-Dimer (sD-Dimer) and synovial fluid FDP (sFDP)
in the diagnosis of PJI.Materials and methodsIn a prospective study, the
levels of serum C-reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
(ESR), sD-Dimer, and sFDP were measured and compared in 56 patients with
PJI (Group A) and 40 patients with aseptic loosening (Group B) who
presented at our department from March 1st, 2020, to December 31st,
2023. The diagnostic efficacy of these markers in PJI diagnosis was
assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve.ResultsThe levels of CRP, ESR, sD-Dimer, and
sFDP in Group A were significantly higher than the levels in Group B.
The AUC values, optimal threshold values, sensitivity, and specificity
for CRP, ESR, sD-Dimer, and sFDP in PJI diagnosis were as follows: CRP
[0.920 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.846–0.965), &gt;6.77, 76.69%,
95.00%], ESR [0.905 (95% CI, 0.828–0.955), &gt;41, 73.21%, 92.50%],
sD-Dimer [0.788 (95% CI, 0.692–0.864), &gt;738.65, 66.07%, 80.00%], and
sFDP [0.869 (95% CI, 0.785–0.929), &gt;1558.35, 91.07%, 70.00%].
Furthermore, sFDP demonstrated similar performance in PJI diagnosis to
CRP and ESR, while sD-Dimer exhibited inferior performance in PJI
diagnosis compared to CRP and ESR.ConclusionssFDP shows promise as a
valuable new adjunctive diagnostic marker for PJI. Further
investigations with larger sample sizes are warranted.</p>

shifts in dental plaque of children with severe early childhood caries
following comprehensive dental treatment under general anesthesia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo elucidate the microbial diversities and compositions of
dental plaque in children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC)
before and after comprehensive dental treatment under general
anesthesia, contributing evidence for the reestablishment of oral
microecological balance.DesignTwenty children aged 2.2-5.5 years
diagnosed with S-ECC without systemic diseases were enrolled in this
study. Dental plaque samples were collected before and after treatment,
analyzed using high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina Miseq
platform. Bioinformatics methods were employed to compare the dental
plaque microbial diversity and compositions differences before and after
comprehensive dental treatment under general
anesthesia.ResultsSignificant enhancements in dental plaque microbial
diversity were observed post-comprehensive treatment (P &lt; 0.05). At
the phylum level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria significantly
decreased after treatment (P &lt; 0.05). At the genus level, the
relative abundance of Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Rothia significantly
declined (P &lt; 0.05), while Prevotella showed a significant increase
after treatment (P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionsFollowing comprehensive dental
treatment under general anesthesia, children with S-ECC exhibit
significant changes in the microbial diversity and composition of dental
plaque, indicating a shift towards a more balanced oral microecological
state. This study highlights the importance of dental intervention in
positively altering oral microbiota.</p>

id="mycobacterium-tuberculosis-modulates-nudt21-mediated-alternative-polyadenylation-to-enhance-fth1-expression-in-macrophages-and-promotes-intracellular-growth">Mycobacterium
tuberculosis modulates NUDT21-mediated alternative polyadenylation to
enhance FTH1 expression in macrophages and promotes intracellular
growth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) is a key iron-storage protein that
regulates iron availability, supports immune defense, and prevents
iron-induced toxicity. During Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
infection, macrophages enhance FTH1 expression to sequestrate iron and
limit Mtb growth. However, Mtb can exploit the host ferritinophagy
pathway to degrade FTH1 and release iron, thereby promoting its
survival. Although FTH1 plays an essential role in host–pathogen
interaction during Mtb infection, its regulation remains unclear.
Previous studies suggest that post-transcriptional mechanism,
particularly alternative polyadenylation (APA), are critical in immune
responses. We propose that APA, which determines the length of a
transcript’s 3′UTR, may regulate FTH1 expression during Mtb infection.
Our study demonstrates that Mtb induces APA of FTH1 in macrophages,
favoring the production of longer isoforms that enhance protein
synthesis. Mechanistically, Mtb disrupts the interaction between NUDT21
and CPSF6, impairing NUDT21’s ability to bind UGUA motifs in the FTH1
3′UTR, a key step in polyadenylation site selection. Silencing NUDT21
reduces macrophage bactericidal activity against Mtb, highlighting its
role in immune defense. These findings reveal a novel Mtb-driven
mechanism that enhances FTH1 expression via the NUDT21-mediated APA
pathway in macrophages, suggesting that Mtb manipulates this process to
promote its survival. This study provides new insights into tuberculosis
pathogenesis and points to potential avenues for therapeutic
exploration.</p>

a comprehensive toolkit for pathogen detection and analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionUnbiased metagenomic sequencing (mNGS) is crucial for
infectious disease diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. However,
its analysis requires specialized bioinformatics skills, creating
barriers for clinicians. We developed HPD-Kit (Henbio Pathogen Detection
Toolkit) with an integrated pathogen database to simplify pathogen
detection and analysis for both human and animal
pathogens.MethodsHPD-Kit includes a specifically curated pathogen
database and optimized bioinformatics pipeline. We evaluated its
performance using simulated datasets at varying pathogen abundances and
clinical samples. The toolkit provides both open-source software and a
web interface for streamlined one-click analysis.ResultsValidation with
simulated data showed HPD-Kit maintains high detection accuracy even at
low pathogen abundance. Clinical dataset analysis demonstrated superior
pathogen identification compared to conventional methods. The web
interface retained this performance while significantly improving
usability.DiscussionHPD-Kit effectively addresses the bioinformatics
barrier in mNGS analysis while maintaining high accuracy. Its dual
open-source and web-based implementation facilitates clinical and public
health applications, promoting wider adoption of mNGS technology in
diagnostic settings.</p>

id="impact-of-omicron-ba.5-infection-on-maternal-and-neonatal-outcomes">Impact
of Omicron BA.5 infection on maternal and neonatal outcomes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPhysiological and immunological adaptations during
pregnancy may elevate the risk of adverse perinatal and neonatal
outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This retrospective study
aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of pregnant women and the
maternal and neonatal outcomes during pregnancy following Omicron BA.5
variant infection.MethodsClinical and laboratory data from 208 pregnant
women with Omicron BA.5 infection were analyzed, including intrapartum
and postpartum records of 24 infected parturients and their neonates,
with comparisons made to uninfected controls. Multiple specimen types,
including placental membranes and amniotic fluid, were collected for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.ResultsAmong 208 infected pregnant women, 91.8%
(191/208) had received at least one dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2
vaccine. BA.5 infection in pregnant women exhibited viral load,
clearance time and symptom profiles comparable to the general
population, with no severe or critical illness being found. No
significant differences were noted between pregnant women over and under
35 years. BA.5 infection reduced the white blood cell counts but did not
aggravate the hypercoagulability compared to the uninfected controls.
Neonates of infected mothers showed a higher rate of intrauterine
hypoxia than those controls. However, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable
in any of the neonatal oropharyngeal swabs as well as maternal
specimens, including placental membranes, amniotic fluid, vaginal
secretions, breast milk, venous blood and ascites.ConclusionThis study
demonstrates favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes in vaccinated
pregnant women with BA.5 infection following timely medical
intervention. Neonates born to infected mothers have an extremely low
risk of vertical transmission. Nevertheless, enhanced prenatal care for
pregnant women with COVID-19 remains essential to mitigate adverse
neonatal outcomes.</p>

id="predictive-survival-modelings-for-hiv-related-cryptococcosis-comparing-machine-learning-approaches">Predictive
survival modelings for HIV-related cryptococcosis: comparing machine
learning approaches</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHIV-associated cryptococcosis is marked by unpredictable
disease trajectories and persistently high mortality rates worldwide.
Although improved risk stratification and tailored clinical management
are urgently needed to enhance patient survival, such strategies remain
limited.MethodsWe analyzed clinical and immunological data from 98
HIV-related cryptococcosis cases, employing machine learning techniques
to model disease severity and predict survival outcomes. Our approach
included unsupervised clustering, elastic net regularized Cox
regression, and random survival forests. Model performance was
rigorously assessed using the C-index, Brier score, Calibration and
time-dependent AUC, with validation executed through a comprehensive,
multi-replicated nested cross-validation framework.ResultsThrough
cytokine profiling, we identified an immune phenotype characterized by
excessive inflammatory response (EXC), associated with greater disease
severity, more frequent neurological symptoms, and poorer survival
outcomes compared to the other two immune phenotypes, highlighting its
potential significance in risk stratification. To further support
clinical decision-making, we developed an elastic net regularized Cox
regression model, achieving superior predictive accuracy with a mean
C-index of 0.78 for 36-month outcomes and a mean Brier score of 0.13,
outperforming both random survival forest and traditional Cox models.
Time-dependent AUC analysis validated the model’s robustness, with AUC
values of 0.84 at 12 months and 0.79 at 36 months, indicating its
reliability and potential clinical utility.DiscussionThis study presents
comprehensive and multidimensional approaches to overcome the challenges
commonly encountered in real-world clinical settings. By applying
cytokine-based clustering, we illustrate the potential for more nuanced
severity stratification, offering a fresh perspective on disease
progression. In parallel, our penalized survival model provides a step
forward in personalized risk assessment, supporting informed clinical
decisions and customized patient management. These findings suggest
promising directions for individualized healthcare solutions, leveraging
machine learning to enhance survival predictions in HIV-related
cryptococcosis.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitutes a significant global
public health challenge, posing a serious threat to human health. In
clinical practice, physicians frequently resort to empirical antibiotic
therapy without timely Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST)
results. This practice, however, may induce resistance mutations in
pathogens due to genetic pressure, thereby complicating infection
control efforts. Consequently, the rapid and accurate acquisition of AST
results has become crucial for precision treatment. In recent years,
advancements in medical testing technology have led to continuous
improvements in AST methodologies. Concurrently, emerging artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Machine Learning(ML) and
Deep Learning(DL), have introduced novel auxiliary diagnostic tools for
AST. These technologies can extract in-depth information from imaging
and laboratory data, enabling the swift prediction of pathogen
antibiotic resistance and providing reliable evidence for the judicious
selection of antibiotics. This article provides a comprehensive overview
of the advancements in research concerning pathogen AST and resistance
detection methodologies, emphasizing the prospective application of
artificial intelligence and machine learning in predicting drug
sensitivity tests and pathogen resistance. Furthermore, we anticipate
future directions in AST prediction aimed at reducing antibiotic misuse,
enhancing treatment outcomes for infected patients, and contributing to
the resolution of the global AMR crisis.</p>

of the periodontal proteome in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva
using SWATH-MS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionProteomic techniques are useful to analyse the
periodontal proteome in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva.
However, few investigations have assessed and compared the GCF and
salivary proteomes. Therefore, this research aims to analyse the
proteome structure and compare protein expression in these fluids
between individuals with periodontal health and those with
periodontitis.MethodsGCF and saliva were collected from 44 periodontally
healthy subjects and 41 with periodontitis (stages III-IV). Samples were
analysed using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass
spectra (SWATH-MS), and proteins were identified employing the UniProt
database. The periodontal proteome structure was assessed using
principal component analysis (PCA). Differential protein expression was
defined as an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 combined with a fold-change ≥2
(upregulated) or ≤0.5 (downregulated).Results250 abundant proteins were
quantified in GCF and 377 in saliva (238 in common). The proteome
structure was different in periodontitis compared to periodontal health
in both oral fluids. In GCF, 63 (25.2%) proteins were differentially
expressed, with 38 upregulated and 25 downregulated in periodontitis.
The most overexpressed proteins were haemoglobin subunits (Hbs) beta
(fold-change of 5.06) and alpha (4.35), carbonic anhydrase 1 (4.28), and
protein S100-P (4.27). Among the underexpressed proteins, 14 were
keratins, with type II cytoskeletal 6B being the most downregulated
(0.10), together with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.12)
and zymogen granule protein 16 homolog B (0.13).In saliva, 59 (15.7%)
proteins were differentially expressed, with 55 upregulated and four
downregulated in periodontitis. Twenty-nine proteins showed a
fold-change ≥4, highlighting beta-2-microglobulin (44.14), keratin, type
I cytoskeletal 13 (36.23), neutrophil defensin 1 (25.08), proteins
S100-A9 (12.30), A8 (10.61), A12 (4.76), and P (4.72), annexin A1
(9.34), lysozyme C (4.98), immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1 (4.45),
resistin (4.37), and Hbs beta (4.20) and alpha (4.06). The most
downregulated protein was lipocalin-1 (0.35). Fourteen proteins were
differentially expressed in GCF and saliva, where seven were keratins
being underexpressed in GCF but overexpressed in
saliva.ConclusionPeriodontitis alters the periodontal proteome structure
and the expression of numerous abundant proteins in GCF and saliva.
However, proteins expressed vary qualitatively and quantitatively,
indicating different expression patterns between oral fluids.</p>

acnes lysate improves cellular response against Candida albicans,
Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis in an in vitro model of
vaginal infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe vagina is a finely balanced microecological
environment. The rupture of this balance leads to dysbiosis, which
causes the resident microbiota to be overcome by pathogens. This event
triggers the onset of gynecological infectious diseases, normally
treated with antimicrobial drugs, considered to date as the gold
standard; yet the increasing rate of drug resistance requires novel
approaches and alternative therapeutic strategies. Bacterial lysates,
obtained by mechanical or chemical crushing of the bacterial cell walls,
contain several antigens and Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns
(PAMP) molecules that through the priming of epithelial and innate
immune cells could improve the responses to the pathogens.Materials and
methodsWe evaluated the effect of a bacterial lysate (BL) obtained by
Cutibacterium acnes on the response of a human vaginal epithelial cell
line and a murine macrophage cell line to the infection by C. albicans,
E. coli and G. vaginalis. By priming the cells with BL, the
mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (mtROS) production, the cellular
damage, the impairment of microbial growth, the phagocytic and killing
capacity and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines were
assessed.ResultsBL did not show any direct antimicrobial effect nor any
toxicity for the cell lines employed. Upon infection with C. albicans,
the BL-primed cells were shown to increase the production of mtROS, to
be more resistant to pathogen-mediated cell damage, and to reduce the
microbial growth. BL-primed macrophages displayed also an increased
phagocytic and killing activity against C. albicans, E. coli and G.
vaginalis. Cytokines and chemokines secretion by BL-primed vaginal
epithelial cells was also modulated upon infection with C. albicans, E.
coli and G. vaginalis.DiscussionOverall, the results shown here point to
the possible role of BL in priming epithelial and phagocytic cells and
to improve their response against bacterial and fungal pathogens. These
data indicate that the use of this (and, in future, other bacterial
lysates) may provide a promising novel approach to handle lower genital
tract infections through the reinforcement of local immunity.</p>

id="immune-dysregulation-in-endometrial-tuberculosis-elevated-hla-g-and-il-1ra-as-key-modulators">Immune
dysregulation in endometrial tuberculosis: elevated HLA-G and IL-1Ra as
key modulators</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Endometrial tuberculosis (ETB) is a reproductive system infection
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily invading the endometrium
through hematogenous dissemination. This study included 10 patients
diagnosed with ETB and 10 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) to
analyze their clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics.
Anatomically, PTB presented the highest prevalence among tuberculosis
cases. Compared to PTB imaging, CT scans of ETB showed less distinctive
diagnostic features. Pathologically, abscess formation was more
frequently observed in ETB patients than in PTB patients, suggesting a
more intense local inflammatory response in ETB. However, there were no
statistically significant differences in granulomatous lesions, caseous
necrosis, coagulative necrosis, inflammatory necrosis, exudation, acute
inflammation, or fibrous tissue hyperplasia between the two groups.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed higher infiltration of macrophages
(CD68) in ETB lesions compared to PTB, whereas the counts of T cells
(CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) and B cells (CD20) showed no significant differences.
Notably, the expression levels of HLA-G and IP-10 were significantly
elevated in the lesion areas of ETB compared to PTB. Similarly, the
expression of HLA-G, IP-10, IL-1Ra, and IL-10 was significantly higher
in the ETB group than in the PTB group. Furthermore, HLA-G and IL-1Ra
expression levels were markedly elevated in ETB lesion areas compared to
surrounding normal endometrial tissue. HLA-G plays a pivotal role in
immune tolerance by modulating local immune responses, while IP-10 is
involved in chronic inflammatory signaling. IL-1Ra and IL-10 are key
regulators of endometrial immune homeostasis, counterbalancing
inflammatory responses that could otherwise disrupt reproductive
function. These immunoregulatory factors are crucial in maintaining
immune tolerance within the endometrium and may influence immune
responses associated with endometrial tuberculosis.</p>

<p>With the development of artificial intelligence(AI) in computer
science and statistics, it has been further applied to the medical
field. These applications include the management of infectious diseases,
in which machine learning has created inroads in clinical microbiology,
radiology, genomics, and the analysis of electronic health record data.
Especially, the role of machine learning in microbiology has gradually
become prominent, and it is used in etiological diagnosis, prediction of
antibiotic resistance, association between human microbiome
characteristics and complex host diseases, prognosis judgment, and
prevention and control of infectious diseases. Machine learning in the
field of microbiology mainly adopts supervised learning and unsupervised
learning, involving algorithms from classification and regression to
clustering and dimensionality reduction. This Review explains crucial
concepts in machine learning for unfamiliar readers, describes machine
learning’s current applications in clinical microbiology and infectious
diseases, and summarizes important approaches clinicians must be aware

<p>date: 2025-05-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been
widely reported to provide crucial information for the diagnosis and
treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we aimed to evaluate
mNGS in pathogens diagnosis of lung infections.MethodsA total of 188
patients who were suspected of pulmonary infection and received medical
treatment at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from
August 2022 to December 2023 were enrolled in this study. Conventional
microbiological tests (CMTs) and mNGS were employed for pathogens
diagnosis.ResultsStatistical results indicated that mNGS were
significantly better than CMTs in sensitivity, negative predictive
value, and negative likelihood ratio. Remarkably, the positive detection
rate of mNGS was significantly higher than that of CMTs (86.17% vs
67.55%, P &lt; 0.01). Through mNGS, we identified 96 pathogens,
comprising 59 bacteria, 18 fungi, 15 viruses, and 4 special pathogens.
In contrast, CMTs detected 28 species, including 25 bacteria and 3
fungi. The effectiveness rate of antibiotic treatment decisions based on
mNGS results was 40.60%. Out of 54 cases with positive treatment
impacts, mNGS results contributed to the treatment and improved
prognosis of 16 infections caused by atypical pathogens.ConclusionOur
results proved the essential role of mNGS in lung infection diagnosis,
enabling early detection and the prompt development of targeted
anti-infection therapies. We recommended that the clinical application
of mNGS can enhance treatment effectiveness and improve patient
prognosis.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundEvidence of changes in the composition and function of the
gut microbiota (GM) in post-stroke depression (PSD) patients is
gradually accumulating. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the
relationship between PSD and GM.MethodsWe searched in PubMed, Web of
Science, Embase, Cochrane databases, Wangfang, VIP, CBM, and CNKI from
the establishment of the database to April 17, 2024, and systematic
review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate the differences
of GM between patients with PSD spectrum and healthy controls (HC) or
stroke spectrum.ResultThere were 14 studies consisting a total of 1,556
individuals included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed
that PSD spectrum demonstrated significantly increased α diversity as
indexed by Chao1 index, ACE indexes, Shannon index, and Simpson index as
compared to HC. Additionally, stroke spectrum significantly increased α
diversity as indexed by Simpson index compared to PSD. Furthermore, the
pooled estimation of relative abundance showed that Bacteroidota,
Fusobacteriota, and Pseudomonadota in PSD patients were significantly
higher than those in the HC group, while the abundance of Bacillota was
higher in the HC group. Moreover, significant differences in GM were
observed between PSD patients and HC at the family and genus
levels.ConclusionThis study found that the α diversity of PSD patients
was higher than that of HC. Moreover, there were also differences in the
distribution of GM at the phylum, family, and genus levels,
respectively. At the same time, the level of Lachnospira in PSD patients
was lower than that in the stroke group.Systematic review

<p>In recent years, a number of observational studies have been
published in neonatology-focused journals that modify American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) evidence-based guidelines, as outlined in the Red
Book and other publications authored by the AAP Committee on the Fetus
and Newborn and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, for the
treatment of neonatal infectious diseases. Specifically, studies that
decrease the treatment length or advocate for the early transition of
intravenous to oral antibiotics in all neonates with suspected or
culture-positive sepsis or pneumonia should be regarded with caution.
These studies are usually conducted through quality improvement
initiatives without informed parental consent, and lack well-defined
definitions for the infection of interest. They often fail to include
sufficient information regarding well-documented variations in
gestational age-based immune responses, and usually combine bacterial
infections into a single group without considering virulence and
pathophysiologic differences between gram-negative and gram-positive
infections. We seek to raise awareness of the potential harm these
practices may cause and to advocate for parental involvement and consent
when deviations from practice standards are investigated.</p>

T cells expanded with vitamin C combined with HMBPP in vitro inhibit
intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) presents a significant
global health threat, and the existing treatments have notable
limitations. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells activated by HMBPP can inhibit the growth of
intracellular Mtb. Additionally, vitamin C (VC) promotes the
differentiation and proliferation of related T cells. However, it
remains uncertain whether VC can enhance the expansion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells
within PBMCs activated by HMBPP and rIL-2, and the underlying mechanism
of the inhibitory effect of the expanded T cells on intracellular Mtb
has not been elucidated.MethodsVenous blood was collected from healthy
individuals, and PBMCs were subsequently isolated. In vitro, Vγ9Vδ2 T
cells were selectively expanded with HMBPP, rIL-2, and VC. Flow
cytometry was utilized to analyze the purities and phenotypes of Vγ9Vδ2
T cells, while cell counts were performed to determine the total number
of viable cells. Magnetic bead sorting was employed to purify Vγ9Vδ2 T
cells. Mtb strains were cultured, and macrophage infection models
derived from THP1 cells were established. Co-culture experiments were
conducted with Mtb-infected macrophages and Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, and the
number of intracellular bacteria was quantified through CFU counting.
The levels of cytokines were measured using the CBA method and flow
cytometry. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism and
SPSS software.ResultsVC (70 μM) significantly enhances the expansion of
Vγ9Vδ2 T cells within PBMCs during primary HMBPP activation in the
presence of rIL-2, with higher induction rates and total cell
proliferation. By day 14 of induction, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded with
HMBPP, VC, and rIL-2 exhibited the central memory (10-20%) and the
effector memory phenotypes (75-90%). Furthermore, these expanded T cells
effectively inhibited the growth of intracellular virulent Mtb strain
(H37Rv) in a cell-contact-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was
associated with an up-regulated production of TNF-α and IFN-γ, and a
down-regulated expression of IL-10 and IL-17A during Mtb infection.
ConclusionThis study demonstrates that VC enhances the proliferative
expansion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in PBMCs primarily stimulated with HMBPP and
rIL-2. The expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are capable of effectively inhibiting
the growth of virulent H37Rv strain, likely through the secretion of
TNF-α and IFN-γ. These findings provide a novel direction for
tuberculosis treatment research.</p>

haemaphysaloides</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe salivary glands of female ticks rapidly degenerate
after feeding. The mechanism involves programmed cell death mediated by
an ecdysteroid receptor. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network has
been established using miRNA and the competitive binding of three types
of RNA (lncRNA, circRNA, and mRNA), that were demonstrated to be
involved in the regulation of biological processes. However, the
comprehensive expression profile and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)
regulatory network between mRNAs and ncRNAs involved in salivary gland
development remain unclear.MethodsIn the current study, we employed
whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) at various stages of
feeding to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs,
and mRNAs. The ceRNA networks combining lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and
mRNAs were predicted and constructed based on the miRanda and TargetScan
databases. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed for target mRNAs with
significantly different expression levels.ResultsWe identified several
pathways related to organ growth and development: Insulin secretion, the
Hippo signaling pathway, the Pl3K-Akt signaling pathway, the FoxO
signaling pathway, and the Ferroptosis pathway in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA
network, and Steroid biosynthesis, Cholesterol metabolism, the FoxO
signaling pathway, and the Ferroptosis pathway in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA
network, each of which involved insulin and ecdysteroid
regulation.DiscussionOur findings have advanced our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms of salivary gland development and
degeneration.</p>

Acinetobacter baumannii</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAcinetobacter baumannii exhibits high genomic plasticity,
enabling it to acquire virulence factors and antibiotic resistance (AR).
Understanding its evolutionary adaptations is crucial for developing
effective therapeutic strategies.MethodsThirty clinical isolates
collected from two distinct time periods, defined as older (2010–2013),
and recent (2022–2023),- were compared phenotypically (antibiotic
resistance, growth, biofilm formation, desiccation tolerance,
invasiveness) and genotypically (whole-genome sequencing).ResultsAll
isolates displayed an extensively drug-resistant phenotype. Overall,
respiratory isolates harbored a higher content of antibiotic-resistant
genes (ARGs), with older isolates showing 12.5% increases in the average
number of ARGs compared to recent urine isolates (P = 0.02). More than
50% of the strains with faster growth, stronger biofilm formation, and
increased lung cell invasiveness were recent respiratory isolates, while
over 70% of older isolates showed greater desiccation tolerance and
bladder cell invasiveness. Eleven virulence factor genes were shared
between old and recent respiratory isolates, and eight were common
between recent urinary and respiratory strains with no overlap among
urinary isolates. Statistically significant positive correlations were
observed between fast-growing and strong biofilm-forming respiratory
isolates as well as their lung cell invasiveness. Conversely, negative
correlations were found between collection time, isolation site, and
host cell invasiveness. Analysis of macrocolony types revealed no link
to phenotypic behavior.ConclusionSignificant genetic variability was
found between past and recent isolates. Older isolates had more genes
involved in adhesion and nutrient uptake, while recent respiratory
strains demonstrated increased biofilm formation and invasiveness,
reflecting adaptation to clinical pressures. These findings highlight
the dynamic evolution of A. baumannii, providing insights for future
therapeutic strategies and infection control.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Dengue fever remains a significant global public health issue,
necessitating a collaborative One Health strategy for efficient
management. This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge,
attitudes, and practices (KAP) of 516 healthcare professionals regarding
dengue and its vectors. Most participants were young (82.6%), male
(75.6%), and had MBBS qualifications (61.4%), predominantly employed in
hospital settings (70.3%), and living in non-hotspot areas (53.3%). The
research indicated that 65.1% of respondents possessed moderate
knowledge about dengue, while 19.6% exhibited high knowledge and 15.3%
showed low knowledge. Most participants (87.8%) correctly identified
Aedes mosquitoes as the main vector, with 52.7% recognizing stagnant
clean water as their breeding habitat. Positive attitudes were noted
among 72.5% of participants; 51% viewed dengue as a moderately serious
threat, and 47.3% strongly agreed on the crucial role of healthcare
professionals in prevention. Conversely, 48.9% pointed out insufficient
preventive measures in their facilities. In terms of practices, 80.8% of
participants regularly informed patients about prevention, and 79.1%
recommended CBC tests for suspected cases. Protective measures such as
repellents and mosquito nets were consistently utilized by 57.2%,
whereas 41.1% reported infrequent use. Remarkably, 59.7% had never
undergone formal training on dengue prevention and management, with only
23.6% receiving consistent training. Furthermore, while 50.8% indicated
that their facilities had adequate resources for dengue treatment, 42.8%
reported a lack of mosquito control activities. These findings underline
significant gaps in training, resource availability, and preventive
practices, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced capacity-building,
resource allocation, and intersectoral collaboration within the One
Health framework to combat the effects of dengue in the region.</p>

<p>Periodontitis, a prevalent inflammatory oral disease, is intricately
linked to disruptions in the oral microbiome, a state known as microbial
dysbiosis. This review explores the pivotal roles of key pathogens,
including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, in driving
periodontitis and examines the underlying molecular mechanisms that
disrupt microbial homeostasis. We discuss how interactions among
bacterial species affect the oral ecosystem’s balance and how microbial
metabolites influence the host immune responses, contributing to disease
progression. Leveraging these insights, we propose cutting-edge
therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring microbial equilibrium. These
include personalized pharmacological interventions tailored to
individual microbiome profiles and innovative microbiome-targeted
strategies such as probiotic formulations and bacteriophage therapy. By
precisely modulating microbial communities, these strategies hold
promise for enhancing treatment efficacy, preventing disease recurrence,
and mitigating issues like antimicrobial resistance. Overall, this
review paves the way for novel prevention and management techniques in
periodontitis, offering significant improvements in oral health outcomes
for patients.</p>

<p>ObjectiveExplore and analyze CLABSI pathogenic bacteria
characteristics in ICU patients and the value of PCT, NLR, PLR in early
infection prediction.Methods926 ICU patients with central venous
catheters in Minhang Hospital from January 2021 to December 2023 were
enrolled. They were grouped by co-infection status. PCT, NLR and PLR
levels were measured, patient data analyzed, pathogenic bacteria
characteristics summarized, and their predictive value evaluated via ROC
curve.ResultsFrom January 2021 to December 2023, among the 926 patients
with CVC, 73 were diagnosed with CLABSI, with an infection rate of
7.88%. A total of 81 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated,
including 60.50% (49/81) Gram - positive bacteria, 35.80% (29/81) Gram -
negative bacteria, and 3.70% (3/81) fungi. The main Gram - positive
bacteria exhibited high resistance to penicillin, erythromycin,
clindamycin, and oxacillin, with a resistance rate exceeding 70%, yet
were sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, and tetracycline. The main Gram
- negative bacteria had high resistance to piperacillin,
piperacillin/tazobactam, Aztreonam, and gentamicin, with a resistance
rate over 70%, and were more sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam,
imipenem, and amikacin. Age, the site of catheterization, the duration
of catheterization, and the employment of double - cavity catheters were
all factors that exerted an influence on CLABSI among ICU patients (with
p &lt; 0.05). The levels of peripheral blood NLR, PLR, and PCT in the
infected group were higher than those in the non - infected group (p
&lt; 0.05). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of peripheral blood NLR,
PLR, and PCT were 0.814, 0.798, and 0.856, respectively, with the
largest AUC for PCT. When the cut - off point was 2.75 ng/ml, the Youden
index was the largest. The AUCs of the combination of peripheral blood
NLR and PLR, NLR and PCT, PLR and PCT, and all three combined were
0.877, 0.903, 0.857, and 0.917.ConclusionThe early prediction of CLABSI
in ICU patients by means of PCT, NLR, and PLR is of remarkable
significance. It can provide a precious reference for clinical
diagnostic and treatment strategies.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The global emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella
pneumoniae, particularly carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP),
presents a severe public health threat, limiting available treatment
options. Tigecycline and eravacycline, have been considered a
last-resort therapeutic against MDR Enterobacteriaceae. However, strains
were resistant to these antibiotics increased recently. The
tmexCD-toprJ, a plasmid-encoded resistance-nodulation-division
(RND)-type efflux pump, has emerged as a critical factor conferring
resistance to tigecycline and eravacycline. In this study, we reported
the emergence of 11 CRKP isolates harboring tmexCD-toprJ, isolated from
two lung transplant patients in a tertiary hospital in eastern China.
Most of the isolates (82%) exhibited high-level resistance to
tigecycline and eravacycline, along with other common antibiotics.
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analysis indicated these
strains are not clonal, and resistance phenotypes were associated with
the tmexCD-toprJ operon and other crucial resistance elements. We also
found the tmexCD-toprJ operon was located on a conjugative plasmid,
sharing high sequence similarity with the operon identified in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results showed that the
tmexCD-toprJ-harboring plasmid is efficiently transferable, which
contributes to the dissemination of tigecycline and eravacycline
resistance. At the same time, the plasmid can coexist with the
blaKPC-2-carrying plasmid, which may cause multidrug resistance. The
emergence of tmexCD-toprJ-positive CRKP in lung transplant patients
highlights the potential for rapid nosocomial dissemination and reduced
treatment efficacy of last-line antimicrobials. Our findings emphasize
the need for enhanced genomic surveillance, infection control measures,
and alternative therapeutic strategies to combat the spread of
tmexCD-toprJ-mediated resistance in clinical settings.</p>

Schistosoma japonicum infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Egg granulomas caused by Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) are
important causes of morbidity and mortality in schistosomiasis. The
intestine plays a crucial role in the complete life cycle of S.
japonicum; eggs are transported through the intestine and excreted with
feces. During this process, the interaction between the eggs and the
intestine can trigger a strong intestinal immune system response and
cause inflammation. Eggs in the intestine preferentially accumulate in
Peyer’s patches (PPs). However, the cellular composition of intestinal
granulomas and the impacts of egg deposition on the immune function of
PPs remain poorly understood. Using a mouse model of S. japonicum
infection, we revealed that the deposition of eggs disrupted the
structure of PPs, resulting in immunosuppression. We further
characterized the cellular composition of intestinal granulomas,
revealing a layered distribution of neutrophils, macrophages, T cells,
and B cells, with marked neutrophil accumulation. Single-cell RNA
sequencing revealed that egg deposition drives B-cell apoptosis, T-cell
exhaustion, and activation of fibrotic pathways in myeloid cells,
collectively impairing PP function. In conclusion, the layered cellular
architecture of intestinal granulomas in PPs suggests a unique immune
microenvironment of egg-driven immunosuppression and fibrotic
remodeling, and the identification of fibrotic pathways in myeloid cells
provides a potential therapeutic target to alleviate fibrosis in
patients with S. japonicum infection.</p>

Recent research has demonstrated that screening libraries of compounds
aimed at these receptors can help identify inhibitors that prevent the
replication of various viruses, including filoviruses and SARS-CoV-2. We
screened a neurotransmitter receptor modulator library in
influenza-infected U937 cells and found that many adrenergic, histamine,
dopamine, and serotonin receptor agonists and antagonists exhibit
antiviral activity. We identified 20 candidate compounds with IC50
values below 20 μM, suggesting a critical role for these receptors in
influenza replication. Three representative compounds (isoxsuprine,
ciproxifan, and rotigotine) inhibited H1N1 replication in a
dose-dependent manner in multiple cell lines, and were effective against
H1N1, oseltamivir-resistant H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B strains.
Mechanistic studies indicated that these compounds affect virus
internalization during the early infection stages. In a mouse model of
lethal influenza, isoxsuprine significantly decreased lung viral titers,
mitigated pulmonary inflammation, and enhanced survival rates. These
findings highlight neurotransmitter receptors as potential targets for
developing novel anti-influenza agents, providing a foundation for
further optimization of the identified compounds as potential
therapeutic agents.</p>

regulating Th17/Treg imbalance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMicrobial dysbiosis links to mucosal immune
dysregulation, but the specific bacterial contributions to oral mucosal
inflammation remain unclear. Escherichia coli (E. coli), a pathogen
well-characterized in mucosal immunity and immune regulation studies,
has been observed to be enriched in chronic oral inflammatory lesions
and was reported to modulate T helper 17 cells (Th17)/T regulatory cells
(Treg) homeostasis. Here, we developed an oral mucositis mouse model via
tongue scratch and E. coli topical application to investigate its role
in Th17/Treg imbalance.MethodsThe inflammatory infiltration was
evaluated by macroscopic photography and HE staining. The expression of
inflammatory factors in tongue tissue and peripheral blood of mice were
detected by immunohistochemical staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. The number of Th17 and Treg in mice spleen lymphocytes were
evaluated with flow cytometry. Differential gene expression analysis,
functional enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis were
performed using RNA-seq data from oral lichen planus (OLP).ResultsE.
coli stimulation aggravated inflammatory responses induced by scratching
in lingual mucosa of mice, including increased local and systemic
expression of interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 17 (IL17), chemokine
receptor 6 (CCR6) and chemokine C-C motif ligand 20 (CCL20), increased
proportions of Th17 cells and increased Th17/Treg ratio in spleen
lymphocytes. Analysis of RNA-seq data from OLP revealed alterations in
antimicrobial responses and inflammatory factors associated with
upregulation of Th17/Treg balance.ConclusionThis study supports the role
of E. coli in promoting oral mucosal inflammation and provides an
experimental basis for in vivo study of OLP from the perspective of
microorganisms.</p>

characteristics and diagnostic performance of metagenomic pathogen
detection technology in mycobacterial infections among HIV patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMycobacterial infections represent a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. This study
evaluated diagnostic techniques for mycobacterial identification and
compared clinicopathological features between HIV-positive and
HIV-negative patients.MethodsWe analyzed 88 tissue samples (with 41
matched blood and 28 sputum samples) using histopathology (HE and
acid-fast staining), bacterial culture, MTB-PCR (sputum/biopsy),
PCR-reverse dot blot hybridization (RDBH), and metagenomic pathogen
detection technology (MetaPath™). Logistic regression analyses were
performed to identify factors affecting detection
rates.ResultsMycobacterial infection was detected in 95.5% (84/88) of
patients. Among HIV-positive patients (n=63), 46% (29/63) had
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections, and 44% (28/63) had
non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections, significantly higher than
the 20% (5/25) NTM rate in HIV-negative patients. Univariate analysis
identified HIV-positive status (p=0.009), lymph node involvement
(p=0.020), and positive MetaPath™ results (p=0.002) as significant
predictors of detection, while multivariate analysis confirmed these as
independent factors (p=0.036; p=0.042; p=0.006). Lymph nodes were the
most common infection site in HIV-positive patients (42.9%, 27/63),
while lung tissue predominated in HIV-negative patients (48%, 12/25).
MetaPath™ demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity for
detecting both MTB and NTM. Biopsy samples provided higher diagnostic
accuracy than sputum or blood for lung and lymph node infections, but
not for brain. In HIV-positive patients, NTM infections showed
significantly more granuloma formation (p=0.032) and foam cells
(p=0.005), but less necrosis (p=0.0005) compared to MTB infections. No
significant differences were observed in HIV-negative
patients.ConclusionsMetaPath™ is a highly effective diagnostic tool for
mycobacterial infections, particularly in tissue biopsies. HIV-positive
status, lymph node involvement, and MetaPath™ positivity independently
predict mycobacterial detection. HIV-positive patients exhibit distinct
clinicopathological features, emphasizing the need for tailored
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches based on immune status.</p>

of the gut microbiota in older people with and without sarcopenia: a
systematic review and meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSarcopenia, an age-related disorder marked by decreased
skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, is associated with
negative health impacts in individuals and financial burdens on families
and society. Studies have suggested that age-related alterations in gut
microbiota may contribute to the development of sarcopenia in older
people through the gut-muscle axis, thus modulation of gut microbiota
may be a promising approach for sarcopenia treatment. However, the
characteristic gut microbiota for sarcopenia has not been consistent
across studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the
diversity and compositional differences in the gut microbiota of older
people with and without sarcopenia, and to identify gut microbiota
biomarkers with therapeutic potential for sarcopenia.MethodsThe PubMed,
Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge
Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database were searched studies about the gut
microbiota characteristics in older people with sarcopenia. The quality
of included articles was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
Weighted standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for α-diversity index were estimated using a random
effects model. Qualitative synthesis was conducted for β-diversity and
the correlation between gut microbiota and muscle parameters. The
relative abundance of the gut microbiota was analyzed quantitatively and
qualitatively, respectively.ResultsPooled estimates showed that
α-diversity was significantly lower in older people with sarcopenia
(SMD: -0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.26, I²: 71%, P &lt; 0.00001). The
findings of β-diversity varied across included studies. In addition, our
study identified gut microbiota showing a potential and negative
correlation with sarcopenia, such as Prevotella, Slackia, Agathobacter,
Alloprevotella, Prevotella copri, Prevotellaceae sp., Bacteroides
coprophilus, Mitsuokella multacida, Bacteroides massiliensis,
Bacteroides coprocola Conversely, a potential and positive correlation
was observed with opportunistic pathogens like Escherichia-Shigella,
Eggerthella, Eggerthella lenta and Collinsella
aerofaciens.DiscussionThis study showed that α-diversity is decreased in
sarcopenia, probably predominantly due to diminished richness rather
than evenness. In addition, although findings of β-diversity varied
across included studies, the overall trend toward a decrease in
SCFAs-producing bacteria and an increase in conditionally pathogenic
bacteria. This study provides new ideas for targeting the gut microbiota
for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.Systematic review

repair and immune function in the Pseudomonas infected CF lung: before
and after highly effective modulator therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The leading cause of death for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF)
continues to be due to respiratory-related illnesses. Both wound repair
and immune cell responses are dysregulated in the CF airways, creating a
cycle of unresolved injury and perpetuating inflammation. PwCF are
predisposed to colonization and infections with opportunistic bacteria
like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), the most common adult pathogen in CF.
Pa possesses key virulence factors that can exacerbate chronic
inflammation and lung injury. With the approval of highly effective
modulator therapies like elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), pwCF
eligible for ETI have seen drastic improvements in lung function and
clinical outcomes, including an increased life expectancy. While
modulator therapies are improving bronchial epithelial cellular
processes in wound repair and some areas of immunity, many of these
processes do not reach a non-CF baseline state or have not been
thoroughly studied. The effect of modulator therapy on Pa may lead to a
reduction in infection, but in more longitudinal studies, there is not
always eradication of Pa, and colonization and infection frequency can
return to pre-modulator levels over time. Finally, in this review we
explore the current state of additional treatments for CF lung disease,
independent of CFTR genotype, including anti-inflammatories,
phage-therapies, and Pa vaccines.</p>

bloodstream infection in Hainan, China, 2021-2024</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionRarely does Pandoraea occur in bloodstream infections
(BSI), although it’s typically found in cystic fibrosis. This study aims
to decipher the genetic map and obtain insights of clinical symptoms
into Pandoraea from BSI patients. Methods30 suspected BSI patients’
diagnostic records and medical histories were recorded. Pandoraea spp.
isolates were collected and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility
testing, Sanger sequencing and Whole-genome sequencing (WGS). ResultsOf
the 30 clinical cases, five (16.67%) ultimately died, whereas 25
(83.33%) are alive. 30 purified Pandoraea isolates showed high degree of
MIC values to Meropenem, Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate,
Gentamicin, and Ceftazidime. Then, all isolates were identified as P.
pneumonica based on the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis. Among 28
genomes of them, the average genome size and average GC contents were
5,397,568 bp, and 62.43%, respectively. However, WP1 displayed high
similarity (90.6%) to reference Pandoraea sp. LMG 31114. Genetic
differences between the tested isolates and LMG 31114 suggested that the
outbreak’s causative pathogen could be a novel cluster of P. pneumonica.
The genomes accumulated mutations at an estimated rate of 1.3 × 10-7
mutations/year/site. Moreover, 26 clinical isolates within the P.
pneumonica cluster were formed in July 2014, revealing a tendency to
develop regional endemic patterns. ConclusionBSI caused by this novel
cluster of P. pneumonica is linked to significant morbidity and
mortality. Such cluster remains a critical public health challenge due
to their regional epidemiological patterns and antibiotic treatment
risk. This study contributed to the basis on pathogen identification,
disease diagnosis, and BSI treatment.</p>

Wolbachia transcriptomic signature in the arboviral vector Aedes
aegypti</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of
arboviral diseases such as dengue and imposes a global health burden. A
promising control strategy is to infect A. aegypti populations with
Wolbachia, a genus of intracellular bacteria capable of blocking
arboviral infections. Enhancing and preserving the efficacy of this
method will depend on a solid mechanistic knowledge of the A.
aegypti-Wolbachia symbiosis. By identifying differences between
Wolbachia-infected and uninfected A. aegypti, previous transcriptomic
studies proposed a wide range of symbiotic interactions, but a
systematic identification of consistent effects across datasets is still
missing.MethodsTo identify A. aegypti genes and functions consistently
affected by Wolbachia, we performed differential expression and
functional enrichment analysis on published transcriptomic datasets,
followed by a meta-analysis of the obtained p-values using the maxP
method. Six datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus,
Sequence Read Archive and ArrayExpress (last searched in July 2024,
considering lack of replication as the exclusion criteria). After
discarding one dataset from wAlbB-infected cell line due to poor mapping
to the A. aegypti genome, the data comprised adult female A. aegypti
heads, muscles, carcasses, midguts and bodies, and Wolbachia strains
wMel and wMelPop.Results and DiscussionMeta-analysis revealed 10 and 21
consistently down- and upregulated host genes, some of which have
escaped the focus of previous research, including the consistently
downregulated exonuclease AAEL009650 which has a pro-dengue virus
homolog in Drosophila. At the function level, we found consistent
upregulation of electron transport chain (ETC), carbohydrate transport
and serine-type peptidase activity and inhibition, and downregulation of
DNA replication. ETC upregulation suggests an alternative mechanism for
Wolbachia’s induction of antiviral oxidative stress, previously
attributed to dual- and NADPH-oxidases which here showed downregulation
or no regulation. Through analysis of previously published datasets,
this work identifies promising molecular and functional targets for
future studies aimed at elucidating the most fundamental mechanisms of
the A. aegypti–Wolbachia symbiosis.</p>

hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by the Hantaan virus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the Thrombomodulin (TM)
levels in patients who suffered hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) of varying severities, and to evaluate the predictive properties
of TM for the seriousness of HFRS, thereby providing a clue for the
monitoring and management of this patients in the
future.MethodsChemiluminescence was used to determine the concentrations
of TM in 196 patients with HFRS and 49 healthy controls. Conventional
testing techniques were used to test the basic clinical reference values
for leukocytes, platelets (PLT), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine
(Cr), uric acid (UA), and urea, and the values for activated partial
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen. The colloidal
gold method was used to measure HFRS antibody levels in the patients.
The correlation of TM with conventional parameters was assessed using
Spearman correlation analysis, and ordinal logistic regression analysis
was used to analyze the severity risk factors. The predictive potency of
TM for HFRS patients’ severity was evaluated by receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsThe concentrations of TM
increased with disease severity and peaked in the critical type
patients. In addition, plasma levels of TM were proportionally
correlated with the levels of leukocytes (r= 0.4218; p&lt;0.01),
creatine (r= 0.3797; p&lt;0.01), urea (r= 0.3763; p&lt;0.01), uric acid
(r= 0.3624; p&lt;0.01), and C-reactive protein (r= 0.2767; p&lt;0.01).
Conversely, there was an inverse correlation between TM, platelet counts
(r= -0.4509; p&lt;0.01), and fibrinogen levels (r= -0.2431; p&lt;0.01).
Furthermore, TM demonstrated significant predictive value for the
severity of HFRS with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.872(95% CI:
0.822-0.921, P&lt;0.001).ConclusionsTM levels are associated with HFRS
severity, suggesting that TM detection might be beneficial for
monitoring the status and effective management of HFRS patients.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Lung cancer is a significant health concern that poses a considerable
threat to human health and quality of life. In order to enhance the
prognosis of patients with lung cancer, we conducted a combined analysis
of 16S rDNA gene sequencing of alveolar lavage fluid and LC-MS
metabolomics research, with the objective of identifying biomarkers in
patients with early-stage lung cancer presenting as SPN. A comparison of
the benign nodule group and the early-stage lung cancer patients
revealed that the phylum-level Bacteroidetes and the genus-level
Chryseobacterium and Delftia were more abundant in the latter group.
Additionally, the Fusobacteriales might serve as a predictive marker for
the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer. In the context of
metabolomics, the early-stage lung cancer was found to be characterised
by elevated levels of specific metabolites, including Alternariol, dTMP,
Oxymatrine, Gedunin, PC 36:4. Conversely, reductions in other
metabolites, such as LPC O-24:0, PC 18:2_18:3, PC 19:2_19:2,
Cholecalciferol and T-2 Triol, were also observed. Correlation analyses
demonstrated that alveolar lavage microorganisms were closely associated
with differential metabolites. Specifically, reductions in
Cholecalciferol were associated with a variety of high-abundance flora
and involved in vitamin digestion and absorption pathways. Furthermore,
reductions in cholecalciferol may serve as a robust predictor of
early-stage lung cancer. These findings provide new predictive
biomarkers for early-stage lung cancer manifested by SPN, which is
clinically important and requires further study of the potential
mechanisms of action and function of the targets.</p>

<p>Prophages are bacteriophages that integrate their genomes into the

prophages integrated into 44 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated
from tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia. A total of 97 intact prophages
were identified among clinical strains, with 16 prophages found present

lengths ranging from 7.7 kb to 74.1 kb, and their GC content was found
to be between 49.91% and 64.9%. Our findings show that prophages are
present in the majority of the isolated P. aeruginosa strains (41 out of
44). Additionally, several proteins related to viral defense
(toxin/antitoxin modules and proteins against restriction-modification
enzymes) were identified, supporting the idea that prophages influence
bacterial pathogenesis and anti-phage defenses.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Candida albicans is the most prevalent opportunistic fungal pathogen.
Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that genome
plasticity is a hallmark of C. albicans. While aneuploidy formation is a
well-documented adaptive mechanism under various stress conditions, the
response to brefeldin A—a compound that induces endoplasmic reticulum
stress—remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that C.
albicans adapts to subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of
brefeldin A, primarily through the formation of chromosome 3 trisomy.
These aneuploid strains were found to be unstable, reverting to euploidy
in the absence of stress, accompanied by a loss of brefeldin A
tolerance. We identified at least two genes on chromosome 3, SEC7 and
CDR1, that contribute to this adaptive response. Notably, higher
concentrations of brefeldin A selected for strains with increasingly
complex aneuploidies. Our findings underscore the remarkable genomic
plasticity of C. albicans and reveal aneuploidy as a reversible
mechanism for adapting to brefeldin A stress. This study provides new
insights into the role of aneuploidy in fungal adaptation and offers
potential implications for understanding drug resistance mechanisms in
pathogenic fungi.</p>

Chengdu, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global public
health issue, due to their high prevalence and potential impact on
pregnancy outcome and fetal health. The objective of this study is to
investigate the prevalence of STI-causative pathogens including
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Ureaplasma
urealyticum (UU) as well as the epidemiological characteristics of STIs
among males and females of childbearing age in Chengdu.MethodsThis
retrospective cross-sectional study involved 15,055 participants of
childbearing age including 7,235 males and 7,820 females. All specimens
of participants were tested for CT, NG, and UU by nucleic acid
amplification tests (NAATs) methods.Results27.80% of the participants
were infected with at least one of the three pathogens, with
significantly higher overall prevalence in females (45.22%) than males
(8.98%, p&lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis
demonstrated that gender was independently associated with both CT
positivity (females vs males, OR 2.276, 95% CI 1.724-3.005, p&lt;0.001)
and UU positivity (females vs males, OR 8.079, 95% CI 7.183-9.086,
p&lt;0.001). Single infections predominated in both males and females
(males: 98.15%; females: 93.16%), while mixed infections were more
frequent in females (6.84%) than in males (1.85%). CT prevalence was
highest in both males and females aged 18-24, followed by aged 25–30 and
31-35. Among aged 18-24, the prevalence of UU in males and NG and UU in
females were also higher. Compared to other age groups, mixed infections
(CT+NG, CT+UU, NG+UU, CT+NG+UU) were also highest in females aged 18-24.
Compared to other clinical diagnostic groups, The prevalence of CT, NG
and mixed infection of CT+NG was highest in both males and females in
the urogenital inflammation group (p&lt;0.05).ConclusionsAmong the
population of childbearing age in Chengdu, China, the prevalence among
females was significantly higher than that among males. Single
infections predominated in both males and females, while mixed
infections occurred more frequently in females. STIs were more prevalent
in sexually active young people aged 18-35, especially in the 18–24 age
group. CT and NG infections in both males and females may cause
urogenital inflammation, and mixed infections of CT+NG further elevate
the risk of inflammatory responses.</p>

in whole genome sequencing for foodborne pathogens: implications for
clinical infectious disease surveillance and public health</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Foodborne outbreaks affecting millions of people worldwide are a
significant and growing global health threat, exacerbated by the
emergence of new and increasingly virulent foodborne pathogens.
Traditional methods of detecting these outbreaks, including
culture-based techniques, serotyping and molecular methods such as
real-time PCR, are still widely used. However, these approaches often
lack the precision and resolution required to definitively trace the
source of an outbreak and distinguish between closely related strains of
pathogens. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a revolutionary
tool in outbreak investigations, providing high-resolution,
comprehensive genetic data that allows accurate species identification
and strain differentiation. WGS also facilitates the detection of
virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, providing critical
insight into the potential pathogenicity, treatment/control options and
risks of spreading foodborne pathogens. This capability enhances
outbreak surveillance, source tracing and risk assessment, making WGS an
increasingly integrated component of public health surveillance systems.
Despite its advantages, the widespread implementation of WGS faces
several pressing challenges, including high sequencing costs, the need
for specialized bioinformatics expertise, limited computational
infrastructure in resource-constrained settings, and the standardization
of data-sharing frameworks across regulatory and public health agencies.
Addressing these barriers is crucial to maximizing the impact of WGS on
foodborne disease surveillance. Even so, WGS is emerging as a vital tool
in food safety and public health, and its potential to become the gold
standard in outbreak detection has been recognized by public health
authorities in the USA, the European Union, Australia and China, for
example. This review highlights the role of WGS in foodborne outbreak
investigations, its implementation challenges, and its impact on public
health surveillance.</p>

application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in etiologic
diagnosis of severe pneumonia in adults</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo analyze the clinical characteristics and risk factors for
death of severe pneumonia (SP) in adults and explore the application
value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the detection of
pathogens.MethodsA total of 132 adult patients with SP admitted from May
2021 to October 2023 were selected. Data on gender, age, smoking,
underlying diseases, laboratory tests and prognosis were collected. BALF
samples were sent for mNGS, smear-stained microscopy and culture.
Meanwhile, conventional methods were used for pathogen detection of
blood, urine and throat swab specimens. The detection efficiencies of
different methods were compared and the associated pathogen profiles
were analyzed.ResultsAmong the 132 patients, there were 92 males and 40
females, with a total of 52 deaths. Age≥65 years, heart failure, renal
insufficiency, positive of COVID-19, use of vasoactive drugs, use of
mechanical ventilation and use of CRRT were statistically different
between the survivors and non-survivors. Heart failure (OR=4.751) and
use of mechanical ventilation (OR=11.914) were risk factors of SP
mortality. The bacteria detected were mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fungi detected
were mainly Candida and Aspergillus. The viruses detected were mainly
COVID-19 and influenza virus. The positive rate of mNGS was higher than
conventional methods in both bacteria, fungus and virus (82.58% vs
63.64%, 50.76% vs 37.88% and 67.42% vs 37.88%, respectively)
(P&lt;0.05). The sensitivity and accuracy of mNGS in bacterial detection
were significantly higher than traditional methods (P&lt;0.05). Compared
to culture, mNGS detected more Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, and had a
significant advantage in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex, Nontuberculous mycobacterial, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia
psittaci, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus. Moreover, mNGS can
better indicate mixed infections of bacteria, viruses, or
fungi.ConclusionElderly people with chronic diseases were the main group
of severe pneumonia in adults. The pathogenic microorganisms that caused
SP are complex, and mixed infection is common. mNGS enhanced the
effectiveness of pathogen detection, makes up for the shortcomings of
conventional methods, especially in identifying unexpected pathogens,
and provides a new means for early targeted anti-infection
treatment.</p>

evaluation of personalized Helicobacter pylori treatment guided by PCR
detection from fecal samples: a real-world study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGrowing antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) diminishes eradication therapy effectiveness, emphasizing the
need for accurate, non-invasive diagnostic techniques. This study aims
to assess the clinical utility of PCR analysis of fecal samples for
detecting antibiotic resistance in guiding personalized treatment for H.
pylori infection.MethodsA retrospective, observational study was
conducted across 13 hospitals within Jiangsu Province. Fecal samples
were analyzed using fluorescence PCR for the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes,
indicating clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance. Then,
individualized eradication recommendations were proposed for the H.
pylori-positive patients. A follow-up was performed one year later to
evaluate the eradication outcomes in a routine medical environment, with
participants having provided informed consent.ResultsA total of 387
participants completed the eradication treatment, with an overall
success rate of 91.0% (352/387, 95% CI: 87.6%-93.6%). Among them, 310
individuals received a 14-day course of bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT),
achieving an eradication rate of 90.0% (279/310, 95% CI: 86.1%-93.1%).
77 participants were treated with high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) for the
same duration, resulting in a slightly higher eradication rate of 94.8%
(73/77, 95% CI: 87.2%-98.6%), although this difference was not
statistically significant (P=0.188). No significant differences in
eradication rates were observed among various BQT antibiotic
combinations (P=0.208). The eradication rates for HDDT, based on either
vonoprazan or esomeprazole, were 96.8% (61/63, 95% CI: 89.0%-99.6%) and
85.7% (12/14, 95% CI: 57.2%-98.2%), respectively, without a significant
difference (P=0.304).ConclusionPCR detection from fecal samples
targeting the resistance genes of H. pylori is effective in guiding
personalized treatments, highlighting its clinical utility and potential
for broader application.</p>

the power of antimicrobial peptides: advances in production,
optimization, and therapeutics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are critical effectors of innate
immunity, presenting a compelling alternative to conventional
antibiotics amidst escalating antimicrobial resistance. Their
broad-spectrum efficacy and inherent low resistance development are
countered by production challenges, including limited yields and
proteolytic degradation, which restrict their clinical translation.
While chemical synthesis offers precise structural control, it is often
prohibitively expensive and complex for large-scale production.
Heterologous expression systems provide a scalable, cost-effective
platform, but necessitate optimization. This review comprehensively
examines established and emerging AMP production strategies,
encompassing fusion protein technologies, molecular engineering
approaches, rational peptide design, and post-translational
modifications, with an emphasis on maximizing yield, bioactivity,
stability, and safety. Furthermore, we underscore the transformative
role of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning
algorithms, in accelerating AMP discovery and optimization, thereby
propelling their expanded therapeutic application and contributing to
the global fight against drug-resistant infections.</p>

on the mechanism of intestinal microbiota against colorectal cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the occurrence and
development of colorectal cancer, and its anti - colorectal cancer
mechanism has become a research hotspot. This article comprehensively
expounds on the molecular mechanisms of the intestinal microbiota in
anti - colorectal cancer, including aspects such as immune regulation,
activation of carcinogenic signaling pathways (it should be noted that
it is more reasonable to be “inhibition of carcinogenic signaling
pathways”), metabolite - mediated effects, and maintenance of intestinal
barrier function. At the same time, it explores the roles and potential
mechanisms of intervention methods such as probiotic supplementation
therapy, immunotherapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation. In
addition, it analyzes the impact of the intestinal flora on the
therapeutic efficacy of colorectal cancer. The existing research results
are summarized, and the future research directions are prospected, with
the aim of providing new theoretical bases and treatment ideas for the
prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.</p>

vesicles in arbovirus infections: from basic biology to potential
clinical applications</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, are currently considered a
global health threat responsible for potentially severe human diseases.
The increased population density, changes in land use and climate change
are some of the factors that are contributing to the spread of these
infections over the last years. The pathogenesis of these diseases and
the mechanisms of interaction with the host, especially those leading to
the development of severe forms, are yet to be fully understood. In
recent years extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as important
players in the inter-cellular and host-pathogen interaction arising a
lot of interest also in the field of vector-borne viruses. In this
context, EVs seem to play a dual role, by either promoting, thus
facilitating, or preventing infection. Many studies are showing how
viruses can hijack the vesiculation machinery to escape the host immune
response and exploit EVs to sustain their replication and propagation,
even though EVs shed by immune cells seem essential to promote antiviral
responses. In this manuscript we reviewed the current knowledge
regarding the association between EVs and vector-borne viruses, paying
particular attention to their possible role in disease transmission and
dissemination, as well as to their potential as novel tools for clinical
applications, spanning from biomarkers of clinical utility to novel
therapeutic options.</p>
