of xerostomia in Sjögren’s syndrome – what effect does it have on the
oral microbiome?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by
lymphatic infiltration of secretory tissues. The disease results in
dryness of the eyeball or mouth, which often occur simultaneously.
Agents used to treat Sjögren’s syndrome may improve oral hydration and
the patient’s quality of life. There are several pharmacological and
non-pharmacological agents used to treat significant problem like
xerostomia. The use of appropriate medicines (i.e. pilocarpine and
cevimeline) may cause changes in the local microbiome, which is very
sensitive to quantitative changes in water. As a result of Sjögren’s
syndrome, a new balance of the microbiome is established in the oral
cavity, which, if disturbed by medical measures, may increase the risk
of oral lesions (such as periodontopathies or caries) or reduce this
risk. Overall, the knowledge regarding microbiological aspects and
agents treating oral dryness is still not well described but initial
results indicate some microbial alterations.</p>

blood and oral microbiome profiles reveal altered microbial composition
and functional pathways in myocardial infarction patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe blood microbiome, increasingly recognized as a
distinct microbial niche, may originate partly from oral translocation.
We systematically compared circulating and oral microbiome profiles
between healthy individuals and myocardial infarction (MI) patients to
identify disease-associated signatures.MethodsThe current study
recruited 20 participants, including 10 healthy controls and 10 patients
with MI. Blood and Saliva samples were collected from each participant
to analyze the association between blood and oral microbiome in MI
patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.ResultsThe blood microbiome
showed significantly greater alpha diversity than the oral microbiome
(p&lt;0.05), but beta diversity did not differ significantly. The blood
microbiome in MI patients had higher levels of Firmicutes, Bacteroidota,
Actinobacteriota, genus Bacteroides, and lower Proteobacteria, whereas
the oral microbiome was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidota,
Veillonella, and Prevotella_7. LEfSe analysis revealed distinct blood
microbial taxa-Actinobacteria in MI patients and Enterobacterales in
controls. In contrast, the oral microbiota of healthy subjects was
enriched in Rothia, Micrococcaceae, and Micrococcales, while no distinct
taxa were associated with MI. Both blood and oral microbiomes showed
significant functional pathway differences (KEGG) between groups.
Additionally, microbiome signatures significantly correlated with
clinical and demographic markers.DiscussionOur study demonstrates that
the blood harbors a distinct microbiome characterized by specific
microbial taxa and functional pathways rather than merely reflecting
oral bacterial translocation. These findings suggest that the
circulating microbiome may play an active role in the pathology of MI.
Furthermore, we identified significant associations between these
microbial signatures and clinical disease markers. This highlights the
potential importance of the blood microbiome in understanding the
mechanisms underlying MI and its diagnostic or therapeutic
implications.</p>

microbiota changes of persistent human papillomavirus infection after
cervical conization</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveWe investigated the changes in vaginal microbiota among
females with persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection following
cervical conization in Xinjiang, China.MethodsA total of 108 female
participants were enrolled in the study, including 37 HPV-positive
females without cervical conization (Group P1), 37 HPV-positive females
after cervical conization (Group P2), and 34 HPV-negative females after
cervical conization (Group N). DNA was extracted from vaginal
secretions, and the V3-V4 regions of bacterial 16S rDNA were amplified
and sequenced using NovaSeq technology. The diversity analysis of the
bacterial microbiota was conducted using QIIME2 and R software, while
the phenotypic analysis was performed with Bugbase
software.ResultsLactobacillus was the predominant genus in the vaginal
microbiota of women with persistent HPV infection after cervical
conization in Xinjiang. Following partial cervical resection, the
α-diversity of the vaginal microbiota decreased, particularly among
patients who had cleared HPV. Bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes
were common in the vaginal environment, with their relative abundance
increasing in cases of persistent HPV infection. Postoperative
persistent HPV infection was found to be correlated not only with
pathogens linked to bacterial vaginosis but also with those associated
with aerobic vaginitis. Gardnerella and Atopobium, as well as
Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, demonstrated a symbiotic synergy.
Both Lactobacillus and Gardnerella exhibited negative correlations with
many pathogenic bacteria. Anaerobic and biofilm formation were the most
evident phenotypes in individuals with persistent HPV infection after
conization.ConclusionThe vaginal microbiota of women with persistent HPV
infection following cervical conization is characterized by the
coexistence of Lactobacillus dominance and increased microbial
diversity. Anaerobic bacteria and biofilm formation may play a
significant role in the persistence of HPV infection post-surgery, and
the role of Gardnerella in the vaginal flora under an HPV-infected state
warrants further study.</p>
