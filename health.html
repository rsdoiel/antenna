id="characterization-of-naegleria-fowleri-from-two-human-cases-insights-into-its-excretionsecretion-products">Characterization
of Naegleria fowleri from two human cases: insights into its
excretion/secretion products</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNaegleria fowleri is the etiologic agent of primary acute
meningoencephalitis (PAM). Although this amoeba is commonly found in
water and soil, reports of infections are rare; problems with diagnosis
probably contribute to underestimation. Moreover, information regarding
the pathogenicity of this species is still lacking. Costa Rica reported
the first three cases of PAM during 2020; from these, two N. fowleri
isolates were recovered. The aim of this study was to characterize and
compare these isolates, focusing in excretion/secretion
products.MethodsAnalyses of protein profiles by silver staining and
protease activity assays were performed to characterize whole protein
extracts and conditioned media from isolates. Proteomic analyses of
excretion/secretion products, including extracellular vesicles (EVs),
were performed, and cytopathic effect and drug susceptibility tests were
also compared between isolates.ResultsResults obtained were similar for
both isolates. Patterns of multiple bands were observed in each isolate
after silver staining. Proteomics analyses revealed a total of 88 and 62
non-redundant proteins as part of the cargo of EVs secreted by
trophozoites of N. fowleri Guanacaste and N. fowleri Limón, while
conditioned media results revealed 34 and 17 non-redundant proteins,
respectively; hydrolase activity and actin filament binding were part of
the most represented gene ontology terms in EVs and conditioned media.
Regarding drug susceptibility assays, no statistically significant
differences were identified. On the other hand, although protease
activity resulted very similar with substrate buffer at pH 8.5, only N.
fowleri Limón showed activity between 40 and 70 kDa at pH 5.0; in
contrast, a more rapid cytopathic effect was observed when incubating
Vero cells with N. fowleri Guanacaste.DiscussionComparative analyses of
different N. fowleri isolates, supported by their remarkable genomic
heterogeneity that could be reflected in different metabolic
repertoires, are key to understanding virulence and pathogenicity of
this amoeba, and could help to explain whether different isolates differ
in the severity or course of PAM.</p>

id="impaired-k48-polyubiquitination-downmodulates-mouse-norovirus-propagation">Impaired
K48-polyubiquitination downmodulates mouse norovirus propagation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNoroviruses are small non-enveloped, single stranded
positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the family Caliciviridae. They
are highly contagious and resistant to multiple detergents and are the
infectious agents in the majority of viral gastroenteritis in adults.
Due to a lack of approved preventive or curative therapy options,
intensive research effort is ongoing to better understand the
pathogenesis mechanisms of noroviruses.MethodsIn this study, using the
persistent murine norovirus S99 strain (MNoV_S99), we have investigated
the role in the regulation of anti-noroviral responses of
ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that covalently adds
one or multiple ubiquitin molecules onto lysine residues of target
proteins. To that end, we have first generated RAW264.7 cells
overexpressing YFP-Ubiquitin_WT, _K29R, _K48R or_K63R constructs. All
non-WT constructs encode a ubiquitin fusion protein with one lysine
mutated into an arginine residue, thus preventing the formation of the
K29-, K48- or K63-dependent polyubiquitin chains
respectively.ResultsUpon infection of these cells with MNoV_S99, we
unexpectedly observed that only cells expressing the YFP-Ubiquitin_K48R
protein showed a significantly impaired expression of several viral
markers: NS5, NS7, VP1 and the replication intermediate dsRNA.
Consequently, the number of viral genome copies or viral titers were
also significantly decreased in the YFP-Ubiquitin_K48R cells compared to
the YFP-Ubiquitin_WT cells. This negative regulation cannot be explained
by perturbed viral entry, but rather a constitutive hypersecretion of
the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF and downstream upregulation of IκBα
phosphorylation and the subsequent NF-κB nuclear
translocation.ConclusionOverall, these consequences combined impose a
non-permissive environment for MNoV_S99 replication and propagation.</p>

learning-based text mining for cutaneous myiasis and potential value of
an accidental maggot therapy for complicated skin and soft tissue
infection with sepsis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCutaneous myiasis, one of the most frequently diagnosed
myiasis types, is defined as skin or soft tissue on a living host
infested by dipterous larvae (maggots). However, bibliometric analysis
of this disease remains sparse. Machine learning techniques and updated
publications provide an opportunity for such an investigation.Materials
and methodsAll the studies were retrieved from PubMed and were processed
using R software in the bibliometric analysis and latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Furthermore, the clinical management of
two diabetes patients with serious soft tissue infection-associated
sepsis was analyzed.ResultsA total of 211 results were retrieved and 50
topics relevant to cutaneous myiasis were determined by the LDA
algorithm. The topics of uncommon fly species, nasal infestation, and
physician discussion of cutaneous myiasis were consistently common over
the last 20 years. Case report remains one of the key features in
myiasis. Four major clusters were identified, i.e., case report related,
disease type and development, travel in the tropics, and skin disease.
To further delve into clinical practice, the clinical features of two
patients with soft tissue infection-related sepsis were demonstrated,
and a distinct beneficial role of myiasis was found. The levels of white
blood cell, blood glucose, and C-reactive protein in the case with
cutaneous myiasis were more stable than the other case without cutaneous
myiasis but with sepsis shock.ConclusionMaggot debridement therapy may
be a promising treatment and beneficial for soft tissue
infection-related sepsis. The model analysis of maggot therapy and its
clinical advantages shows increasing research value and possible
application in future clinical practice.</p>

E virus infection and renal injury in non-immunocompromised host:
clinical investigation and rabbit model study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatitis E virus (HEV)-associated renal injury is mainly
reported in immunocompromised patients. Here we investigated
HEV-associated renal injury in non-immunocompromised acute hepatitis E
(AHE) patients and rabbits.MethodsA total of 35 non-immunocompromised
AHE patients were tested for kidney function parameters and HEV markers.
HEV3- and HEV4-infected rabbits were tested for alanine
aminotransferase, creatinine (Cr), and HEV markers. HEV-associated renal
injury and renal HEV replication were analyzed by histopathology and
RT-qPCR.ResultsThe non-immunocompromised AHE patients all showed normal
serum Cr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine acid (UA). However, 25%
of non-immunocompromised AHE patients showed proteinuria. In the rabbit
model, HEV replication was observed in kidney tissues. The HEV-infected
rabbits showed a transient elevated Cr level. Renal injury, including
focal lymphocytic infiltration and tubular protein casts, was observed
in rabbits across acute, recovery, and chronic phases of HEV
infection.ConclusionsProteinuria is not uncommon in
non-immunocompromised AHE patients, indicating that HEV infection
affects the kidney. We further proved that HEV can cause renal injury in
a rabbit model.</p>

id="the-relationship-between-gut-microbiome-and-human-diseases-mechanisms-predisposing-factors-and-potential-intervention">The
relationship between gut microbiome and human diseases: mechanisms,
predisposing factors and potential intervention</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The complex interrelation of gut microbiota with human health
underlines the profound influence this microbial ecosystem has on
mechanisms of disease and wellness. The gut microbiome profoundly
impacts various human diseases, encompassing gastrointestinal disorders,
metabolic disorders, neurological disorders, and immune-related
diseases. Gastrointestinal disorders are closely linked to microbial
imbalances in the gut. Metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2
diabetes, are influenced by the gut microbiota’s role in energy
regulation and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis
highlights the correlation between gut microbiota and neurological
conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Moreover, the gut
microbiome assumes a pivotal function in regulating the immune system,
whereby dysbiosis is implicated in developing immunological-related
ailments, including allergies and autoimmune disorders. Predisposing
factors, including diet, medicines, lifestyle, and environmental
influences, are described as having an important role in the composition
of the gut microbiome. By understanding these factors, we can get
valuable insights into how to intervene to reduce the chances of a
disease. Current interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal
microbiota transplants, and lifestyle modification, show promise, but
there are still challenges and unanswered questions in this evolving
field that may lead to improvements. This review interrelates the
complicated gut microbiome with various human diseases, mechanisms,
predisposing factors, and potential interventions.</p>

id="understanding-adaptation-to-fluconazole-comparative-insights-into-tolerance-and-resistance-in-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-and-candida-albicans">Understanding
adaptation to fluconazole: comparative insights into tolerance and
resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntifungal resistance and tolerance are distinct
responses exhibited by fungi when exposed to drugs. While considerable
research has focused on azole tolerance in the human pathogen Candida
albicans, studies in other fungal species remain limited.ObjectiveThis
study aims to conduct a comparative investigation of the adaptation of
the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans to
fluconazole in vitro.MethodsWe performed experiments using laboratory
strains of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans to evaluate their fluconazole
tolerance and resistance under varying temperature conditions. High
concentrations of fluconazole were administered, and subsequent changes
in fungal phenotypes were analyzed through techniques such as
transcriptome analysis and monitoring of petite formation.ResultsOur
results revealed that fluconazole tolerance is present in wild-type
strains of S. cerevisiae and is influenced by temperature, albeit in a
manner opposite to that observed in C. albicans. Importantly, when
subjected to high concentrations of fluconazole, S. cerevisiae strains
developed resistance without displaying tolerance; all resistant
adaptors identified were petites. Chemical induction of petite formation
led to an increase in resistance accompanied by a decrease in
tolerance.ConclusionTranscriptome analysis indicated that petites
up-regulated efflux mechanisms while down-regulating most ERG genes.
This suggests that, unlike petite-negative C. albicans, petite-positive
S. cerevisiae swiftly transitions to a petite phenotype upon exposure to
fluconazole, resulting in enhanced resistance but diminished tolerance.
This evolutionary divergence emphasizes the need for additional studies
on fluconazole tolerance in other pathogenic fungi.</p>

id="evaluation-of-multidrug-resistant-bacteria-and-their-molecular-mechanisms-found-in-small-animal-veterinary-practices-in-portugal">Evaluation
of multidrug-resistant bacteria and their molecular mechanisms found in
small animal veterinary practices in Portugal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIntensive medical care provided in companion animal
practices carries the potential risk of selecting and disseminating
multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). However, data on infection,
prevention and control standards specific to small animal veterinary
practices (SAVPs) remains limited. The goal of our work was to evaluate
the environmental contamination and staff carriage by MDROs in
veterinary practices across Portugal.MethodsFourteen SAVPs were
enrolled. Environmental samples were collected from critical areas such
as operating room, wards and pre-operative area. Veterinary team members
voluntarily gave nasal, hand and rectal swabs. All samples were screened
for the presence of, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-
and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRS). Whole-genome sequencing
was performed for carbapenem resistant strains.ResultsEnvironmental
evaluation by surface swabs revealed that 6.5% (n=32/490) were
contaminated with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter spp. (n=5) and IMP-8-producing
Pseudomonas juntendi (n=2) strains were described on different locations
of different SAVPs. Moreover, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=12) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3) strains were also found on multiple
surfaces of different SAVPs. Three human samples (two rectal, one hand)
had carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains by OprD mutations, while
S. maltophilia strains were recovered from four samples (two rectal, two
hands). One nasal swab was positive for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae ST11. Only one SAVP surface was positive for the newly typed
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST9220-II. MRSA
nasal carriage was found in 14% of samples (n=9/64), with an equal
prevalence of ST22-IV and ST8-VI. As for hand samples, MRSA was present
in 10.7% (n=4/38), with a predominance of ST8-VI.DiscussionThese
emerging data indicate that SAVPs may significantly contribute to the
dissemination of MDROs. To address this, rigorous infection, prevention
and control (IPC) measures should be implemented, alongside educational
workshops directed to all veterinary staff as well as to veterinary and
nursing students.</p>

id="apoptosis-inhibitor-of-macrophage-suppress-immune-responses-via-il-10-production-and-delay-bacterial-clearance-in-mycobacterium-avium-infection">Apoptosis
inhibitor of macrophage suppress immune responses via IL-10 production
and delay bacterial clearance in Mycobacterium avium infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections, including Mycobacterium
avium, are increasingly recognized as a growing public health concern,
even among immunocompetent individuals. These infections are a
significant cause of chronic pulmonary disease, and they are
characterized by the formation of foamy macrophages (FMs) that
facilitate bacterial persistence. Previously, we reported that apoptosis
inhibitor of macrophage (AIM), a protein secreted by macrophages,
promotes lipid droplet accumulation in M. avium-infected macrophages.
However, the precise role of AIM in modulating immune responses remains
unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of AIM on FM
formation, bacterial burden, and immune response in M. avium-infected
mice by comparing AIM knockout (KO) mice with wild-type mice.
Histological analysis revealed a reduction in FM formation in AIM KO
mice, accompanied by decreased lipid droplet accumulation and altered
expression of lipid metabolism-related genes. Furthermore, AIM KO mice
exhibited a reduced bacterial load in the lungs, highlighting decreased
cytokine production, including IL-1β, compared to wild-type mice. In
addition, the analysis of the immune cells of AIM KO mice using flow
cytometry revealed an increase in M1 macrophages and IFN-γ-producing T
cells, as well as a decrease in M2 macrophages and interleukin 10
(IL-10)-producing T cells. The reduced expression of CD36 and PD-L1 in
macrophages from AIM KO mice further supports the skewing toward an M1
phenotype. In vitro experiments with bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) confirmed reduced bacterial growth and lipid droplet formation
in AIM KO BMDMs, which was restored by AIM and IL-10 treatment. These
findings suggest that AIM contributes to the promotion of FM formation
by establishing an immunosuppressive environment that promotes the
establishment of M. avium through IL-10 production.</p>
