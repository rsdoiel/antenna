id="non-classical-monocyte-levels-correlate-negatively-with-hiv-associated-cerebral-small-vessel-disease-and-cognitive-performance">Non-classical
monocyte levels correlate negatively with HIV-associated cerebral small
vessel disease and cognitive performance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDespite antiretroviral treatment (cART), aging people
living with HIV (PWH) are more susceptible to neurocognitive impairment
(NCI) probably due to synergistic/additive contribution of traditional
cerebrovascular risk factors. Specifically, transmigration of
inflammatory CD16+ monocytes through the altered blood brain barrier
(BBB) may exacerbate cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), a known cause
of vascular cognitive impairment.MethodsPWH on cART (n=108) and age,
sex, and Reynold’s cardiovascular risk score-matched uninfected
individuals (PWoH, n=111) were enrolled. This is a longitudinal
observational study but only cross-sectional data from entry visit are
reported. Neuropsychological testing and brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) were performed. CSVD was diagnosed by Fazekas score ≥1.
Flow cytometric analyses of fresh whole blood were conducted to evaluate
circulating levels of monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, and
non-classical) and markers of monocyte activation (CCR2, CD40, PSGL-1,
TNFR2 and tissue factor). ELISAs were used to measure sCD14, ICAM, and
Osteoprotegerin. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear
regression models were performed to study the effects of HIV status,
CSVD status, and their interaction to outcome variables such as
cognitive score. Two-sample t-tests and correlation analyses were
performed between and within PWoH with CSVD and PWH with CSVD
participants.ResultsPWH with CSVD (n=81) had significantly lower total
cognitive scores, higher levels of NCMs and soluble CD14 and
intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) as compared to PWoH with CSVD
group (n=68). sCD14 and ICAM1 were positively correlated with each other
indicating that monocyte and endothelial activation are associated with
each other. Cognition was negatively correlated with NCMs, especially in
the PWH with CSVD group. Among other blood biomarkers measured,
osteoprotegerin levels showed mild negative correlation with cognitive
performance in individuals with CSVD irrespective of HIV
status.ConclusionsElevated levels of NCMs may contribute to
neuroinflammation, CSVD and subsequent cognitive impairment. This
finding is of particular relevance in aging PWH as both HIV and aging
are associated with increased levels of NCMs. NCMs may serve as a
potential biomarker to address these comorbidities. Further longitudinal
studies are needed to evaluate whether changes in NCM levels are
associated with changes in CSVD burden and cognitive impairment.</p>

functional prediction of ear canal flora in chronic bacterial otitis
externa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate ear canal microflora’s structure, composition
and function in patients with chronic bacterial otitis externa.MethodsA
case-control study design method was used to collect the ear canal
secretions from 14 patients with chronic bacterial external otitis (CB
group) and 14 healthy controls (H group) treated in the Department of
Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery in the First Affiliated
Hospital of Hainan Medical University. 16S rRNA high-throughput
sequencing technology was used to sequence the ear canal microflora’s V3
~ V4 region gene amplification products in the participating population.
The α diversity of ear canal microflora in 2 groups was analyzed. Based
on the weighted Unifrac distance, principal coordinate analysis was
performed to compare the β diversity of ear tract microflora between the
two groups. The differences in ear microflora at phylum and genus levels
were analyzed. PICRUSt2 function prediction and BugBase phenotype
prediction were also performed.Resultsα diversity analysis showed that
the diversity and richness of auricular microflora in the CB group were
significantly lower than those in the H group. β diversity analysis
showed that there were some differences between the two groups. At the
phylum level, the relative abundance of Bdellovibrionota,
Campylobacterota, and WPS-2 in the microbiota of patients in the CB
group was significantly lower than that in the H group, and the
differences were statistically significant. At the genus level, the
relative abundance of Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Pelomonas,
Sphingomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Brevundimonas, Enhydrobacter, Actinomyces,
Paracoccus and Chryseobacterium in the ear canal of Group H is
significantly higher than that of Group CB. Functional prediction of
PICRUSt2 suggests that amino acid biosynthesis and bacterial microbiota
may be related. In BugBase phenotypic prediction, the contribution of
aerobic phenotype in group CB was significantly lower than that in group
H.ConclusionThe diversity and abundance of the ear canal flora of
patients with chronic bacterial otitis externa were significantly lower
than those of the healthy population, and their bacterial colony
structure was significantly altered. Dysbiosis of the ear canal flora
may be an important cause of chronic bacterial otitis externa.</p>

antigen screening and development of a multi-component subunit vaccine
against Mycoplasma synoviae in chickens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMycoplasma synoviae (MS) is a globally important avian
pathogen causing infectious synovitis and respiratory diseases in
poultry, leading to significant economic losses. Despite advances in
vaccine development, a commercially viable subunit vaccine against MS
remains elusive.MethodsWe sequenced whole genomes of six clinical MS
strains isolated from different Chinese provinces. Common genes were
analyzed using Biopython software, identifying those with high copy
numbers in virulent strains and shared among all strains. Vaxign2 and
IEDB Antibody Epitope Prediction were used to analyze protein
properties. We assessed immune protective effects of candidate proteins
and developed a multivalent subunit vaccine.ResultsTen candidate vaccine
proteins were initially selected. A multivalent subunit vaccine composed
of MSPB, Ppht, Cfba, and EF-G displayed the best protective effect. The
optimal immunization dosage was 20μg, with each protein accounting for
25%. The immune production period was determined to be 28 days
post-first immunization, lasting 180 days. The immune protection rate
against highly virulent strains reached 90%∼100%.DiscussionThis study
provides a new approach for screening vaccine antigens and develops an
effective candidate vaccine for MS prevention. The multivalent subunit
vaccine shows promising results in protecting against MS infections,
potentially offering a solution to reduce economic losses in the poultry
industry.</p>

mediates autophagy, inflammation, and apoptosis to escape host
killing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Brucellosis is a serious zoonosis caused by Brucella spp. infection,
which not only seriously jeopardizes the health of humans and mammals,
but also causes huge economic losses to the livestock industry. Brucella
is a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium that relies primarily on its
virulence factors and a variety of evolved survival strategies to
replicate and proliferate within cells. Currently, the mechanisms of
autophagy, inflammation, and apoptosis in Brucella-infected hosts are
not fully understood and require further research and discussion. This
review focuses on the relationship between Brucella and autophagy,
inflammation, and apoptosis to provide the scientific basis for
revealing the pathogenesis of Brucella.</p>

factors for identifying pneumocystis pneumonia in pediatric
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to identify the risk factors and construct
the diagnostic model associated with pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in
pediatric patients.MethodsThis retrospective observational study
analyzed 34 cases of PCP and 51 cases of other types of pneumonia
treated at Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University between
January 2021 and August 2023. Multivariate binary logistic regression
was used to identify the risk factors associated with PCP. Receiver
operating characteristic curves and calibration plots were constructed
to evaluate the diagnostic model.ResultsTwenty clinical variables
significantly differed between the PCP and non-PCP groups. Multivariate
binary logistic regression analysis revealed that dyspnea, body
temperature&gt;36.5°C, and age&lt;1.46 years old were risk factors for
PCP. The area under the curve of the diagnostic model was 0.958, the
P-value of Hosmer‐Lemeshow calibration test was 0.346, the R2 of the
calibration plot for the actual and predicted probability of PCP was
0.9555 (P&lt;0.001), and the mean Brier score was 0.069. In addition,
metagenomic next-generation sequencing revealed 79.41% (27/34) and
52.93% (28/53) mixed infections in the PCP and non-PCP groups,
respectively. There was significantly more co-infection with
cytomegalovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the PCP group than that
in the non-PCP group (p&lt;0.05).ConclusionsDyspnea, body
temperature&gt;36.5°C, and age&lt;1.46 years old were found to be
independent risk factors for PCP in pediatric patients. The probability
of co-infection with cytomegalovirus and S. pneumoniae in the PCP group
was significantly higher than that in the non-PCP group.</p>

rapid and visual detection assay for Senecavirus A based on
recombinase-aided amplification and lateral flow dipstick</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSenecavirus A (SVA) is a newly pathogenic virus correlated
with the acute death of piglets and vesicular lesions in pigs. The
further prevalence of SVA will cause considerable economic damage to the
global pig farming industry. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnostic
tools for SVA are crucial for preventing and controlling the
disease.MethodsWe designed multiple primer pairs targeting the most
conserved region of the SVA 3D gene and selected those with the highest
specificity. Nfo-probes were subsequently developed based on the highest
specificity primer pairs. Subsequently, the recombinase-assisted
amplification (RAA) reaction was completed, and the reaction temperature
and duration were optimized. The RAA amplicons were detected using a
lateral flow device (LFD). Finally, a rapid and intuitive RAA-LFD assay
was established against SVA.ResultsThe SVA RAA-LFD assay can be
performed under reaction conditions of 35°C within 17 minutes, with
results observable to the naked eye. We then evaluated the performance
of this method. It exhibited high specificity and no cross-reaction with
the other common swine pathogens. The lowest detectable limits of this
method for the plasmid of pMD18-SVA-3D, DNA amplification product, and
viral were 3.86×101 copies/µL, 8.76×10-7 ng/µL, and 1×100.25 TCID50/mL,
respectively. A total of 44 clinical samples were then tested using the
RAA-LFD, PCR, and RT-qPCR methods. The results demonstrated a consistent
detection rate between the RAA-LFD and RT-qPCR assays.ConclusionThe SVA
RAA-LFD assay developed in our study exhibits excellent specificity,
sensitivity, and time-saving attributes, making it ideally suited for
utilization in lack-instrumented laboratory and field settings.</p>

epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of the Omicron variant of
SARS-CoV-2 during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in Pakistan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has
posed extraordinary challenges to global health systems and economies.
The virus’s rapid evolution has resulted in several variants of concern
(VOCs), including the highly transmissible Omicron variant,
characterized by extensive mutations. In this study, we investigated the
genetic diversity, population differentiation, and evolutionary dynamics
of the Omicron VOC during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in
Pakistan.MethodsA total of 954 Omicron genomes sequenced during the
fifth wave of COVID-19 in Pakistan were analyzed. A Bayesian framework
was employed for phylogenetic reconstructions, molecular dating, and
population dynamics analysis.ResultsUsing a population genomics
approach, we analyzed Pakistani Omicron samples, revealing low
within-population genetic diversity and significant structural variation
in the spike (S) protein. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Omicron
variant in Pakistan originated from two distinct lineages, BA.1 and
BA.2, which were introduced from South Africa, Thailand, Spain, and
Belgium. Omicron-specific mutations, including those in the
receptor-binding domain, were identified. The estimated molecular
evolutionary rate was 2.562E-3 mutations per site per year (95% HPD
interval: 8.8067E-4 to 4.1462E-3). Bayesian skyline plot analysis
indicated a significant population expansion at the end of 2021,
coinciding with the global Omicron outbreak. Comparative analysis with
other VOCs showed Omicron as a highly divergent, monophyletic group,
suggesting a unique evolutionary pathway.ConclusionsThis study provides
a comprehensive overview of Omicron’s genetic diversity, genomic
epidemiology, and evolutionary dynamics in Pakistan, emphasizing the
need for global collaboration in monitoring variants and enhancing
pandemic preparedness.</p>

<h2 id="novel-antimicrobial-coating-for-hernia-meshes">Novel
antimicrobial coating for hernia meshes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeAntibiotic coating for several medical devices has been
carried out; however, there are only few studies about coating hernia
meshes with antimicrobial substances. In this study we checked the
capacity of different commercially available hernia meshes to act as
drug carrier.MethodsThe meshes were coated with gentamicin palmitate,
chlorhexidine palmitic acid and chlorhexidine palmitate. The coating
mass and subsequent in vitro delivery rate were evaluated for gentamicin
palmitate by fluorescence polarization. For Chlorhexidine coated devices
the coating mass was determined by weighing. The in vitro delivery rate
was determined by UV absorption (255 nm). The interaction of each mesh
to the different coating substances was observed by scanning electron
microscopy.Results1. Certain uniformity was observed on the quantity of
chlorhexidine coating the surface of each mesh used when compared with
gentamicin palmitate coating. 2.We did not detect significant difference
between the amounts of gentamicin palmitate released from each mesh. 3.
The release of chlorhexidine palmitate and chlorhexidine palmitic acid
from UltraPro™ and Mersilene™ were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in
comparison with the other two meshes. 4. The coating substances covered
the surface of the fibers without damaging its structure. 5. The coating
substances were distributed all along the fibers in all
samples.ConclusionsWe suggest the use of chlorhexidine palmitate and
chlorhexidine palmitic acid, as well as gentamicin palmitate, for
coating of hernia meshes aiming prevention of infections. Further
investigation of the bactericidal effect of coated hernia meshes against
biofilm form of S. aureus and other device-related infections is
suggested.</p>

id="alternative-splicing-in-the-genome-of-hpv-and-its-regulation">Alternative
splicing in the genome of HPV and its regulation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is
the main cause of cervical cancer. These chronic infections are
characterized by high expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes and the
absence of the L1 and L2 capsid proteins. The regulation of HPV gene
expression plays a crucial role in both the viral life cycle and rare
oncogenic events. Alternative splicing of HPV mRNA is a key mechanism in
post-transcriptional regulation. Through alternative splicing, HPV mRNA
is diversified into various splice isoforms with distinct coding
potentials, encoding multiple proteins and influencing the expression of
HPV genes. The spliced mRNAs derived from a donor splicing site within
the E6 ORF and one of the different acceptor sites located in the early
mRNA contain E6 truncated mRNAs, named E6<em>. E6</em> is one of the
extensively studied splicing isoforms. However, the role of E6* proteins
in cancer progression remains controversial. Here, we reviewed and
compared the alternative splicing events occurring in the genomes of
HR-HPV and LR-HPV. Recently, new HPV alternative splicing regulatory
proteins have been continuously discovered, and we have updated the
regulation of HPV alternative splicing. In addition, we summarized the
functions of known splice isoforms from three aspects: anti-tumorigenic,
tumorigenic, and other cancer-related functions, including not only E6*,
but also E6^E7, E8^E2, and so on. Comprehending their contributions to
cancer development enhances insights into the carcinogenic mechanisms of
HPV and explores the potential utility of alternative splicing in the
diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer.</p>

inflammatory and innate immune responses induced by infection with a
novel goose astrovirus in goose embryonic kidney cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSince 2016, a highly lethal visceral gout induced by
infection with the novel goose astrovirus (GoAstV) resulted in an
ongoing outbreak in goslings in China, with a mortality rate ranging
from 10% to 50%, and causing considerable economic losses in the goose
industry. However, the pathogenesis of GoAstV and the molecular
mechanism by which kidney lesions are induced by GoAstV infection are
unclear.MethodsIn the present study, a GEK cell infection model for
GoAstV was established, and the apoptosis, inflammatory and innate
immune responses induced by GoAstV were investigated in GEK
cells.ResultsThe results shown that the expression of proapoptotic
proteins, including Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9 and cytochrome c,
increased in the infection group; however, the expression of the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased, indicating that apoptosis was
induced by GoAstV infection in GEK cells. Besides, the activation of the
RIG-I/MDA5 pathway and the downstream upregulation of proinflammatory
cytokines, including the adapter proteins MAVS, IRF7 and NF-κB and the
proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, were detected in GEK
cells infected with GoAstV. In addition, GoAstV infection induces the
activation of the NLPR3 pathway and further stimulates the increased
production of IL-1β. In summary, the present study revealed that GoAstV
infection could induce apoptosis and the activation of the RIG-I/MDA5
and NLRP3 pathways in GEK cells, as well as the massive release of
proinflammatory cytokines.DiscussionThese results are helpful for
elucidating the molecular mechanism of pathological lesions in the
kidney in gout goslings infected with GoAstV and the interaction between
GoAstV and the innate immune system of the host.</p>

identification in ticks and yaks from Zoige County, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background:Ticks represent a significant vector for the transmission
of infectious diseases, with the prevalence of tick-borne diseases
becoming a prominent global health concern in recent decades. Anaplasma
spp., Rickettsia spp., and Piroplasma have been identified as
significant pathogens with the potential to impact human and animal
health. However, there is a dearth of data concerning the prevalence of
these pathogens in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China.MethodsIn this
study, a total of 643 Dermacentor silvarum and 314 Haemaphysalis
longicornis were identified through the application of morphological and
molecular identification techniques on 957 ticks collected from yaks in
Zoige County. The assessed of Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Theileria
spp., and Babesia spp. was assessed in 957 ticks and 96 blood samples
collected from yaks.ResultsSignificant discrepancies were observed in
the positivity rates for the four pathogens among the tick species and
sampling sites. The identification of different species within the four
pathogens was based on the analysis of the 16S rRNA of Anaplasma spp.,
the ompA and ompB genes of Rickettsia spp., and the 18S rRNA of
Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. The prevalence ranges of the four
pathogens are 9.9-50.2%, 29.5-100%, 16.2-46.4%, and 14.5-58.4%,
respectively.ConclusionIn view of the growing zoonotic risks, further
investigations into the prevalence of additional pathogens in ticks and
animals, including livestock, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, are
essential.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>A growing body of research has established a correlation between
tumors and persistent chronic inflammatory infiltration. As a primary
instigator of inflammation, the majority of microbiomes naturally
residing within our bodies engage in a mutually beneficial symbiotic
relationship. Nevertheless, alterations in the microbiome’s composition
or breaches in the normal barrier function can disrupt the internal
environment’s homeostasis, potentially leading to the development and
progression of various diseases, including tumors. The investigation of
tumor-related microbiomes has contributed to a deeper understanding of
their role in tumorigenesis. This review offers a comprehensive overview
of the microbiome alterations and the associated inflammatory changes in
ovarian cancer. It may aid in advancing research to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the ovarian cancer-associated microbiome,
providing potential theoretical support for the future development of
microbiome-targeted antitumor therapies and early screening through
convenient methods.</p>

mycobacteria enhance the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway to induce
immunosuppression and facilitate pulmonary colonization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM)
infections alongside tuberculosis (TB) underscores a pressing public
health challenge. Yet, the mechanisms governing their infection within
the lung remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic
sequencing, metabolomic sequencing, machine learning classifiers,
SparCC, and MetOrigin methods to profile bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) samples from NTM/TB patients. Our aim is to unravel the intricate
interplay between lung microbial communities and NTM/Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infections. Our investigation reveals a discernible
reduction in the compositional diversity of the lung microbiota and a
diminished degree of mutual interaction concomitant with NTM/TB
infections. Notably, NTM patients exhibit a distinct microbial community
characterized by marked specialization and notable enrichment of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, driving pronounced
niche specialization for NTM infection. Simultaneously, these microbial
shifts significantly disrupt tryptophan metabolism in NTM infection,
leading to an elevation of kynurenine. Mycobacterium intracellulare,
Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, Mycobacterium abscessus, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in the metabolic pathways
associated with the conversion of indole to tryptophan via tryptophan
synthase within NTM patients. Additionally, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
converts tryptophan into kynurenine, fostering an immunosuppressive
milieu during NTM infection. This strategic modulation supports
microbial persistence, enabling evasion from immune surveillance and
perpetuating a protracted state of NTM infection. The elucidation of
these nuanced microbial and metabolic dynamics provides a profound
understanding of the intricate processes underlying NTM and TB
infections, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and
management.</p>
