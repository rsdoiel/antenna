gut-on-chip enables extended in vitro development of Cryptosporidium
hominis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCryptosporidium hominis is the dominant Cryptosporidium
species infecting humans, but most advances in developing robust in
vitro culturing platforms for Cryptosporidium have utilised C. parvum.
Consequently, there is relatively little available information specific
to the biology and life cycle of C. hominis. The present study utilised
a pumpless and tubeless gut-on-chip to generate a physiologically
relevant in vitro environment by applying a constant fluid shear stress
of 0.02 dyn cm-2 to HCT-8 cells. MethodsGut-on-chips were fabricated
using standard soft lithography. C. hominis oocysts isolated from human
pathology samples were used to infect the human ileocecal colorectal
adenocarcinoma (HCT-8) cell line under a constant fluid shear stress of
0.02 dyn cm-2. Parasite growth was assessed using a C. hominis-specific
quantitative PCR, a Cryptosporidium genus-specific immunofluorescence
assay, and scanning electron microscopy. Differences in the HCT-8
transcriptome with and without fluid shear stress, and the host-parasite
interaction, were both assessed using bulk
transcriptomics.ResultsTranscriptomic analysis of the HCT-8 cell line
cultured within the gut-on-chip demonstrated a metabolic shift towards
oxidative phosphorylation when compared to the same cell line cultured
under static conditions. Extended C. hominis (subtype IdA15G1) cultures
were sustained for up to 10 days within the gut-on-chip as shown by a C.
hominis-specific qPCR and a Cryptosporidium genus-specific
immunofluorescence assay, which demonstrated ~30-fold amplification in
the gut-on-chip over the duration of the experiment. Scanning electron
microscopy of infected monolayers identified trophozoites, meronts,
merozoites, macrogamonts, microgamonts, and possible gamont-like stages
at 48 h post-infection. The potential role of gamonts in the
Cryptosporidium life cycle remains unclear and warrants further
investigation. Transcriptomes of HCT-8 cells infected with C hominis
revealed upregulation of biological processes associated with cell cycle
regulation and cell signalling in C. hominis-infected cells under fluid
shear stress compared to static culture. ConclusionsThese data
demonstrate that bioengineered gut-on-chip models support extended C.
hominis growth and can be used to interrogate responses of host cells to
infection. Owing to its relative simplicity, the pumpless and tubeless
gut-on-chip can be accessible to most laboratories with established
HCT-8 infection models for Cryptosporidium culture.</p>

mediates apoptosis, inflammation, and treatment of pathogen
infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The FAS cell surface death receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis
factor receptor family, activates both apoptotic and non-apoptotic
signaling upon interaction with its ligand FASL. It is critical in cell
migration, invasion, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. Pathogen
infection can influence host cells’ behavior by modulating the FAS/FASL
pathway, thereby influencing disease progression. Understanding the role
of FAS signaling in the context of pathogen interactions is therefore
crucial. This review examines FAS-mediated apoptotic and non-apoptotic
signaling pathways, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms of
apoptosis and inflammation induced by bacterial and viral infections.
Additionally, it highlights therapeutic strategies, including drug,
cytokine, antibody, and FASL recombinant protein therapies, providing
new directions for treating pathogenic infections and cancers, as well
as insights into developing novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

id="the-heart-of-the-matter-modeling-hiv-associated-cardiovascular-comorbidities-in-nonhuman-primate-models">The
heart of the matter: modeling HIV-associated cardiovascular
comorbidities in nonhuman primate models</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) that effectively
suppresses HIV replication, and reduced AIDS progression, the clinical
spectrum of HIV infection has dramatically changed. Currently, the
people living with HIV (PLWH) who receive ART have a nearly normal
prognostic of survival, yet they still experience higher morbidity and
mortality than age-matched uninfected subjects. The higher risk of death
in PLWH is linked to persistence of residual systemic inflammation and
T-cell activation. These factors contribute to accelerated aging and
higher incidence of HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions, thereby
presenting new diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This new shifting
paradigm of HIV infection associates a higher incidence of
cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke, acute myocardial
infarction and sudden cardiac death, in stark contrast to the reduced
incidence of opportunistic infections. The incidence of acute myocardial
infarction and coronary disease is several folds higher in PLWH than in
the general population. Study of United States (US) death certificates
listing HIV infection shows that the deaths from CVD doubled between
1996 and 2006. CVD will become an even more prominent comorbidity
considering that more than 50% of PLWH in the US are over 50 years old,
an age that more frequently associates CVD, and cardiovascular
complications are more frequent in urban African-Americans and
Hispanics, which are disproportionately affected by HIV. Therefore,
reducing the overall risk of these complications will become the primary
challenge in the management of chronic HIV infection. Not surprisingly,
the REPRIEVE trial showed a substantial benefit of statins to PLWH, and
the current guidelines include statin administration to PLWH. Nonhuman
primate (NHP) models for the cardiovascular comorbidities associated
with HIV are currently available and their use for testing new
therapeutic approaches aimed at countering the effects of
hypercoagulability and CVD is discussed. Their use can be of tremendous
help to understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and the determinants
of CVD in PLWH, which are currently poorly understood. Use of the NHP
models could help in dissecting the relative contribution of the virus,
behavioral factors, and ART to cardiovascular risk, having the potential
to help us establish new strategic approaches aimed at controlling
HIV-related CVD.</p>

toxicity and immunogenicity evaluation of a recombinant subunit COVID-19
vaccine (ZF2001) in rats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had given rise to a massive
epidemic. Owing to the high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 and the
lack of effective therapies, safe and effective vaccination is the
optimum choice for controlling this epidemic and preventing infection.
The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001, which targets the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) protein of SARS-CoV-2, has a significant protective effect
against COVID-19. At the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, to promote
the early approval of ZF2001 for clinical trials by the National Medical
Products Administration of China (NMPA), a comprehensive evaluation of
its toxicity in vivo was warranted. In the present study, a major part
of the above series of studies, we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity
and efficacy of the ZF2001 vaccine for the first time in adult Sprague
Dawley (SD) rats. The male and female rats were administered three doses
of the ZF2001 vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg NCP-RBD protein/dose, containing
the aluminum-based adjuvant). The safety profile of ZF2001 was assessed
by observing the general health status, local toxicity at the site of
administration, immunotoxicity, immunogenicity, blood chemistry and
hematology parameters in SD rats. In general, our results indicated that
the ZF2001 vaccine did not induce significant systemic toxicity in rats,
with a no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 50 μg NCP-RBD
protein/rat. Moreover, the ZF2001 vaccine showed good immunogenicity by
inducing the production of specific IgG antibodies in rats after three
consecutive immunizations. In addition, histological examination
revealed recoverable inflammatory changes in quadricep muscles and
adjacent lymph nodes at the vaccine injection site. In summary, our
systematic toxicology study proves the safety, tolerability and
immunogenicity of the ZF2001 vaccine, which further supports the results
of clinical trials of ZF2001.</p>

dysbiosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection: implication for pathophysiology and
management strategies of COVID-19</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), in late 2019 initiated a global health crisis marked by
widespread infection, significant mortality, and long-term health
implications. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system,
recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human
microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease
severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased
susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions.
Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of
COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a
significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200
symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition
of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which
SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease
progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates
the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its
implications in disease severity and for developing personalized
therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Furthermore, it highlights the dual
role of the microbiome in modulating disease progression, and as a
promising target for advancing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic
approaches in managing COVID-19.</p>

range of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in healthy individuals and its
predictive value for post-trauma nosocomial infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThis study aimed to establish the reference range of the
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte absolute ratio (NLR) in healthy individuals,
explore the association between NLR and post-trauma nosocomial
infections, and evaluate the effectiveness of NLR in predicting clinical
outcomes of post-trauma infections.MethodsA retrospective analysis was
conducted based on medical records of acute trauma patients from the
China National Center for Trauma Medical and health examination data
from Chengdu First People’s Hospital, Sichuan Province. The reference
range of NLR was established, and multivariate logistic regression
analysis was performed to identify risk factors for infection, with
subgroup analysis conducted by age. The predictive value of NLR for
post-trauma infections was assessed using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC).ResultsA total of 175,019
individuals were included, comprising 165,504 healthy individuals (753
minors [0.45%, &lt;18 years] and 164,751 adults [99.55%]) and 9,515
acute trauma patients (8,602 in the control group [90.40%] and 913 with
post-trauma infections [9.60%]). The 2.5th-97.5th percentile range for
NLR was 0.69-3.48 in minors and 0.86-3.83 in adults. NLR was identified
as an independent risk factor for post-trauma infections, with an odds
ratio (OR) of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.18-1.73). Additionally, NLR showed a
positive correlation with common inflammatory markers, CRP (r = 0.37
[0.32-0.42], weak correlation) and PCT (r = 0.52 [0.45-0.58], moderate
correlation). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
demonstrated that NLR had an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69-0.73, P &lt;
0.0001) for predicting infections, with a diagnostic cutoff value of 4,
sensitivity of 60.28% (95% CI: 59.24-61.31), and specificity of 72.85%
(95% CI: 69.71-75.77). No significant differences in NLR values were
observed between groups with pulmonary infections, urinary tract
infections, combined pulmonary and urinary infections, and soft tissue
infections (P &gt; 0.05). However, NLR values were significantly higher
in patients with fungal infections compared to those without (P =
0.03).ConclusionThe current 2.5th-97.5th percentile range of NLR is
0.69-3.48 in minors and 0.86-3.83 in adults. With increasing age, the
reference range widens, and females tend to have a slightly broader
range than males. NLR is an independent risk factor for post-trauma
infections, showing higher predictive value in patients over 60 years of
age. Although NLR cannot differentiate infection sites or pathogen
types, elevated NLR values may provide a reference for identifying
fungal infections.</p>

of dynamic microbial migration patterns in the respiratory tract</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe role of the respiratory microbiome in lung diseases is
increasingly recognized, with the potential migration of respiratory
pathogens being a significant clinical consideration. Despite its
importance, evidence elucidating this phenomenon remains
scarce.MethodsThis prospective study collected clinical samples from
patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI),
including oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid (BALF). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was employed
to analyze respiratory microbial diversity, complemented by Bayesian
source tracking and sequence alignment analyses to explore pathogen
migration patterns.ResultsA cohort of 68 patients was enrolled, with 56
diagnosed with LRTI and 12 with non-infectious respiratory conditions. A
statistically significant disparity in respiratory microbiome diversity
was observed between infected and non-infected groups (p &lt; 0.05).
Intriguingly, no significant variations in microbial community
structure, including alpha and beta diversity, were detected across
different respiratory tract sites within individuals. The Bayesian
source tracking analysis revealed a pronounced migration pattern among
pathogens compared to the overall microbial community, with migration
ratios of 51.54% and 1.92%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Sequence
similarity analysis further corroborated these findings, highlighting a
notable homology among specific migrating pathogens.ConclusionThis study
represents a pioneering effort in deducing pathogen migration patterns
through microbial source tracking analysis. The findings provide novel
insights that could significantly advance clinical diagnostics and
therapeutic strategies for respiratory infections.</p>

approaches for septicemia induced by multidrug-resistant bacteria using
desert-adapted plants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>AimSepticemia, a life-threatening condition, can arise when bacterial
infections are left untreated, allowing the pathogens to spread into the
bloodstream. Moreover, infections caused by MDR bacteria are
particularly challenging, as they can persist and lead to septicemia
even when treated with conventional antibiotics. This study aimed to
address this crisis by investigating combination therapies using
desert-adapted medicinal plant extracts, including Jasonia candicans (J.
candicans), Cistanche tubulosa, Moltkiopsis ciliata, and Thymelea
hirsuta, as alternative treatments. The goal was to develop new
strategies to combat resistance and improve the management of septic
patients.MethodologyIn this study, 400 blood samples from septic
patients were analyzed to identify Gram-negative bacterial isolates.
Antimicrobial resistance patterns were assessed using standard
susceptibility tests. Medicinal plant extracts were evaluated for
antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion and broth microdilution
assays, while COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition and antioxidant activity were
measured using in vitro assays. Histopathological examinations were
conducted on treated mice to assess tissue damage and response.ResultsWe
observed a high prevalence of E. coli and K. pneumoniae among septic
patients. Multidrug resistance was widespread, with many isolates
showing high resistance to various antibiotics, although all were
susceptible to colistin. Evaluation of desert-adapted plant extracts
revealed that J. candicans exhibited the most potent antimicrobial
activity and the strongest COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities, as
well as antioxidant effects, compared to other extracts and Celecoxib,
with a concentration required to achieve 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50)
value of 71.97 μg/mL for antioxidant activity. Moreover, the combination
of this extract with amikacin showed a synergistic effect, significantly
enhancing antimicrobial efficacy and converting over 50% of
amikacin-resistant strains to sensitive phenotypes. Histopathological
analysis of mice showed that the combination of J. candicans extract and
amikacin resulted in reduced severity of pulmonary lesions and splenic
damage compared to amikacin alone.ConclusionWe highlighted the potential
of J. candicans extracts as combination therapies alongside traditional
antibiotics for combating MDR Gram-negative infections, due to their
superior antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant
properties.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of
miR-9-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in sepsis
patients.MethodsDifferentially expressed miR-9-5p in sepsis were
screened from a database and available literature. Subsequently, iBMDM
cell validation was conducted and the expression level of miR-9-5p in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined using RT-qPCR in 69
sepsis patients and 30 non-sepsis patients with infections, 24 hours
after ICU admission. A control group that comprised 35 healthy
individuals, matched for age and sex, was set up from those who agreed
to provide blood samples laboratory analysis.ResultsOn admission to the
ICU, the levels of miR-9-5p were significantly higher in sepsis patients
(10.13 [3.21, 24.94]) than in non-sepsis patients with infections (2.08
[1.68, 3.18]) and healthy controls (0.86 [0.36, 1.88]) (p &lt; 0.001).
The miR-9-5p levels were positively correlated with the severity of the
disease as indicated by the SOFA score (r=0.656, P&lt;0.001). The AUC of
miR-9-5p in predicting sepsis, septic shock, and in-hospital death was
0.825, 0.821, and 0.845, respectively.ConclusionElevated expression
levels of miR-9-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are
significantly associated with an increased risk of sepsis and septic
shock, and also indicate a higher risk of organ dysfunction.</p>

xylosus from subclinical mastitis-affected cow’s milk using a
whole-genome metagenomic sequencing method. Our analysis subsequently
revealed that the complete genome sequences of the identified bacteria
contained MDR genes and genes for multiple virulence factors. These MDR
bacteria may pose a public health risk through exposure to milkers, milk
handlers, and farm workers or through the handling and consumption of
unpasteurized milk.</p>

characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19- associated invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis in critically patients: a single-center study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveA single-center retrospective study was conducted according
to the latest diagnostic criteria of the European Consortium for
Mycology in Medicine/International Society for Human and Animal Mycoses
(ECMM/ISHAM) Consensus, which describes the clinical characteristics,
factors influencing and prognosis of a group of patients with COVID-19
(Omicron variant) combined with invasive pulmonary mycoses with onset of
disease at the end of 2022.MethodsThis study retrospectively analyzed
data related to 58 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia due to
COVID-19 infection admitted to the ICU of critical care medicine,
respiratory ICU, and ICU of the Department of Infections at the First
Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from December 1, 2022, to
January 31, 2023. CAPA was defined according to the ECMM/ISHAM consensus
criteria. Our study compared the clinical and microbiological
characteristics and associated risk factors of fungal infections and
pulmonary fungal infections and performed univariate and multivariate
analyses of factors associated with mortality in patients with
COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA).Results17 (29.3%) of
the 58 critically ill patients were diagnosed with CAPA, of which 10
(58.82%) patients were Probable CAPA and 7 (41.18%) patients were
Possible CAPA. Among this Aspergillus strains, Aspergillus fumigatus
strains were found in 13 cases (76.47%) and Aspergillus niger strains in
4 cases (23.53%). 7 (41.18%) patients had concomitant bacterial fungal
infections with a mortality rate of 57.14% (4/7), of which Acinetobacter
baumannii was the most common pathogen. Among the patients with CAPA,
galactomannan assay of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed
in 5 patients with a 100% (5/5) positivity rate, and two or more serum
galactomannan (GM) assays were performed in 17 patients, with a
probability of favorable results in both cases of 41.2% (7/17). The
60-day mortality rate in patients with CAPA was 52.9% (9/17), whereas
the non-CAPA patients had a 60-day mortality rate of 24.4% (10/41),
which was statistically different (P = 0.035). Diabetes mellitus (P =
0.018, OR: 5.040 (95% CI: 1.314-19.337)), renal insufficiency (P=0.002,
OR: 11.259 (95% CI: 2.480-51.111)), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) (P = 0.003, OR: 6.939 (95% CI: 1.963-24.531)), elevated
interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P = 0.022, OR: 4.160 (95% CI: 1.226~14.113)),
mechanical ventilation (P = 0.002, OR: 8.100 (95%CI: 2.132~30.777)),
increased duration of steroids use (P = 0.022, OR: 1.071 (95%CI:
1.010~1.135)), increased cumulative dose of steroids use ((P &lt; 0.001,
OR: 1.012 (95%CI: 1.009~1.015)), use of tocilizumab (P = 0.020, OR:
11.480 (95%CI: 2.480~51.111)), and increased length of hospitalization
in ICU (P = 0.021, OR: 1.038 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.071)), and increase in
the type of antibiotics used (P = 0.002, OR: 1.603 (95% CI: 1.181 to
2.176)) were the risk factors for the occurrence of fungal infections,
whereas the use of steroids or not, the use of baricitinib or not, and
hypertension did not have a significant effect on the occurrence of
fungal infections (P &gt; 0.05). Patients with CAPA had a higher
mortality rate, and their hospitalization was prolonged compared to
non-CAPA patients. The all-cause mortality rate for patients with CAPA
was 52.9%. We also performed univariate and multivariate analyses of
potential factors associated with mortality, including the use of
mechanical ventilation (P = 0.040 OR: 10.500, (95% CI: 1.115 to
98.914)), advanced age (P = 0.043 OR: 1.212, (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.460)),
and a significantly higher CRP level (P = 0.042 OR: 1.043, (95% CI:
1.002~1.078)) had a worse prognosis. Steroids use, gender, and diabetes
mellitus were not associated with patient death (P &gt; 0.05).</p>

protein as a fishmeal substitute: impacts on reproductive performance,
immune responses, and gut microbiota in two sow hybrids</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe persistent African swine fever epidemic has
significantly compromised China’s swine production. To accelerate
production recovery, commercial farms are increasingly adopting
retention of two-way backcross sows (Landrace × Yorkshire × Landrace,
LLY) for breeding. This study aimed to investigate the effects of yeast
protein, an emerging sustainable protein source, on reproductive
performance, immune responses, and gut microbiota in two-way crossbred
sows (Landrace × Yorkshire, LY) and LLY sows.MethodsThe experiment
employed a 2×2 factorial design evaluating two fixed factors: sow hybrid
(LY vs LLY) and yeast protein supplementation (0% vs 2.6%). The four
treatment groups were: LY sows without yeast protein supplementation
(LY-C), LLY sows without yeast protein supplementation (LLY-C), LY sows
with yeast protein supplementation (LY-YP), and LLY sows with yeast
protein supplementation (LLY-YP). A total of one hundred healthy sows of
2-6 parities (50 LY sows and 50 LLY sows), were stratified by backfat
thickness, body weight, and parity, then randomly allocated to the four
treatment groups on day 105 of gestation, with 25 sows in each group.
The experimental period lasted from day 106 of gestation to day 18 of
lactation.Results and conclusionYeast protein supplementation showed no
significant effects on most reproductive parameters of different sow
hybrids, but reduced backfat loss by 30.5% during lactation (P &lt;
0.05) and demonstrated a numerical reduction in mummification rate of
fetuses (P = 0.06). Immunological assessments revealed that LLY sows
exhibited 26.8% lower serum IgM concentration than LY sows (P &lt;
0.05), while yeast protein supplementation significantly reduced serum
IL-1β levels by 45.6% (P &lt; 0.05) on day 18 of lactation. 16S rRNA
gene sequencing analysis revealed comparable fecal microbial diversity
across treatments (P &gt; 0.05), though differences were observed in
certain bacterial genera between LY and LLY sows during late gestation
and lactation. Yeast protein supplementation enriched beneficial
bacteria including Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group,
and Christensenellaceae_R_7_group, while suppressing potentially
detrimental bacteria such as Family_XIII_AD3011_group (P &lt; 0.05).
These findings demonstrate the practical feasibility of retaining LLY
sows for commercial breeding. Yeast protein supplementation, as a
substitute for fishmeal during late gestation and lactation,
significantly reduced lactational backfat loss, moderately attenuated
inflammatory response, and enhanced gut microbiome homeostasis through
selective microbial enrichment in sows.</p>
