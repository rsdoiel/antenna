## Hetal Vasavada’s Taco Bell Inspired Dense Bean Salad

date: 2025-08-08, from: Taste of Home

This salad is my love letter to Taco Bell! It has all the flavors of a taco or Crunchwrap filling, just without the tortilla and late-night drive-thru guilt. I mix black and pinto beans with crunchy lettuce, juicy tomatoes, creamy avocado, sour cream, onions and a whole lot of cheese. Then I add Taco Bell’s mild taco seasoning and sauce for that classic Taco Bell flavor. It’s high protein, high fiber and super filling. You can serve this with tortilla chips or eat it on it’s own! —Hetal Vasavada, San Francisco, California

## WHY FERMENTED FOODS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK IN IRELAND – THE RISE OF SOURDOUGH, KIMCHI, AND KOMBUCHA

date: 2025-08-04, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Table of Contents Rediscovering the Past: Ireland’s Fermented Food Heritage The Sourdough Revival: From Ancient Grains to Artisan Loaves Kimchi and Kombucha Go Celtic: Global Ferments with an Irish Twist Health, Gut, and Culture: Why Fermented Foods Are Trending Where to Taste and Learn: Irish Fermenters, Markets, and Workshops Rediscovering the Past: Ireland’s Fermented Food Heritage Fermented foods may be hailed as a modern wellness trend, but in truth, they’re as old as Ireland’s hills. Long before refrigeration, fermentation was essential to survival in Irish homes—from cabbage preserved in brine to buttermilk bubbling in oak churns. Today, this age-old practice is making a vibrant comeback, with Irish consumers seeking foods that are both functional and full of flavor. In the days of our ancestors, every cottage had its own preservation techniques. Cabbage was turned into sour slaws. Dairy wasn’t just consumed fresh—it was cultured into kefir-like drinks, clabber, and thick tangy yogurts. Even fish and meat were sometimes preserved through salt-curing and slow fermentation. These methods weren’t just practical—they added complex taste and extended shelf life. What’s driving this return to fermentation in the 21st century? A mix of nostalgia, nutrition, and the modern search for gut health. Today’s Irish foodies are looking backward to move forward, reviving traditional skills with a contemporary twist. Sourdough is rising again—not just in bakeries, but in home kitchens across the country. Kombucha taps now sit next to craft beer in hip cafés. Kimchi finds a home beside the boxty on creative brunch menus. But beyond the buzz, there’s something deeper happening. Fermented food connects us to nature’s rhythms and to the quiet magic of time. It’s not just about what’s trendy—it’s about what endures. Ireland’s renewed embrace of fermentation is a return to roots, and a delicious one at that. The Sourdough Revival: From Ancient Grains to Artisan Loaves In recent years, Ireland has seen a quiet but powerful transformation in its baking culture. While sliced pan still holds nostalgic charm, sourdough has risen to prominence as the bread of choice for a growing number of Irish households and bakeries. What began as a hipster trend in urban cafés has now taken root in towns, villages, and even rural kitchens across the country. Unlike commercially yeasted breads, sourdough is fermented slowly using wild yeasts and naturally occurring bacteria. This age-old technique results in a loaf that is easier to digest, more flavorful, and often more nourishing. For many Irish bakers, the sourdough revival is not just about taste—it’s about tradition, sustainability, and mindfulness in the kitchen. Artisan bakeries like Firehouse Bakery in Delgany or Scéal Bakery in Dublin have helped lead the charge, offering crusty loaves that showcase Irish flour, sea salt, and heritage grains. Some even blend old varieties of wheat like spelt and emmer, connecting modern consumers to a forgotten agricultural past. And thanks to online tutorials and local workshops, more and more home bakers are nurturing their own sourdough starters on windowsills and countertops from Kerry to Kilkenny. But sourdough’s appeal goes beyond its crumb and crust. It represents a slower way of life—a rebellion against industrial convenience. In a world where so much food is processed for speed and shelf life, sourdough stands apart. It asks us to wait. To feed something. To trust time. That philosophy resonates with a new generation of Irish people who are increasingly seeking connection through their food. Whether it’s a rustic boule on a farmhouse table or a chewy rye loaf served with butter and pickles, sourdough in Ireland today is more than bread—it’s a movement. And it’s feeding a deeper hunger for flavor, integrity, and authenticity in how we eat. Kimchi and Kombucha Go Celtic: Global Ferments with an Irish Twist While sourdough has clear roots in European baking, the Irish ferment revival isn’t just about tradition—it’s also about embracing the global. In kitchens from Cork to Donegal, kimchi and kombucha have found a surprising second home. Once unfamiliar imports, they are now being reimagined with distinctly Irish ingredients and flair. Kimchi—the spicy, pungent Korean fermented cabbage—is no longer confined to Asian restaurants. Irish chefs and food enthusiasts are now crafting versions that reflect local terroir. Think: kimchi made with savoy cabbage, wild garlic, horseradish leaves, or even seaweed harvested from the Atlantic coast. This cross-cultural fermentation is both creative and deeply rooted in Ireland’s love of seasonal, foraged food. Kombucha, the lightly fizzy fermented tea, has also become a staple in Irish cafés and health food shops. Brewed using a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast), kombucha production has blossomed into a cottage industry. Brands like SynerChi in Donegal and King of Kefir in Dublin are leading the charge, offering craft-brewed, small-batch kombucha made with Irish spring water and botanicals like elderflower, nettle, and hibiscus. This new wave of fermentation is about more than importing trends—it’s about indigenizing them. Irish fermenters are not simply copying global styles; they’re blending them with the island’s own food culture. The result? A thriving, hybrid ferment scene that feels both global and local at once. Whether it’s a spicy kimchi folded into a potato boxty or a chilled glass of kombucha enjoyed in a Galway garden, Ireland is making these once-exotic ferments its own. They’re not displacing tradition—they’re expanding it. And in doing so, they reflect a growing appetite for food that is alive, adaptive, and full of character. Health, Gut, and Culture: Why Fermented Foods Are Trending One of the biggest reasons fermented foods are making waves in Ireland today is their profound impact on gut health. As science continues to highlight the vital connection between our digestive system and overall well-being, more people are turning to probiotic-rich foods like sauerkraut, kefir, and kombucha to nourish the body from the inside out. Our ancestors may not have used terms like “microbiome” or “digestive flora,” but they understood the value of foods that kept the gut in balance. Now, modern Irish consumers are rediscovering that wisdom—with help from nutritionists, doctors, and wellness influencers</p>
