## Elise Jesse’s Taco Bouquet

date: 2025-05-20, from: Taste of Home

I love taco night, but sometimes I just need a break from the dishes. Washing every little topping bowl used to hold me back from throwing taco night until I decided to create a Taco Bouquet. I started making this on vacation when I had minimal dishes to use, and I wanted to make sure my little kids kept the floor clean. This simple method saved me time, but didn’t sacrifice flavor. The unique cone shape keeps all the toppings from falling out, making it an easy meal you can walk around with at summer parties, too. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio

## CRUBEENS

date: 2025-05-19, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description: Crubeens are boiled pig’s trotters, once a beloved pub snack and street food in Ireland, particularly popular in the early to mid-20th century. The name comes from the Irish word crúibín, meaning &#8220;little hoof.&#8221; Traditionally eaten by hand and enjoyed with mustard or vinegar, crubeens are prized for their rich, gelatinous texture and deep pork flavour. While less common today, they remain a nostalgic and culturally significant dish. Preparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 2½–3 hoursServing Size: Serves 4 Ingredients: 4–6 pig’s trotters (cleaned and split if necessary) 1 onion, peeled and halved 2 carrots, chopped 2 celery sticks, chopped 3–4 garlic cloves, crushed 2 bay leaves 6–8 black peppercorns Salt to taste Malt vinegar or mustard, for serving Optional: crusty bread or mashed potatoes Instructions Clean the TrottersRinse the pig’s trotters thoroughly under cold water. If they still have hairs or bristles, scorch them off with a flame or scrape carefully with a knife. Prepare the BrothPlace the trotters in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and skim off any scum. Add Vegetables and SeasoningAdd the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Simmer gently for 2½ to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and gelatinous and starts to come away from the bone. ServeRemove the trotters from the pot and allow them to cool slightly. Traditionally, crubeens are eaten by hand, hot or cold, with mustard or vinegar. The broth can also be strained and served as a rich soup base. Serving Suggestions: Pub-style: Serve hot with mustard, vinegar, and a pint of stout. Homestyle: Accompany with mashed potatoes or colcannon for a more filling meal. Snack-style: Chill and slice into medallions to eat cold with pickles.</p>

## GOOSEBERRY FOOL

date: 2025-05-19, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description: A light and creamy traditional Irish dessert, Gooseberry Fool blends the tartness of gooseberries with sweetened whipped cream or custard. It dates back to the 15th century and remains a summer favourite when gooseberries are in season. The balance of sharp fruit and smooth cream makes it both refreshing and indulgent. Preparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 10-15 minutesServing Size: Serves 4 Ingredients: 300g (10 oz) fresh gooseberries, topped and tailed 75g (⅓ cup) caster sugar (adjust to taste) 250ml (1 cup) double cream (heavy cream) ½ tsp vanilla extract (optional) A few fresh mint leaves or crushed biscuits for garnish (optional) Instructions: Cook the GooseberriesPlace the gooseberries and sugar in a saucepan with 1–2 tablespoons of water.Simmer gently over low heat for 10–15 minutes, or until the gooseberries have burst and softened into a compote. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cool the FruitOnce cooked, remove from heat and allow to cool completely. For a smoother texture, you can purée the mixture using a hand blender or press it through a sieve. Whip the CreamIn a separate bowl, whip the cream and vanilla extract (if using) until soft peaks form. Fold TogetherGently fold the cooled gooseberry compote into the whipped cream. You can fully mix it for a uniform fool or swirl for a marbled look. Chill and ServeSpoon into individual serving glasses or bowls. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving. Optional GarnishTop with a sprig of mint, crushed ginger biscuits, or a few whole cooked gooseberries for a lovely finish.</p>

## Lucy Wang’s Tuna Poke with Rice Paper Chips

date: 2025-05-19, from: Taste of Home

Is it science? Is it wizardry? I don't know, but it’s so satisfying and delicious with everything. I always thought rice paper was meant for Vietnamese-style summer rolls, but frying it just unlocked an entirely new fixation. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles, California

## Hetal Vasavada’s Orange Creamsicle Tres Leches Cake

date: 2025-05-19, from: Taste of Home

This tres leches cake is my homage to the orange creamsicle, that dreamy combo of citrus and vanilla I grew up loving every summer. I use a lush, citrusy milk soak infused with oleo saccharum, a classic technique from old-school punch recipes where sugar is massaged into citrus peels to draw out their fragrant oils. It’s a simple trick that adds incredible depth and natural orange flavor without a drop of extract. It also makes sure that your tres leches mixture doesn't curdle. I take a little shortcut with the cake itself, using a box mix boosted with extra eggs, milk instead of water, and butter instead of oil for a richer sponge that soaks up all the orange-vanilla tres leches milk. It’s nostalgic, bold and sunshiny in every bite. —Hetal Vasavada, San Francisco, California
