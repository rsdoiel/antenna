## SPICED BEEF(CORK STYLE)

date: 2025-05-26, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description Spiced Beef is a festive and flavorful delicacy from Cork, traditionally enjoyed during Christmas but cherished year-round. The beef is cured in a mixture of spices—like cloves, allspice, black pepper, and sugar—then slow-cooked until tender. It’s usually served cold, thinly sliced, and paired with crusty bread or mustard. Recipe Summary Preparation Time: 20 minutes (plus 5–7 days curing time) Cooking Time: 3–4 hours Serving Size: Serves 8–10 Ingredients For the Cure: 4–5 lb (2–2.5 kg) beef brisket (flat cut, well-trimmed) ½ cup brown sugar ½ cup coarse sea salt 1 tbsp cracked black pepper 1 tbsp whole allspice 1 tbsp whole cloves 1 tbsp juniper berries (optional) 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground nutmeg 1 tsp ground ginger 4 garlic cloves, crushed 1 bay leaf, crumbled For Cooking: 1 onion, quartered 1 carrot, chopped 1 celery stalk, chopped Water to cover Instructions Prepare the Spice Mix: In a bowl, mix all the curing ingredients together. Rub and Cure: Rub the spice mixture thoroughly all over the beef. Place in a large ziplock bag or non-metallic dish, cover, and refrigerate for 5 to 7 days. Turn the beef daily to ensure even curing. Rinse and Simmer: After curing, rinse the beef under cold water to remove excess spices. Place in a large pot with onion, carrot, and celery. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Skim any foam, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook Slowly: Simmer the beef for 3 to 4 hours until tender. You can use a slow cooker on low for 8 hours as an alternative. Cool and Slice: Let the beef cool in the broth. Once cooled, wrap and refrigerate until firm. Slice thinly and serve cold. Serving Suggestions Serve with crusty brown bread, mustard, or pickles. Excellent in sandwiches or as part of a festive cold meat platter.</p>
