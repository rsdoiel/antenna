These boneless chocolate chip cookies are eggless, budget-friendly and simple to make.

## PORTER CAKE: A RICH DESSERT WITH A GUINNESS TWIST – THE HISTORY OF THIS BOOZY FRUITCAKE

date: 2025-06-23, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Table of Contents The Deep Roots of Porter Cake in Irish Kitchens Key Ingredients and What Makes It Unique A Cake for All Seasons – Celebrations, Holidays, and Daily Life The Modern Revival: Recipes, Variations, and Twists From Ireland to the World – Cultural Legacy and Emigrant Stories The Deep Roots of Porter Cake in Irish Kitchens Porter Cake is not just a rich, spiced fruitcake—it’s a slice of Irish culinary history that embodies the heart of home baking. Made with dark Irish porter (most famously Guinness), it’s a loaf that tells the story of frugality, festivity, and flavor, all rolled into one humble but delicious package. Its origins are tied to the evolution of Irish domestic baking in the 18th and 19th centuries. As porter-style beer became widely available throughout Ireland—especially after the founding of Guinness in 1759—home cooks began using it not only for drinking but as an ingredient in hearty meals. Just as porter added body to beef stews and depth to brown breads, it found a flavorful role in desserts. Recipes for porter cake began appearing in Irish cookbooks and handwritten family journals in the mid-1800s. These cakes were originally baked for holidays, weddings, and religious festivals like Easter or Christmas. Their popularity grew due to two key advantages: they lasted for weeks without spoiling and actually tasted better with time. In an age without refrigeration, this made them both practical and celebratory. Unlike the more luxurious, brandy-soaked Christmas puddings of the English gentry, porter cake was a cake for the people. It used ingredients that were becoming more accessible to the rural Irish: dried fruits imported through coastal ports, affordable brown sugar, and of course, the ever-present porter that flowed from urban breweries into countryside shops and pubs. What also made the cake stand out was its texture—dense, moist, and deeply flavored. The porter infused the crumb with a roasted maltiness that balanced the sweetness of the fruit. Combined with warming spices like cloves, nutmeg, and mixed spice, it created a loaf that was at once rich, rustic, and comforting. Many grandmothers had their own version, and some were fiercely secretive about the blend of spices or the exact brand of porter used. In some areas of Ireland, the cake was baked in round tins and served like a pie; in others, it was made in long rectangular loaf pans and sliced generously for tea. Whether wrapped in parchment for a child’s school lunch or offered to guests at wakes and weddings, Porter Cake had a place in nearly every Irish home. Its longevity made it ideal for slow weeks between shopping trips or for tucking into tins to share with neighbors. In times of celebration or hardship, this cake remained—a small but enduring comfort, often baked with love and memories in equal measure.   Key Ingredients and What Makes It Unique At first glance, Porter Cake might appear similar to other fruitcakes—but a closer look reveals how its carefully chosen ingredients transform it into a distinctively Irish creation. This is a recipe born from both resourcefulness and flavor intuition, where every component plays a role in achieving the cake’s dense texture and rich complexity. 1. Porter or Stout – The Star Ingredient At the heart of every Porter Cake lies its namesake: a dark, malty beer such as Guinness. Traditionally, Irish porter was slightly sweeter and less bitter than stout, but modern recipes often use either. The alcohol content helps preserve the cake, while the roasted barley adds a deep, toasty flavor. When baked, porter doesn’t leave the cake tasting boozy—it lends it a rounded, nutty base that enhances the warmth of the spices and the richness of the fruit. 2. Dried Fruits – Sweetness and Chew Irish home cooks made use of whatever dried fruits were available—usually raisins, sultanas, and currants. These fruits were sometimes soaked in porter before baking to help them plump up and absorb flavor. The sweetness of the fruit balances the slight bitterness of the beer, creating a harmonious flavor that deepens as the cake rests. 3. Butter and Brown Sugar – The Moisture Makers Unlike some drier fruitcakes, Porter Cake is rich and tender, thanks to generous quantities of real Irish butter. Brown sugar is preferred over white, as it adds molasses notes that echo the beer’s malt. The fat and sugar ensure that the cake stays moist for days—if not weeks—after baking. 4. Flour and Raising Agent Most traditional recipes call for plain flour and a modest amount of baking soda. The soda reacts with the acidity in the porter to create a gentle rise—not enough to make the cake airy, but just enough to avoid heaviness. The result is a close, satisfying crumb that holds its shape when sliced. 5. Spices – Warming and Aromatic Mixed spice—a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and sometimes allspice or ginger—is what gives Porter Cake its signature warmth. These spices reflect Ireland’s long history of importing colonial goods through ports like Cork and Waterford. Over time, these exotic flavors became essential to Irish festive baking. 6. Optional Additions While purists might stick to the basics, many bakers add extras like orange zest, chopped nuts (often almonds or hazelnuts), or even a spoon of treacle for darker flavor. In some recipes, a splash of Irish whiskey is added alongside the porter—especially around Christmas—to enrich the festive feel. One of the most beautiful aspects of Porter Cake is its flexibility. The foundation remains the same, but each baker, each family, and each county in Ireland may add their own signature flourish. The result? A cake that is both consistent and customizable—ideal for tradition, yet open to innovation.   A Cake for All Seasons – Celebrations, Holidays, and Daily Life Though it may have humble roots, Porter Cake became a beloved centerpiece for many Irish family traditions. Its rich flavor and long shelf life made it not only practical but also ceremonial. In a country where feasting often revolved around religious and</p>

## SMOKED SALMON SUSHI WITH PICKLED SAMPHIRE

date: 2025-06-23, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Irish Seafood Meets Japanese Style Smoked Salmon Sushi with Pickled Samphire brings together the best of Irish coastal produce and Japanese culinary technique. This fusion dish combines silky smoked Irish salmon with vinegared sushi rice and a pop of briny freshness from pickled samphire—a coastal vegetable native to Irish shores. It&#8217;s a fresh, elegant appetizer or light meal that celebrates both tradition and innovation. 🍽️ Serving Size Makes 24 sushi rolls (serves 4–6 as an appetizer) ⏱️ Preparation Time 30 minutes (plus 30 minutes for rice cooling) 🔥 Cooking Time 15 minutes Ingredients For the Sushi Rice: 1 cup sushi rice 1 1/4 cups water 2 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tbsp sugar 1/2 tsp sea salt For the Rolls: 6 sheets of nori (seaweed) 200g thinly sliced smoked Irish salmon 1/2 cup pickled samphire (see below) 1 cucumber, julienned 1 ripe avocado, sliced Optional for Serving: Soy sauce Pickled ginger Wasabi How to Make Pickled Samphire Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Blanch 1/2 cup fresh samphire for 1 minute, then plunge into ice water. Drain and place in a small jar with 1/4 cup white wine vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, and a pinch of salt. Let sit for 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight. Instructions Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Combine rice and water in a pot, bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat. Simmer for 10–12 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand (covered) for 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, dissolve sugar and salt in the rice vinegar over low heat. Stir into the rice and let cool to room temperature. Lay a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat (or parchment paper). Spread a thin layer of rice over the sheet, leaving a 1-inch gap at the top. Arrange smoked salmon, pickled samphire, cucumber, and avocado in a line near the bottom edge of the rice. Roll the sushi tightly using the mat, sealing the edge with a bit of water. Slice each roll into 4–6 pieces using a wet, sharp knife. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately with soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi if desired. Serving Tips This Irish-Japanese fusion sushi makes an elegant party dish or starter. For a dramatic touch, serve with wild sea herbs or edible flowers. For a more casual feel, pair it with a cold glass of white wine or craft beer.</p>

## FLUMMERY

date: 2025-06-23, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>A Traditional Irish Oatmeal Dessert Flummery is a historic Irish dessert once beloved in country kitchens and urban homes alike. Made by soaking oatmeal in water, straining it, and then sweetening the silky liquid, this simple dish was known for being nourishing, economical, and comforting. Though it faded from popularity, Flummery is making a quiet comeback as people rediscover its wholesome texture and subtle flavor—ideal as a light dessert or breakfast alternative. 🍽️ Serving Size Serves 4 ⏱️ Preparation Time 10 minutes (plus overnight steeping) 🔥 Cooking Time 15 minutes Ingredients 1 cup rolled oats (or pinhead oatmeal for a more traditional texture) 2 cups cold water (plus extra if needed) 1 tbsp brown sugar or honey (adjust to taste) 1 pinch of sea salt Optional: fresh cream, cinnamon, or berry compote for serving Instructions Place the oats in a bowl and cover with 2 cups of cold water. Stir, cover, and leave to steep overnight (8–12 hours). The next day, stir the mixture again and strain through a fine sieve or muslin cloth into a saucepan, pressing the oats to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the oat solids or repurpose them in baking or compost. Gently heat the strained liquid over medium-low heat, stirring continuously until it thickens slightly—about 10–15 minutes. Add the brown sugar (or honey) and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust sweetness if needed. Once slightly thickened, remove from heat and pour into small bowls or ramekins. Let it cool, then refrigerate for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with cream, fruit, or spices if desired. Serving Suggestions Traditionally served plain, Flummery also pairs beautifully with fresh raspberries, stewed apples, or a drizzle of cream. Its gentle taste and texture make it suitable for all ages, especially when served slightly warm on colder days.</p>
