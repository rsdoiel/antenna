## Elise Jesse’s Pasta Salad

date: 2025-04-28, from: Taste of Home

Summer was made for pasta salad, and this creamy, colorful dish is my go-to. My mom whipped it up in the '90s when every pasta salad was smothered with Italian dressing. That version wasn’t my mom’s speed, so she took a risk and switched it up with mayo. She nervously brought it to a pool party, and to her surprise, it was an instant hit. Soon, it became a highly requested dish. Now my own kids ask for it too. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio

## THE ASIAN-IRISH FOOD CONNECTION: HOW CHINESE AND INDIAN CUISINE BECAME IRISH STAPLES

date: 2025-04-28, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>A New Flavor Arrives – Immigration and Ireland’s Expanding Palate Ireland, long known for its hearty traditional dishes like stews, soda bread, and roasts, began to experience a quiet culinary revolution in the latter half of the 20th century. As waves of immigrants from China, India, and other parts of Asia arrived — many seeking new opportunities in a modernizing Ireland — they brought with them rich food traditions that would soon intertwine with Irish tastes in unexpected ways. In the 1970s and 80s, small Chinese takeaways started appearing in towns across the country. These weren’t the sprawling restaurants of major cities, but modest, family-run operations offering a handful of familiar dishes like sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and chow mein. At the same time, Indian cuisine was beginning to find its footing, introducing bold spices, curries, and savory breads to a population mostly accustomed to salt, pepper, and parsley. The Irish public, curious and increasingly cosmopolitan, embraced these new flavors — but with a twist. Asian recipes were adapted to suit local tastes: milder spices, simpler ingredients, generous portions. Dishes evolved into a fusion that was neither fully traditional Chinese or Indian, nor fully Irish — something entirely new was taking shape. In this beginning phase, food wasn’t just about nourishment — it was about connection. It was about adventure on a plate, in a country that was just starting to open up to the wider world. These early interactions laid the groundwork for some of Ireland’s most beloved late-night staples, like curry chips and spice bags, which would soon become part of the national identity. Curry Chips – The Birth of a Beloved Irish Dish If there’s one dish that perfectly symbolizes the Asian-Irish food fusion, it’s the humble yet mighty curry chips. Found everywhere from chip shops in rural villages to bustling city center takeaways, curry chips are simple: thick-cut, golden Irish chips (fries) drenched in a mild, savory curry sauce. But behind that simplicity is a story of cultural blending that captured Ireland’s heart — and taste buds. In the late 20th century, as Chinese takeaways spread across Ireland, many shop owners adapted their menus to local expectations. Knowing that Irish customers loved their traditional chips, enterprising chefs began offering a new option: chips served with a rich, comforting curry sauce — one that wasn’t too spicy, but just exotic enough to feel exciting. The curry sauce itself was a fusion invention, often based on a Cantonese-style curry popular in Hong Kong, modified further to fit Irish palates. It was thick, slightly sweet, with just a little heat — a flavor that complemented the crispy, fluffy texture of freshly fried chips perfectly. What made curry chips so iconic wasn’t just the taste — it was the experience. Hot, steamy chips in a paper carton, soaked in warm curry, eaten on a cold Irish night after a pub crawl or a GAA match. It became a ritual, a comfort food that bridged traditional Irish eating habits with the vibrant flavors of Asia. By the 1990s, curry chips weren’t just a novelty; they were an expectation. And today, they’re a beloved classic, proudly Irish in spirit yet deeply rooted in the country&#8217;s immigrant story. The Spice Bag – Ireland’s New National Obsession If curry chips were the first great Asian-Irish fusion hit, the spice bag was the sensation that followed.Appearing sometime around the early 2010s, particularly in Dublin and other major cities, the spice bag quickly skyrocketed from local secret to nationwide craze — and it remains one of Ireland’s most beloved takeaway orders today. At its core, a spice bag is beautifully chaotic: crispy chips, deep-fried chicken pieces (often shredded or in bite-sized chunks), tossed together with sautéed peppers, onions, and a house-made spice mix. The flavor is salty, spicy, slightly sweet, and completely addictive. Each takeaway has its own version, but the basic experience is the same: a warm paper bag stuffed with pure comfort. The spice bag’s creation was no accident. Irish Chinese takeaways, already well-experienced in blending traditional Asian flavors with Irish preferences, saw an opportunity to combine familiar ingredients into something entirely new. Influences from Cantonese cooking (salt and pepper seasoning, fried chicken) blended with the Irish love of hearty, fried food and generous portions. Social media played a major role in the spice bag’s explosion. Suddenly, people were posting about their late-night spice bag cravings, sharing “best spice bag in town” recommendations, and even inspiring spice bag–themed merchandise. It became more than food — it became a cultural moment. Unlike traditional dishes, the spice bag is entirely Irish in origin, despite its Asian-inspired flavors. It&#8217;s a symbol of modern Ireland: diverse, inventive, and proudly blending different worlds into something uniquely its own. At its core, a spice bag is beautifully chaotic: crispy chips, deep-fried chicken pieces, tossed together with sautéed peppers, onions, and a house-made spice mix. A New Flavor Profile – How Asian Spices and Techniques Influenced Irish Cooking While curry chips and spice bags captured a particular moment, the impact of Asian cuisine on Ireland has gone much deeper — changing not just takeaway menus, but also everyday home cooking, grocery shopping habits, and even restaurant culture. By the late 1990s, ingredients that once seemed exotic — like garam masala, soy sauce, ginger, turmeric, and five-spice powder — began appearing on the shelves of ordinary supermarkets across Ireland. This wasn’t just about takeaway food anymore; it was about how Irish people cooked at home.Home cooks started experimenting, blending Asian spices into stews, roasting meats with hints of soy and ginger, or even creating Irish-Asian hybrids like curried shepherd’s pie. Restaurants also evolved. It became increasingly common to find gastropubs offering dishes like Thai green curry with Irish chicken, beef and black bean stew with soda bread, or masala-infused seafood chowder. Chefs across Ireland recognized that diners wanted more adventurous flavors, but still craved comfort — and so fusion cuisine thrived. Even traditional celebrations, like Christmas, began to feature</p>

## IRISH SODA BREAD PIZZA

date: 2025-04-28, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description: A hearty Irish twist on classic pizza! This rustic version uses quick and easy soda bread dough instead of yeast dough, creating a dense yet tender base. Topped with rich Irish cheddar, smoky bacon, and your favorite herbs, it’s a simple but satisfying meal with true country flavor. Preparation Time: 15 minutesCooking Time: 20 minutesServing Size: Serves 4 Ingredients: For the Soda Bread Dough: 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour 1 tsp baking soda ½ tsp salt ¾ cup (180 ml) buttermilk (more if needed) For the Toppings: •1 ½ cups (150 g) grated Irish cheddar cheese 4–5 slices smoked bacon, cooked and chopped 1–2 tbsp fresh chopped chives or scallions Black pepper, to taste Optional: a few thin slices of tomato or caramelized onion Instructions: 1.Make the Dough: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually stir in the buttermilk until a soft dough forms. Add a little more buttermilk if the dough is too dry.   2.Roll Out the Base: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth. Roll it out into a rough circle about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick — rustic is perfect! Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.   3.Add Toppings: Sprinkle the grated cheddar evenly over the base. Scatter the cooked bacon pieces over the cheese. Add any extra toppings you like, such as tomatoes or onions. Season lightly with black pepper.   4.Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 15–20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the crust is golden brown.   5.Finish and Serve: Sprinkle with fresh chives or scallions before slicing and serving warm.</p>
