## San Francisco Cioppino

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

Traditionally, cioppino is made with whatever seafood was caught that day or whatever seafood is on hand. It began as a soup for the working class, but with how delicious it tastes, it's no wonder this dish made its way into high-end restaurants and hotels. Feel free to use whatever fish, shellfish and seafood you can find. —Barbara Pletzke, Herndon, Virginia

## Light & Creamy Chocolate Pudding

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

## Appalachian Stack Cake with Apple-Bourbon Sauce

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

My version of a completely traditional Appalachian stack cake was inspired by the way my ancestors would have made it many moons ago. All the ingredients are there: dried apples, a stiff dough, molasses and apple butter. My only flair is adding a bourbon sauce to drip over the edges and right into your heart. —Lauren May, <a href="https://www.mustloveherbs.com/" target=" _blank" =""="">Must Love Herbs</a>

## Creamy Strawberry Icebox Cake

## Italian Pan-Fried Chicken

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

## Air-Fryer Zucchini Fries

## Cuts-Like-Butter BBQ Brisket

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

## Butter Pecan Cookie Bars with Penuche Drizzle

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

I have made these bars for many, many years. They are rich, chewy, nutty and buttery—all the good stuff. I like to use dark brown sugar for the extra flavor. A sprinkle of some pecans on the top makes for a nice nutty, toasted flavor. They freeze well, that is, if they last long enough! A little drizzle of old-fashioned penuche icing takes them over the top. You could eat these without the penuche, but why would you want to? —Kallee Krong-McCreery, Escondido, California

## Creamy Pizza Soup

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

This Creamy Pizza Soup is like eating supreme pizza with a spoon! You can add your own favorite pizza toppings as long as you include the ooey-gooey melty cheese on top. If you can't find the tomato and sweet basil bisque soup, try using canned tomato bisque soup and adding Italian seasoning. —Susan Bickta, Kutztown, Pennsylvania

## Dark Chocolate Peppermint Bark

date: 2025-01-17, from: Taste of Home

Classic dark chocolate peppermint bark gets a new look by swirling dark and white chocolate together. You can also layer them if you wish. Be sure to use real peppermint oil (not extract) so your chocolate won't seize into a big clump. —<a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/author/jschend/">James Schend</a>, <a href="https://www.dairyfreed.com/" target="_blank">Dairy Freed</a>
