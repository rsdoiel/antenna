## IRISH WHEATEN BREAD

date: 2025-05-12, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Description: Irish Wheaten Bread is a hearty, slightly sweet wholemeal bread made with whole wheat flour, buttermilk, and baking soda. It has a nutty flavor and dense texture, making it perfect for serving with butter, jam, or alongside soups and stews. This traditional Irish bread is quick to prepare, requiring no yeast or lengthy rising time. Preparation Time: 10 minutesCooking Time: 40-45 minutesServing Size: 1 loaf (about 8-10 slices) Ingredients: 3 cups (360g) whole wheat flour 1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour 1 tsp baking soda 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp brown sugar (optional, for a touch of sweetness) 1 ¾ cups (420ml) buttermilk 2 tbsp rolled oats (for topping, optional) Instructions: Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease a 9&#215;5-inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and brown sugar (if using). Stir well to ensure the baking soda is evenly distributed. Add Buttermilk: Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a wooden spoon or your hands until the mixture comes together into a slightly sticky dough. Do not overmix. Shape the Dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently shape it into a loaf to fit your pan. Alternatively, you can shape it into a round loaf and place it on a baking sheet for a more rustic look. Prepare for Baking: Place the dough in the prepared loaf pan or on a baking sheet. If desired, sprinkle rolled oats on top for texture. Cut a shallow cross or slash on the top of the loaf to help it bake evenly. Bake: Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If the top browns too quickly, cover it loosely with foil. Cool: Remove the bread from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before slicing. Serving Suggestions Serve warm with Irish butter, homemade jam, or honey. Pair with soups, stews, or smoked salmon for a classic Irish meal. Toast slices for a hearty breakfast with cheese or avocado.</p>
