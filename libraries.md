## The Open University of Brazil in the management of student permanence in Pedagogy courses

date: 2024-06-07, from: SciELO in Perspective

<p>The growth of distance education (<em>Educação a Distância, EaD</em>) in Brazil, coupled with the high dropout rates in this modality, brings with it the need to renew school management models, with the aim of keeping students until they graduate. Based on an analysis of the Pedagogy courses at the Open University of Brazil, researchers have developed alternative guidelines to guarantee student retention.  <span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span> <span class="more-link-wrap"><a href="https://humanas.blog.scielo.org/en/2024/06/07/the-open-university-of-brazil-in-the-management-of-student-permanence-in-pedagogy-courses/#new_tab" class="more-link"><span>Read More &#8594;</span></a></span></p>

## Web platform can revolutionize the essay correction process

date: 2024-06-06, from: SciELO in Perspective

<p>In search of an alternative to the laborious process of correcting essays, more specifically regarding identifying deviations from the theme in essays, researchers have developed a text feedback platform that simulates the National High School Examination (<em>Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio, ENEM</em>) guidelines and grades, the Corrector of Essays by Artificial Intelligence (<em>Corretor de Redações por Inteligência Artificial, CRIA</em>). The tool is already being used by students and education professionals. <span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span> <span class="more-link-wrap"><a href="https://humanas.blog.scielo.org/en/2024/06/06/web-platform-can-revolutionize-the-essay-correction-process/#new_tab" class="more-link"><span>Read More &#8594;</span></a></span></p>

## How do young people experience the democratization of access to higher education?

date: 2024-06-06, from: SciELO in Perspective

<p>Educational expansion, marked by the tension between meritocracy and pragmatism in access to higher education, confronts the aspirations and realities of young people, especially those from working class backgrounds, amid the erosion of traditional notions of career and stability. While some seek any degree as a means of social mobility, others aim for specific careers, trying to adapt in the face of obstacles. <span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span> <span class="more-link-wrap"><a href="https://humanas.blog.scielo.org/en/2024/06/06/how-do-young-people-experience-the-democratization-of-access-to-higher-education/#new_tab" class="more-link"><span>Read More &#8594;</span></a></span></p>
