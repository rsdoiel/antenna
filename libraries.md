## Changing fees to increase equity and reduce complexity

date: 2025-07-28, from: Crossref Blog

<p>The Crossref Board recently approved three recommendations for changes to our fees: introduction of a new lowest membership fee tier, removal of volume discounts for record registration, and normalisation of registration fees for peer reviews. The changes will be applied from January 2026.</p>
<p>This is the first outcome of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">the Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)</a> program, launched in 2023, as a comprehensive effort to review all aspects of Crossref revenue and how we&rsquo;re adapting to growth and the diversification of our membership. The program aims to make fees more equitable, simplify our complex fee schedule, and rebalance revenue sources.</p>
<p>Following two rounds of member surveys, feedback gathered from the community in polls, open discussions, and emails, the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/committees/membership-and-fees/">Membership and Fees (M&amp;F) Committee</a> (made up of 30+ representatives from members, service providers, sponsors, and community partners) discussed evidence and made the first round of recommendations to the Board this month. We&rsquo;re very thankful for their time spent reviewing data and sharing their experiences to get to this point.</p>
<h2 id="goal-1-more-equitable-fees">GOAL 1: More equitable fees</h2>
<p>Our membership has changed over the years - members now tend to be less well-resourced, more likely to be based in Asia or Latin America, and more likely to be much smaller operations, some of which may not even be organisations but volunteer groups. We are seeing more universities join as members, and fewer members now consider themselves publishers first and foremost. With our mission of creating a complete global research nexus, this growing diversity is excellent news.</p>
<p>While new member growth is steady (2.3k members per year), over half join via a <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/">Sponsor</a> (that makes membership more accessible both financially and technically), and close to 300 members have their membership revoked due to unpaid invoices each year, indicating that the current fee may be a barrier to participation for some.</p>
<h3 id="area-of-focus-define-a-new-basis-for-sizing-and-tiering-members-for-their-capacity-to-pay">Area of focus: Define a new basis for sizing and tiering members for their capacity to pay</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.crossref.org/fees/#annual-membership-fees">Our annual membership fees</a> are currently tiered according to the publishing revenue or expenses (whichever is higher) of each member. This enables each member to contribute to the community infrastructure according to their capacity to pay.</p>
<p>One of the first areas under consideration throughout 2024 was an option to change the basis of our membership fees from the publishing revenue (or expenses) of each organization to their <em>overall</em> organisational revenue (or expenses) instead.</p>
<p>Through surveys, discussions with the M&amp;F committee, and at the Crossref 2024 Annual Meeting, we received strong feedback, particularly from those based at institutions and/or following a diamond open-access model, that making this change would put Crossref beyond their reach.</p>
<p><strong>It became clear therefore that we should NOT change the basis for sizing and tiering members.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, we will maintain the current basis for sizing and tiering members by considering their <em>publishing</em> revenue or expenses, whichever is higher. For non-publisher members, we advise taking &lsquo;publishing&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;producing&rsquo;, so taking their cost of producing the works being registered with us, whether that is data, software, imagery, physical objects, etc.</p>
<h3 id="area-of-focus-evaluate-the-us-275-annual-membership-fee-tier-and-propose-a-more-equitable-pricing-structure-which-might-entail-breaking-this-down-into-two-or-more-different-tiers">Area of focus: Evaluate the US $275 annual membership fee tier and propose a more equitable pricing structure, which might entail breaking this down into two or more different tiers.</h3>
<p>We also looked into making our fees more equitable. It&rsquo;s been long recognised that our lowest fee tier (an annual fee payment of US $275 for all members with publishing revenue up to US $1 million) represents a huge diversity of organisations operating within a range of financial contexts - over 95% of our non-sponsored members are in this category, and this is the category almost all new members join in. Throughout the project, we ran various surveys with our members to learn more about the makeup and factors affecting the capacity to pay for this group.</p>
<p><strong>From January 2026, we will create a new annual membership tier for members whose publishing revenue/expenses (whichever is higher) is equal to or lower than US $1,000 per year.</strong></p>
<p>Based on survey data, we expect 30-60% of our current members in the current US $275 tier to move to this new category. This new membership fee tier will be set at US $200 in 2026, which is 27% lower than the current $275 membership fee. We will monitor the uptake in this category, with a view to identify necessary adjustments in future years.</p>
<p>Our Membership team will reach out to help qualifying members change to the new tier well before January 2026. If your publishing revenue or expenses are equal to or lower than US $1,000 per year,  look out for our email in the next couple of weeks to help you transition to the lower US $200 tier. </p>
<h2 id="goal-2-simplify-complex-fees">GOAL 2: Simplify complex fees</h2>
<h3 id="area-of-focus-address-and-adjust-volume-discounts-for-content-registration">Area of focus: Address and adjust volume discounts for Content Registration</h3>
<p>We currently offer volume discounts for several of our record types. These are calculated at the end of each quarter.</p>
<p><strong>In order to reduce the complexity of our pricing, we will eliminate all volume discounts.</strong></p>
<p>They are underused, accessible only to a small percentage of members, and the financial impact of making the change is small. These discounts contribute to complexity in our billing process and block our ability to offer members a running total or provide leaving members with a timely final invoice.</p>
<p>Having consulted with affected organisations, we&rsquo;re reassured that the change will not adversely affect their ability to register their works with us. We appreciate their understanding of the overall positive impact of this change for Crossref and their support for our sustainability.</p>
<h3 id="area-of-focus-reduce-complexity-in-peer-review-pricing">Area of focus: Reduce complexity in peer review pricing</h3>
<p>Finally, prompted by feedback from our members, we looked into normalising fees for peer review registration. We currently have two sets of pricing for peer reviews based on whether the review is registered by the owner of the item being reviewed. There is a charge for the first review for a specific article, and a different charge for subsequent reviews for the same article, which also varies depending on who registered the review. Very few members register peer reviews for records that they do not own, so having a separate, higher set of fees just adds complexity to the fee schedule with no financial or strategic benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from January 2026, we will consolidate all peer review pricing, regardless of who registers it, to US $0.25 for the first review for an article, and free registration for any subsequent reviews of that same record.</strong></p>
<h3 id="area-of-focus-address-and-adjust-backfile-discounts-for-record-registration">Area of focus: Address and adjust backfile discounts for record registration</h3>
<p>Another recommendation, related to the removal of back-year discounts for select record types (conference proceedings, technical reports and working papers, theses and dissertations, and posted content/preprints) due to underuse, hasn&rsquo;t been approved yet. Based on feedback from the board, more research will be conducted on trends related to specific record types, such as theses and dissertations, so we can better understand potential unintended consequences of such changes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking to retain back-file discounts for record types where they continue to be well-used, including those for journal articles and book titles. We&rsquo;re also looking to retain back-file discounts for grants, as these are at an early stage of adoption, and new funders coming on board naturally start with a backlog of grants to register in the Grant Linking System.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h3>
<p>The Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability program is very broad, and in the coming months you can expect progress with other aspects of our revenue. There is more work to come, including the rebalancing of revenue from the use of our metadata, the future of fees for our funder members, and further changes to record registration fees.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re glad to see the first changes progressing to implementation, and would like to thank our Membership and Fees Committee and all members who took part in the consultations so far for your continuous support.</p>
