## Rubber Ducking For Research Communication: Why Explaining to Nobody Helps You Explain to Anybody

date: 2025-04-24, from: Scholarly Kitchen

<p>Explaining research to a rubber duck might sound odd, but it could be the secret to clearer thinking and better communication. This post explores how "rubber ducking" -- a technique borrowed from programming -- can help researchers explain complex ideas with more clarity, creativity, and confidence.</p>

## International Metrics Make Latin American Urban Journals Invisible

date: 2025-04-23, from: SciELO in Perspective

<p>Study shows how global scientific evaluation criteria put urban journals from the Global South at a disavantage, reinforcing epistemic inequality in the production and circulation of knowledge.
