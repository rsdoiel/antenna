## Government incompetence is keeping kids out of college

date: 2024-04-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>President Joe Biden&#8217;s botched rollout of a revamped financial aid form reveals a stunning lack of managerial competence. It has left colleges unable to tell millions of students how much they&#8217;ll have to pay, causing some to delay enrolling and others to drop the idea altogether. This easily avoidable failure threatens to deprive low-income Americans of a college education. And Biden, the country&#8217;s chief executive, needs to hold to account the officials who are directly responsible.</p>
