## Out of chances: Letting Donald Trump skate is contempt for justice

date: 2024-05-06, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Acting Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan held Donald Trump in contempt for his violations of a gag order in his criminal hush money case. The penalty? A paltry $9,000. Nonetheless, the judge cautioned the former president that continued violations might result in &#8220;incarceratory punishment,&#8221; just as they might for any other defendant. We hope he&#8217;s not bluffing.</p>

## Slovakia’s capital makes a remarkable comeback

date: 2024-05-05, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia and once a nearly desolate ghost town, is one of Europe&#8217;s great urban success stories. Its compact old town bursts with colorfully restored facades, lively outdoor caf&#0233;s, and swanky boutiques. Its ramshackle industrial quarter, just east of the center, is rapidly being redeveloped into a forest of skyscrapers. The hilltop castle gleams. And even the glum communist-era suburb of Petr&#0382;alka, right across the Danube, has undergone a Technicolor makeover. It&#8217;s arguably the fastest-changing city in Europe.</p>
