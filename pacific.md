## VOTE or else you know WHAT!

date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety

THE Truth is WE the People need to “get-out &amp; VOTE” even though this is a midterm election it is still critical to our very future and quality of life. Statistical data has proven that “the lower the voter turnout can be equated to the very quality of government” as it is directly tied to having an accountable government.  If WE don’t hold those in office accountable on election day then WE have not done OUR job, as citizens have a fiduciary DUTY to “be informed &amp; vote.” So, if you are one who gets in the voting booth and doesn’t know WHO someone is, it can be a good sign not to vote for them or a bad sign that you didn’t do your homework as a voter.

## It’s all politics at the Vatican in ‘Conclave’

date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety

(AP) — In Edward Berger’s “Conclave,” the selection of the pope is no holy affair. Instead, it’s a petty, political campaign carried out in secrecy, where gossip flows, agendas are malleable and loyalties are fleeting. All are there to serve God, they say. But we all know how helpful that has been in conflicts throughout history. “Conclave” might not have much new or interesting to say about the Catholic Church, but it is a deliriously fun watch in the way that tense, smart thrillers with an ensemble of great actors can be.
