## Rick Steves: Vibrant, historic Dresden is worth a detour

date: 2024-08-25, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Intriguing Dresden, Germany, winds up on far fewer American itineraries than it deserves to. Don&#8217;t make that mistake. Since its horrific firebombing in World War II, the city has transitioned to a thriving cultural center that&#8217;s well worth a visit. Even with only a day to spare, Dresden is a doable side trip from bigger attractions like Berlin or Prague.</p>
