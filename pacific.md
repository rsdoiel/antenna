## Bartolome couple wins MVariety's Valentine’s Day contest

date: 2025-02-13, updated: 2025-02-16, from: Marianas Variety

HUSBAND and wife Romel and Jorgie Bartolome are the winners of the Marianas Variety’s #LoveintheMarianas story contest.The contest asked island couples to share on social media a picture or video of themselves enjoying our island paradise while also sharing a story about how they celebrate love.Out of the many contest entries, the Bartolome couple’s pictures and heartfelt captions stood out. For their efforts, they win an 18x12” canvas print of one of their photos.In her post, Jorgie says, “I swore off long-distance relationships in the past, had to go back home [because] of the pandemic, but this guy fought his way through to bring down the walls I’ve built despite being countries apart.”In an interview with Marianas Variety, Romel explained that he and Jorgie first met in 2019 when she was an intern at the Saipan World Resort’s kitchen and he was a staff member.He immediately had a crush, but was unable to approach her. That did not stop him from sending her that year a short and simple Thanksgiving greeting on Facebook Messenger.That got the ball rolling, but it was no stroll in the park for Romel. Yes, they began exchanging messages online and sometimes went out to eat—but only as friends, Jorgie clarified.“I didn’t like him,” she laughs. “When we went out for a quick [McDonald’s] date, he asked me if he could date me and I said no.”Jorgie said Romel must have taken her no as a final answer, and he gave her some space. In his absence, though, Jorgie realized that she missed him and began nursing a small crush of her own.That’s when they rekindled ties and began dating in earnest, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world.Soon after, Jorgie had to go back to the Philippines, but Romel couldn’t let his ‘mahal’ [beloved] say ‘adios,’ and they kept in touch online.Around 2022, Romel was able to go to the Philippines. By then, he knew he couldn’t let Jorgie get away, and when he asked her again to be his girlfriend, she agreed.The couple moved back to Saipan in 2023 and tied the knot in November 2024.They both say they want to make Saipan their home.In her Instagram and Facebook posts of their photos, Jorgie said: “Everything about this place has ‘paradise’ written all over it.”

## Record number of journalists killed in 2024, Israel mostly responsible, CPJ says

date: 2025-02-13, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; A record number of journalists was killed around the world last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday, adding that Israel was responsible for nearly 70% of the deaths. At least 124 journalists in 18 countries died in 2024, the deadliest year for reporters and media workers since the committee started recording the numbers more than three decades ago, the CPJ said in a statement. CPJ said the Israel-Gaza war has accounted for the deaths of 85 journalists at the hands of the Israeli military, and accused Israel of attempting to stifle investigations of incidents, shift blame onto journalists and ignore its duty to hold people to account for the killings.</p>
