## OPINION ǀ Truth 64: OF, FOR & BY the People & CNMI Impotency! (Part II of III)

date: 2024-10-13, updated: 2024-10-13, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH is we are seeing MORE Taxes, fewer flights with arrivals continuing to decline WE must ask, if WE ask “are WE better off now than before Covid, the answer will be a resounding NO, as NOTHING has changed FOR the better FOR the People nor FOR the CNMI. The impotence in our economy FOR the People is obvious with no real improvements and nothing even planned to improve our economy other than crying to the Feds &amp; taxes. This is WHY I’ve been screaming &amp; yelling for YEARS to get a real economist on the Hill working with our Executive &amp; Legislature but instead WE continue to suffer under what I see as picnic table discussions &amp; decisions on our economy. Just because one may be smart, it by-no-means qualifies them as an economist — so WHO is really our Economist!!!
