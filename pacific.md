## OPINION ǀ  Notch on your belt (‘Masawan Omw Fa’)

date: 2024-09-26, updated: 2024-09-26, from: Marianas Variety

IT isn’t often that I get to participate in a debate between candidates for a seat in U.S. Congress; in fact, I’ve only ever done it once and that was just recently (a little over a week ago) in the U.S. Delegate Debate hosted by the Saipan Chamber of Commerce.  Overall, I think the audience got what one might expect from a highly publicized exercise in rigid speed-dating with bachelors and bachelorettes (numbers one through five) trying to win the hearts and minds of the CNMI people through a series of timed responses meant to gauge our respective hearts and minds for the people of the CNMI.

## Trump’s welcome SALT switch: Restore the tax break back to what it was

date: 2024-09-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Donald Trump is a late convert to restoring the federal income tax deduction of state and local taxes (SALT) that were capped at $10,000 when he signed his big Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018. But Trump&#8217;s support is still most welcome and his fellow Republicans in Congress should follow his lead. The current law is simply unfair, putting an extra burden on people in states like New York. </p>
