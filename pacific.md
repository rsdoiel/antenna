## Belichick isn’t back, he’s everywhere

date: 2024-07-30, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Bill Belichick landed his first NFL coaching gig in 1975 as a special assistant on Ted Marchibroda&#8217;s Baltimore Colts. To put that in perspective, it was so long ago that 48-year-old George Blanda was still playing in the NFL. It was so long ago that Robert Kraft was a little-known part owner of the Boston Lobsters in World Team Tennis. It was so long ago that most NFL fans under age 50 have no memory of the Colts being based in Baltimore.</p>

				<p>Months if not years in the making, a bipartisan bill in Washington seeks to speed up permitting for new energy infrastructure, which far too often today gets bogged down if not killed by exhausting regulatory processes and lawsuits. Here&#8217;s hoping the imperfect but worthy legislation isn&#8217;t bogged down or killed by the forces protecting the status quo, which far too often today carry the day in Congress.</p>
