## Can you define socialism?

date: 2024-08-06, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Before we explore this divisive issue, I want to be clear that I believe capitalism has done more to lift people out of poverty than any other social and economic system in history. But don&#8217;t kid yourself that we live in a country that embraces &#8220;free market&#8221; capitalism. As we embark on this exploration, please know that I&#8217;m not suggesting we embrace policies that create disincentives to work, and work hard. Nor am I suggesting that we embrace policies that guarantee equal outcomes for all Americans. Rather, we need to evolve capitalism and break out of the political narratives that constrain that objective.</p>

I AM a daughter of Saipan, Virginia Flores Camacho. This June, I brought my family of seven to Saipan, the key destination of our three-week trip that included visits to Japan, Guam, and Honolulu. I was excited to introduce my grandchildren, Linden, age 7, and Callen, age 10, to Northern Marianas heritage and history.

My own adult children, daughter Chrissy and son Robby, shared this vision as they enjoyed revisiting the island.

## OPINION ǀ Truth 62: It’s OUR Managaha — Stewardship!

date: 2024-08-04, updated: 2024-08-04, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is that it is OUR Economy falling off a cliff and this Governor and the next Governor will continue to be faced with stewardship rebuilding our Economy.  The stewardship over the need to rebuild our Economy, that has obviously been decimated by nature &amp; Ralph, is critical to making sure all the moving parts are functioning properly but that is not the case with Managaha. There has been entirely tooooo much left up to the Secretaries &amp; Directors to “do the Right &amp; BEST thing FOR the People they represent, yet the Managaha fiasco is just another reason WHY the People “don’t like and don’t TRUST OUR Government to DO the People’s bidding,” not their personal desires &amp; belief. It should be duly noted that Managaha was the MOST productive when the operations were “INDIVIDUALS,” it was the very concept of “exclusive operator” that KILLED Local Operators and the diversity for Tourists and the future growth of Managaha is still in limbo. At least our Governor has interceded like he is doing with Star Marianas and CPA to try and resolve the problem and pray he will think about “his people are FIRST” —  the first law of nature self-preservation.
