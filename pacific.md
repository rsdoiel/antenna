				<p>Like the Gorgons in Greek mythology whose glances could turn people to stone, today&#8217;s sour candidates have calcified our presidential politics with their glowering contest. &#8220;Rancor,&#8221; said Jos&#0233; Ortega y Gasset, &#8220;is an outpouring of a feeling of inferiority.&#8221; Both men have much about which to feel inferior. The electorate, however, is at least interesting.</p>

## Slovakia’s capital makes a remarkable comeback

date: 2024-05-05, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia and once a nearly desolate ghost town, is one of Europe&#8217;s great urban success stories. Its compact old town bursts with colorfully restored facades, lively outdoor caf&#0233;s, and swanky boutiques. Its ramshackle industrial quarter, just east of the center, is rapidly being redeveloped into a forest of skyscrapers. The hilltop castle gleams. And even the glum communist-era suburb of Petr&#0382;alka, right across the Danube, has undergone a Technicolor makeover. It&#8217;s arguably the fastest-changing city in Europe.</p>
