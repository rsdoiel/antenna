At the time, I hoped that these programs would not only create jobs and give people a sense of financial security but also be seen as a sign of respect, a sign to the unseen and the alienated that America had their back.</p>

Hitting the ball three feet in front of the plate at a minus-45-degree angle isn&#8217;t a typical path to success. </p>

## Slovakia’s capital makes a remarkable comeback

date: 2024-05-05, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia and once a nearly desolate ghost town, is one of Europe&#8217;s great urban success stories. Its compact old town bursts with colorfully restored facades, lively outdoor caf&#0233;s, and swanky boutiques. Its ramshackle industrial quarter, just east of the center, is rapidly being redeveloped into a forest of skyscrapers. The hilltop castle gleams. And even the glum communist-era suburb of Petr&#0382;alka, right across the Danube, has undergone a Technicolor makeover. It&#8217;s arguably the fastest-changing city in Europe.</p>
