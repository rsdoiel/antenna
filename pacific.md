## OPINION | Truth 30: Forward v backward thinkers & reality!

date: 2023-12-18, updated: 2023-12-18, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is our Governor has “chosen wisely” for us and WE-as-a-People, need to get on board and start moving forward as “one people headed in the same direction” and stop figuratively looking in the rearview mirror at China. We don’t hear Kilili promoting this EVS-TAP stuff because it is an attempt to circumvent our-fathers-in-Washington, especially when the EVS-TAP was recommended by Trump the Administration that supported China — duh! I don’t have to tell readers the fact that Trumpism was involved which spells TROUBLE!  Jude has poli-tricked the entire legislature preying on their desperation to do something desperately-stupid even taking us backwards to 2019 Trump-GOP stuff. But that ship has sailed as all the variables for getting tourists from China have changed drastically and there is still the fact that Japanese are not coming if the CNMI is to be a Chinese tourist’s destination. Jude is doing what he does best, Poli-trick People!
