Behind those combatants were 3,500 people who offered them safe houses and storage for their ammunition. Bolstering them was a much broader community of people who endorsed their efforts.</p>

## OPINION ǀ Why aren't business leaders promoting CNMI's visa-free access?

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Marianas Variety

IN my previous opinion pieces, I have pointed out that the current CNMI administration hasn’t made any changes to prevent the legal entry of tourists from China. This really got me questioning why the narrative by business groups and certain individuals has been to incorrectly blame the administration for the lack of tourists from China. It has not made much sense to me. I arrived at the conclusion that they were not truly after tourists from China as much as they were after pro-PRC messaging from the administration. I still believe that is the case. It did however get me to wondering why the numbers are down.

## Rick Steves: Vibrant, historic Dresden is worth a detour

date: 2024-08-25, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Intriguing Dresden, Germany, winds up on far fewer American itineraries than it deserves to. Don&#8217;t make that mistake. Since its horrific firebombing in World War II, the city has transitioned to a thriving cultural center that&#8217;s well worth a visit. Even with only a day to spare, Dresden is a doable side trip from bigger attractions like Berlin or Prague.</p>
