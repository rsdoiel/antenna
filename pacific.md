## From coral to critical minerals, FSM’s rising value in the global tug-of-war 

date: 2025-05-08, from: Pacific Island Times

   Perhaps to the detriment of the U.S.—or simply short-sightedness—the Compact of Free Association does not address deep-sea mining or seabed governance. Worse still, the U.S. has yet to ratify UNCLOS, the international treaty that governs the world’s oceans. As a result, the U.S. has no formal seat at the table of the International Seabed Authority, which oversees deep-sea mining in international waters.

GROWING up, my mother was never tall. I mean, obviously, as a 7 or 12-year-old, you wouldn’t expect her to be the tallest, but even as she grew older, her height stayed stagnant. And no, I’m not talking about physical height—like being five-foot-two—but in a metaphorical sense, where she could never quite reach her destined height.

While the Old World magic in many parts of the city has been plowed under by modern affluence, today&#8217;s Istanbul is every bit as rich and rewarding as it was back then.</p>
