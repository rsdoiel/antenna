It was so long ago that Robert Kraft was a little-known part owner of the Boston Lobsters in World Team Tennis. It was so long ago that most NFL fans under age 50 have no memory of the Colts being based in Baltimore.</p>

Here&#8217;s hoping the imperfect but worthy legislation isn&#8217;t bogged down or killed by the forces protecting the status quo, which far too often today carry the day in Congress.</p>
