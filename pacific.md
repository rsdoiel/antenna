With a 1-0 win against Mexico and a dreary scoreless draw against Costa Rica, head coach Emma Hayes&#8217; plan of attack is still unclear.

## Movie review: ‘Twisters’ a supremely entertaining summer blockbuster

date: 2024-07-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Tornadoes have been a subject of film fascination since &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221; in 1939, but Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont helped to solidify the appeal of the cinematic cyclone with his 1996 summer blockbuster &#8220;Twister,&#8221; about a group of adrenaline junkie storm chasers. A new installment, &#8220;Twisters,&#8221; arrives 28 years after de Bont&#8217;s film, chasing away all those &#8220;Sharknados&#8221; that have cluttered up the tornado movie subgenre, and reminding us of what made &#8220;Twister&#8221; so appealing to begin with: it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the airborne fauna, but rather, the human dramas that play out as tornadoes roam across the landscape.</p>

## OPINION ǀ Truth 60: Stuck in Reverse needing to go FORWARD!

date: 2024-07-16, updated: 2024-07-17, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is that it’s obvious the CNMI is stuck in reverse needing to go forward. Ever since the poli-tricking that killed La Fiesta the CNMI has being slowly going backwards economically with no end in site because there has yet to be any REAL REFORMS to make the CNMI a BETTER Tourist destination.  Crying for tourists from China will NOT fix our economy and it is a small bandage if anything. WE can’t keep our people nor get new tourists because “the CNMI is out-of-step with the rest of America/World Tourism.”  IF our leaders would take the RIGHT steps to turn our economic downfall around, the rest will be easy, as the real problem is not new tourists but the need for NEW Attractions which is what WE were supposed to have been setting up during Covid.  But Ralph was busy with “pipe dream of Mr. Tan with the Deer BS for “high-end tourists” in the Northern Islands and giving our money away! Ralph put us in reverse and now we must go FORWARD and I’m fighting FOR ALL of us in this boat, even my critics who are full of bigotry, I just keep praying for them!

## OPINION ǀ Thanks for Your Service Lt. Col. Camacho

date: 2024-07-14, updated: 2024-07-15, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is I’ve decided to lead by example, as I’ve been waiting to give Locals/Politicians a chance to THANK Lt. Col. Edward C. Camacho for his 43 years of Service first, as I just wrote an Op ed about the need for us to say THANKS more.  Lt. Col. Camacho is a REAL “Bad-A**,” for TRUE and may have been one of, if not the highest serving Chamorro to ever be in the military along with PSS’s Commissioner. But I can remember when Lt. Col. Camacho was chosen to be our DPS Commissioner, as I was sooo glad along with many others to know we had someone we could TRUST.  His genuine humility and appreciation for such an honor with teers for being appointed was something I will never forget. It is truly touching when grown men cries and it is truly a special and even a historic event when it’s a Lt. Col.  There was no doubt in the minds of many citizens that he was the RIGHT man who is made of the Right-Stuff — training/experience, integrity, respectful and humble! I’m sure the average reader would love to have Lt. Col. Camacho on their team figuratively.

## Åga population increasing through rear-and-release program

(CNMI Department of Lands and Natural Resources &amp; University of Washington) — Åga enthusiasts can rejoice as the species reached an important milestone recently. The Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi), known in Chamorro as “Åga,” has been listed as an endangered species in the Marianas since 1984. Though once plentiful, the introduction of the Brown Tree Snake to Guam in the 1940’s led to their decline and listing, with the population on Luta or Rota being the last remaining of what had been a thriving species.
