## Trump says he’s not planning to fire Fed’s Powell

date: 2025-07-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is not planning to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, but he kept the door open to the possibility and renewed his criticism of the central bank chief for not lowering interest rates. A Bloomberg report earlier Wednesday saying that Trump was likely to fire Powell soon sparked a drop in stocks and the dollar, and a rise in Treasury yields. Trump, who has been criticizing Powell on an almost daily basis for being &#8220;TOO LATE&#8221; to cut interest rates, said the report wasn&#8217;t true. But Trump confirmed he had floated the idea with Republican lawmakers on Tuesday evening, marking the latest chapter in an escalating campaign by Trump against the independent central bank and its embattled chief. &#8220;I don&#8217;t rule out anything, but I think it&#8217;s highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud,&#8221; Trump said, a reference to recent White House and Republican lawmaker criticism of cost overruns in the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed&#8217;s historic headquarters in Washington. There has been no evidence of fraud, and the Fed has pushed back on criticism of its handling of the project. Powell, who was nominated by Trump during his first term in late 2017 to lead the Fed and then nominated for a second term by Democratic President Joe Biden four years later, has repeatedly said he intends to serve out his term, which runs through May 15, 2026. A recent Supreme Court opinion has solidified a long-standing interpretation of the law that the Fed chair cannot be fired over policy differences but only &#8220;for cause.&#8221;</p>

## Many US ice cream producers to phase out artificial food dyes by 2028

date: 2025-07-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Dozens of U.S. ice cream producers are planning to remove artificial colors from their products by 2028, a dairy industry group and government officials said on Monday. The producers, which together represent more than 90% of ice cream sold in the U.S., are the latest food companies to take voluntary steps to remove dyes since Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in April said the U.S. aimed to phase out many synthetic dyes from the country&#8217;s food supply. Several major food manufacturers - including General Mills (GIS.N), Kraft Heinz, J.M. Smucker (SJM.N), Hershey (HSY.N) and Nestle USA (NESN.S) - have previously announced their plans to phase out synthetic food coloring. The 40 ice cream companies will remove Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 from their retail products, excluding non-dairy products, according to the International Dairy Foods Association. The IDFA announced the plan at an event at the U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters on Monday with Kennedy, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. &#8220;We know that our current health outcomes, especially for our children, are unsustainable and that American agriculture is at the heart of the solution to make America healthy again,&#8221; Rollins said at the event, referencing a slogan aligned with Kennedy. Rollins and Kennedy have worked closely together on food sector efforts like encouraging states to ban soda from the nation&#8217;s largest food aid program.</p>

## Let’s Talk Food: Grain bowls

date: 2025-07-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Grain bowls are trendy and a great way to combine grains, vegetables, proteins and sauces all in a bowl. Martha Stewart&#8217;s &#8216;Meatless&#8217; cookbook in 2013 helped to make grain bowls popular. But I personally think the Koreans have been eating bibimbap way before Martha Stewart was born. &#8220;Bibim&#8221; means &#8220;mixing,&#8221; and started from early rural Koreans taking leftover vegetables or &#8220;banchan,&#8221; and eating it with rice in a bowl. There are some writings in the 1800s of bibimbap.</p>
