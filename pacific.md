## UAW accuses Trump, Musk of trying to intimidate workers in labor complaints

date: 2024-08-14, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>DETROIT &#8212; The United Auto Workers Union said on Tuesday it has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board against Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk over attempts to threaten and intimidate workers. It is unclear whether the NLRB would take action against Trump for his comments on Monday during a two-hour conversation with Musk that was broadcast on social media platform X. The UAW seized upon Trump&#8217;s remarks as the union rallies behind Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris and encourages its nearly 400,000 workers to vote for her over Trump. The issue is especially pertinent in battleground states like Michigan which could determine who wins the White House in November. The UAW endorsed Harris at the end of July. </p>

## Google the word ‘monopoly’: Federal judge rules against illegal market control for internet searching

Google search can simultaneously be a very, very useful product (indeed, the judge said it is &#8220;widely recognized as the best&#8221; general search engine &#8220;available in the United States&#8221;) and one that might not stay in the digital catbird seat if it weren&#8217;t strong-arming competitors. </p>
