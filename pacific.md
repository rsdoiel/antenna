## Amazon workers to strike at multiple US warehouses during busy holiday season

date: 2024-12-19, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Thousands of Amazon.com workers will walk off the job on Thursday morning, in the crucial final days of the holiday season, after union officials said the retailer failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. The strike is a challenge to Amazon&#8217;s operations as it races to fulfill orders during its busiest season of the year, although union-represented facilities represent only about 1% of Amazon&#8217;s hourly workforce. In the New York City area, for example, the company has multiple warehouses and smaller delivery depots. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said unionized workers at facilities in New York City; Skokie, Illinois; Atlanta, San Francisco and southern California will join the picket line to seek contracts guaranteeing better wages and work conditions. The Teamsters union has said it represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the company&#8217;s U.S. facilities. Workers at seven of those facilities will walk out on Thursday, the Teamsters said. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

## ‘September 5’ goes inside a newsroom during the Munich Olympics hostage crisis

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Marianas Variety

(AP) — News junkies will find much to love in “September 5,” a fictionalized account of ABC’s live coverage of the hostage crisis during the 1972 Munich Olympics. There are spirited debates about reporting with only one source, use of words like “terrorism” and what to do if violence breaks out during a live shot. There are negotiations with rival networks over satellite usage, disguises and fake badges made to get reels of 16mm film in and out of the locked down Olympic village and plenty of confused men (and a few women) trying to keep up with an ever-escalating situation.
