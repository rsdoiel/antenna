## Iran’s attack failed. Its threat to peace remains

date: 2024-04-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Though largely thwarted by Israel and its allies, the assault launched by Iran against the Jewish state over the weekend was a powerful reminder that the Tehran regime remains the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. Israel&#8217;s security would be best served now through resolve and restraint, rather than military escalation. Iranian leaders tried to portray Saturday&#8217;s attack as a proportional response to a presumed Israeli strike that killed a top Iranian commander and several advisers in Damascus, Syria, on April 1. The operation involved more than 300 drones and cruise and ballistic missiles, with Iran attacking Israel from its own territory for the first time. The assault dramatically increased the risk of a regionwide war, even if Iran hoped the matter was now &#8220;concluded.&#8221;</p>

## Government incompetence is keeping kids out of college

date: 2024-04-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>President Joe Biden&#8217;s botched rollout of a revamped financial aid form reveals a stunning lack of managerial competence. It has left colleges unable to tell millions of students how much they&#8217;ll have to pay, causing some to delay enrolling and others to drop the idea altogether. This easily avoidable failure threatens to deprive low-income Americans of a college education. And Biden, the country&#8217;s chief executive, needs to hold to account the officials who are directly responsible.</p>
