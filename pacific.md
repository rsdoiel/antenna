## Mind the Gap: Six Tips to Assess Your Healthcare Coverage Before the New Year

date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-26, from: Marianas Variety

(BPT) - The new year is a good time to reset. From a fresh start on lifestyle choices, hobbies or pursuits, to the less exciting — but no less important — aspects of life, like memberships, contracts and even health insurance. Health insurance deductibles reset in the new year, so it's a good idea to keep that in mind as you plan for healthcare expenses. Any changes made to your health insurance plan during open enrollment go into effect as well.
