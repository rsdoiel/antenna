				<p>Donald Trump&#8217;s net worth tumbled by $1 billion along with the shares of his social media business after it disclosed a more than $58 million loss in 2023, as revenue for the former president&#8217;s Truth Social platform trickled in. Trump Media &#38;Technology Group Corp.&#8217;s stock fell 21% Monday to $48.66 per share, below the $49.95 level where the blank-check vehicle it merged with was trading a week ago. Trump owns 57% of the company, according to the filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with his stake now worth $3.76 billion on paper. The slump takes his net worth to $6.4 billion, a fall of 14%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
