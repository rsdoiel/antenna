## Navigating the Digital World: Protecting Your Safety Online

date: 2025-06-05, updated: 2025-06-07, from: Marianas Variety

(BPT) - Technology is integral to Americans' daily lives — at work, home, school and everywhere in between. They can't live without it and may not even realize how much time is spent on their phones, laptops and tablets. Deloitte's Center for Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications surveyed U.S. consumers and found that the average American spends eight hours a day online — half of waking hours. That equates to almost 3,000 hours a year. While all that time online can deliver positive experiences, 44% of those surveyed admit they struggle to limit their screen time to a level they are comfortable with, up from 38% year-over-year.

## Men’s mental health: More than muscle, it’s about showing up

date: 2025-06-02, updated: 2025-06-03, from: Marianas Variety

IN May, I shared a bit about how I found a surprising outlet for wellness through pickleball. It wasn’t just about the game; it was about connection, laughter, movement, and community. Over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed more and more people joining in. What started as a casual hit-around has grown into a steady stream of “pickleballers” — men and women alike — showing up for their well-being.
