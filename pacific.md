## The Gargoyles of il Duomo di Milano

date: 2024-02-22, from: Hawai'i Pacific Review (HPU Literary Magazine)

## FEATURE ǀ I can’t run

date: 2024-02-22, updated: 2024-02-22, from: Marianas Variety

MY college lacrosse teammates and I were required to run two miles in twelve minutes (or less) at the beginning of each season or we’d be made to run before each daily practice until we succeeded — a fitting test, I suppose, of the will and physical prowess needed for the sport.  It usually took me three or four tries before making time each year — some did it on their first try.  A few others never could run it in time, so they kept our sideline benches warm throughout the season… not fun especially during the winter months.

## FEATURE ǀ In the sacrifice zone

date: 2024-02-22, updated: 2024-02-22, from: Marianas Variety

THE Pacific region is in the spotlight as a zone of competition for power between the US and China. In New Zealand, the government is weighing up a potential role as a junior partner in AUKUS, the nuclear submarine military pact between Australia, the UK and the U.S. AUKUS is designed to contain China’s influence in the Pacific, and is among a range of agreements that would open the door to greater military activity in the region.
