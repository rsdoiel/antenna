## Quick Fix: Meatloaf with Garlic Carrots and Peas

date: 2025-03-18, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>When I was thinking about making a comforting meatloaf but wanted to make a quick dinner, I created a way to cut down on the baking time. I divided the meatloaf into two small loafs and placed them on a baking sheet. This allowed the hot air to circulate all around the meat for faster cooking. Instead of the usual breadcrumbs used to make meatloaves, I add rolled oats for a new texture.</p>

				<p>Consider a can of soda. When the can is closed (pressurized), the soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2). When you open the can, the pressure drops, bubbles form and rise. Molten rock (magma) beneath the Earth&#8217;s surface behaves similarly and we can learn from the gas trapped in tiny bubbles preserved in crystals from the rock after it&#8217;s erupted on the surface.</p>
