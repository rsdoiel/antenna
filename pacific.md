## Irwin: Islands of Opportunity in the Pacific

## Steves: ‘It feels like a new morning in Belfast’

date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Belfast, Northern Ireland&#8217;s capital city, is perhaps best known for the sectarian strife that took place here during the era of the Troubles, and as the birthplace of the Titanic (and many other ships that didn&#8217;t sink). While these two claims to fame aren&#8217;t too uplifting, Belfast&#8217;s story is hardly a downer. This unsinkable city, just two hours away from Dublin by train, makes for a fascinating day trip.</p>

				<p>Speaking freely at a glitzy Supreme Court Historical Society event earlier this month, Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that there are &#8220;fundamental things that really can&#8217;t be compromised&#8221; in society, and speculated that &#8220;one side or the other is going to win.&#8221; The comments were recorded by a documentarian who had attended the events and surreptitiously recorded the justices as they increasingly find themselves under the microscope for tossing precedent overboard and embarking on ideologically rigid right-wing path.</p>
