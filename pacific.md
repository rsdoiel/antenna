## Irwin: Some thoughts about leadership

date: 2024-09-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>A new friend recently asked me what I think my job is. Leadership being so hard to define, I often reply that I go to meetings and I sign stuff. That indeed is how I spend much of my time. There are also the events, of course &#8212; receptions, athletic competitions, dinners and luncheons &#8212; and at each of those events, I know my attendance is representative not only of me personally but also of the university as a whole.</p>

## Time travel on Rome’s ancient Appian Way

date: 2024-09-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>It&#8217;s fitting that it was the expansion-minded ancient Romans who built Europe&#8217;s first super highway &#8212; they understood the value of good roads to growing an empire. And the Appian Way, begun in 312 BC, was the engineering wonder of its day. It connected Rome with Capua (near Naples), ignoring natural contours and running in a straight line for much of the way. Eventually it stretched 430 miles to Brindisi &#8212; gateway to the East &#8212; where Roman ships sailed for Greece and Egypt.</p>
