## Volcano Watch: What was an emergency manager doing at a scientific conference?

date: 2024-03-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>On the Island of Hawaii, frequent eruptions foster a close relationship between the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.

## Rethinking Hawaii’s conveyance tax

date: 2024-03-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Hawaii grapples with a daunting challenge: the urgent need for 4,000 to 5,000 affordable rental units annually over the next five years to tackle our lack of affordable housing. This acute shortage of housing drives both the houselessness and outmigration crises. The state Legislature has a pivotal opportunity to address this situation by reevaluating conveyance tax rates on the sale of multimillion dollar investment properties.</p>
