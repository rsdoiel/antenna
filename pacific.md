## Trump policy concerns send US consumer confidence plummeting to eight-month low

date: 2025-02-26, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; U.S. consumer confidence deteriorated at its sharpest pace in 3-1/2 years in February while 12-month inflation expectations surged, offering further signs that Americans were growing anxious about the potential negative economic impact of the policies of President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration. The Conference Board survey on Tuesday noted that &#8220;comments on the current administration and its policies dominated the responses.&#8221; It followed on the heels of surveys last week showing steep declines in business and consumer sentiment in February. Tariffs on imports, which Trump has already imposed or is planning to, have been singled out as the major issue in almost every survey of households and businesses.</p>
