## Malfeasance is not a cure Joe – Governor

date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-21, from: Marianas Variety

THE recent malfeasant behavior and attacks by Joe Palacios are not a cure for our Cannabis Industry and have nothing to do with our economy, just invoking that WE the People should be satisfied with losing money every year on a Cannabis Commission that WE don’t need. First you assert the “race card” when I have only referred to myself as an “outsider” when you are an outsider too Joe having come to the CNMI from Guam, duh. Next you assert that your IQ is magically 144, which I believe is a bold-face LIE and I dare you prove me wrong, as my 139 IQ was certified by the State of Tenn &amp; 2 different Phycologists. You didn’t even know anything about our Cannabis Industry when you arrived from Guam, as you only asserted “problems with the wording in the Law” that you read-up on before being first appointed. Joe, you haven’t done anything that would even hint to you being a genius and the dysfunctional state of the Cannabis Commission is PROOF you are NOT a genius, given this is you second term and NOTHING has changed. Joe, you are only preying on “nepotism,” and it seems to be working. I just pray the Governor is not going to run again if he is going to let people like YOU &amp; Clyde manipulate him against HIS People.
