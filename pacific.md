## Which MLB contenders have the most prospect chips to offer in trade deadline deals?

date: 2024-06-13, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>One of the biggest misconceptions in baseball is that teams without highly ranked farm systems have no prospects to offer in trade deadline deals. In fact, every organization has prospects other teams covet &#8212; even those with the bottom-ranked farms &#8212; and if a team is determined to make a deal, a deal can usually be had. That said, it&#8217;s far easier for teams to land their top trade targets if they have a larger pool of attractive prospects to deal from, and it&#8217;s easier for those teams to part with talented prospects when they have more in the pipeline.</p>

## OPINION ǀ Truth 51: The China Poli-tricking has Begun!!!

date: 2024-06-11, updated: 2024-06-12, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is the perception of the Governor’s statement to “pivot away from China” seems to have been totally misinterpreted, as it’s just a poli-trick! The assertion that the Governor and those who appreciate his pivot of dedicating our resources away from China are “against Chinese Tourists,” are so far from the truth they must be in the Andromeda Galaxy seeing time lapses of the CNMI. I want to make it perfectly CLEAR, as I’m sure it is safe to say that virtually “NO ONE is against Chinese Tourists coming to the CNMI.”  But WE (the CNMI) shouldn’t be putting “all our bets on China” figuratively given the fact WE cannot and will never be able to predict what the Chinese Government will do, as everything can change in the blink-of-an-eye for TRUE!  The Governor made a “SAFE &amp; SOUND” call, and I don’t see the Governor nor anyone trying to prevent Chinese Tourists from coming — just political talk (poli-tricking) against the Governor and no ideas offered on what else WE can do beyond China. Yet, WE the People have two entire industries (Cannabis Tourism &amp; Hemp Industry) that have yet to be fully functioning and one is even costing us money.  I don’t see the China supporters doing any supporting and promoting of these two potential NEW Revenues for the CNMI. PROPONENTs &amp; OPPONENTs of China need to read my last opinion Op ed on the Casino Commission, which is something everyone needs to read about our own self-destruction and our future that is definitely beyond China’s influence alone that WE can control — for TRUE! WE must and can do a much better job of controlling our fate!

## Is the Fed behind the curve?

date: 2024-06-10, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold

Most important, the European Central Bank just cut the interest rates it controls by a quarter of a percentage point &#8212; a small number in itself but a signal of future normalization. And the ECB is a major player, setting policy for an economy around four-fifths as large as America&#8217;s.</p>
