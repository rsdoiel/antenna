## OPINION ǀ Truth 45: Get REAL - Marijuana Phobias & Hypocrisy of Saipan Man!!!

date: 2024-05-12, updated: 2024-05-13, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is the marijuana phobias that still exist in “lay-language” are technically called by experts and scientist as being “IRRATIONAL FEARS” that can’t be substantiated by scientific methods nor with unfounded assertions.  Well, the marijuana phobias promoted by “Saipan Man” in the comment section is the source that provided the platform for this response to his ill-rational and unfounded assertions about marijuana and its usage. In fact, I wish to take this opportunity to issue an “APB” (all-points-bulletin) for the identification of Saipan Man in the comment section who is using a fake-name for fake-comments (please contact: ambrosebennett@yahoo.com).
