<h2 id="mozilla-integrating-ai-chatbots-into-firefox">Mozilla
integrating AI chatbots into Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla has announced it’s adding easy access to tool like ChatGPT,
Gemini, and so to Firefox. Whether it’s a local or a cloud-based model,
if you want to use AI, we think you should have the freedom to use (or
not use) the tools that best suit your needs. With that in mind, this
week, we will launch an opt-in experiment offering access to preferred
AI services in Nightly for improved productivity as you browse. Instead
of juggling between tabs or apps for assistance, those who have opted-in
will have the option to access their preferred AI service from the
Firefox sidebar to summarize information, simplify language, or test
their knowledge, all without leaving their current web page.  Our
initial offering will include ChatGPT, Google Gemini, HuggingChat, and
Le Chat Mistral, but we will continue adding AI services that meet our
standards for quality and user experience. ↫ Ian Carmichael My biggest
worry is not so much Mozilla adding these tools to Firefox – other
browsers are doing it, and people clearly want to use them, so it makes
sense for Firefox, too, to integrate them into the browser. No, my
biggest worry is that this is just the first step on the way to the next
major revenue agreement – just as Google is paying Mozilla to be the
default search engine in Firefox, what if OpenAI starts paying to be the
default AI tool in Firefox? Once that happens, I’m afraid a lot of the
verbiage around choice and the ability to easily disable it all is going
to change. I’m still incredibly annoyed by the fact I have to dive into
about:config just to properly remove Pocket, a service I do not use, do
not want, and annoys me by taking up space in my UI. I’m afraid that one
or two years from now, AI integration will be just another complex set
of strings I need to look for in about:config to truly disable it all.
It definitely feels like Firefox is only going to get worse from here on
out, not better, and this AI stuff seems more like an invitation for a
revenue agreement than something well thought-out and useful. We’ll see
where things go from here, but my worries about Firefox’ future are only
growing stronger with Mozilla’s latest moves. As a Linux user, this
makes me worried.</p>

<p>
“Let me google it for you” was a bad reply back in the days; these days
telling somebody “to google something” is insulting because we all know
how aggravating it is to spend time and energy against privacy invasions
and sifting through the AI slop and the grifters. Life is short and
there’s no time for this.
</p>
<p>
I try to err on the side of caution and always add links to stuff if I
can. I’m preparing for the total breakdown of search as we know it.
</p>
<p>
Some days Internet search feels like we’re at the capitalist optimum
where everything is as painful as possible but not prohibitive. Can’t
live without it (to find those link farms, advice sites, public
archives) but also can’t find the private websites and blogs.
</p>
<p>
Is it true that Reddit managed to replace all the blogs or is it true
that we just can’t find them any more. The real problem is the loss of
trust all around.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@vesto" title="@vesto@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="vesto">@vesto</span></a> reminded me that
there was a solution in “the realm of curating human-scale websites”:
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a>.
</p>
<p>
And indeed, it looks like a great starting place!
</p>
<p>
I’m thinking that perhaps I can somehow use blog planets as sources for
topic-specific search engines. I could use the blogs on
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a> to build an
Emacs search engine and the blogs of
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> to build an RPG
search engine.
</p>
<p>
It seems quite doable!
</p>
<p>
The ethics remain complicated, of course. Would I want search engine
developers to scrape my site? Usually I just notice them when their bots
misbehave so I’m pretty averse to the entire situation. The search
engine makers also being ad sellers and ads being a poison for our
society doesn’t help. The search engine makers being AI fans and AI
energy and water requirements being cited as the reasons to keep fossil
power plants running and to build nuclear power plants doesn’t help. AI
also resulting in me having to read texts that other people didn’t
bother to write adds injury to insult.
</p>
<p>
In any case… perhaps there is a way to have ethical search and not drown
in the AI slob: Hand curated websites (taken from the planets), no ads,
no income (and therefore necessarily small in scope).
</p>
<p>
I started experimenting. Using <code>webringSelector = "#sidebar li
a:nth-child(2) [href]"</code> in the <code>lieu.toml</code> file seemes
to get the links of RPG blogs, for example.
</p>
<p>
One thing I find disturbing is that lieu uses Colly to scrape the web
and <a href="https://github.com/gocolly/colly/issues/614">Colly ignores
robots.txt by default</a>. I managed to lock the crawler out of my site
in less than a second. Yikes!
</p>
<p>
And the sad part is that if I add <code>c.IgnoreRobotsTxt = false</code>
to the code, it seems to have no effect. Does anybody know more about
how to control this?
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a>
</p>
<p>
The following branches are probably temporary:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kensanata/lieu/tree/unix-domain-socket">unix-domain-socket</a>:
This can be used by systemd to start the server connected to a Unix
domain socket. Using a server like nginx or Apache as a front-end allows
them to communicate with the server via the Unix domain socket. In that
case, no port is required.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kensanata/lieu/tree/robots-txt">robots-txt</a>:
This is where I try to enable <code>robots.txt</code> handling again –
but I’m failing at it.
</p>
<p>
Then again, perhaps the ethics of it all make it untenable for me – is
this really something I need? If it isn’t, perhaps I’d be better off
doing something else.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-06-26</strong>. Perhaps it’d be easier to search feeds.
People already publish feeds. The feeds already contain the content they
are willing to share. The feed is already limited to web pages and
doesn’t include web applications.

<p>date: 2024-06-26, updated: 2024-06-26, from: Oberon A2 at CAS</p>
<p dir="auto">
Hi, I was curious about browsing some of the pre-2000s sources for A2,
particularly to see the history of the X11 interface
<a href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11">https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11</a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I tried using <code>git-svn</code> to pull the history from the ETH
hosted SVN server, but it doesn't appear to work unfortunately. I could
try again or take some pointers, but I don't want to blindly mash
against what's meant to be an archive. Maybe the SVN repo could be
dumped to an object storage service as a permanent download? In general
I think it would be illustrative to have a more complete history of the
source code, but I understand if that's not a priority of the faculty.
Thanks!

<h2 id="of-psion-and-symbian">Of Psion and Symbian</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>As cool as the organizer was, it was extremely limited in pretty much
every way. Psion had got many things right in the first go, as reviewers
were quick to admit, and that made iterating on the design somewhat
easy. The Organiser II CM released in 1986 was built on the Hitachi
HD6303X (Motorola 6803) clocked at 920kHz with 8K RAM and 32K ROM. The
screen was a much improved dot matrix LCD with two lines of sixteen
characters. This version also shipped with a little piezo beeper built
in, and an expansion slot on the top. The expansion slot could allow for
a wired power adapter, a serial cable, a bar code reader, a telephone
dialer, and even a USB port. Given the reputation of the first model for
ruggedness and the coverage of the same quality in the second model,
this particular model sold quite well to companies who needed handheld
computers for inventory and other purposes. The Organizer II XP launched
the same year, and this model had 32K RAM and a backlit screen while
otherwise being the same machine. Given that both of these models had
significantly more RAM than their predecessor, the programming
capabilities were greatly enhanced with a new language, OPL, which was
similar to BASIC. ↫ Bradford Morgan White The Psion Organiser II is the
very root of all mobile computing today. This may seem like hyperbole –
but trust me, it really is. I have an Organiser II LZ64 with a 32k
datapak (memory card), and while it may look like a calculator, this
little machine from 1986 already contains the very skeleton of the
graphical user interface Palm would eventually popularise, and the
iPhone and Android would take to extraordinary heights. Turn on an
Organiser II, and you’re greeted by a home screen with a grid of
applications (no icons, though, of course – just labels) with a selector
you moved around with the cursor keys. Hit the EXE key, and the
application would load up, ready to be used; hit the home button (the ON
key if my memory serves) and it would take you back to the home screen.
This basic paradigm, of a grid of applications as a home screen you
always return to, survives to this day, and is used by billions of
people on their Android and iOS devices, both smartphones and tablets.
People with little to no knowledge of the history of mobile computing –
or people spreading corporate propaganda – often seem to act as if the
release of the iPhone was the big bang of mobile computing, and that it
materialised out of thin air because Steve Jobs alone willed it into
existence. The reality is, though, that there is a direct line from the
early Psion devices, through to Palm OS, the iPhone, and later Android.
There were various dead end branches along the way, too, like the
Newton, like Symbian, like the original Windows PocketPC, and so on –
but that direct line from early Psion to that fancy Pixel 8 Pro or
whatever you have today is solidly visible to anyone without an agenda.
I love my Organiser II. It’s approaching 40 years old now, and it still
works without a single hitch. There’s barely a scratch on it, the
display is bright, the pixels are clear, the characteristic sliding
cover feels as solid today as it did when it rolled off the factory
line. This is where mobile computing began.</p>

One huge problem with VNC or remote desktop is how flaky it is if you
have limited bandwidth or an unstable connection, like on an airplane.

It takes forever to start a screen sharing session, and the airplane’s
flaky WiFi usually causes the session to lock up, meaning you can’t do
much at all.

Remote <em>terminal</em> access, just relaying text commands, is the
best solution for that problem. And sure, I have a VPN I could use with

<h2 id="looking-ahead-to-30-years-of-freedos">Looking ahead to 30 years
of FreeDOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>In a few days, 29 June, FreeDOS will turn 30. This happens to make it
one of the oldest, continuously active open source projects in the
world, originally created because Jim Hall had heard Microsoft was going
to kill DOS when the upcoming Windows 95 was going to be released. After
seeing the excitement around Linux, he decided it an open source DOS
would be a valuable time investment. I still used DOS, and I didn’t want
to stop using DOS. And I looked at what Linux had achieved: people from
all over the world shared source code with each other to make this full
operating system that worked just like Unix. And I thought “If they can
do that with Linux, surely we can do the same thing with DOS.” I asked
around on a discussion board (called Usenet) if anyone had made an “open
source” DOS, and people said “No, but that’s a good idea .. and you
should do it.” So that’s why I announced on June 29, 1994, that I was
starting a new project to make an open source version of DOS that would
work just like regular DOS. ↫ Jim Hall For an open source implementation
of what was a dead end and now is a dead operating system, FreeDOS has
been remarkably successful. Not only are there countless people using
FreeDOS on retro hardware, it’s also a popular operating system for DOS
gaming and running old DOS applications in virtual machines. On top of
that, many motherboard makers and OEMs use FreeDOS to load firmware
update tools, and some of them even offered FreeDOS as the preinstalled
operating system when buying new hardware. With the ever-increasing
popularity of retrocomputing and gaming, FreeDOS clearly has a bright
future ahead of itself.</p>

sqlite-vec to enable more powerful Local AI applications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Mozilla Developer Network blog</p>
<p>
Today we’re proud to announce the next Mozilla Builders project:
sqlite-vec. Led by independent developer Alex Garcia, this project
brings vector search functionality to the beloved SQLite embedded
database. Alex has been working on this problem for a while, and we
think his latest approach will have a great impact by providing
application developers with a powerful new tool for building Local AI
applications.

charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling Teams</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary
view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its
communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular
productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office
365 and Microsoft 365. ↫ European Commission press release Chalk this
one up in the unsurprising column, too. Teams has infested Office, and
merely by being bundled it’s become a major competitor to Slack, even
though everyone who has to use it seems to absolutely despise Teams with
a shared passion rivaling only Americans’ disgust for US Congress. On a
mildly related note, I’m working with a friend to set up a Matrix server
specifically for OSNews users, so we can have a self-hosted, secure, and
encrypted space to hang out, continue conversations beyond the shelf
life of a news item, suggest interesting stories, point out spelling
mistakes, and so on. It’ll be invite-only at first, with preference
given to Patreons, active commenters, and other people I trust. We
intend to federate, so if everything goes according to plan, you can use
your existing Matrix username and account. I’ll keep y’all posted.</p>

I’m getting my podcast-only feed for Scripting News ready.
</p>
<p>
It’s going to be an Apple-compliant podcast feed.
</p>
<p>
Of course when it came time to do the logo I went to my
reasonably-priced graphics consultant, ChatGPT. It came breathtakingly
close on the first attempt, but it repeated part of the story. Every
time I asked it to fix a problem, it created another problem, and the
image brightness was reduced, not just in terms of pixels but also the
creativity of the image. Of course it isn’t really creative. I know.
Yadda yadda.
</p>
<p>
Finally I got something that I could live with that I liked but was
imperfect. I decided that since the motto of my blog is “It’s even worse
than it appears” that an obvious imperfection is totally consistent with
the philosophy, and we move onward. As they say, still diggin!

<h2 id="ubuntu-24.10-will-default-nvidia-users-to-wayland">Ubuntu 24.10
will default NVIDIA users to Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The transition to Wayland is nearing completion for most desktop
Linux users. The most popular desktop Linux distribution in the world,
Ubuntu, has made the call and is switching its NVIDIA users over to
Wayland by default in the upcoming release of Ubuntu 24.10. The
proprietary NVIDIA graphics driver has been the hold-out on Ubuntu in
sticking to the GNOME X.Org session out-of-the-box rather than Wayland
as has been the default for the past several releases when using other
GPUs/drivers. But for Ubuntu 24.10, the plan is to cross that threshold
for NVIDIA now that their official driver has much better Wayland
support and has matured into great shape. Particularly with the upcoming
NVIDIA R555 driver reaching stable very soon, the Wayland support is in
great shape with features like explicit sync ready to use. ↫ Michael
Larabel This is great news for the Linux desktop, as having such a
popular Linux distribution defaulting the users of the most popular
graphics card brand to X.org created a major holdout. None of this
obviously means that Wayland is perfect or that all use cases are
covered – accessibility is an important use case where tooling simply
hasn’t been optimised yet for Wayland, but work is underway – and for
those of us who prefer X.org for a variety of reasons, there are still
countless distributions offering it as a fallback or as the default
option.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-puts-repair-front-and-center">Microsoft puts repair
front and center</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems the success of the Framework laptops, as well the
community’s relentless focus on demanding repairable devices and he
ensuing legislation, are starting to have an impact. It wasn’t that long
ago that Microsoft’s Surface devices were effectively impossible to
repair, but with the brand new Snapdragon X Elite and Pro devices, the
company has made an impressive U-turn, according to iFixIt. Both the new
Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are exceptionally easy to repair, and
take cues from Framework’s hardware. Microsoft’s journey from the
unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our
teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair.
The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the
impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign
that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit. ↫
Shahram Mokhtari The new Surface devices contain several affordances to
make opening them up and repairing them easier. They take cues from
Framework in that inside screws and components are clearly labeled to
indicate what type they are and which parts they’re holding in place,
and there’s a QR code that leads to online repair guides, which were
available right away, instead of having to wait months to forever for
those to become accessible. The components are also not layered; in
other words,you don’t need to remove six components just to get to the
SSD, or whatever – some laptops require you to take out the entire
mainboard just to get access to the fans to clean them, which is
bananas. Microsoft technically doesn’t have to do any of this, so it’s
definitely praiseworthy that their hardware department is going the
extra kilometre to make this happen. The fact that even the Surface Pro,
a tablet, can be reasonably opened up and repaired is especially
welcome, since tablets are notoriously difficult to impossible to
repair.</p>

<h2 id="briefly-on-julian-assange">Briefly on Julian Assange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
So, Viv and I were in the car this morning when we heard about the
Assange plea deal.
</p>
<p>
Viv: omg, finally! I only hope he’ll now give up hacking 😔<br> Me: Hmm,
or maybe he should give up non-consensual sex. That’s where he went
wrong, isn’t it?<br> Viv: …true
</p>
<p>
I mean, fuck. I know this prosecution has been politically motivated,
purely to punish him for his role exposing Western war crimes. The
charges he’s accepted a plea deal over are the US “espionage” ones,
after all, not the Swedish sexual assault ones, which were dropped long
ago. And I don’t support politically-motivated prosecutions of people
who expose war crimes. But I’ve also never been comfortable with any
kind of personalised “I support Assange” sentiment, as if he were a
righteous martyr, rather than “I support exposing those who commit war
crimes”.
</p>
<p>
Back in my student activist days, I once got stuck doing a stall where
we were trying to get signatures on a petition calling for Assange’s
charges to be dropped (and this was back when they were the sexual
assault charges, not the espionage ones). The organiser of the stall
knew full well the attitude I was going to take to this, so he gave me a
stack of leaflets and told me to hand them out around Campus Centre. I
took the stack, went upstairs, dropped them all straight in the bin,
then chilled out in the cafeteria for an hour before reporting back. I
think he knew that’s what I was going to do, too, lol. I didn’t get
scolded for skipping out on nearly the whole stall, which I usually
would’ve been.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Assange is married now, so maybe he has straightened himself
out. I don’t know. I think it’s good there’s a resolution at last to the
political prosecution (although I would note, cynically, that so many
years have passed that the “deterrence” objective has already been
achieved, and the, uh, short-term memory of the political establishment
means no one cares what happened during the War on Terror any more,
anyway). But Assange himself is still an asshole.

<p>Microsoft has made OneDrive slightly more annoying for Windows 11
users. Quietly and without any announcement, the company changed Windows
11’s initial setup so that it could turn on the automatic folder backup
without asking for it. Now, those setting up a new Windows computer the
way Microsoft wants them to (in other words, connected to the internet
and signed into a Microsoft account) will get to their desktops with
OneDrive already syncing stuff from folders like Desktop Pictures,
Documents, Music, and Videos. Depending on how much is stored there, you
might end up with a desktop and other folders filled to the brim with
shortcuts to various stuff right after finishing a clean Windows
installation. ↫ Taras Buria at NeoWin Just further confirmation that
Windows 11 is not ready for the desktop.</p>

<h2 id="apple-first-company-to-be-found-violating-dma">Apple first
company to be found violating DMA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the European Commission has informed Apple of its preliminary
view that its App Store rules are in breach of the Digital Markets Act
(DMA), as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to
alternative channels for offers and content. In addition, the Commission
opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that
its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app
stores, including Apple’s new “Core Technology Fee”, fall short of
ensuring effective compliance with Apple’s obligations under the DMA. ↫
European Commission press release File this in the category for entirely
expected news that is the opposite of surprising. Apple has barely even
been maliciously compliant with the DMA, and the European Commission is
entirely right in pursuing the company for its continued violation of
the law. The DMA really isn’t a very complicated law, and the fact the
world’s most powerful and wealthiest corporation in the world can’t seem
to adapt its products to the privacy and competition laws here in the EU
is clearly just a bunch of grandstanding and whining. In fact, I find
that the European Commission is remarkably lenient and cooperative in
its dealings with the major technology giants in general, and Apple in
particular. They’ve been in talks with Apple for a long time now in
preparation for the DMA, the highest-ranking EU officials regularly
talked with Apple and Tim Cook, they’ve been given ample warnings,
instructions, and additional time to make sure their products do not
violate the law – as a European Union citizen, I can tell you no small
to medium business or individual EU citizen gets this kind of leniency
and silk gloves treatment. Everything Apple is reaping, it sowed all by
itself. As I posted on Mastodon a few days ago: The EU enacted a new law
a while ago that all bottle caps should remain attached to the bottle,
to combat plastic trash. All the bottle and packaging makers, from
massive multinationals like Coca Cola and fucking Nestlé to small local
producers invested in the development of new caps, changing their
production lines, and shipping the new caps. Today, a month before the
law goes into effect, it’s basically impossible to find a bottle without
an attached cap. I don’t know, I thought this story was weirdly relevant
right now with Apple being a whiny bitch. Imagine being worse than Coca
Cola and motherfucking Nestlé. ↫ Thom Holwerda Apple is in this mess and
facing insane fines as high as 10% of their worldwide turnover because
spoiled, rich, privileged brats like Tim Cook are not used to anyone
ever saying “no”. Silicon Valley has shown, time and time again, from
massive data collection for advertising purposes to scraping the entire
web for machine learning, that they simply do not understand consent.
Now that there’s finally someone big, strong, and powerful enough to not
take Silicon Valley’s bullshit, they start throwing tamper tantrums like
toddlers. Apple’s public attacks on the European Union – and their
instructions to their PR attack dogs to step it up a notch – are not
doing them any favours, either. The EU is, contrary to just about any
other government body in the Western world, ridiculously popular among
its citizens, and laws that curb the power of megacorps are even more
popular. I honestly have no idea who’s running their PR department,
because they’re doing a terrible job, at least here in the EU.</p>

<h2 id="ios-and-ipados-18-can-format-external-drives">iOS and iPadOS 18
can format external drives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I can’t believe this is considered something I need to write about,
but it’s still a very welcome new feature that surprisingly has taken
this long to become available: iOS and iPadOS 18 now allow you to format
external storage devices. Last year when I began testing iPadOS 17
betas, I noticed the addition of options for renaming and erasing
external drives in the Files app. I watched these options over the
course of the beta cycle for iPadOS 17 to see if any further changes
would come. The one I watched most closely was the “Erase” option for
external drives. This option uses the same glyph as the Erase option in
Disc Utility on macOS. In Disc Utility on the Mac, in order to reformat
an external drive, you first select the “Erase” option, and then
additional options appear for selecting the new format you wish to
reformat the drive with. When I saw the “Erase” option added in the
Files app on iPadOS, I suspected that Apple might be moving towards
adding these reformatting options into the Files app on iPadOS. And I’m
excited to confirm that this is exactly what Apple has done in iPadOS
18! ↫ Kaleb Cadle It was soon confirmed this feature is available in iOS
18 as well. You can only format in APFS, ExFAT and FAT, so it’s not
exactly a cornucopia of file systems to choose from, but it’s better
than nothing. This won’t magically fix all the issues a lot of people
have with especially iPadOS when it comes to feeling constrained when
using their expensive, powerful tablets with detachable keyboards, but
it takes away at least one tiny reason to keep a real computer around.
Baby steps, I guess.</p>

<h1 id="2024-06-23-adjudicating-the-difficulty">
2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty
</h1>
<p>
I was listening in on an exchange between
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a>. They were
talking about <a href="Traveller">Traveller</a> and Peter noted that he
didn’t like the “somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests”.
I don’t like this, either! It’s exhausting. I feel drained when I do it.
</p>
<p>
I started thinking about this for a while and maybe the following
provides for an interesting way to talk about rules in role-playing
games.
</p>
<p>
Note that the problem shows up in many places. For example, I don’t like
“the ladder” in <a href="Fudge">Fudge</a> and <a href="Fate">Fate</a>
games where I as the referee need decide whether opponents are “good” or
“very good” at fighting the player characters. For me, this is the same
problem, except it happens behind the screen. Player’s don’t know about
this.
</p>
<p>
Using classic D&amp;D or similar rules and running a megadungeon is
comparatively easy, because the monster hit dice are tied to dungeon
levels. Once I know the dungeon level, I can pick appropriate monsters
and their stats automatically determine “the difficulty classes of some
tests.” This might be one of the reasons that makes it easier to run
D&amp;D with self-made dungeons.
</p>
<p>
So this is the first solution to the problem of having to assign
difficulties to rolls: The game can have a small number of actions that
require a dice roll. Each roll has clear conditions of success. The
referee doesn’t have to assess the difficulty as soon as the situation
is established. D&amp;D would be an example of this kind of game. You
roll to hit, to do damage, to save, and all the target numbers are known
once the monster is on the table. In classic D&amp;D, traps have only
one difficulty setting so thieves only need to know a single number.
Hidden doors are either concealed or secret. Those are the two difficult
settings for finding the hidden door and thus the referee only needs to
know two numbers (1-in-6 or 2-in-6). Of course it breaks down sometimes
when a module tells you that a particular door is harder to find
(“1-in-8”) or that a lock is harder to pick (“add 20% to the check”).
But generally speaking, as a referee, very little thought is required.
The trade-of is that characters don’t have many “skills”. They have
their attack rolls, their saves, the thieves skills, some other d6
abilities like opening doors and listening, but that’s it.
</p>
<p>
As soon as skills are introduced, the situations in which dice can be
rolled explodes. One way to solve the problem of having to decide the
difficulty of every single roll is to a provide a long list of examples
from which to extrapolate. I haven’t played any game that does that
well. Zweihänder provides seven example uses of the skill, one for each
difficulty rating. That is amazing.
</p>
<p>
A game that has a single roll for every skill (great idea) but then
provides a lot of help adjudicating the rolls in general isn’t helping.
I found this to be the case for the few Basic Role-Playing, Warhammer
Fantasy Roleplay, Rolemaster and HARP games I tried. I didn’t try many
of them. I just checked HARP again and there are examples for some of
the skills and not for others, so I’d have to play it again to remember
whether this was even a problem.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps one possible solution is to just ignore difficulties and to
assume all skill rolls at the default difficulty to be appropriate for
adventures. As far as I can remember, this is how we often played these
games.
</p>
<p>
Mongoose Traveller isn’t helping, either. There, the target number is
always an eight. Almost all the modifiers appear to obvious and well
explained, but with the Task Difficulty Dice Modifiers the “somewhat
mysterious difficulty classes of some tests” is back.
</p>
<p>
Classic Traveller is worse it leans into the referee making up the roll.
Sometimes an examples of a skill is provided (“navigation expertise can
be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed
information”) but most of the time it’s simply a description of where
the skill might be applicable and it’s up to the referee to call for an
appropriate throw, if at all. At the very beginning, skills are
explained as follows: “The acquired skills table provides four basic
types of results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength),
weapons expertise (such as blade combat), transport skills (such as
ATV), and basic skills (such as navigation).” That is to say, sometimes
the skill simply means that something can be done. The example that
comes to mind is how to recover from serious wounds: “Recovery is
dependent on medical attention (a medical facility and an individual
with medical-3 skill; recuperation to full strength without medical
attention is not possible).” The medic doesn’t have to roll at all.
Having the skill is all that counts.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to the last category: negotiation. This what I learned
from Burning Wheel: Before a roll is made, players declare what they
want and the referee determines the difficulty of the roll and explains
the consequences of failure. Then players decide whether they want to
make the roll. Implicitly, they can change their mind, declare a
different goal and see whether they like the odds and consequences
better. I like this a lot.
</p>
<p>
Of course, turning every skill roll into a negotiation can be tiresome.
If people remember what the previous result of similar negotiations was,
the system takes on aspects of case law. As soon as the people of the
table realize that a similar situation was resolved using this or that,
and there are no circumstances that warrant a change, then the
negotiation is skipped.
</p>
<p>
Then again, a long lists of conditions and modifiers can also take on
aspects of case law.
</p>
<p>
So perhaps this is what I think all these rules texts evolve into: Any
rule system where referees set the difficulty imply a system where
players can enter a short negotiation. In order to avoid future
negotiations, the table remembers the outcomes and uses them as
shortcuts for future situations.
</p>
<p>
Once you know this, the approach by some games to simply do a fixed
difficulty roll such as 50% rate of success makes sense if you assume
that there is some sort of negotiation and case law powering it all.
Sometimes the penalty of failure is scorn and insults, sometimes it’s
death. It depends on the situation but there’s always a way to negotiate
for the two outcomes that seem acceptable to the table.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t found a perfect solution, for me. I like it both ways. A game
like <a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberts &amp; Helmets</a> is much
like D&amp;D where as a game like <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> is one
where all effects outside of combat have to be negotiated but it’s not
as wild and free as Classic Traveller.

<h2 id="the-name-siddhartha">The Name ‘Siddhartha’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Since Vivian was a teenager, apparently, it’s been his long-held dream
to name a son Siddhartha and call him Sid for short, so as to honour
both his Hindu heritage <em>and</em> Syd Barrett, his rock ’n’ roll
idol. Pretty much as soon as Viv told me this dream, I poured cold water
on it. Honestly, I did not believe that “Siddhartha” was a name that
actual, real-life human beings are given. Vivian insisted it was, so
after a few years of back-and-forth, I finally deigned to search the
internet to see if I could find any actual, real-life human beings with
this name. The result was that every single “Siddhartha” I found was a
French speaker (of Indian heritage) – professionals living in cities
like Lyon, Geneva, Montreal… so of course I took this back to Vivian and
said all accusatorily, “You want to give our child a French name!”
</p>
<p>
This turns out to be a really good way to wind him up – I can say this,
because he’s compelled me to make the same argument repeatedly since –
because he starts whining, “Nooooo, it’s an Indian name!” and I tell him
that random LinkedIn profiles on the internet don’t lie, and our child
is not getting a French
name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
It’s really funny how worked up he gets about it. Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Now that we’re actually <em>having</em> a child, of course, we’re having
all these discussions again, even though we don’t know Baby’s sex yet.
“Sid” has been Viv’s pet name for the growing creature in my belly, and
I do often go along with it, although I also point out regularly that
that’s <em>never</em> going to be their actual name.
</p>
<p>
“That’s okay,” he jokes, “when you die in childbirth, there’ll be no one
to stop me putting whatever I want on the birth certificate.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha-ha,” I retort, “I hope you’re not gambling on those odds.”
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, we <em>have</em> started putting together an
<em>actual</em> shortlist, consisting of names that are Indian in
origin, but are either <em>also</em> English/Irish names <em>or</em>, at
least, don’t sound markedly foreign in English. This is what Viv said he
really liked about the whole “Siddhartha”/“Sid” thing, and I think
<em>that’s</em> a fair enough goal… just not the actual name
“Siddhartha”. Un­for­tun­ately, Viv’s next favourite name isn’t so much “an
Irish name” as “the Irish word for ‘bread’”, but we’ll get there.

<h2 id="mozilla-acquires-ad-analytics-company-for-some-reason">Mozilla
acquires ad analytics company, for some reason</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of my biggest concerns regarding the state of the web isn’t ads
(easily blocked) or machine learning (the legal system isn’t going to be
kind to that), but the possible demise of Firefox. I’ve long been
worried that with the seemingly never-ending downward marketshare spiral
Firefox is in – it’s at like 3% now on desktop, even less on mobile –
Mozilla’s pretty much sole source of income will eventually pull the
plug, leaving the already struggling browser effectively for dead. I’ve
continuously been warning that the first casualty of the downward spiral
would be Firefox on platforms other than Windows and macOS. So, what do
we make of Mozilla buying an online advertising analytics company?
Mozilla has acquired Anonym, a trailblazer in privacy-preserving digital
advertising. This strategic acquisition enables Mozilla to help raise
the bar for the advertising industry by ensuring user privacy while
delivering effective advertising solutions. ↫ Laura Chambers They way
Mozilla explains buying an advertising network is that the company wants
to be a trailblazer privacy-conscious online advertising, since the
current brand of online advertising, which relies on massive amounts of
data collection, is unsustainable. Anonym instead employs a number of
measures to ensure that privacy is guaranteed, from anonymous analytics
to employing differential privacy when it comes to algorithms, ensuring
data can’t be used to tack individual users. I have no reason to doubt
Mozilla’s intentions here – at least for now – but intentions change,
people in charge change, and circumstances change. Having an ad network
integrated into the Mozilla organisation will surely lead to temptations
of weakening Firefox’ privacy features and ad-blocking abilities, and
just overall I find it an odd acquisition target for something like
Mozilla, and antithetical to why most people use Firefox in the first
place. What really doesn’t help is who originally founded Anonym – two
former Facebook executives, backed by a load of venture capital. Do with

and Windows 95, what is a “grabber”?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows 3.0 Enhanced Mode introduced the ability to run MS-DOS
programs in a virtual machine. This by itself was already quite an
achievement, but it didn’t stop there. It also let you put the MS-DOS
session in a window, and run it on the screen along with your other
Windows programs. This was crazy. Here’s how it worked. ↫ Raymond Chen

going to start a new podcast-only feed, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a">this
will be first episode</a>. 14 minutes. It tells the story of RSS as a
remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The
first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red
Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of
blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the
people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed
base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that
is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was
confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS
was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in
1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get
their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the <i>entire news
world supported RSS.</i> That’s the story. You can write all about who
did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly
remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained
its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough
foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn’t work with
each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where
it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We
should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course
until the real story is out there, we can’t learn from it. This is a
14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in
the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the
sites it points to. And if there’s interest I’ll happily talk about it
in a future podcast.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search&quot;&gt;Should I remove this blog from Google Search?&lt;/a&gt;” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s
obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies
don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a
server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We
could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual
users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of
us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t
gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are
only two options left:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because
that’s just the world we live in
</li>
<li>
Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our
content
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas’s post made me also think
about something else. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals
content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it
all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the
TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I
would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar,
radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding
investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew
it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return
any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously
not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?

restaurant that someone in the call recommended yesterday?”

S. Tanenbaum receives ACM Software System Award</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU
Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which
influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple
generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used
operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987
to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.
MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM
PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code,
and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file
system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source
software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for
Tanenbaum, and it’s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens
to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in
2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our
belt.</p>
