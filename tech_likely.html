Knicks keep winning my heart. They play the game exactly as it should be
played. And they don’t take the bait to make it about anything other
than what happens on the court, and to trust in the league to take care
of players who don’t play by the rules. And <i>of course</i> the
Philadelphia arena was full of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less
than NYC tickets, and it’s only 2 hours away by car, and there’s good
train service. If the series goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing
will happen. I feel sorry for fans of small town teams, because no
matter where you go in the US, there are always lots of Knicks fans.

released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s a new 9front release! So, what exactly is 9front, you may
ask? Well, after it became clear that Bell Labs wasn’t doing much with
plan9, a group of developers took matters into their own hands and
created 9front, a fork of plan9. Their latest release is called DO NOT
INSTALL, and brings things like more USB audio support, DNS over TLS,
WiFi support for the Raspberry Pi, I2C support, and much more. I’m not
particularly well-versed in the world of plan9, and more often than not
it feels like a form of high-level programming performance art that I’m
just not smart enough to understand. The whole community and its
associated web sites have a very unique feel to it, and I always feel
like I’m just not cool enough to be part of it. That’s not a dig at the
plan9 community – it’s more of an indictment of my lack of coolness.
Which really shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>

<h2 id="run0-a-systemd-based-more-secure-replacement-for-sudo">run0: a
systemd-based, more secure replacement for sudo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Lennart Poettering, main developer of systemd, has announced run0, a
systemd-based replacement for the well-known sudo command that fixes
many of he inherent issues with the widely used tool to gain temporary
elevated privileges. There are various problems with sudo, which
basically come down to that it’s a large SUID binary, meaning it
consists of privileged code that unprivileged users can run from their
own context. This makes sudo a fairly large attack surface, and why
OpenBSD uses doas instead; while doas suffers from the same main
problem, it’s much smaller and reduces the attack surface considerably.
SUID processes are weird concepts: they are invoked by unprivileged code
and inherit the execution context intended and controlled by
unprivileged code. By execution context I mean the myriad of properties
that a process has on Linux these days, from environment variables,
process scheduling properties, cgroup assignments, security contexts,
file descriptors passed, and so on and so on. A few of these settings
the kernel is nice enough to clean up automatically when a SUID binary
is invoked, but much of it has to be cleaned up by the invoked suid
binary. This has to be done very very carefully, and history has shown
that SUID binaries are generally pretty shit at that. ↫ Lennart
Poettering Poettering wants to address this problem, and has come up
with run0, which behaves like sudo, but works entirely differently and
is not SUID. Run0 asks the services manager to create a shell or command
under the target user’s ID, creating a new PTY, sending data back and
forth from the originating TTY and the new PTY. Or in other words: the
target command is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked
off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the client (well,
admittedly, we <em>do</em> propagate $TERM, but that’s an explicit
exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist). One could say, “run0”
is closer to behaviour of “ssh” than to “sudo”, in many ways. Except
that it doesn’t bother with encryption or cryptographic authentication,
key management and stuff, but instead relies on the kernel’s local
identification mechanisms. run0 doesn’t implement a configuration
language of its own btw (i.e. no equivalent of /etc/sudoers). Instead,
it just uses polkit for that, i.e. how we these days usually let unpriv
local clients authenticate against priv servers. ↫ Lennart Poettering
This approach addresses a whole slew of attack vectors on sudo, and it
comes with fun additional features like being able to give your terminal
a different background tint when using it, or displaying a little red
dot in the terminal window title to further indicate you’re using
elevated privileges. It will ship as part of the upcoming release of
systemd 256.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-at-work">Microsoft At Work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this was a wild goose chase of a read. J. B. Crawford dove into
the history of something I’ve never heard of – Microsoft At Work – and
came away with a story that’ while clearer thanks to his research, is
still frustratingly nebulous. I’m still not entirely sure what Microsoft
At Work really was, but I think it had the goal of running Windows on
communications devices like faxes, to make it easier to share and work
on documents across various devices. Crawford did a lot of digging, and
eventually settles on what he thinks might be a description of what MAW
really consisted of. I am being a bit dismissive for effect. MAW was
more ambitious than just installing Windows on a grape. The effort
included a unified communications protocol for the control of office
machines, including printers, for which a whole Microsoft stack was
envisioned. This built on top of the Windows Printing System, a
difficult-to-search-for project that apparently predated MAW by a short
time, enough so that Windows Printing System products were actually on
the market when MAW was announced—MAW products were, we will learn, very
much not. MAW devices like the Ricoh IFS77 ran 16-bit Windows 3.1 with a
new GUI intended to appear more modern while reducing resource
requirements. Some reporters at the time noted that Microsoft was cagey
about the supported architectures, I suspect they were waiting on ports
to be completed. The fax machine was probably x86, though, as there’s
little evidence MAW actually ran on anything else. ↫ J. B. Crawford The
’90s were a wild time, especially as Microsoft, and this MAW project
seems to have ’90s written all over it, but I’d still love to learn a
lot more about this. I hope this article will bring out some former
Microsoft execs or employees who can give us more details, and possibly
even some code. I want to know how this works and what it did.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-cosmotechnics">Thoughts on Cosmotechnics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called
<a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The
negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs
called
<a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From
Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea
called “The
SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>”
which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin
and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s
<em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
–which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve
ever read, so this is relevant for me.
</p>
<p>
Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism
linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called
<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics
and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all
these philosophical (epistemological?)
arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>,
but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for
a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In
Hui’s words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the
unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities,
whether craft-making or art-making.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to
divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a
contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component
and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use,
then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction.
Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed
animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that
stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped
from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item,
I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for
me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…
</p>
<p>
In the words of Dr. King from his sermon
<em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The
Three Evils of Society</a></em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided
missiles and misguided men.”<br /> – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up
question is “Whose morals?”
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in
regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic,
but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest
destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough
seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of
African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology,
a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural
order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less
metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on
cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the
continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor,
and people.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world
order that goes beyond a single
hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve
the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We
need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And
the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient
knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism
brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems
that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away
from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from
the
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>;
the butcher Pao Ding.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to
being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather
in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei
about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good
knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the
Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the
bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter
into the gaps between them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better
understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web
design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of
viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or
preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become
excellent butchers of websites.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year
because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his
knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other
hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen
years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone.
Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and
gropes for the right place to move further.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through
bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a
technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if
we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium,
<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the
grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.
</p>
<p>
The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist
makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the
cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and
there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?
</p>
<p>
Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old
guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my
loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology
from an
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral
company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm.
Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth
of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools
dull, we throw stones at each other.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but
I’ve never thought of the tools I use as a moral choice. Perhaps now I
will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of
<em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for
expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the
large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to
have vocabulary to think about future problems.

One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the
leading power in this new cosmopolitical system. I fully agree we need
to grow out of our single hegemony (America), but I’ve heard this
“multipolar world’ philosophy echoed by Vladimir Putin before and I
don’t believe we should cede moral authority over to authoritarian
regimes that slaughter and demonize LGBTQ+ groups and ethnic minorities.
We shouldn’t use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era
superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new. That said, I
sit in a comfortable seat of privilege and systemic power well within
the borders of the American Empire…

id="windows-nt-and-netware-on-pa-risc-and-a-hp-ux-port-to-x86">Windows
NT and NetWare on PA-RISC, and a HP-UX port to x86</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Back when I was working on my article about PA-RISC, HP-UX, and UNIX
workstations in general, I made extensive use of OpenPA, Paul
Weissmann’s invaluable and incredibly detailed resource about HP’s
workstation efforts, HP-UX, and tons of related projects and products.
Weissmann’s been doing some serious digging, and has unearthed details
about a number of essentially forgotten operating system efforts. First,
it turns out HP was porting Windows NT to PA-RISC in the early ’90s.
Several magazine sources and USEnet posts around 1993 point to HP
pursuing a PA-RISC port to NT, modified the PA-RISC architecture for
bi-endianess and even conducted a back-room presention at the ’94 Comdex
conference of a (modified HP 712?) PA-7100LC workstation running Windows
NT. Mentions of NT on PA-RISC continued in 1994 with some customer
interest but ended around 1995. ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA The port
eventually fizzled out due to a lack of interest from both customers and
application developers, and HP realised its time was better spent on the
future of x86, Intel’s Itanium, instead. HP also planned to work
together with Novell to port NetWare to PA-RISC, but the work took
longer than expected and it, too, was cancelled. The most recent
secretive effort was the port of HP-UX to x86, an endeavour that took
place during the final days of the UNIX workstation market. Parts of the
conversation in these documents mention a successful boot of HP-UX on
x86 in December of 2009, with porting efforts projected to cost 100M+
between 2010 and 2016. The plan was for mission-critical x86 systems
(ProLiant DL980 and Superdome with x86) and first releases projected in
2011 (developer) and 2012 (Superdome and Linux ABI). ↫ Paul Weissmann at
OpenPA I’m especially curious about that last one, as porting HP-UX to
x86 seems like a massive effort during a time where it was already
obvious Linux had completely obliterated the traditional UNIX market. It
really feels like the last death saving throws of a platform everybody
already knew wasn’t going to make it.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-foundation-in-financial-trouble">GNOME Foundation in
financial trouble</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>As you may be aware, the GNOME Foundation has operated at a deficit
(nonprofit speak for a loss – ie spending more than we’ve been raising
each year) for over three years, essentially running the Foundation on
reserves from some substantial donations received 4-5 years ago. The
Foundation has a reserves policy which specifies a minimum amount of
money we have to keep in our accounts. This is so that if there is a
significant interruption to our usual income, we can preserve our core
operations while we work on new funding sources. We’ve now “hit the
buffers” of this reserves policy, meaning the Board can’t approve any
more deficit budgets – to keep spending at the same level we must
increase our income. ↫ Robert McQueen Learning that the GNOME Foundation
can barely scrape by financially makes me irrationally angry. As much as
I’ve grown to dislike using GNOME and thus switched all my machines over
to KDE, GNOME is still the most popular desktop environment and used
extensively by pretty much all the big corporate Linux distributions.
How is it possible that this hugely popular and important open source
project has to beg individual users for donations like they’re running
an independent tech website or something? Where’s all the financial
support from Red Hat, IBM, Oracle, Canonical, and so on? If not even an
insanely popular project like GNOME can be financially stable, what hope
is there for the countless small, unknown open source projects that form
the basis of our entire computing world?</p>
