id="microsoft-adds-driver-to-windows-that-prevents-changing-the-default-browser-using-the-registry">Microsoft
adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using
the registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar
defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this
is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft
is not particularly happy with this, as they’ve recently introduced a
new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by
blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of
registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was
discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based
protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd
party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but
in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education
environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver
during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of
executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly
and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph
Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do,
Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an
additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert
the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the
changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU’s DMA, but the
driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it’s all a bit
unclear at the moment.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub
and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and
tries out new ideas.

ActivityPub you know who’s following you and in RSS you don’t. This may
sound like a negative until you think about it from the user’s
standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn’t
like RSS btw.
</li>
<li>
It has been
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed
out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can
testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind
of spooky but I guess ok. I can’t recall ever receiving spam as a result
of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I
unsub begging me to come back. So it isn’t a huge problem in a real way
at least for me, yet.
</li>
<li>
I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you
attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You’re
just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don’t abide
that. Have a nice day.

<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
ALGOL is one of those topics that’s haunted the show for a while. It
comes up any time we talk about programming languages, and with good
reason. Many of the features and ideas found in modern languages have
their roots in ALGOL. Despite that influence, ALGOL itself remains
somewhat obscure. It never reached the highs of a C or LISP.
</p>
<p>
In this series we are going to look at ALGOL from 1958 all up to 1968,
keeping a careful eye on how the language evolved, how it’s problems
were addressed, and how new problems were introduced.

id="microsoft-blocks-even-more-customization-apps-in-windows-11-version-24h2">Microsoft
blocks even more customization apps in Windows 11 version 24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Users recently noticed that third-party apps for customizing the user
interface no longer work in the upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2. Not
only does Microsoft not allow you to run those apps, but it even blocks
you from upgrading to newer builds. StartAllBack, a popular tool for
tweaking the taskbar and Start menu in Windows 11, was among the first
to fail on 24H2. Sadly, it is not the only one. ExplorerPatcher also no
longer works in Windows 11 24H2. ExplorerPatcher from Valinet is quite a
popular app that lets you bring back the old Windows 10 taskbar in
Windows 11, apply additional modifications to make Windows 11 slightly
better, and restore some of its missing features. Windows 11 version
24H2 is now flagging ExplorerPatcher as incompatible due to “security or
performance issues” with the following message. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin
I guess the taskbar and Start menu are incredibly important real estate
for Microsoft, since it’s the absolute prime spot for showing ads. If
users replace their taskbar and Start menu with something from a third
party, that prime real estate is gone. Major conspiracy vibes, yes, and
I know this isn’t the reason, but why else would they be blocking these
applications? I can’t think of anything that makes more sense.</p>

<h2 id="outlook-is-microsofts-new-data-collection-service">Outlook is
Microsoft’s new data collection service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows, it appears
the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance tool for
targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing campaigns
of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate
advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply
an email service; it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 801
external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. ↫
Edward Komenda on the Proton blog Now, note that this is an article
written by Proton, posted on the company blog, so of course they’re not
going to be too kind towards their competitors. That being said, the
article’s not wrong: the new Outlook web application, now the default in
Windows, not only shared your data with around 800 partners, it also
displays ads inside of the application. On macOS, it will even show yo
fake emails that are, in fact, ads. Furthermore, once you add your
accounts to this new Outlook web application, you’ll also be uploading
your username and password to Microsoft, giving them access to your
email accounts for advertising and data collection purposes, a shady
practice a ton of email clients on mobile devices tend to do as well.
Suffice it to say you really shouldn’t be using this new Outlook, and
you should make sure friends and family don’t either. This is yet
another nail in the coffin of Windows, now an advertising and data
collection platform first, and operating system second.</p>

Bluesky, Andrew Hickey
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b">explains</a>
how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his
house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my
house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I
had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the
chaos. It wasn’t until the work was over that I was able to start to get
back into my flow.
</p>
<p>
In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a
good five or six hours before it’s time to do the next thing. The first
hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about
where I’m going next. By hour two, I’m not quite at my highest rate but
getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I’m in a good
groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I’m taking short breaks to check
email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my
attention to be available, for a short period.
</p>
<p>
After 5-6 hours of this, I’m wiped out.
</p>
<p>
I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.
</p>
<p>
But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if
I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my
head. It doesn’t take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole
thing, and basically have to start over the next day.
</p>
<p>
Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything
other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I’m sure of it.
Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual
achievement. If you’re doing something that few other people do well,
you’re not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and
a lot of detail, and memory, but you’re sometimes inventing things that
no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other.
And you’re doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you’re
burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)

PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they
don’t interfere at all. ;-)

<p>
PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won’t edit it until
the evening, when I do lite work that doesn’t require much focus for any
duration.

2024-04-06 Travelling
</h1>
<p>
The last ten years, travels – even holiday travels! – have made me more
and more nervous. I used to be so cool about travel. We lived abroad and
travelled so much. And now I’d prefer to just stay in Switzerland all
the time. But my wife still loves to travel and once I’m there, wherever
it is, I feel OK again.
</p>
<p>
I can’t say what it is. A vague anxiety about everything. From the
smallest thing like it’s spring and I’m going to miss the next two weeks
of flowers, and the bees are all emerging from their reed tubes and I
hope our friend is OK with watering the gazillion plants we have and I
hope we didn’t forget anything and I hope security checks are going to
be OK and foreign dictatorship and secret services are going to stay out
of our lives and out of our phones and I hope we have enough money for
tips and how much does one tip again?
</p>
<p>
Back when I was about thirty I argued that equipped with a credit card
nothing else mattered. I’d just buy whatever I was missing. These days
we start our “packing mound” days beforehand.
