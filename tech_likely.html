law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>You know those modal screens that interrupt your groove when you are
surfing? There are no laws forcing websites to use them. They use them
because they choose to. ↫ Bite code! Cookie banners are not only not
required, they’re not even needed, and most implementations you
encounter today are illegal anyway. You can use session cookies and
anonymous stats cookies without needing any user approval. Companies
like to use these cookie banners because they want to make you mad at
the law, not at them for tracking you up the wazzoo, and people who
actually do know better trot out the cookie banners to enrage you at the
government instead of at the corporations exploiting you. EU law only
states that if a website wants to track you, they have to let you know.
That’s it. Seems very reasonable to anyone who isn’t a corporatist.</p>

<p>When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into
account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all
mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying
about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his
equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of
the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties,
because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state
liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate.
Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works
the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family
home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it’s a good
question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.</p>

<p>Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always
say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened
recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to
Raptors. He wasn’t the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them.
He has a competitive grace you don’t see very often. Quickley was one of
those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team,
he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we
can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the
Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side,
if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks
win they way they are winning now. That’s what I want from developing
software. I want to create a global team of truly independent
developers, filling the void left by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predation</a> of the
silos. There won’t even be a business model for much of what we do, but
there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best
accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We’re going to play a game we
started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could
still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can’t produce end-user
software much longer, but I don’t want to leave until we have this thing
rebooted.</p>

13 is the end of the FreeBSD version</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Bad news from BSD land – the oldest vendor of BSD systems is changing
direction away from FreeBSD and toward Linux. NAS vendor iXsystems has
been busy this year, but apart from some statements in online user
communities, it hasn’t been talking about the big news. Back in 2022, we
covered TrueNAS CORE 13, the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey OS
for NAS servers, and in that article we mentioned its new product, the
Debian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing storage for Kubernetes
users. Now it seems the company is betting its future on that
Linux-based product, meaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD
offering. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register Very sad to read, as more
monoculture is not exactly great, but at the same time, from a corporate
perspective, it’s also not entirely unexpected to focus on the server
operating system with by far the widest industry support. I hope the
fork mentioned in the article gains some steam, because having
competition in this space is crucially important.</p>

<p>Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and
Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features.
Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return
to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But
sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed
it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns
blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click
outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.</p>

working with developers again, thank goodness. I once thought I could
make server products or toolkits for people I called “poets” – motivated
writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a
properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results,
I’ve seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good
developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it
still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet
knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get
<i>anything</i> technical to work. If they knew what was required, my
2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their
degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to
the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little
cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs.

<h2 id="trapped-in-the-iron-age">
Trapped in the Iron Age
</h2>
<p>
In 1836, Danish antiquarian and curator Christian Jürgensen Thomsen
distinguished three prehistorical eras based on the dominant materials
used for weapons and cutting implements: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age,
and the Iron
Age.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Thomsen’s classification refers to the past, but according to his
criteria, we have never evolved beyond the Iron Age. Even in the 21st
century, iron remains the dominant material, not just for weapons and
cutting implements but for about every modern technology.
</p>
<p>
We now use most iron in the form of steel. However, according to
Thomsen’s criteria, we cannot speak of a “Steel Age.” First, steel is
merely an alloy of iron (&gt;98%) and carbon (&lt;2%). Second, humans
have been producing steel since the beginning of the Iron Age. That is a
little-known fact in the Western world, where steel production only took
off in the nineteenth century with fossil fuels. However, Asian and
African metallurgists developed high-quality steels much earlier, and
this knowledge eventually allowed Europeans to do the same – on a much
larger
scale.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By 2021, the global iron and steel output reached 1,950 million tonnes
(Mt). That is 22 times larger than the combined aluminum and copper
output (88 Mt). The global iron and steel output corresponds to five
times the global plastics output (391 Mt) and dwarfs the worldwide
production of silicon (8.5 Mt) and lithium (0.1
Mt).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
Steel is the fundamental material of industrial societies. Without
plastics, lithium, or silicon, we would still be in an industrial
society. Without iron and steel, we would be thrown back 3,000 years
into the Bronze Age.
</p>
<h2 id="where-is-all-that-steel">
Where is all that steel?
</h2>
<p>
The massive presence of steel in industrial society is not so
obvious.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
At home, we find several steel appliances such as the refrigerator,
washing machine, water boiler, bathtub, and cooking, heating, and
cooling appliances. However, only 2-3% of total steel production ends up
in domestic
appliances.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
Outdoors, there’s a lot of steel in the form of vehicles. These are
especially passenger cars that use around 10% of all steel globally (20%
in rich countries). Busses, trucks, trains, and ships add another 4-5%.
Altogether that is still less than 20% of the global steel output.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far
away from residential areas.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far
away from residential areas. More than half of global steel production
goes into construction, which includes buildings (residential,
commercial, industrial) and infrastructures (bridges, tunnels, harbors,
canals, runways, oil rigs, refineries, pipelines, power plants,
transmission lines, railways, subways, and so on). Much of that steel is
embedded in concrete. Reinforced concrete is the world’s primary
building material, and concrete is the only material that can match the
output of steel (1,819 Mt in 2021).
</p>
<p>
Roughly 15% of global steel production serves to make machinery,
including machine tools, industrial equipment, electrical hardware, and
construction, mining, and farming machines. Even products made of other
materials – such as other metals, plastics, and wood – are shaped by
steel
tools.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
The final 15% of steel production ends up in a variety of objects, from
screws over food packaging to furniture and shipping
containers.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>

<h2 id="the-environmental-footprint-of-the-steel-industry">
The environmental footprint of the steel industry
</h2>
<p>
Steel is often presented as one of the most sustainable materials.
Unlike plastics, steel can be recycled without any loss in quality. The
steel industry has made great advances in energy efficiency, more so
than many other industries. Making one ton of crude steel now requires
roughly 20 gigajoules (GJ) of primary energy on average – three times
less than in
1950.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
This compares very favorably to other materials such as aluminum (175
GJ/t), plastics (80-120 GJ/t), or copper (45
GJ/t).<sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Unlike plastics, steel is a biodegradable
material.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>
Finally, iron ore is not in short supply. It makes up 5 percent of the
Earth’s crust and is fourth in abundance among the
elements.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
For comparison, copper only makes up
0.01%.<sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, despite all these advantages, the global iron and steel
industry consumes more energy and produces more carbon emissions than
any other industry. The total primary energy use of crude steel
production was 39 exajoules (EJ) in 2021, which corresponds to 7% of all
energy used worldwide in that year (595 EJ). The greenhouse gas
emissions are even higher because around 75% of energy use comes from
coal – the fuel with the highest carbon emissions. In 2021, the iron and
steel industry produced 3.3 Gt of carbon emissions, roughly 9% of global
emissions (36.3
Gt).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
The concrete industry follows closely with 8% of global emissions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The iron and steel industry consumes more energy and produces more
carbon emissions than any other industry.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The estimates above come from the <em>World Steel Association</em> and
the <em>International Energy Agency</em>. These data are available for
all metals and have been documented over a long period, allowing for
historical comparisons. However, they only refer to the smelting of the
metal. They do not include the energy use and carbon emissions for
mining and transporting iron ore, coal, limestone, scrap, and steel
products. Nor do they include the energy and emissions for coke
production and ore preparation – all essential to the steel production
process.<sup id="fnref3:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scientific studies that have set wider boundaries for the iron and steel
industry conclude that the energy cost of steel production increases by
50% to
100%.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>
One report concludes that the methane emissions from metallurgical coal
mining alone could increase emissions by 27%. Another study estimates
that seaborne transport of iron ore and steel adds 10-15% extra
emissions.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>
Iron and steel production also create other environmental problems, such
as high water use, solid waste production, and significant air and water
pollution.
</p>
<p>
The carbon footprint of the iron and steel industry is incompatible with
current ambitions to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, even less
so because steel production is very likely to expand further. Steel
production grew tenfold since 1950 and doubled between 2000 and 2020,
growing faster than many researchers had
predicted.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>
Furthermore, efficiency gains have decreased, and there is a scientific
consensus that current technologies have reached their thermodynamic
limits.<sup id="fnref4:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>
During the last two decades, the average energy use for the production
of 1 ton of steel has remained around 20
GJ/t.<sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-steel-without-fossil-fuels">
How to make steel without fossil fuels?
</h2>
<p>
There are two ways to make steel, and one is much more sustainable than
the
other.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
On the one hand, there is the blast furnace or basic oxygen furnace, in
which steel is made from iron ore and coal. This technology is – in its
essential form – 2000 years
old.<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
On the other hand, there is the electric arc furnace, in which steel is
made from steel scrap and electricity. The electric arc furnace, which
is a relatively new technology, consumes much less energy than the blast
furnace, makes use of a recycled resource (no need to mine iron ore),
and works without the direct use of coal or other fossil fuels (the
electricity can be supplied by solar, wind, or atomic power).
</p>
<p>
The most energy-efficient electric arc furnaces now consume less than
300 kilowatt-hours of electricity per ton of steel
produced.<sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>
Hypothetically, if we had produced all steel in 2021 (1,950 Mt) in such
furnaces, the total power consumption of the global iron and steel
industry would have been only 585 terawatt-hours (Twh). That corresponds
to just one-third of all electricity generated by wind turbines
worldwide in the same year (1,848 Twh). Unfortunately, more than 70% of
global steel output was made in blast furnaces fed by coal and iron
ore.<sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>
A blast furnace consumes twenty times more energy and cannot be operated
by electricity because coal is both the fuel source and the chemical
reductant. The combustion of coal produces carbon monoxide that reduces
the iron from its
ore.<sup id="fnref5:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="not-enough-scrap-available">
Not enough scrap available
</h2>
<p>
The solution seems obvious: let’s produce all that steel in electric arc
furnaces. However, this is impossible. First, there’s not enough scrap
available: the continuous growth of the global steel output makes a
circular flow of resources
impossible.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>
It takes decades before most steel becomes available for recycling. For
example, there is 543 Mt of steel stocked in
ships.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>
The scrap available for recycling in 2021 corresponds to the production
level of 1965 when global steel production was less than one-quarter of
what it is today (450
Mt).<sup id="fnref5:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
Consequently, the other three quarters need to be produced in blast
furnaces using coal and freshly mined iron ore.

<p>
Nowadays, China produces roughly half of the steel in the world and does
that almost exclusively (+90%) in blast furnaces using coal and iron
ore. Many other steelmaking nations have a higher share of electric arc
furnaces. However, it makes little sense to point the finger at China.
First, the US and Europe have outsourced many of their industries to
China since the 2000s, a trend that corresponds neatly with the growing
steel output in that country. Furthermore, twenty to forty years ago,
China hardly used any steel. Consequently, there is almost no scrap
available. China has no other choice than to use blast
furnaces.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="ever-higher-grades-of-steel">
Ever higher grades of steel
</h2>
<p>
A second obstacle is the continuous development of higher grades of
steel. There are now over 2,500 different types of steel with a variety
of properties, such as increased strength, tolerance to high
temperatures, or corrosion
resistance.<sup id="fnref6:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref6:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
Although these higher quality steels can be produced in electric arc
furnaces, they are not made from scrap, and they have much higher energy
use.
</p>
<p>
Steel available for recycling forms a mix of steel grades. That mix is
suitable for making plain carbon steel but not highly alloyed steels,
which require scrap with similar qualities. However, that scrap is not
available. For example, stainless steel, the most produced special steel
grade, has a recycling rate of only 15%. Almost 60 Mt of stainless steel
was produced in 2021, compared to only 4 Mt in
1980.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>
The traditional use of stainless steel was in cutlery, surgical tools,
and medical and food processing equipment. However, it is now also used
in the construction of tunnels and outdoor furniture, wastewater
treatment, seawater desalination, nuclear engineering, and the
production of
biofuels.<sup id="fnref7:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The low recycling rate and the need for the extraction of additional
elements such as chrome and nickel make higher grades of steel more
energy-intensive to produce. For example, stainless steel production
requires almost 80 GJ per ton, four times more than the production of
plain carbon
steel.<sup id="fnref8:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
The continuous development of higher-grade steels is stimulated by
environmental legislation (such as the use of lighter steel in cars) and
by competition from other materials, mainly aluminum and plastic
composites.<sup id="fnref9:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref7:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
Ironically, the competition with these materials, which consume even
more energy, makes steel less and less sustainable.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-renewable-energy">
Steel and renewable energy
</h2>
<p>
The steel industry is heavily dependent on the energy supply, but the
energy supply is also heavily dependent on the steel industry. Almost
10% of the global steel output goes into building and maintaining energy
supply infrastructure. That amount corresponds to the entire steel
output in 1950. A great share of that steel goes to gas and oil
infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.
Oil and gas mining, production, and transportation require steel for
offshore drilling platforms, pipelines, refineries, tankers, and storage
tanks. Coal mining depends on steel for cutters, loaders, conveyors,
excavators, and
trucks.<sup id="fnref10:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the planned switch to low-carbon energy sources and the
electrification of heating and transport technologies will not decrease
our dependency on the steel industry – on the contrary. A low-carbon
power grid requires much more steel (and other materials) than an
infrastructure based on fossil fuels. Wind and solar power are very
diffuse power sources compared to fossil fuels. Therefore, it takes much
more materials (and land) to produce the same energy. In jargon, wind
and solar have low “power density” or high “material
intensity.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A low-carbon power grid requires much more steel than an infrastructure

</blockquote>
<p>
The “steel intensity” of thermal gas and coal power plants is between 50
and 60 tonnes of steel per megawatt of installed
power.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
Hydroelectric power plants have a lower steel intensity, with 20-30
tonnes of steel per
MW.<sup id="fnref11:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
Atomic power’s steel intensity is also lower at between 20 and 40 tonnes
of steel per installed
MW.<sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>
On the other hand, solar PV requires between 40 and 170 tonnes of steel
per installed
MW.<sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>
Although there is little or no steel in the solar panels themselves,
it’s the material of choice for the structures that support them.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-wind-power">
Steel and wind power
</h2>
<p>
The most steel-intensive power source – by far – is the modern wind
turbine. The steel intensity of a wind turbine depends on its size. A
single, large wind turbine requires significantly more steel per
megawatt of installed power than two smaller wind
turbines.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
For example, a 3.6 MW wind turbine with a 100-meter tall tower requires
335 tons of steel (83 tons/MW), while a 5 MW wind turbine with a
150-meter tall tower needs 875 tons of steel (175
tons/MW).<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>
The trend is towards taller wind turbines and a higher steel intensity.

<p>
Steel consumption further increases for offshore wind turbines. Onshore
wind power plants rely on reinforced concrete for their foundations, but
offshore wind turbines need massive steel structures such as monopiles
and
jackets.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>
The steel intensity for offshore wind turbines is calculated to be
around 450 tonnes per MW for a 5 MW turbine – eight times higher than
the steel intensity of a thermal power
plant.<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.
As these wind turbines get taller and move into deeper waters, their
steel use further increases.
</p>
<p>
The most popular offshore wind turbine nowadays has a capacity of 7 MW,
while the largest ones have a capacity of 14
MW.<sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
If we make a conservative estimate based on the data above (the steel
intensity doubles for every doubling of the power capacity), a 14 MW
offshore wind turbine would require 1,300 tons of steel per MW or 18,200
tonnes in total. Such a wind turbine thus consumes 24 times more steel
than a coal or gas power plant of the same power capacity.
</p>
<h2 id="shorter-life-expectancy">
Shorter life expectancy
</h2>
<p>
The difference between renewable power sources and fossil fuels becomes
even larger if the steel intensity is calculated per unit of energy
rather than power (MWh instead of MW). In contrast to coal and gas power
plants, the output of wind and solar power plants depends on the
weather, and they do not always produce their maximum power capacity.
Therefore, replacing 1 MW of fossil electricity generation capacity
requires the installation of (on average) 4 MW of solar power or 2 MW of
wind
power.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>
A 14 MW offshore wind turbine thus has a steel intensity that is almost
50 times higher than a fossil fuel power plant for every kilowatt-hour
of electricity
produced.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Solar and wind power plants also have shorter lifetimes (20-30 years)
compared to thermal power plants (30-60
years).<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>
While this does not affect the steel intensity per MW of power
installed, it again increases the steel intensity per unit of energy
produced over time. That does not always lead to a doubling of steel use
because foundations for offshore wind turbines and structures for solar
panels may have longer lifetimes than the power sources they support and
could thus be
reused.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>

<p>
The data above only include the steel used in the power plants
themselves. For fossil fuel power plants, they do not include the steel
used in the pipelines, oil rigs, coal excavators, and the like. However,
the same goes for the low-carbon power sources. Because they need much
more resources than thermal power plants (steel but also other metals
and materials), they depend on a global mining and transport
infrastructure that is just as steel-intensive as the supply chain for
fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, because they are more diffuse power sources with
intermittent and unpredictable power production, often located far away
from energy consumption centers, renewable power plants drive the
expansion of transmission infrastructure. That infrastructure is also
based on steel – from switchyard equipment over towers to conduction
cables.<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup><sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Finally, low-carbon power sources also have a high need for special
grades of steel, which are more energy-intensive to produce. Steel for
off-shore wind turbines should resist corrosion, and stainless steel is
increasingly used for solar panel support
structures.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>
Electrical lamination steel (iron-silicon) is indispensable for
transformers in the power
network.<sup id="fnref12:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Nuclear power plants may have a relatively low steel intensity but are
completely built up of energy-intensive specialty steels. For example,
cladding the fuel elements containing fissionable uranium requires
zirconium steel, while all structural elements contain austenitic
stainless
steel.<sup id="fnref13:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>

<p>
The high steel intensity of low carbon power sources confronts us with a
so-called “catch-22”, a situation in which there seems to be no escape
from a problem no matter what we do. We need much more steel if we
replace thermal power plants with renewable ones. Because there is not
enough steel scrap available, we can only produce that extra steel from
iron ore in blast furnaces burning fossil fuels. To address climate
change, we need to build low-carbon sources quickly and in great
numbers. However, to achieve circular material flows and build
low-carbon power sources from scrap and renewable electricity, we would
have to do the opposite: slow down the development of a low-carbon power
grid.

A well-cited study from 2013 concluded that if wind and solar power
would supply 25,000 Twh of electricity – which corresponds to total
global electricity demand in 2021 – we need about 3,200 Mt of steel to
build the power plants
alone.<sup id="fnref4:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>
Global electricity demand is projected to grow to between 52,000 and
71,000 terawatt-hours in 2050, which would increase the extra steel
demand to between 6,400 and 8,960
Mt.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
Spread out over the lifetime of solar panels and wind turbines (25
years), we would have to produce 256 to 358 Mt extra steel per year to
make wind turbines and solar panel structures – comparable to the steel
demand for passenger cars (195 Mt) and other transportation modes (98
Mt) combined.
</p>
<p>
That is still a very optimistic estimation. Electricity demand only
makes up around 20% of total energy demand. If the total energy demand
(177,000 Twh in 2021) would be supplied by wind and solar, we would need
22,400 Mt of steel. That’s an extra 896 Mt steel per year – as much as
the global production in the early 2000s. You could argue that
electricity can be used more efficiently than fossil fuels, for example,
in cars and heating systems. However, at the same time, total energy
demand is expected to rise further, countering the gains made by
increased energy efficiency.
</p>
<h2 id="the-high-tech-solutions">
The high-tech solutions
</h2>
<p>
The steel industry counts on technological solutions to make steel
production carbon neutral. One option is to replace coal by gas, an
approach that is already common in the Middle East and North America.
Gas-based steelmaking results in somewhat lower carbon emissions, but
they are still much higher than in the case of the electric arc furnace.
Therefore, most attention goes to hydrogen, which can replace purified
coal (coke) as a reducing agent in a direct reduction shaft
furnace.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
However, hydrogen-based steelmaking does not offer an escape from the
catch-22 because it further increases the need for a steel-intensive
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
The production of hydrogen is energy-intensive. It takes 50-55
kilowatt-hour to make 1 kg of hydrogen and 60 kg of hydrogen to make 1
ton of
steel.<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
The production of 1 ton of steel from hydrogen thus consumes 3,000 kWh
of electricity, which is ten times higher than the electricity use of an
electric arc furnace making steel from scrap. Consequently,
hydrogen-based steelmaking requires roughly ten times more wind turbines
and solar panels than scrap-based steel production – and thus ten times
more steel. On top of this comes the steel for building the pipelines
and storage tanks that are part of the hydrogen infrastructure.

<p>
Carbon capture and storage, in which the carbon emissions of steelmaking
plants are captured and then stored underground, faces the same
problems. It requires a steel infrastructure and extra energy, thus
indirectly raising the use of fossil fuels. Reverting to older,
preindustrial steelmaking processes is not the answer either. Today’s
blast furnace is essentially still the blast furnace from earlier
centuries, only much more energy
efficient.<sup id="fnref14:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="the-low-tech-solutions">
The low-tech solutions
</h2>
<p>
The picture painted above seems to offer little hope for carbon-neutral
steelmaking and power production. However, there is a low-tech solution
that could achieve it. We could adjust steel production to the available
scrap supply both in quantity and quality. That would allow us to
produce all steel from scrap in electric arc furnaces, dramatically
reducing energy consumption and eliminating almost all carbon emissions.
Of course, the intent should not be to replace steel with plastic
composites and aluminum because they are even more energy-intensive to
produce. The only solution is to reduce material use overall.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We could adjust steel production to the available scrap supply both in
quantity and quality.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reducing the steel output and using more common steel grades would not
bring us back to the Bronze Age. As noted, global end-of-life ferrous
scrap availability was approximately 450 Mt in 2021, which would allow
us to produce roughly one-quarter of the current steel output.
Furthermore, the scrap supply will continue to rise for the next 40
years, enabling us to produce more and more low-emission steel each
year. By 2050, scrap availability is expected to rise to about 900 Mt,
almost half of today’s global steel
production.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>
All that extra steel could be invested in expanding the low-carbon power
grid without raising emissions first.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of room to reduce the steel intensity of modern society.
All our basic needs – and more – could be supplied with much less steel
involved. For example, we could make cars lighter by making them
smaller. That would bring energy savings without the need for
energy-intensive high-grade steel. We could replace cars with bicycles
and public transportation so that more people share less steel. Such
changes would also reduce the need for steel in the road network, the
energy infrastructure, and the manufacturing industry. We would need
fewer machine tools, shipping containers, and reinforced concrete
buildings. Whenever steel intensity is reduced, the advantages cascade
throughout the whole system. Preventing corrosion and producing steel
more locally from local resources would also reduce energy use and
emissions.<sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The continuous growth of the steel output – the increasing steel
intensity of human society – makes sustainable steel production
impossible. No technology can change that because it’s not a
technological problem. Like forestry can only be sustainable if the wood
demand does not exceed the wood supply, steel is sustainable or not
depending on the balance between (scrap) supply and (steel) demand. We
may not be able to escape the Iron Age, but we have an option to escape
the catch-22 that inextricably links steel production with fossil
fuels.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>

compressed this technological evolution in just a few decades: shipping

For off-shore wind turbines, the lifetime of the foundations is
estimated to be 100 years, so in principle they could serve for
replacement wind turbines of the same size. On the other hand, it is not
self-evident that these steel foundations will eventually be recycled.
First, only around 10% of decommissioning costs can be recovered by
recycling the metal, meaning that it is not economically and perhaps
even energetically interesting to do it. Second, in some cass marine
life has flourished around the foundations. The four offshore wind farms
that had been decomissioned in 2019 lasted for 15, 18, 20 and 26 years.

Another motivation for reducing the steel intensity of modern society is
to limit the consequences of geopolitical conflicts. The more steel we
produce for peaceful purposes, the more steel becomes available for war
and destruction. Remarkably, the production of military equipment is
absent from modern steel statistics, and if mentioned, its share is very
low. However, in times of war, steelmaking facilities switch to
producing steel for military purposes. The steel industry can thus be
converted into a weapons industry at any moment, and there is now a lot
more steel production capacity available than there has ever been in
history. <a href="#fnref:49" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

<h2 id="mending-chestertons-fence-open-source-decision-making">Mending
Chesterton’s Fence: Open Source Decision-making</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
When each line of code is written it is surrounded by a sea of context:
who in the community this is for, what problem we’re trying to solve,
what technical assumptions we’re making, what we already tried but
didn’t work, how much coffee we’ve had today. All of these have an
effect on the software we write.
</p>
<p>
By the time the next person looks at that code, some of that context
will have evaporated. There may be helpful code comments, tests, and
specifications to explain how it should behave. But they don’t explain
the path not taken, and why we didn’t take it. Or those occasions where
the facts changed, so we changed our mind.
</p>
<p>
Some parts of our system are as old as Crossref itself. Whilst our
process still involves coffee, it’s safe to say that most of our working
assumptions have changed, and for good reasons! We have to be very
careful when working with our oldest code. We always consider why it was
written that way, and what might have changed since. We’re always on the
look out for
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/chestertons-fence" target="_blank">Chesterton’s
Fence</a>!
</p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-trail">
Leaving a Trail
</h2>
<p>
We’re building a new generation of systems at Crossref, and as we go
we’re being deliberate about supporting the people who will maintain it.
</p>
<p>
When our oldest code was written, the software development team all
worked in an office with a whiteboard or three, and the code was
proprietary. Twenty years later, things are very different. The software
development team is spread over 8 timezones. Thanks to
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">POSI</a>,
all the new code we write is open source, so the next people to read
that code might not even be Crossref staff.
</p>
<p>
Working increasingly asynchronously, without that whiteboard, we need to
record the options, collect evidence, and peer-review them within the
team.
</p>
<p>
So for the past couple of years the software team has maintained a
<a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/" target="_blank">decision
register</a>. The first decision we recorded was that we should record
decisions! Since then we have recorded the significant decisions as they
arise. Plus some
<a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/dr-0003/" target="_blank">historical
ones</a>.
</p>
<p>
These aren’t functional specifications, which describe what the system
should do. It’s the decisions and trade-offs we made along the way to
get to the how. Look out for another blog post about specifications.
</p>
<p>
By leaving a trail of explanations as we go, we make it easier for
people to understand why code was written, and what has changed. We’re
writing the story of our new systems. This makes it easier to alter the
system in future in response to changes in our community, and the
metadata they use.
</p>
<h2 id="difficult-decisions">
Difficult Decisions
</h2>
<p>
There are some fun challenges to building systems at Crossref. We have a
lot of data. Our schema is very diverse, and has a vast amount of domain
knowledge embedded in it. It’s changed over time to accommodate 20 years
of scholarly publishing innovations. Our community is diverse too, from
small one-person publishers with a handful of articles, through to large
ones that publish millions.
</p>
<p>
What might be an obvious decision for a database table with a thousand
rows doesn’t always translate to a million. When you get to a billion,
things change again. An initially sensible choice might not scale. And a
scalable solution might look over-engineered if we had millions of DOIs,
rather than hundreds of millions.
</p>
<p>
The diversity of the data also poses challenges. A very simple feature
might get complicated or expensive when it meets the heterogeneity of
our metadata and membership. What might scale for journal article or
grant metadata might not work for book chapters.
</p>
<p>
The big decisions need careful discussion, experimentation, and
justification.
</p>
<h2 id="2nf-or-not-2nf">
2NF or not 2NF
</h2>
<p>
One such recent decision was how we structure our SQL schema for the
database that powers our new ‘relationships’ REST API endpoint,
currently in development.
</p>
<p>
The data model is simple: we have a table of Relationships which connect
pairs of Items. And each Item can have properties (such as a type). The
way to model this is straightforward, following conventional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_blank">normalization
rules</a>:
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/open-source-decision-making/1.svg"
alt="SQL Tables, normalised" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<p>
We built the API around it, and all was well.
</p>
<p>
We then added a feature which lets you look up relationships based on
the properties of the subject or object. For example “find citations
where the subject is an article and the object is a dataset”. This
design worked well in our initial testing. We loaded more data into it,
and it continued to work well.
</p>
<p>
And then, the context changed. Once we tested loading a billion
relationships in the database, the performance dropped. The
characteristics of the data: size, shape and distribution, reached a
point where the database was unable to run queries in a timely way. The
PostgreSQL query planner became unpredictable and occasionally produced
some quite exciting query plans (to non-technical readers: databases are
neither the time nor the place for excitement).
</p>
<p>
This is a normal experience in scaling up a system. We expected that
something like this would happen at some point, but you don’t know when
it will happen until you try. We bounced around some ideas and came up
with a couple of alternatives. Each made trade-offs around processing
time, data storage and query flexibility. The best way to evaluate them
was to use real data at a representative scale.
</p>
<p>
One of the options was denormalisation. This is a conventional solution
to this kind of problem, but was not our first choice as it involves
extra machinery to keep the data up-to-date, and more storage. It would
not have been the correct solution for a smaller dataset. But we had the
evidence that the other two approaches would not scale predictably.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/open-source-decision-making/2.svg"
alt="SQL Tables, normalised" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<br>
<p>
By combining the data into one table, we can serve up API requests much
more predictably, and with much better performance. This code is now
running with the right performance. Technical readers note that this
diagram is simplified. The
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/manifold/-/blob/62fc458b280e71c6b6221908fb7824bd3573726f/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1_0_0__initial_schema_creation.sql#L356" target="_blank">real
SQL schema</a> is a little different.
</p>
<p>
Without writing this history down, and explaining what we tried, someone
might misunderstand the reason for the code and try to simplify it.
Decision record
<a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/dr-0500/" target="_blank">DR-0500</a>
guards against that.
</p>
<p>
But one day, when the context changes, future developers will be able to
come back and modify the code, because they understand why it was like
that in the first place.

<h2 id="hackintosh-is-almost-dead">Hackintosh is (almost) dead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s true that latest macOS 14 (Sonoma) still supports the latest
generations of Intel Macs and it’s very likely that at least one or two
major versions will still be compatible. But there’s one particular
development that is de-facto killing off the Hackintosh scene. In
Sonoma, Apple has completely removed all traces of driver support for
their oldest WiFi/Bt cards, namely various Broadcom cards that they last
used in 2012/13 iMac / MacBook models. Those Mac models are not
supported by macOS for few years now thus it’s not surprising the
drivers are being removed. Most likely reason is that Apple is moving
drivers away from .kext (Kernel Extensions) to .dext (DriverKit) thus
cleaning up obsolete and unused code from macOS. They did the same with
Ethernet drivers in Ventura. ↫ Aleksandar Vacić Everybody, especially
the small but active Hackintosh community itself, knew full well the
writing was on the wall the day Apple switched to ARM, and we’re seeing
the first signs of the impending end of the community. Sure, enough
people will remain who are interested in building Hackintoshes using
older, unsupported versions of macOS, kind of like retrocomputing, but
the days of running the latest macOS release on non-Apple hardware are
coming to an end. As a fun side note, this old OSNews article I wrote in
2009 is one of the most-visited articles on our site of all time.
Hackintoshes were way, way more popular than people gave them credit
for.</p>

adds “real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection” to Chrome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting
users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying
and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion
devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we’ve
seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats
they defend against. That’s why we’re excited to announce a new version
of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL
protection for people using the Standard protection mode of Safe
Browsing in Chrome. ↫ Jasika Bawa, Xinghui Lu, Jonathan Li, and Alex
Wozniak on the Google blog Reading through the description of how this
new feature works, it does indeed seem to respect one’s privacy, but
there could be so many devils in so many details here that you’d really
need to be a specialist in these matters to truly gauge if Google isn’t
getting its hands on the URLs you visit through this feature. But even
if all that is true, it doesn’t really matter because Google has tons of
other ways to collect more than enough data on you to build an exact
profile of you are, and what advertisements will work well no you. Any
time Google goes out of its way to announce it’s not collecting some
type of data – like here, the URLs you type into the Chrome URL bar –
it’s not because they care so much about your privacy, but because they
simply don’t need this data to begin with.</p>

A month ago, Lana Novikova
<a href="https://twitter.com/_Unsolved_/status/1758039399684542664">asked
me</a> to imagine the future of software documentation. What will
software technical writing look like in, say, 2049, when our profession
will be a century old? Will we be writing markup in git repositories or
use ÜberDITA in space? Will our job still exist? I’ve put my futurist
hat on to picture the shape of our profession 25 years from now. Buckle
up!

<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>People in the United Kingdom who use RISC OS have plenty of
opportunities to meet up with fellow users, with a number of user groups
holding meetings on a regular basis, and a small number of main events –
the shows, such as Wakefield and London. But what of our European
friends? It’s possible for them to join some of the user group meetings
when they’re held online and at a suitable time, as many are, but while
doing so is an opportunity not to be missed where possible it’s…</p>

Ladybird with tools from Google Project Zero</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>While Ladybird does an okay job with well-formed web content, I
thought it would be useful to throw some security research tools at it
and see what kind of issues it might reveal. So today we’ll be using
“Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird
and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that
Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but
strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug
build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high
hopes for Ladybird.</p>

Rather than a guest speaker, the next RISC OS User Group of London
(ROUGOL) meeting – which will take place on 18th March (tomorrow) – will
take the form of an open discussion, with Bernard Boase chairing the

<h2 id="wal-g-3.0.0-released">WAL-G 3.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0
</p>
<p>
WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL,
GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.
</p>
<h2>
Noteworthy Changes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This
technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down.
However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.
</li>
<li>
For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary
purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.
</li>
<li>
Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If
you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the
restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for
these tables. See
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a>
for details.
</li>
<li>
Greenplum’s PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation
process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We
now have tools to verify the integrity of AOfiles in storage without
actually restoring backups.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day!
