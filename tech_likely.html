<h2 id="microsoft-all-content-on-the-web-is-fair-use">Microsoft: all
content on the web is fair use</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>When someone tells you who they are, believe them. Microsoft’s AI
chief Mustafa Suleyman: With respect to content that is already on the
open web, the social contract of that content since the ’90s has been
that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce
with it. That has been freeware, if you like. That’s been the
understanding. ↫ Mustafa Suleyman This is absolute bullshit from the
first word to the very last. None of this is true – not even in the
slightest. Content on the web is not free for the taking by anyone,
especially not to be chewed up and regurgitated verbatim by spicy
autocomplete tools. There is no “social contract” to that effect. In
fact, when I go to any of Microsoft’s website, documents, videos, or any
other content they publish online, on the open web, and scroll to the
very bottom of the page, it’s all got the little copyright symbol or
similar messaging. Once again, this underlines how entitled Silicon
Valley techbros really are. If we violate even a gram of Microsoft’s
copyrights, we’d have their lawyers on our ass in weeks – but when
Microsoft itself needs to violate copyright and licensing on an
automated, industrial scale, for massive profits, everything is suddenly
peace, love, and fair use. Men in Silicon Valley just do not understand
consent. At all. And they show this time and time again. Meanwhile, the
Internet Archive has to deal with crap like this: The lawsuit is about
the longstanding and widespread library practice of controlled digital
lending, which is how we lend the books we own to our patrons. As a
result of the publishers’ lawsuit, more than 500,000 books have been
removed from our lending library. ↫ Chris Freeland at the Internet
Archive Blogs Controlled lending without a profit motive is deemed
illegal, but violating copyright and licensing on an automated,
industrial scale is fair use. Make it make sense. Make it make
sense.</p>

<h2 id="apple-ii-graphics-more-than-you-wanted-to-know">Apple II
graphics: more than you wanted to know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Apple ][ is one of the most iconic vintage computers of all time.
But since Wozniak’s monster lasted all the way until 1993 (1995 if you
could the IIe card, which I won’t count until I get one), it can be easy
to forget that in 1977, it was a video extravaganza. The competitors–
even much bigger and established companies like Commodore and Tandy–
generally only had text modes, let alone pixel-addressable graphics, and
they certainly didn’t have sixteen colors. (Gray and grey are different
colors, right?) ↫ Nicole Branagan If there’s ever anything you wanted to
know about how graphics work on the Apple II, this is the place to go.
It’s an incredibly detailed and illustrated explanation of how the
machine renders and displays graphics, and an excellent piece of writing
to boot. I’m a little jealous.</p>

<p>
The Pi 5’s thermals are close enough to the Pi 4 that old cooling
solutions work okay, but the port layout and inclusion of a power button
means at least minimal redesigns are necessary.

Here are a few of the Pi 5 cases I’ve been testing (most for over a

not unusual to port the Linux Vector Packet Processor (VPP) to
FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is a framework for moving packets
around at high rates. Its core concept is handling packets in groups
known as “vectors,” which allows for the native use of vector processor
instructions for packet classification and processing in different CPU
architectures — currently amd64 and arm64. VPP can process packets at
incredibly high rates and competes with many dedicated forwarding
appliances. This is achieved using userspace networking that bypasses
the host’s normal network stack. This article describes the porting of
VPP to FreeBSD and working with the upstream VPP project to include
FreeBSD as a supported target. ↫ Tom Jones It’s not unusual for me to
link to something a little over my head, and this is another example of
something I know y’all will like, but I don’t really understand
fully.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wanted to see what was out there in blogrolls, so I wrote an app that
started from my own blogroll, and looked for feeds I was subscribed to
that also had blogrolls, following the
<a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">conventions</a> we outlined in
March.
</p>
<p>
It then starts at each of the blogrolls I found in my list, and did the
same thing with them, until I ran out of lists to look at.
</p>
<p>
And the whole thing runs again a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>
It found a bunch of them, so then I threw together a simple user
interface that lets you click on the title of a blogroll in a list in
the left panel, and view the actual blogroll in the right panel. Here’s
a screen shot.

</p>
<p>
A caveat – what you see here is just an experiment. I don’t expect this
app to be up for any period of time. It’s here just to learn from. Part
of a bootstrap perhaps.

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-28-biden">
2024-06-28 Biden
</h1>
<p>
When I see all this talk about Biden and the US elections I keep
thinking: almost all that matters is that Biden has a vice president
that can take over as soon as things break down. I still remember
thinking when Biden got elected: this guy has nothing; he is the most
boring and conflict averse choice. And this was exactly what the US
needed. And it’s what the US still needs. A boring candidate whose
administration gets stuff done.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the US also needs a lot of other things: reforms, policy
changes, and on and on. And you can have both! Do not vote for the
fascist and keep the criticism up. So I can say: racism, Israel,
Ukraine, immigration, gerrymandering, gun control, Snowden… work on all
these things!! Do it! But just because I’m unhappy about the lack of
progress does not mean you should abstain or vote for a fascist.
</p>
<p>
The fact that both candidates are old white men is a shame, yes of
course! But it is not a reason to hand power to the fascists.
</p>
<p>
And often things can get done at the local level. The Swiss based their
constitution on the US constitution (senate, congress, states,
federalism) and I know that what is impossible to achieve at the
national level can sometimes be achieved at the state level, and what
cannot be achieved at the state level can be achieved at the city level,
in the community, in the library, at the bar, at home.
</p>
<p>
Wherever things are not first past the post you can kick Democrats where
it hurts and beat them. And then, perhaps, one day, things will get
better.
</p>
<p>
Then again, here in Switzerland percentages go up and down here and
there and yet one feels that nothing really changes. It’s hard and
people aren’t as social I would prefer them to be.
</p>
<p>
I do like flowers and trees and birds and amphibians and bees and ants
and marine mammals and bison and many other things, though. The help me
through the dark times.

there’s nothing to be done, we just have to let this play out. Even if
Biden were to step aside, that would just open the convention and there
are lots of Democrats who would see this as their opportunity to be the
FDR or Lincoln of the 21st century. There would be no nominee until
after the convention, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad for the Democrats to
have everyone’s full attention for a few months. There will be lots of
polls, that’s for sure. In the meantime, I’m going to try to enjoy the

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I grew up on a ranch in West Texas. Horses, rodeo, and roping were my
life. I was going to be a horse trainer. Then, when my life took a left
turn in high school, I got much more serious about music, started
writing songs, and ended up pursuing a music degree at the University of
North Texas.
</p>
<p>
After college, I had a 3-year stint in Portland, Oregon, where I started
the band
<a href="https://alisonwilder.net/voodoo-economics-accept-no-imitations/">Voodoo
Economics</a>. My bandmates and I moved to Philly in 2004-ish, where I
wrote for, played in, and produced for Voodoo while completing a
Master’s in music theory at Temple University. After a few years of
adjunct teaching, I decided a PhD in music theory &amp; cognition at
McGill University in Montreal was the right move, so I went off to do
that. The timing was epically bad – this was the beginning of the end of
the humanities in North American universities, after all – and I
realized after about a year that it would be nearly impossible to get a
job in a place where I actually wanted to live. So I packed up the piano
yet again and headed back to Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
Back in Philly, I co-founded a music tech company with a super-cool and
interesting composer/pianist/technologist named Greg Wilder. After a
whirlwind couple of years in the depths of the music industry, we
decided to move away from daily ops with that company, and I was very
much at loose ends. I had never had any real marketable skills (don’t
try to tell me songwriting and music theory are marketable!), and I had
no idea what to do. So I asked Greg, <em>“What should I do?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Learn Linux,”</em> he said.
</p>
<p>
So I wiped my laptop, installed Debian, and was off to the races. Then I
said, <em>“but what should I do with Linux?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Maybe WordPress?”</em> he said.
</p>
<p>
It was 2011, and the timing couldn’t have been better. I learned
WordPress, started faffing about in PHP, Javascript, and all the rest,
and somehow people started writing checks. Over the last 13 years, Greg
and I have turned my faffing about into a couple of real businesses
(<a href="https://punktdigital.com/">Punkt Digital</a> and
<a href="https://wickedgoodweb.com/">Wicked Good Web</a>). At some point
during all of that, we got married, moved to New Hampshire, divorced,
and stayed best friends.
</p>
<p>
Though I stopped music completely for about 7 years after the start-up
(relationship status: it’s complicated), I’ve spent the last 6 years or
so building my studio back up and pouring myself into songwriting and
producing again (<a href="https://blixbyrd.bandcamp.com/">Blix Byrd</a>
and <a href="https://doctorbody.bandcamp.com/">Doctor Body</a> with
Greg). Which brings us to today. Phew!
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve always loved writing. Some days, I harbor secret aspirations to be
a real writer. (Uh-oh, secret’s out…) So blogging just comes naturally.
I don’t think of my blog as part of a business, or as a way to promote
myself exactly. It’s more of a place that gives me an outlet to organize
my thoughts publicly.
</p>
<p>
I generally find myself writing about a combination of daily life,
music, my own creative process, and things I’m doing or making. I
haven’t used social media much (although I’ve been enjoying
<a href="https://io.waxandleather.com/@alisynthesis">Mastodon</a> for
the last year or two!), so I sometimes use my blog as my own personal
Insta-book feed. It’s fun to make a quick post of something I like
and/or find amusing, and I enjoy perusing my old posts occasionally. My
memory isn’t the greatest, so in the case of daily life posts, I often
wouldn’t remember the thing at all if I didn’t blog about it!
</p>
<p>
Because blogging is purely for my own fun and enjoyment, I don’t force
myself to keep any kind of posting schedule. I just post when I feel
like it. I go through phases where that’s weekly, monthly, or even less.
So if you’re looking for a consistent presence in your RSS feed, my blog
is probably not for you.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any blog posts from prior to my current website, although I
did have other blogs on Tumblr and early Squarespace over the years. It
looks like I started blogging on my own site in about 2014. See, told
you my memory was bad…I had to sign in to find out when my earliest
posts were!
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My blogging process probably doesn’t qualify as a process. More like, “I
just blog when I feel like it and say whatever I want to.” That said, I
do also write quite a bit privately, so maybe it would be interesting to
explore the difference between my public and private writing?
</p>
<p>
I’m generally an open book – the kind of person who will tell strangers
whatever they want to know about me. That said, I do write differently
on my blog than in my personal journals. Obviously, I edit a lot more on
the blog. I also tend to post the kinds of things that I think others
might find interesting, which means I don’t often post about my own
internal thoughts and feelings.
</p>
<p>
That said, I enjoy reading blogs where people get personal, so now I’m
wondering why I don’t do that! Perhaps a topic for a future blog post?
</p>
<p>
And to the second question: the above paragraphs illustrate how I get my
inspiration – navel gazing and over-thinking. ;)
</p>
<p>
For quick posts, I write directly in WordPress. For longer bits or
things that come out of my private journaling, I write in Markdown in
Obsidian. (Yes, I’m one of those obsessive Obsidian people.)
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a very aesthetically-minded person who is most satisfied when I feel
like I’m immersed in beautiful and creative objects. I’ve tried to craft
my home environment so that I feel inspired in every seat in the house.
Right now, I’m sitting on my back porch looking my gardens and typing on
my laptop. It’s May in New Hampshire, and you can almost hear the plants
growing.
</p>
<p>
I tend to write short bits on my laptop wherever I want to be sitting,
because my office/studio is a place I work seriously. That said, my
studio is beautiful, ergonomic, and has a powerful computer, so anything
that takes awhile or requires lots of research/editing/photo work, I’ll
tend to do there.
</p>
<p>
I don’t typically listen to music while I work, because my brain won’t
agree to keep it in the background. And if music can be in the
background, I probably don’t want to hear it at all. (Not a judgment
about wallpaper music, that’s just how it is for me.) So there’s lots of
silence at my house.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
Greg and I operate our own managed WordPress hosting platform (Digital
Ocean + Serverpilot) for our clients, so we also host all of our own
personal websites there. How convenient!
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I think about switching to a static site generator, and have
certainly enjoyed playing around with them and occasionally using them
for client projects, but since I know so much about WordPress, it’s
kinda my default.
</p>
<p>
We register all our domains at Namecheap, which has been rock solid over
the years.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t think so. If I weren’t a WordPress person for work, I would
probably use a static site generator and really enjoy that experience. I
could easily see using an Obsidian vault at my CMS, and in face, I
maintain a public-not-public recipe site where I do exactly that, using
Obsidian to write, and Jekyll to website.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
That’s a tough question since we run our own Digital Ocean servers. If I
were a client of ours, I would pay <span class="math inline">$486/year
for our managed hosting plan. But since I'm not, I don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog generates absolutely no revenue. I haven't tried, and I
doubt I will, because I prefer keeping my creative life separate from my
financial life. (Now that's a blog post topic! I'm surprised I haven't
written about that before. Who knows, maybe I have.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I don't see anything wrong with other people
monetizing their blog. More power to 'em! I don't regularly financially
support any bloggers, although I do tend to throw folks the occasional
bone when I enjoy their work for awhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a
href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/4QTNCKWFYW#fX4XAW0GJI4Z"&gt;link to
all the personal blogs I subscribe to&lt;/a&gt; in my RSS reader:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few quick blog recs: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotta plug &lt;a href="https://gregwilder.com"&gt;Greg
Wilder's blog&lt;/a&gt;, which is an awesome and regularly-updated
account of being a composer/pianist/synthesizer wizard/mountain
man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ruk.ca/"&gt;Peter Rukavina&lt;/a&gt; is a
writer, printer and developer on Prince Edward Island. I don't know him,
but I so enjoy his description of his life on his blog. He seems like a
wonderful person!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://rubenerd.com/"&gt;Ruben Schade&lt;/a&gt;
is an prolific blogger/developer who I also don't know, but whose
writing style and perspective I totally enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been obsessed with &lt;a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Strickland_(director)"&gt;Peter
Strickland&lt;/a&gt;'s films over the last few years. Berberian Sound
Studio and its soundtrack (by the super-cool band Broadcast) are
AMAZING. Check them out if your taste tends toward the weird and
wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More in weird electronic music: don't sleep on Mort Garson. He
may be dead, but &lt;a href="https://mortgarson.bandcamp.com/"&gt;he's
still on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like hearing over-educated musicians who used to be
married blathering about music, check out Greg's and my podcast, &lt;a
href="https://toomuchmusicpodcast.com"&gt;Too Much
Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>More Trollopean spoilers here.  One of Trollope’s more interesting
habits as a novelist is the tendency to create counterparts: a character
in one novel will mirror a character in another. The proper counterpart
of Lady Arabella in Doctor Thorne, whom I discussed in my previous post,
appears in the next Barsetshire novel, Framley Parsonage: I […]</p>

A compiler cannot catch all semantic errors. An infinite recursion is
often not caught by a compiler. Again, I argue for (in)completeness
reasons: it would, probably, be not that difficult to catch cases like
this one
</p>
<div class="gl-relative markdown-code-block js-markdown-code">
<pre data-sourcepos="2:1-7:3" class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight language-plaintext" v-pre="true"><code><span id="LC1" class="line" lang="plaintext">PROCEDURE P();</span>
<span id="LC2" class="line" lang="plaintext">BEGIN</span>
<span id="LC3" class="line" lang="plaintext">  P()</span>
<span id="LC4" class="line" lang="plaintext">END P;</span></code></pre>
<p><copy-code></copy-code></p>
</div>
<p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:153" dir="auto">
but it already becomes more difficult when the error is not that obvious
any more like in the following wrong attempt to implement the factorial
function
</p>
<div class="gl-relative markdown-code-block js-markdown-code">
<pre data-sourcepos="9:1-16:3" class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight language-plaintext" v-pre="true"><code><span id="LC1" class="line" lang="plaintext">PROCEDURE F(i: INTEGER): INTEGER;</span>

<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:252" dir="auto">
So, for the time being, I don't know how to handle this. The compiler
would need to do much more sophisticated things than it is currently
doing in order to detect a lot of infinite recursion cases (and it would
never be guaranteed to catch all cases).

The example I made was pretty artificial and I don't think it is a good
idea to mark errors (only) for very special situations. If at all, we
might issue a warning when a local variable is returned by reference
because this is a case that can easily happen. But, to be honest, I am
not that happy with this kind of incomplete solution either. The concept
of return by reference is inherently dangerous and we will have to live
with it or get rid of the concept altogether. I prefer the former
because I cannot stand having getters and setters all over the place
when an assignment operator shall be overloaded – here I prefer the C++
way over the Java way. (Niklaus Wirth would not have admitted a return
by reference in the first place).

id="windows-10-will-be-covered-by-0patch-a-third-party-paid-patching-service">Windows
10 will be covered by 0patch, a third-party paid patching service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>So I learned something new today: there are companies that provide
security patches for Windows that aren’t Microsoft. I never even
considered this could be a thing, but it turns out that a paid service
called 0patch seems to have been around for a long time, and the
consensus seems to be that not only can it be trusted, it also sometimes
provides patches sooner than Microsoft does. Today, 0patch announced
it’ll also be providing this service for Windows 10 after the end of
support next year. With October 2025, 0patch will “security-adopt”
Windows 10 v22H2, and provide critical security patches for it for at
least 5 more years – even longer if there’s demand on the market. We’re
the only provider of unofficial security patches for Windows (“virtual
patches” are not really patches), and we have done this many times
before: after security-adopting Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 in
January 2020, we took care of 6 versions of Windows 10 as their official
support ended, security-adopted Windows 11 v21H2 to keep users who got
stuck there secure, took care of Windows Server 2012 in October 2023 and
adopted two popular Office versions – 2010 and 2013 – when they got
abandoned by Microsoft. We’re still providing security patches for all
of these. ↫ Mitja Kolsek on the 0patch blog This service implements
patching through what it calls “micropatches”, which are very small sets
of CPU instructions injected into running code in memory without
modifying – in this case – Microsoft’s own code. These micropatches are
applied by briefly stopping the offending program, injecting the fix,
and continuing the program – without having to close the program or
reboot. Of course, they can be unapplied in the same, non-disruptive
way. The 0patch service will provide patches for 0days that Microsoft
hasn’t fixed yet, patches for issues Microsoft won’t fix, and sometimes
patches for third party code. As the headline clearly states, this
service isn’t free, but honestly, at roughly 25 dollars plus tax per
computer per year, it’s not exactly expensive, and definitely cheaper
than Microsoft’s own Windows 10 Extended Security Update program it’s
going to offer for Windows 10 after the end of support date next year.
Diving a bit deeper into who is providing this service, it comes from a
company called ACROS Security, a small company out of Slovenia. The
company details its micropatches on its 0patch blog if you want more
information on how each individual ones works. I still don’t know
exactly what to make of this, and I definitely wouldn’t rely on
something like this for mission-critical Windows computers or servers,
but for something like a home PC that can’t be upgraded to Windows 11
but still works just fine, or perhaps some disposable virtual machines
you’re using, this might be a good stopgap solution until you can
upgrade to a better operating system, like Linux or one of the BSDs. Are
there any people in the OSNews audience who’ve used 0patch, or perhaps a
service similar to it?</p>

<h2 id="fixing-kwins-performance-on-old-hardware">Fixing KWin’s
performance on old hardware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>KWin had a very long standing bug report about bad performance of the
Wayland session on older Intel integrated graphics. There have been many
investigations into what’s causing this, with a lot of more specific
performance issues being found and fixed, but none of them managed to
fully fix the issue… until now. ↫ Xaver Hugl An excellent deep dive into
a very annoying problem KWin on Wayland running on older Intel hardware
was facing. It turns out the issue was related to display timings, and
older Intel hardware simply not being powerful enough to render frames
within the timing window. The solution consisted of a various smaller
solutions, and one bigger one: triple-buffering. The end result is a
massive performance improvement for KWin on Wayland on older Intel
hardware. This detailed post underlines just how difficult it is to
simply render a bunch of windows and UI elements on time, without
stutters or tearing, while taking into account the wide variety of
hardware a project like KDE Plasma intends to run on. It’s great to see
them paying attention to the older, less powerful systems too, instead
of only focusing on the latest and greatest like Apple, and recently
Microsoft as well, do.</p>

<h2 id="the-subscription-problem">The subscription problem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I did a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/26.html#a225814">podcast</a> in my
new <a href="https://this.how/scriptingNewsPodcast/">podcast-only
feed</a> that explained how RSS had its moment between 2002 and 2006.
The big event in 2002 was support from the NY Times, and in 2006 it was
the advent of Twitter.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="https://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/02/09/how-the-ny-times-came-to-support-rss/">NY
Times support</a> gave us the news flow of one of the greatest and most
respected news orgs. The entire news publishing industry followed, with
incredible speed. It was an amazing time. Woodstock on the web. Everyone
who was anyone was there.
</li>
<li>
Inbetween, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> got
the rep of being too hard for average people. The <i>only</i> reason for
this deserved reputation is that subscription was a mess. Every website
had to figure it out for themselves, and every feed reader acted as if
they were the only feed reader in the world. RSS, which could have been
the foundation of something very much like Twitter, never got out the
corner of the market where it was totally adored, by people who were
motivated enough to tolerate the awful state of subscribing.
</li>
<li>
This was not in any way an insolvable problem. But it required something
that the developers of the open web weren’t able to do, work together.
The W3C and IETF were busy trying to replace RSS, they were offended
that it had been developed independently, even though their pitch for
XML was that you could develop your own formats. It seemed they didn’t
believe their own hype? So not only did they not do do anything to help,
they actively worked to undermine the success of RSS. That didn’t work,
fortunately.
</li>
<li>
By the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google
Reader</a> came along in 2005, it was too late for cooperation. Google
dominated, and they didn’t want to do anything to build an open news
ecosystem.
</li>
<li>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/27/followButton.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">When
Twitter arrived in 2006, it had control of every aspect of user
interface in their corporate platform, and were thus able to completely
solve the subscription problem. Every feed had a button that said
Follow. Click the button and you were following that feed. The button
changed to Unfollow. That is was whole user interface right there. So
easy anyone could use it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This story must sound familliar, in 2024 – because it’s all happening
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/468991-all-of-this-has-happened-before-and-it-will-all">again</a>.
This time it’s Facebook playing the role of Twitter, and Mastodon
playing the role of RSS. And Mastodon has gotten a deserved reputation
as being only for techie types. And the solution in 2024 is the same as
it was in 2002 – working together to make subscription easy. A one-click
Follow button that works. One button for site-makers to put on their
pages. And users leaning back and clicking away without a care in the
world (at least about the software).
</p>
<p>
The

or not you want to solve this problem for the fediverse. It can include
non-ActivityPub systems btw, like Bluesky and even feed readers! We can
all share the same subscription protocol. But it cannot be distributed.
It must be centralized.

It seems to me that this particular problem can be solved if the
compiler marks the formal parameter, which is (possibly) returned by
reference, and checks the actual parameter when calling the procedure.
This will not solve all problems with returning by reference, but it
will eliminate a significant number of errors.

2024-06-27 Keep your own archives
</h1>
<p>
In these days of copyright maximalism I often think of all the fragments
by ancient authors that we only know because they were quoted
extensively by others.
</p>
<p>
We should not expect the web to stay up, the links to stay fresh, the
posts to remain available. No, it’s entropy all the way: technology
comes and goes, servers come and go, pages are written and get deleted,
people are born and die, and everything they ever built is pulled down
as capitalism keeps eating us and our works.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my wish: link if you can but quote extensively and fight
copyright maximalism. Save our culture! Some of our works might survive
into the far future and the quotes they bear are the life boats of our
thoughts.
</p>
<p>
I still need to get into the habit of archiving web posts I like. I’m
very unhappy about that. I started saving all the PDFs I liked, read,
skimmed or intended to read, just in case I need find them again. It’s a
start, but not enough.
</p>
<p>
It hurts my brain that Sophocles was so prolific, so famous, so beloved
– and we got seven plays out of a hundred and twenty. 😭 And that’s one
of the authors with complete plays available. All pre-Socratic
philosophy relies on testimonia. 😭 😭

This message is brought to you not only by the film studios cancelling
shows they already produced in order to save on taxes, nor by studios
dumping TV archives, nor by search engines letting the USENET archive
deteriorate, nor by the copyright owners eager to prey on any that would
restore old movies that are rotting away due to age, hoping to leech any
value somebody else might create, nor by thoughts of a generation of
people entrusting their culture to the Internet where companies fail and
servers die and nothing of value survives the coming apocalypse.
No. It’s because the artifacts of our lives and our culture are no
longer made of clay and stone to last for a thousand years, nor paper or
wood to last for centuries, and we’ve handed them over to corporations
that don’t care. All they care for is profit.
</p>
<p>
We need to take back what we can.

<p>
We need to keep our own archives.

I don't see the problem. The assignment operator

<h2 id="ads-hypocrisy">Ads hypocrisy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was browsing the web—like I often do—and I stumbled on a message on a website that read:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you’re reading this, you blocked our ad. That’s cool, we block ads
too. This site is free though, so maybe unblock the ad so we can keep
paying for this website that you’re on, thanks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This message rubbed me in the wrong way for a variety of reasons. First,
the hypocrisy of its content is annoying: we do something to others but
you should not do the same to us. Isn’t the whole <em>“Don’t do unto
others what you don’t want done unto you.”</em> common wisdom at this
point? Second, the <em>“This site is free though”</em> is a shitty
attempt to justify having ads served by an AD network because that’s
literally what every goddamn site out there does. Facebook is free.
Should I allow the tracking because of it? And lastly, the <em>“so we
can keep paying for this website”</em> is a desperate attempt to guilt
trip me into disabling my adblocker. I know very well how much running a
site like that costs. And I know for a fact the people behind that site
all have daily jobs. And so they can easily afford to pay for this site
exactly like countless others are paying for theirs.
</p>
<p>
The discourse around advertising on the web is messy. And the
pervasiveness of ads doesn’t help. You can just see how advertising
manages to find its way into almost everything. But if you’re a creator
of any kind it’s important to recognise the hypocrisy in some of the
arguments that are floating out there. The most glaring example is
YouTube. People often argue that by watching YouTube with adblockers I’m
stealing revenues from creators. Fair. The proposed solution is to pay
for YouTube Premium. Again, fair. My question is: are creators going to
upload YT Premium exclusive versions of the videos without their
sponsors’ ad reads baked in? The answer is no because that’s where the
vast majority of the revenues come from for them. And that’s another
example of the hypocrisy that’s powering this entire business model.
</p>
<p>
I don’t hate the general concept of an AD. I think sponsorships and
partnerships can be a net benefit if done correctly, especially when
done without tracking and profiling. If you run a site that’s focused on
a niche, the profiling is implicit. For example, the people who visit
minimalissimo.com probably have an interest in design and architecture
otherwise they wouldn’t waste their time on that site. And so if I were
to do some sort of partnership it would make sense to work with
companies that make products within those niches. That’s how “good”
advertising should work on the web. And that’s how it used to be before
hyper-targeting was a thing. Mind you, it’s still an option and plenty
of people do do it. It pays less than targeting advertising, for obvious
reasons. But creators need to do their part if we hope to make progress
on this front. Because the future can’t be targeted advertising
everywhere at anytime.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to disable my adblocker for you. I’m running two at the
same time precisely because I don’t give a fuck about your stupid
targeted ad. But if you give me an option to donate something to you
directly I’m gonna do it. Because I believe contributing directly is the
most sane way to keep this whole boat afloat.

<h2>
Upgrading to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2
</h2>
<p>
To upgrade to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2 from an earlier version of
PostgreSQL, you will need to use a strategy similar to upgrading between
major versions of PostgreSQL (e.g. <code>pg_upgrade</code> or
<code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code>). For more information,
please visit the documentation section on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/upgrading.html">upgrading</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Changes Since Beta 1
</h2>
<p>
Fixes and changes in PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Correctly enforce the default behavior of the <code>ON EMPTY</code>
clause when it’s not present in a SQL/JSON query.
</li>
<li>
Fixed issue with <code>pg_logical_slot_get_changes</code> related to
resource ownership.
</li>
<li>
Several fixes around the new data structure for vacuum-related data.

<h2>
Testing for Bugs &amp; Compatibility
</h2>
<p>
The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the
community, to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing
tools in order to find bugs and regressions before the general
availability of PostgreSQL 17. As this is a Beta, minor changes to
database behaviors, feature details, and APIs are still possible. Your
feedback and testing will help determine the final tweaks on the new
features, so please test in the near future. The quality of user testing
helps determine when we can make a final release.
</p>
<p>
A list of

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-metadata-matching">The anatomy of metadata
matching</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-matching-101-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it/">previous
blog post</a> about metadata matching, we discussed what it is and why
we need it (tl;dr: to discover more relationships within the scholarly
record). Here, we will describe some basic matching-related terminology
and the components of a matching process. We will also pose some typical
product questions to consider when developing or integrating matching
solutions.
</p>
<h2 id="basic-terminology">
Basic terminology
</h2>
<p>
Metadata matching is a high-level concept, with many different problems
falling into this category. Indeed, no matter how much we like to focus
on the similarities between different forms of matching, matching
affiliation strings to ROR IDs or matching preprints to journal papers
are still different in several important ways. At Crossref and ROR, we
call these problems matching tasks.
</p>
<p>
Simply put, a <strong>matching task</strong> defines the kind or nature
of the matching. Examples of matching tasks are bibliographic reference
matching, affiliation matching, grant matching, or preprint matching.
</p>
<p>
Every matching task has an input, which is all the data that is needed
to perform the matching. Input data can come in many shapes and forms,
depending on the matching task. For example, all of the following could
be inputs to a matching task:
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;fr:program xmlns:fr=&#34;http://www.crossref.org/fundref.xsd&#34; name=&#34;fundref&#34;&gt;

&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;funder_identifier&#34;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;award_number&#34;&gt;721624&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:program&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{

]
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Every matching task also has an <strong>output</strong>. For our
purposes, this is almost exclusively zero or more matched identifiers.
In the context of a specific matching task, output identifiers may be of
a specific type (e.g. we might match to a ROR ID, and never to an ORCID
ID). In some cases, there can be a certain target set as well
(i.e. matching only to DataCite DOIs). The output identifiers can have
different
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality" target="_blank">cardinality</a>
depending on the task, meaning that the matching task might allow for
zero, one, or more identifiers as a result of matching to a single
input.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>matching strategy</strong> defines how the matching is done.
Multiple strategies can exist for a specific matching task. Compound
strategies can run other strategies and combine their outcomes into a
single result.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, we may also want the matching strategy to output a
confidence score for each matched identifier. A confidence score
represents the degree of certainty or likelihood that the matched
identifier is correct, typically expressed as a value between 0 and 1.
This score may help with post-processing or further interpretation of
the results.
</p>
<p>
To summarise, the anatomy of the matching task can be diagrammed as
follows:

<h2 id="how-to-specify-a-matching-task">
How to specify a matching task
</h2>
<p>
Whenever we plan the development or integration of a matching solution,
it is good to begin by answering a few basic questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What problem do we plan to solve with our matching task? What would we
call our matching task and how would we describe it?
</li>
<li>
What do we expect as the input for this matching task? Which input
formats do we need to be able to accept? What information do we expect
to find in this input?
</li>
<li>
What kind of identifiers should be output? Is there a target set of
identifiers? Can our matching output zero/one/or multiple identifiers,
and under what conditions might that occur?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These sound fairly simple, but the answers to these questions can be
remarkably complex. Once one tries to apply these concepts to real-world
problems, they might encounter several non-obvious challenges.
</p>
<p>
For example, one common concern is at what level we should define each
matching task. Consider the following problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Matching bibliographic reference strings to DOIs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Matching structured bibliographic reference to DOIs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
volume: &#34;208&#34;,
author: &#34;Everitt&#34;,
journal-title: &#34;J. Comput. Appl. Math.&#34;,
article-title: &#34;The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform&#34;,
first-page: &#34;3&#34;,
year: &#34;2007&#34;,
issue: &#34;1&#34;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Are those discrete matching tasks (<em>unstructured reference
matching</em> vs. <em>structured reference matching</em>), or are they
the same task (<em>reference matching</em>) that can accept different
types of inputs (unstructured or structured)?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, let’s compare the following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Matching affiliation strings to ROR IDs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Matching funder names to ROR IDs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation
</code></pre>
<p>
Are these different matching tasks (<em>affiliation matching</em>
vs. <em>funder matching</em>), or the same task with different inputs
(<em>organisation matching</em>)?
</p>
<p>
Defining the boundaries of a matching task can also be difficult.
Consider, for example, the need to obtain ROR IDs for organisations
mentioned in the acknowledgements section of a full-text academic paper.
To begin, one may first extract the acknowledgement section from the
full text, then run something like a named entity recognition (NER) tool
to isolate the organisation names from the extracted text, and finally
match these names to ROR IDs. Is this entire process matching, with the
input being the full text of a paper? Or perhaps matching starts with
the acknowledgement section as the input? Instead, is it only the last
phase, where we try to match the extracted name to the ROR ID, that
constitutes the matching task, with the extraction phases being
completely separate processes?
</p>
<p>
There are also important questions related to the expected behaviour of
a matching strategy. Consider, for example, developing an affiliation
matching strategy where we define our input as “an affiliation string”.
What should happen when the strategy gets something else on the input,
for example, song lyrics? Perhaps the strategy should simply return no
matches, or an error, or we could say that in such a situation the
behaviour is undefined and it simply doesn’t matter what is returned.
But what should happen if in this input we have the lyrics of
<a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roxymusic/streetlife.html" target="_blank">Street
Life by Roxy Music</a>, a song that mentions the names of a few
universities that happen to have ROR IDs?
</p>
<p>
It is likewise important to consider what should happen if different
parts of the input match to different identifiers, like in the following
example:
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Haematology, Eastern Health and Monash University, Box Hill, Australia
</code></pre>
<p>
Here, “Eastern Health” matches to
<a href="https://ror.org/00vyyx863" target="_blank">https://ror.org/00vyyx863</a>
and “Monash University” to
<a href="https://ror.org/02bfwt286" target="_blank">https://ror.org/02bfwt286</a>.
Should the matching strategy return all the identifiers, one of them (if
so, which one?), or nothing at all?
</p>
<p>
Similar questions arise when it is possible to match to multiple
versions (or duplicates) in the target identifier set. This can happen,
for example, in the context of bibliographic reference matching or
preprint matching. Multiple matches may occur when there are different
editions, reprints, or variations of the same publication in the target
dataset, each with its own unique identifier.
</p>
<p>
If you are waiting for an answer to these questions, we unfortunately
must disappoint you here. These can only be answered in the context of a
specific problem, considering who the users are and what it is they need
and expect.
</p>
<p>
Did you notice any other subtleties related to metadata matching and its
concerns? Are there other non-obvious questions that should be
considered when planning to develop or integrate metadata matching
strategies? Let us know—we’d love to hear from you!

<h2 id="mozilla-integrating-ai-chatbots-into-firefox">Mozilla
integrating AI chatbots into Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla has announced it’s adding easy access to tool like ChatGPT,
Gemini, and so to Firefox. Whether it’s a local or a cloud-based model,
if you want to use AI, we think you should have the freedom to use (or
not use) the tools that best suit your needs. With that in mind, this
week, we will launch an opt-in experiment offering access to preferred
AI services in Nightly for improved productivity as you browse. Instead
of juggling between tabs or apps for assistance, those who have opted-in
will have the option to access their preferred AI service from the
Firefox sidebar to summarize information, simplify language, or test
their knowledge, all without leaving their current web page.  Our
initial offering will include ChatGPT, Google Gemini, HuggingChat, and
Le Chat Mistral, but we will continue adding AI services that meet our
standards for quality and user experience. ↫ Ian Carmichael My biggest
worry is not so much Mozilla adding these tools to Firefox – other
browsers are doing it, and people clearly want to use them, so it makes
sense for Firefox, too, to integrate them into the browser. No, my
biggest worry is that this is just the first step on the way to the next
major revenue agreement – just as Google is paying Mozilla to be the
default search engine in Firefox, what if OpenAI starts paying to be the
default AI tool in Firefox? Once that happens, I’m afraid a lot of the
verbiage around choice and the ability to easily disable it all is going
to change. I’m still incredibly annoyed by the fact I have to dive into
about:config just to properly remove Pocket, a service I do not use, do
not want, and annoys me by taking up space in my UI. I’m afraid that one
or two years from now, AI integration will be just another complex set
of strings I need to look for in about:config to truly disable it all.
It definitely feels like Firefox is only going to get worse from here on
out, not better, and this AI stuff seems more like an invitation for a
revenue agreement than something well thought-out and useful. We’ll see
where things go from here, but my worries about Firefox’ future are only
growing stronger with Mozilla’s latest moves. As a Linux user, this
makes me worried.</p>

2024-06-22 Lieu for niche search
</h1>
<p>
“Let me google it for you” was a bad reply back in the days; these days
telling somebody “to google something” is insulting because we all know
how aggravating it is to spend time and energy against privacy invasions
and sifting through the AI slop and the grifters. Life is short and
there’s no time for this.
</p>
<p>
I try to err on the side of caution and always add links to stuff if I
can. I’m preparing for the total breakdown of search as we know it.
</p>
<p>
Some days Internet search feels like we’re at the capitalist optimum
where everything is as painful as possible but not prohibitive. Can’t
live without it (to find those link farms, advice sites, public
archives) but also can’t find the private websites and blogs.
</p>
<p>
Is it true that Reddit managed to replace all the blogs or is it true
that we just can’t find them any more. The real problem is the loss of
trust all around.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@vesto" title="@vesto@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="vesto">@vesto</span></a> reminded me that
there was a solution in “the realm of curating human-scale websites”:
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a>.
</p>
<p>
And indeed, it looks like a great starting place!
</p>
<p>
I’m thinking that perhaps I can somehow use blog planets as sources for
topic-specific search engines. I could use the blogs on
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a> to build an
Emacs search engine and the blogs of
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> to build an RPG
search engine.
</p>
<p>
It seems quite doable!
</p>
<p>
The ethics remain complicated, of course. Would I want search engine
developers to scrape my site? Usually I just notice them when their bots
misbehave so I’m pretty averse to the entire situation. The search
engine makers also being ad sellers and ads being a poison for our
society doesn’t help. The search engine makers being AI fans and AI
energy and water requirements being cited as the reasons to keep fossil
power plants running and to build nuclear power plants doesn’t help. AI
also resulting in me having to read texts that other people didn’t
bother to write adds injury to insult.
</p>
<p>
In any case… perhaps there is a way to have ethical search and not drown
in the AI slob: Hand curated websites (taken from the planets), no ads,
no income (and therefore necessarily small in scope).
</p>
<p>
I started experimenting. Using <code>webringSelector = "#sidebar li
a:nth-child(2) [href]"</code> in the <code>lieu.toml</code> file seemes
to get the links of RPG blogs, for example.
</p>
<p>
One thing I find disturbing is that lieu uses Colly to scrape the web
and <a href="https://github.com/gocolly/colly/issues/614">Colly ignores
robots.txt by default</a>. I managed to lock the crawler out of my site
in less than a second. Yikes!
</p>
<p>
And the sad part is that if I add <code>c.IgnoreRobotsTxt = false</code>
to the code, it seems to have no effect. Does anybody know more about
how to control this?
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a>
</p>
<p>
The following branches are probably temporary:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kensanata/lieu/tree/unix-domain-socket">unix-domain-socket</a>:
This can be used by systemd to start the server connected to a Unix
domain socket. Using a server like nginx or Apache as a front-end allows
them to communicate with the server via the Unix domain socket. In that
case, no port is required.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/kensanata/lieu/tree/robots-txt">robots-txt</a>:
This is where I try to enable <code>robots.txt</code> handling again –
but I’m failing at it.
</p>
<p>
Then again, perhaps the ethics of it all make it untenable for me – is
this really something I need? If it isn’t, perhaps I’d be better off
doing something else.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-06-26</strong>. Perhaps it’d be easier to search feeds.
People already publish feeds. The feeds already contain the content they
are willing to share. The feed is already limited to web pages and
doesn’t include web applications.

Oberon A2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, updated: 2024-06-26, from: Oberon A2 at CAS</p>
<p dir="auto">
Hi, I was curious about browsing some of the pre-2000s sources for A2,
particularly to see the history of the X11 interface
<a href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11">https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11</a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I tried using <code>git-svn</code> to pull the history from the ETH
hosted SVN server, but it doesn't appear to work unfortunately. I could
try again or take some pointers, but I don't want to blindly mash
against what's meant to be an archive. Maybe the SVN repo could be
dumped to an object storage service as a permanent download? In general
I think it would be illustrative to have a more complete history of the
source code, but I understand if that's not a priority of the faculty.
Thanks!

<h2 id="of-psion-and-symbian">Of Psion and Symbian</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>As cool as the organizer was, it was extremely limited in pretty much
every way. Psion had got many things right in the first go, as reviewers
were quick to admit, and that made iterating on the design somewhat
easy. The Organiser II CM released in 1986 was built on the Hitachi
HD6303X (Motorola 6803) clocked at 920kHz with 8K RAM and 32K ROM. The
screen was a much improved dot matrix LCD with two lines of sixteen
characters. This version also shipped with a little piezo beeper built
in, and an expansion slot on the top. The expansion slot could allow for
a wired power adapter, a serial cable, a bar code reader, a telephone
dialer, and even a USB port. Given the reputation of the first model for
ruggedness and the coverage of the same quality in the second model,
this particular model sold quite well to companies who needed handheld
computers for inventory and other purposes. The Organizer II XP launched
the same year, and this model had 32K RAM and a backlit screen while
otherwise being the same machine. Given that both of these models had
significantly more RAM than their predecessor, the programming
capabilities were greatly enhanced with a new language, OPL, which was
similar to BASIC. ↫ Bradford Morgan White The Psion Organiser II is the
very root of all mobile computing today. This may seem like hyperbole –
but trust me, it really is. I have an Organiser II LZ64 with a 32k
datapak (memory card), and while it may look like a calculator, this
little machine from 1986 already contains the very skeleton of the
graphical user interface Palm would eventually popularise, and the
iPhone and Android would take to extraordinary heights. Turn on an
Organiser II, and you’re greeted by a home screen with a grid of
applications (no icons, though, of course – just labels) with a selector
you moved around with the cursor keys. Hit the EXE key, and the
application would load up, ready to be used; hit the home button (the ON
key if my memory serves) and it would take you back to the home screen.
This basic paradigm, of a grid of applications as a home screen you
always return to, survives to this day, and is used by billions of
people on their Android and iOS devices, both smartphones and tablets.
People with little to no knowledge of the history of mobile computing –
or people spreading corporate propaganda – often seem to act as if the
release of the iPhone was the big bang of mobile computing, and that it
materialised out of thin air because Steve Jobs alone willed it into
existence. The reality is, though, that there is a direct line from the
early Psion devices, through to Palm OS, the iPhone, and later Android.
There were various dead end branches along the way, too, like the
Newton, like Symbian, like the original Windows PocketPC, and so on –
but that direct line from early Psion to that fancy Pixel 8 Pro or
whatever you have today is solidly visible to anyone without an agenda.
I love my Organiser II. It’s approaching 40 years old now, and it still
works without a single hitch. There’s barely a scratch on it, the
display is bright, the pixels are clear, the characteristic sliding
cover feels as solid today as it did when it rolled off the factory
line. This is where mobile computing began.</p>

<p>
One huge problem with VNC or remote desktop is how flaky it is if you
have limited bandwidth or an unstable connection, like on an airplane.
</p>
<p>
It takes forever to start a screen sharing session, and the airplane’s
flaky WiFi usually causes the session to lock up, meaning you can’t do
much at all.
</p>
<p>
Remote <em>terminal</em> access, just relaying text commands, is the
best solution for that problem. And sure, I have a VPN I could use with
SSH to get to my Pi, but

<h2 id="looking-ahead-to-30-years-of-freedos">Looking ahead to 30 years
of FreeDOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>In a few days, 29 June, FreeDOS will turn 30. This happens to make it
one of the oldest, continuously active open source projects in the
world, originally created because Jim Hall had heard Microsoft was going
to kill DOS when the upcoming Windows 95 was going to be released. After
seeing the excitement around Linux, he decided it an open source DOS
would be a valuable time investment. I still used DOS, and I didn’t want
to stop using DOS. And I looked at what Linux had achieved: people from
all over the world shared source code with each other to make this full
operating system that worked just like Unix. And I thought “If they can
do that with Linux, surely we can do the same thing with DOS.” I asked
around on a discussion board (called Usenet) if anyone had made an “open
source” DOS, and people said “No, but that’s a good idea .. and you
should do it.” So that’s why I announced on June 29, 1994, that I was
starting a new project to make an open source version of DOS that would
work just like regular DOS. ↫ Jim Hall For an open source implementation
of what was a dead end and now is a dead operating system, FreeDOS has
been remarkably successful. Not only are there countless people using
FreeDOS on retro hardware, it’s also a popular operating system for DOS
gaming and running old DOS applications in virtual machines. On top of
that, many motherboard makers and OEMs use FreeDOS to load firmware
update tools, and some of them even offered FreeDOS as the preinstalled
operating system when buying new hardware. With the ever-increasing
popularity of retrocomputing and gaming, FreeDOS clearly has a bright
future ahead of itself.</p>

sqlite-vec. Led by independent developer Alex Garcia, this project
brings vector search functionality to the beloved SQLite embedded
database. Alex has been working on this problem for a while, and we
think his latest approach will have a great impact by providing
application developers with a powerful new tool for building Local AI
applications.

charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling Teams</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary
view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its
communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular
productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office
365 and Microsoft 365. ↫ European Commission press release Chalk this
one up in the unsurprising column, too. Teams has infested Office, and
merely by being bundled it’s become a major competitor to Slack, even
though everyone who has to use it seems to absolutely despise Teams with
a shared passion rivaling only Americans’ disgust for US Congress. On a
mildly related note, I’m working with a friend to set up a Matrix server
specifically for OSNews users, so we can have a self-hosted, secure, and
encrypted space to hang out, continue conversations beyond the shelf
life of a news item, suggest interesting stories, point out spelling
mistakes, and so on. It’ll be invite-only at first, with preference
given to Patreons, active commenters, and other people I trust. We
intend to federate, so if everything goes according to plan, you can use
your existing Matrix username and account. I’ll keep y’all posted.</p>

image brightness was reduced, not just in terms of pixels but also the
creativity of the image. Of course it isn’t really creative. I know.

Finally I got something that I could live with that I liked but was
imperfect. I decided that since the motto of my blog is “It’s even worse

the philosophy, and we move onward. As they say, still diggin!

<p>As AI continues to advance at a rapid pace, developers are
increasingly turning to AI-driven development (AIDD) to build more
intelligent and adaptive applications. However, using natural language
prompts to describe complex behaviors to AI can be a real challenge.
While natural language is expressive, it lacks the structure and
efficiency needed to clearly communicate […]</p>

<h2 id="ubuntu-24.10-will-default-nvidia-users-to-wayland">Ubuntu 24.10
will default NVIDIA users to Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The transition to Wayland is nearing completion for most desktop
Linux users. The most popular desktop Linux distribution in the world,
Ubuntu, has made the call and is switching its NVIDIA users over to
Wayland by default in the upcoming release of Ubuntu 24.10. The
proprietary NVIDIA graphics driver has been the hold-out on Ubuntu in
sticking to the GNOME X.Org session out-of-the-box rather than Wayland
as has been the default for the past several releases when using other
GPUs/drivers. But for Ubuntu 24.10, the plan is to cross that threshold
for NVIDIA now that their official driver has much better Wayland
support and has matured into great shape. Particularly with the upcoming
NVIDIA R555 driver reaching stable very soon, the Wayland support is in
great shape with features like explicit sync ready to use. ↫ Michael
Larabel This is great news for the Linux desktop, as having such a
popular Linux distribution defaulting the users of the most popular
graphics card brand to X.org created a major holdout. None of this
obviously means that Wayland is perfect or that all use cases are
covered – accessibility is an important use case where tooling simply
hasn’t been optimised yet for Wayland, but work is underway – and for
those of us who prefer X.org for a variety of reasons, there are still
countless distributions offering it as a fallback or as the default
option.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-puts-repair-front-and-center">Microsoft puts repair
front and center</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems the success of the Framework laptops, as well the
community’s relentless focus on demanding repairable devices and he
ensuing legislation, are starting to have an impact. It wasn’t that long
ago that Microsoft’s Surface devices were effectively impossible to
repair, but with the brand new Snapdragon X Elite and Pro devices, the
company has made an impressive U-turn, according to iFixIt. Both the new
Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are exceptionally easy to repair, and
take cues from Framework’s hardware. Microsoft’s journey from the
unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our
teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair.
The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the
impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign
that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit. ↫
Shahram Mokhtari The new Surface devices contain several affordances to
make opening them up and repairing them easier. They take cues from
Framework in that inside screws and components are clearly labeled to
indicate what type they are and which parts they’re holding in place,
and there’s a QR code that leads to online repair guides, which were
available right away, instead of having to wait months to forever for
those to become accessible. The components are also not layered; in
other words,you don’t need to remove six components just to get to the
SSD, or whatever – some laptops require you to take out the entire
mainboard just to get access to the fans to clean them, which is
bananas. Microsoft technically doesn’t have to do any of this, so it’s
definitely praiseworthy that their hardware department is going the
extra kilometre to make this happen. The fact that even the Surface Pro,
a tablet, can be reasonably opened up and repaired is especially
welcome, since tablets are notoriously difficult to impossible to
repair.</p>

<h2 id="briefly-on-julian-assange">Briefly on Julian Assange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
So, Viv and I were in the car this morning when we heard about the
Assange plea deal.
</p>
<p>
Viv: omg, finally! I only hope he’ll now give up hacking 😔<br> Me: Hmm,
or maybe he should give up non-consensual sex. That’s where he went
wrong, isn’t it?<br> Viv: …true
</p>
<p>
I mean, fuck. I know this prosecution has been politically motivated,
purely to punish him for his role exposing Western war crimes. The
charges he’s accepted a plea deal over are the US “espionage” ones,
after all, not the Swedish sexual assault ones, which were dropped long
ago. And I don’t support politically-motivated prosecutions of people
who expose war crimes. But I’ve also never been comfortable with any
kind of personalised “I support Assange” sentiment, as if he were a
righteous martyr, rather than “I support exposing those who commit war
crimes”.
</p>
<p>
Back in my student activist days, I once got stuck doing a stall where
we were trying to get signatures on a petition calling for Assange’s
charges to be dropped (and this was back when they were the sexual
assault charges, not the espionage ones). The organiser of the stall
knew full well the attitude I was going to take to this, so he gave me a
stack of leaflets and told me to hand them out around Campus Centre. I
took the stack, went upstairs, dropped them all straight in the bin,
then chilled out in the cafeteria for an hour before reporting back. I
think he knew that’s what I was going to do, too, lol. I didn’t get
scolded for skipping out on nearly the whole stall, which I usually
would’ve been.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Assange is married now, so maybe he has straightened himself
out. I don’t know. I think it’s good there’s a resolution at last to the
political prosecution (although I would note, cynically, that so many
years have passed that the “deterrence” objective has already been
achieved, and the, uh, short-term memory of the political establishment
means no one cares what happened during the War on Terror any more,
anyway). But Assange himself is still an asshole.

<p>Microsoft has made OneDrive slightly more annoying for Windows 11
users. Quietly and without any announcement, the company changed Windows
11’s initial setup so that it could turn on the automatic folder backup
without asking for it. Now, those setting up a new Windows computer the
way Microsoft wants them to (in other words, connected to the internet
and signed into a Microsoft account) will get to their desktops with
OneDrive already syncing stuff from folders like Desktop Pictures,
Documents, Music, and Videos. Depending on how much is stored there, you
might end up with a desktop and other folders filled to the brim with
shortcuts to various stuff right after finishing a clean Windows
installation. ↫ Taras Buria at NeoWin Just further confirmation that
Windows 11 is not ready for the desktop.</p>

<h2 id="apple-first-company-to-be-found-violating-dma">Apple first
company to be found violating DMA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the European Commission has informed Apple of its preliminary
view that its App Store rules are in breach of the Digital Markets Act
(DMA), as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to
alternative channels for offers and content. In addition, the Commission
opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that
its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app
stores, including Apple’s new “Core Technology Fee”, fall short of
ensuring effective compliance with Apple’s obligations under the DMA. ↫
European Commission press release File this in the category for entirely
expected news that is the opposite of surprising. Apple has barely even
been maliciously compliant with the DMA, and the European Commission is
entirely right in pursuing the company for its continued violation of
the law. The DMA really isn’t a very complicated law, and the fact the
world’s most powerful and wealthiest corporation in the world can’t seem
to adapt its products to the privacy and competition laws here in the EU
is clearly just a bunch of grandstanding and whining. In fact, I find
that the European Commission is remarkably lenient and cooperative in
its dealings with the major technology giants in general, and Apple in
particular. They’ve been in talks with Apple for a long time now in
preparation for the DMA, the highest-ranking EU officials regularly
talked with Apple and Tim Cook, they’ve been given ample warnings,
instructions, and additional time to make sure their products do not
violate the law – as a European Union citizen, I can tell you no small
to medium business or individual EU citizen gets this kind of leniency
and silk gloves treatment. Everything Apple is reaping, it sowed all by
itself. As I posted on Mastodon a few days ago: The EU enacted a new law
a while ago that all bottle caps should remain attached to the bottle,
to combat plastic trash. All the bottle and packaging makers, from
massive multinationals like Coca Cola and fucking Nestlé to small local
producers invested in the development of new caps, changing their
production lines, and shipping the new caps. Today, a month before the
law goes into effect, it’s basically impossible to find a bottle without
an attached cap. I don’t know, I thought this story was weirdly relevant
right now with Apple being a whiny bitch. Imagine being worse than Coca
Cola and motherfucking Nestlé. ↫ Thom Holwerda Apple is in this mess and
facing insane fines as high as 10% of their worldwide turnover because
spoiled, rich, privileged brats like Tim Cook are not used to anyone
ever saying “no”. Silicon Valley has shown, time and time again, from
massive data collection for advertising purposes to scraping the entire
web for machine learning, that they simply do not understand consent.
Now that there’s finally someone big, strong, and powerful enough to not
take Silicon Valley’s bullshit, they start throwing tamper tantrums like
toddlers. Apple’s public attacks on the European Union – and their
instructions to their PR attack dogs to step it up a notch – are not
doing them any favours, either. The EU is, contrary to just about any
other government body in the Western world, ridiculously popular among
its citizens, and laws that curb the power of megacorps are even more
popular. I honestly have no idea who’s running their PR department,
because they’re doing a terrible job, at least here in the EU.</p>

<h2 id="ios-and-ipados-18-can-format-external-drives">iOS and iPadOS 18
can format external drives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I can’t believe this is considered something I need to write about,
but it’s still a very welcome new feature that surprisingly has taken
this long to become available: iOS and iPadOS 18 now allow you to format
external storage devices. Last year when I began testing iPadOS 17
betas, I noticed the addition of options for renaming and erasing
external drives in the Files app. I watched these options over the
course of the beta cycle for iPadOS 17 to see if any further changes
would come. The one I watched most closely was the “Erase” option for
external drives. This option uses the same glyph as the Erase option in
Disc Utility on macOS. In Disc Utility on the Mac, in order to reformat
an external drive, you first select the “Erase” option, and then
additional options appear for selecting the new format you wish to
reformat the drive with. When I saw the “Erase” option added in the
Files app on iPadOS, I suspected that Apple might be moving towards
adding these reformatting options into the Files app on iPadOS. And I’m
excited to confirm that this is exactly what Apple has done in iPadOS
18! ↫ Kaleb Cadle It was soon confirmed this feature is available in iOS
18 as well. You can only format in APFS, ExFAT and FAT, so it’s not
exactly a cornucopia of file systems to choose from, but it’s better
than nothing. This won’t magically fix all the issues a lot of people
have with especially iPadOS when it comes to feeling constrained when
using their expensive, powerful tablets with detachable keyboards, but
it takes away at least one tiny reason to keep a real computer around.
Baby steps, I guess.</p>

the same mistake, and of course until the real story is out, we can’t
learn from it. Let’s get it right on the Wikipedia page. It isn’t about
Guha or Libby, me, or whoever. It’s really about the power of Netscape
and the early web news publishing companies that supported RSS, and the
blogging systems that jumped on board (including my own products) and
then two years later, the NYT coming on board, followed by the entire
news industry. A bunch of nerds arguing on a mail list is <i>not</i> the
story. With the benefit of well over twenty years hindsight this should,
by now, be kind of obvious.</p>

2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty

<p>
I was listening in on an exchange between
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a>. They were
talking about <a href="Traveller">Traveller</a> and Peter noted that he
didn’t like the “somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests”.
I don’t like this, either! It’s exhausting. I feel drained when I do it.
</p>
<p>
I started thinking about this for a while and maybe the following
provides for an interesting way to talk about rules in role-playing
games.
</p>
<p>
Note that the problem shows up in many places. For example, I don’t like
“the ladder” in <a href="Fudge">Fudge</a> and <a href="Fate">Fate</a>
games where I as the referee need decide whether opponents are “good” or
“very good” at fighting the player characters. For me, this is the same
problem, except it happens behind the screen. Player’s don’t know about
this.
</p>
<p>
Using classic D&amp;D or similar rules and running a megadungeon is
comparatively easy, because the monster hit dice are tied to dungeon
levels. Once I know the dungeon level, I can pick appropriate monsters
and their stats automatically determine “the difficulty classes of some
tests.” This might be one of the reasons that makes it easier to run
D&amp;D with self-made dungeons.
</p>
<p>
So this is the first solution to the problem of having to assign
difficulties to rolls: The game can have a small number of actions that
require a dice roll. Each roll has clear conditions of success. The
referee doesn’t have to assess the difficulty as soon as the situation
is established. D&amp;D would be an example of this kind of game. You
roll to hit, to do damage, to save, and all the target numbers are known
once the monster is on the table. In classic D&amp;D, traps have only
one difficulty setting so thieves only need to know a single number.
Hidden doors are either concealed or secret. Those are the two difficult
settings for finding the hidden door and thus the referee only needs to
know two numbers (1-in-6 or 2-in-6). Of course it breaks down sometimes
when a module tells you that a particular door is harder to find
(“1-in-8”) or that a lock is harder to pick (“add 20% to the check”).
But generally speaking, as a referee, very little thought is required.
The trade-of is that characters don’t have many “skills”. They have
their attack rolls, their saves, the thieves skills, some other d6
abilities like opening doors and listening, but that’s it.
</p>
<p>
As soon as skills are introduced, the situations in which dice can be
rolled explodes. One way to solve the problem of having to decide the
difficulty of every single roll is to a provide a long list of examples
from which to extrapolate. I haven’t played any game that does that
well. Zweihänder provides seven example uses of the skill, one for each
difficulty rating. That is amazing.
</p>
<p>
A game that has a single roll for every skill (great idea) but then
provides a lot of help adjudicating the rolls in general isn’t helping.
I found this to be the case for the few Basic Role-Playing, Warhammer
Fantasy Roleplay, Rolemaster and HARP games I tried. I didn’t try many
of them. I just checked HARP again and there are examples for some of
the skills and not for others, so I’d have to play it again to remember
whether this was even a problem.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps one possible solution is to just ignore difficulties and to
assume all skill rolls at the default difficulty to be appropriate for
adventures. As far as I can remember, this is how we often played these
games.
</p>
<p>
Mongoose Traveller isn’t helping, either. There, the target number is
always an eight. Almost all the modifiers appear to obvious and well
explained, but with the Task Difficulty Dice Modifiers the “somewhat
mysterious difficulty classes of some tests” is back.
</p>
<p>
Classic Traveller is worse it leans into the referee making up the roll.
Sometimes an examples of a skill is provided (“navigation expertise can
be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed
information”) but most of the time it’s simply a description of where
the skill might be applicable and it’s up to the referee to call for an
appropriate throw, if at all. At the very beginning, skills are
explained as follows: “The acquired skills table provides four basic
types of results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength),
weapons expertise (such as blade combat), transport skills (such as
ATV), and basic skills (such as navigation).” That is to say, sometimes
the skill simply means that something can be done. The example that
comes to mind is how to recover from serious wounds: “Recovery is
dependent on medical attention (a medical facility and an individual
with medical-3 skill; recuperation to full strength without medical
attention is not possible).” The medic doesn’t have to roll at all.
Having the skill is all that counts.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to the last category: negotiation. This what I learned
from Burning Wheel: Before a roll is made, players declare what they
want and the referee determines the difficulty of the roll and explains
the consequences of failure. Then players decide whether they want to
make the roll. Implicitly, they can change their mind, declare a
different goal and see whether they like the odds and consequences
better. I like this a lot.
</p>
<p>
Of course, turning every skill roll into a negotiation can be tiresome.
If people remember what the previous result of similar negotiations was,
the system takes on aspects of case law. As soon as the people of the
table realize that a similar situation was resolved using this or that,
and there are no circumstances that warrant a change, then the
negotiation is skipped.
</p>
<p>
Then again, a long lists of conditions and modifiers can also take on
aspects of case law.
</p>
<p>
So perhaps this is what I think all these rules texts evolve into: Any
rule system where referees set the difficulty imply a system where
players can enter a short negotiation. In order to avoid future
negotiations, the table remembers the outcomes and uses them as
shortcuts for future situations.
</p>
<p>
Once you know this, the approach by some games to simply do a fixed
difficulty roll such as 50% rate of success makes sense if you assume
that there is some sort of negotiation and case law powering it all.
Sometimes the penalty of failure is scorn and insults, sometimes it’s
death. It depends on the situation but there’s always a way to negotiate
for the two outcomes that seem acceptable to the table.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t found a perfect solution, for me. I like it both ways. A game
like <a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberts &amp; Helmets</a> is much
like D&amp;D where as a game like <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> is one
where all effects outside of combat have to be negotiated but it’s not
as wild and free as Classic Traveller.

<h2 id="the-name-siddhartha">The Name ‘Siddhartha’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Since Vivian was a teenager, apparently, it’s been his long-held dream
to name a son Siddhartha and call him Sid for short, so as to honour
both his Hindu heritage <em>and</em> Syd Barrett, his rock ’n’ roll
idol. Pretty much as soon as Viv told me this dream, I poured cold water
on it. Honestly, I did not believe that “Siddhartha” was a name that
actual, real-life human beings are given. Vivian insisted it was, so
after a few years of back-and-forth, I finally deigned to search the
internet to see if I could find any actual, real-life human beings with
this name. The result was that every single “Siddhartha” I found was a
French speaker (of Indian heritage) – professionals living in cities
like Lyon, Geneva, Montreal… so of course I took this back to Vivian and
said all accusatorily, “You want to give our child a French name!”
</p>
<p>
This turns out to be a really good way to wind him up – I can say this,
because he’s compelled me to make the same argument repeatedly since –
because he starts whining, “Nooooo, it’s an Indian name!” and I tell him
that random LinkedIn profiles on the internet don’t lie, and our child
is not getting a French
name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
It’s really funny how worked up he gets about it. Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Now that we’re actually <em>having</em> a child, of course, we’re having
all these discussions again, even though we don’t know Baby’s sex yet.
“Sid” has been Viv’s pet name for the growing creature in my belly, and
I do often go along with it, although I also point out regularly that
that’s <em>never</em> going to be their actual name.
</p>
<p>
“That’s okay,” he jokes, “when you die in childbirth, there’ll be no one
to stop me putting whatever I want on the birth certificate.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha-ha,” I retort, “I hope you’re not gambling on those odds.”
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, we <em>have</em> started putting together an
<em>actual</em> shortlist, consisting of names that are Indian in
origin, but are either <em>also</em> English/Irish names <em>or</em>, at
least, don’t sound markedly foreign in English. This is what Viv said he
really liked about the whole “Siddhartha”/“Sid” thing, and I think
<em>that’s</em> a fair enough goal… just not the actual name
“Siddhartha”. Un­for­tun­ately, Viv’s next favourite name isn’t so much “an
Irish name” as “the Irish word for ‘bread’”, but we’ll get there.

<h2 id="mozilla-acquires-ad-analytics-company-for-some-reason">Mozilla
acquires ad analytics company, for some reason</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of my biggest concerns regarding the state of the web isn’t ads
(easily blocked) or machine learning (the legal system isn’t going to be
kind to that), but the possible demise of Firefox. I’ve long been
worried that with the seemingly never-ending downward marketshare spiral
Firefox is in – it’s at like 3% now on desktop, even less on mobile –
Mozilla’s pretty much sole source of income will eventually pull the
plug, leaving the already struggling browser effectively for dead. I’ve
continuously been warning that the first casualty of the downward spiral
would be Firefox on platforms other than Windows and macOS. So, what do
we make of Mozilla buying an online advertising analytics company?
Mozilla has acquired Anonym, a trailblazer in privacy-preserving digital
advertising. This strategic acquisition enables Mozilla to help raise
the bar for the advertising industry by ensuring user privacy while
delivering effective advertising solutions. ↫ Laura Chambers They way
Mozilla explains buying an advertising network is that the company wants
to be a trailblazer privacy-conscious online advertising, since the
current brand of online advertising, which relies on massive amounts of
data collection, is unsustainable. Anonym instead employs a number of
measures to ensure that privacy is guaranteed, from anonymous analytics
to employing differential privacy when it comes to algorithms, ensuring
data can’t be used to tack individual users. I have no reason to doubt
Mozilla’s intentions here – at least for now – but intentions change,
people in charge change, and circumstances change. Having an ad network
integrated into the Mozilla organisation will surely lead to temptations
of weakening Firefox’ privacy features and ad-blocking abilities, and
just overall I find it an odd acquisition target for something like
Mozilla, and antithetical to why most people use Firefox in the first
place. What really doesn’t help is who originally founded Anonym – two
former Facebook executives, backed by a load of venture capital. Do with
that little tidbit of information as you please.</p>

going to start a new podcast-only feed, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a">this
will be first episode</a>. 14 minutes. It tells the story of RSS as a
remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The
first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red
Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of
blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the
people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed
base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that
is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was
confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS
was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in
1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get
their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the <i>entire news
world supported RSS.</i> That’s the story. You can write all about who
did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly
remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained
its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough
foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn’t work with
each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where
it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We
should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course
until the real story is out there, we can’t learn from it. This is a
14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in
the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the
sites it points to. And if there’s interest I’ll happily talk about it
in a future podcast.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search&quot;&gt;Should I remove this blog from Google Search?&lt;/a&gt;” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s
obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies
don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a
server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We
could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual
users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of
us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t
gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are
only two options left:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because
that’s just the world we live in
</li>
<li>
Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our
content
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas’s post made me also think
about something else. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals
content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it
all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the
TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I
would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar,
radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding
investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew
it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return
any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously
not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?

while she’s feeling a bit ill under it all is a feeling of splendor and
the usual over the top cuteness! :-)</p>

Big Compute?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog</p>
<p>I don’t think it does. Not for everything. We already have personal
AI for autocomplete. Do we need Big Compute for a personal AI to tell us
which pieces within our Amazon orders are in which line items in our
Visa statements? (Different items in a shipment often appear inside
different charges on a card.) […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Status-Q blog</p>
<p>The tech news has had a lot of coverage recently of Microsoft’s
proposed ‘Recall‘ system, which (as a very rough approximation) takes a
screenshot of your display every five seconds, and uses their AI-type
Copilot system to allow you to search it. “What was that cafe or
restaurant that someone in the call recommended yesterday?”

<p>We’ve been away for the last week or so on the south coast of
Cornwall, and it was a great trip. We had our folding e-bikes inside the
van, and our little boat behind, which meant it wasn’t always the
easiest setup to take along narrow Cornish lanes, especially if we found
ourselves needing to

<h2 id="andrew-s.-tanenbaum-receives-acm-software-system-award">Andrew
S. Tanenbaum receives ACM Software System Award</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU
Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which
influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple
generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used
operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987
to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.
MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM
PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code,
and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file
system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source
software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for
Tanenbaum, and it’s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens
to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in
2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our
belt.</p>
