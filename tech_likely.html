<p>In an email to Doc this morning: “The web is such a huge total mess.
CSS is a junk pile of reinventing that learned nothing from the ideas it
was reinventing. The only reason we put up with this is the freedom we
got from it. But that’s been gone for a long time. I have a feeling
we’re wasting our golden years overlooking that we’re trying to get
creative work done in a corporate crime scene. We won, only to have our
victory enshrined by a bunch of corpy wiseasses and nazis.” Doc is a
very literate and quote-worthy writer, and me too, but we bring out the
best from each other. So next time you see Doc thank him for me, thanks
for the creativity. We’re making the best of a bad situation. It’s even
worse than it appears and old enough to know better.</p>

<p>I’ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just
been living my life :) Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and
left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job
at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful
people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who
hadn’t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more
than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good
job.</p>

<h2 id="me-and-fsd">Me and FSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Check out my
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html">political
preamble</a> on Tesla, X and Musk.
</p>
<p>
One more disclaimer: I love my Tesla Model Y. Best car ever. I’ve been
driving a Tesla since late 2021, and I still feel privileged to drive
the car every time I do. It’s the Macintosh of cars.
</p>
<p>
I don’t generally use
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>,
even though I paid for it and have had it available all the time I’ve
driven a Tesla.
</p>
<p>
They say you should always be fully attentive when using FSD. I am
always <i>soooo</i> ready to take over for it. I don’t trust it. And I
also don’t feel that when I’m in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-knuckle">white-knuckle</a>
mode when it’s driving, that my reflexes are anywhere near as good as
the reflexes I have when I’m driving, with fifty years of experience,
and maybe a few hours of experience supervising a FSD car. I don’t have
a sense of how to work with it. So I err on the side of turning it off
whenever I feel like even slightly scared.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
also don’t like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster">roller
coasters</a>, but if I did, I’d recognize that this is different. A
roller coaster is designed to give the exact same experience to every
user every time. It’s designed to give the impression that your life is
about to end, using gravity and eyesight and all that evolution trained
you to be scared of. It fools you into being scared, when you’re
actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a
rollercoaster. That probably improves the fun for thrill-seekers, and
gives people like me justification for staying away. People also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">bungee jump</a>
knowing there’s a chance the chord could break, but they know it’s not
going to.
</p>
<p>
None of that is true for the Tesla. It’s making it up as it goes along.
And it definitely encounters situations it can’t handle, or it
misinterprets a set of obvious facts, or even worse it hallucinates just
like ChatGPT.
</p>

Yesterday, I was

from Lake Katrine to Woodstock with FSD, and it was doing really well,
up to a point. First I was on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_28">Route

<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9972259,-74.1046808,3a,75y,343.4h,68.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srkTm7bYH3qW0CqLfUyT18w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">turned</a>
onto
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_375">375</a>
which is a curvy two-lane road. I was starting to feel slightly
comfortable. Then we come up to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_212">212</a>,
where 375 ends. A busy
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.0369198,-74.1109242,3a,75y,19.14h,83.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJbEh3c4hgugNZsCx4uUtZw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">intersection</a>.
Traffic coming from the left and right, and many are turning onto the
road I’m on. I watched in awe as FSD tried to find a way to make a left
turn in this complicated situation, starting, stopping, it tried, found
itself out in traffic, and got stuck there. I had enough and took over.
Luckily the car waiting behind us had left a little room. I’ve dealt
with this intersection probably a few hundred times in the last few
years. I know the crazy things the other drivers do here, and I know to
watch out for them. The Tesla didn’t know.

<p>
At the end of each MSNBC YouTube video right now they have a 30 second
post-roll of Ali Velshi explaining the 5-step process on how to install
the new MSNBC app.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Tap on the App Store on your phone
</li>
<li>
Hit “Search” on the bottom right corner
</li>
<li>
Type in “MSNBC”
</li>
<li>
Click on the MSNBC app
</li>
<li>
Click on “Get” or the cloud icon
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There’s an implied sixth step where you need to actually open the newly
installed app. Opening the app for the first time you swipe through a
little slideshow that has two more (optional) steps: give your email and
turn on notifications. Standard engagement economy tactics.
</p>
<p>
Hearing the 5-step native app install process a few times a day makes me
think we lost something along the way. Remember when the call to action
was to visit a URL? Not only is “Visit msnbc.com” more succinct,
catchier, private, less prone to user error, and immune to competitive
advertisements but it also doesn’t require a paid presenter to coach you
through it. Once upon a time users might have needed Ali Velshi’s help
getting to a website, but in my experience visiting a website is one of
the first computing skills my kids learned without my direct
involvement. The URL isn’t a foreign concept anymore.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m making a mountain out of a “We just want to promote our new
app, maaan” molehill here, but even saying “Visit msnbc.com/mobile” with
a redirect to their
<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/information/msnbc-info/download-msnbc-app-n1241692">actual
app download page</a> would be easier. It boggles my mind why you’d push
a clunky app store install flow over a five-letter domain name. I’d even
bet $5 that the “native app” is actually a bunch of web views in a
trench coat. In an even wilder twist, that app download page isn’t
linked anywhere on the website! Ughck. I’m 0% invested on what’s
happening over at MSNBC but I’m already getting whiffs of misaligned
goals, interdepartmental strife, and poorly designed content management
systems.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, websites. They’re old tech but still work great from time to
time.

id="eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-mobile-browsers-gain-market-share">EU’s
new tech laws are working; small mobile browsers gain market share</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a
spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet’s
Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to
rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies. The
early results come after the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act, which
aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big
tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list
of available web browsers from a “choice screen.” ↫ Supantha Mukherjee
and Foo Yun Chee I can’t believe this is even remotely surprising. A lot
of especially Apple fans and people from outside of the European Union
complained left, right, and centre about the choice screen and how it
was ugly, unnecessary, and would just confuse users. These are
interesting claims, considering the fact that setting up a modern
smartphone such as the iPhone takes the user through 40-50 setup screens
chockful of confusing choices to make, so adding one more surely
wouldn’t make a difference. Of course giving users the option to choose
a different default browser would lead to an increase in browsers other
than Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android) being set as the default. I’m
pretty sure quite a few users learned, through the choice screen, for
the first time, that there even are different browsers to choose from,
and that some of those might offer features and benefits they didn’t
even know they could enjoy. That’s the whole point of this endeavour:
informing users that they have a choice, something Apple, Google, and
others would rather you either do not have, or at least not know about.
It’s far too early to tell if these spikes are a one-off thing, or if
the rise in browsers other than Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android is
more structural. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the latter, and even if
the numbers remain in the single digits or low double digits, it will
still lead to an increase in competition, and a more vibrant mobile
browser market. Good news, regardless.</p>

id="microsoft-details-new-features-coming-in-windows-server-2025">Microsoft
details new features coming in Windows Server 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft recently held a streaming event in which it detailed a lot
of the new features and changes coming in Windows server 2025, and has
now followed that up with a blog post, as well. There’s a lot to go over
here, and I’m anything but a Windows Server specialist, so I’ll
highlight some of the thing I’m certain will be welcomed by Windows
Server administrators. First and foremost, the biggest improvement:
hot-patching. Security updates can be installed without having to
reboot, because Server 2025 will modify code in memory without
restarting the processes in question. Quarterly updates, however, will
still require reboots. Hot-patching will be free on all versions of
Server 2025. Microsoft also promises a massive performance boost for
NVMe drives – the company claims a 70% improvement going from Server
2022 to Server 2025. Microsoft’s other file system, ReFS, is also seeing
improvements, and Storage Replica’s compression will be available in all
editions of Windows Server 2025. A major improvement in Hyper-V is the
ability to partition GPUs, so you can use one GPU to power multiple
virtual machines. As far as licensing goes, the most important news here
is that you’ll still be able to buy a normal, regular, run-of-the-mill
perpetual license for Windows Server 2025, so even though there’s

<p>
I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/3xsz1Xj">a 40 pound weighted vest for
$40 dollars on Amazon</a>. The workout term for this is “rucking” and
has connotations with being outdoorsy and/or in the military. Load up a
backpack full of weights (or in my case, a vest full of sand bags) and
head outdoors. The
<a href="https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking">marketing
benefits</a> of rucking sound great:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is simple and anyone can do it
</li>
<li>
Gets you outside
</li>
<li>
Active Resistance Training™️
</li>
<li>
Burns up to 3x more calories than walking
</li>
<li>
Good for your back and improves your posture
</li>
<li>
Good for your mental health
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A neighbor friend of mine (that’s also a physical therapist) has one and
she recommended it. My body is adept at carrying heavy
objects<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
so this seems like an easy way to squeeze out some gains from my regular
walks. Bonus points that it gets me outside and gets rid of my developer
hunch. After a handful of walks, I’m enjoying the vest and –as expected–
my body handles the weight fine but it’s sweatier and hills knock the
wind out of me a bit more.
</p>
<p>
There’s an army fetish around rucking. It’s hard to tell if that’s
fragile male ego in workout culture or if it’s because an armored plate
carrier is a well-tested and efficient way to carry weight. My vest
doesn’t look that masculine and looks more like I duct taped C4 to my
chest. With my uni-bomber glasses, long hair, beard, and resting scowl I
don’t need more help looking like a disgruntled domestic terrorist but I
suppose this completes the look. If I can sustain
<a href="/2021/06/two-options/">the $40 fix</a>, then I’ll upgrade to
the $200 plate vest solution.
</p>
<p>
The cynical side of me wonders if this is more skinny people shit. As I
dawn the weighted vest, the irony is not lost on me I used to be about
the same amount of weight heavier. Being heavy never helped me lose
weight. No one gives you an approving head nod for walking while fat,
but velcro a little vest to your torso and people give you the “good for
you” pity eyes.
</p>
<p>
Putting my optimist hat back on,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po4adxJxqZk">it might work this
time</a>. Maybe this is the one weird trick my body needs to activate
dormant caveman genetics that will unleash my inner Adonis. Walking in
hard mode seems sustainable for the time-being and I can already feel my
ass morphing into a perfect badonkadonk.

<p>
The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey – our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />

There are still plenty of colourful fish.

Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical

We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don’t know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It’s easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.

id="why-does-part-of-the-windows-98-setup-program-look-older-than-the-rest">“Why
does part of the Windows 98 Setup program look older than the
rest?”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this is something I never knew. Over on the retrocomputing
section of StackExchange, someone asked why the second phase of the
Windows 98 installation looked decidedly different from the third phase,
even though they’re both graphical phases (the first phase is textual).
The answer turns out to be both surprising, and entirely predictable.
The first phase is a DOS program called DOSSETUP.BIN, which is the
infamous blue part of the installation. The second part, however, is
what we’re interested in here, and if the first phase is DOS, and the
third phase is Windows 98 itself… What do you think the second phase is
running? Yeah, exactly. Basically, because it is running under Windows
3.1 at that point. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a
Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the “shell” in
SYSTEM.INI). This starts by copying more files to support all the
information-gathering during setup, and various other niceties including
the 3D look shown in your screenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs);
it ends by copying most of Windows 98, setting the system up so that it
will boot Windows 98 from the target drive, and rebooting. ↫ Stephen
Kitt So, in order to install Windows 98, you first run DOS, followed by
Windows 3.1, ending in Windows 98. I have no idea why this is so funny
to me, especially since it fits entirely within expectations of how
Microsoft does things.</p>

<p>For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I
don’t trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working
life dealing with bugs in software. It’s very easy for me to imagine
what could go wrong. I don’t understand how people can trust a computer
with their lives this way. It’s also disconcerting that the car coming
at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when
I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone’s getting a
free demo of FSD, it’s somewhat likely the OP is a computer.</p>

But Rob’s podcast is just the excuse I needed to complain about something I find quite annoying: video podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Season 3 of Yo! is “video first”. Podcasts switching to video to be on
YouTube ranks quite high on the list of things that I find annoying. I
get why they’re doing it. I’m not an idiot. Yet I still find it
annoying. Especially because podcasts that were audio-only would start
referencing and talking about things that are “on the screen right now”
and now I’m missing out on parts of the conversation because I’m
listening to a podcast while I’m driving.
</p>
<p>
Video podcasts are the worst of both worlds. They’re not as good as
actual video content designed to be consumed exclusively as video and
they’re inferior to audio-only podcasts. And if you disagree

<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>The project has been haunted by a mysterious bug since sometime
February. It relates to the code that constructs the index, particularly
the code that merges partial indices. In short the search engine
constucts the reverse index through successive merging of smaller
indices, which reduces the overall memory requirement. You can
conceptualize the revese index itself as two files, one with offset
pointers into another file, which has sorted numbers. This code runs
after each partition finishes crawling and processing its data, and has
a run time of about 4 hours.</p>

id="ixsystems-focusing-on-linux-makes-more-sense-than-freebsd">iXsystems:
focusing on Linux makes more sense than FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we talked about how iXsystems, the company behind
TrueNAS CORE and SCALE, has all but confirmed that its FreeBSD-based
CORE product will be put in maintenance mode, while the Linux-based
SCALE product will get all the attention and focus from here on out. In
an interview with Blocks &amp; Files, the company gave more insight into
this choice. “We had a huge chunk of our engineering staff spending time
improving FreeBSD as opposed to working on features and functionalities.
What’s happened now with the transition to having a Debian basis, the
people I used to have 90 percent of their time working on FreeBSD,
they’re working on ZFS features now … That’s what I want to see; value
add for everybody versus sitting around, implementing something Linux
had a years ago. And trying to maintain or backport, or just deal with
something that you just didn’t get out of box on FreeBSD.” “It’s not
knocking against FreeBSD. We love it. That’s our heritage. That’s our
roots, I was on the CORE team elected twice. So believe me, if I felt
like I could have stayed on FreeBSD for the next 20 years, I would have
absolutely preferred to do that … But at some point, you gotta read the
writing on the wall and say, well, all the the vendor
supported-innovations are happening on the Linux side these days.” BSD
aficionados don’t like this change. Moore said: “Talk is cheap and
complaints are free. You know, everyone loves to complain about it. But
… if people wanted to push FreeBSD forward for the last 15 years, they
would have.” ↫ Chris Mellor at Blocks &amp; Files Above all else, my
personal north star is choice, especially in technology, and as such, I
want iXsystems to keep focusing on FreeBSD so that not everyone is using
Linux for server- and server-like workloads. The fact that TrueNAS was a
FreeBSD-based product for this long was amazing, and I would definitely
have preferred if it stayed that way for many, many more years to come.
However, I don’t think the people of TrueNAS are saying anything wrong
or outrageous here. They’ve got employees to feed, and the money is in
Linux, not FreeBSD. If they spend more money, time, and resources on
getting FreeBSD on par with features Linux has had for ages than on
actually developing their own product – TrueNAS – then they’re fighting
a losing battle. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s taken them this long to
take this controversial step. All we can hope for is that the things
they work on, the features they develop, will make it to FreeBSD
regardless.</p>

cumbersome - and this is not what I want people’s first impression to

acquired by Automattic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you haven’t already heard of Beeper, welcome! Beeper is a
universal chat app for Android, iOS and desktop. Our goal is to build
the best chat app on earth. Beeper is built on an open source chat
protocol called Matrix. Over time, we’ll help people migrate from
proprietary, siloed chat networks to an open standard for chat. If
you’re interested in learning about this, we’ve written more about our
intentions. ↫ Beeper team Beeper is just great. Because I’m European and
have ties to two different countries with vastly different chat
preferences, as well as a number of friends living all over Europe and
the US, I’ve always had to deal with at least four different instant
messaging applications. Beeper, and especially the recent completely
redesigned Android version, is so good and seamless that I no longer
need to use the individual applications at all. It’s not perfect – the
new Android version (the iOS version is old and outdated compared to the
Android one) still has some issues. If you receive a video and play it,
it doesn’t maximise unless you perform a very delicate zoom in pinch.
Sometimes, sending video fails. Some emoji replies on some services look
huge and pixellated. I’m sure these are all relatively low-hanging fruit
types of bugs that’ll get fixes over the coming weeks and months now
that the application is out of beta. However, the actual core of the
application has been working amazingly well for me. Beeper also has
another major announcement. I’m excited to announce that Beeper has been
acquired by Automattic. This acquisition marks the beginning of an
exciting new chapter as we continue our mission to create the best chat
app on earth. ↫ Eric Migicovsky Automattic is the company behind
WordPress, Tumblr, Pocket Casts, and a whole load of other products and
services. Beeper seems like a good fit, since Automattic recently also
acquired Texts.com, another multi-platform messaging client.</p>

details privacy and security features of its new Find My Device
network</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yesterday, I posted an item about the updated Find My Device network
Google launched for Android, but I forgot to link to an additional blog
post by Google about the various security and privacy precautions
they’ve taken. One aspect in particular stands out as something new that
Apple’s Find My network doesn’t do (yet): This is a first-of-its-kind
safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location,
like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network
requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before
reporting its location to the tag’s owner. Our research found that the
Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes
and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By
implementing aggregation before showing a tag’s location to its owner,
the network can take advantage of its biggest strength – over a billion
Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their
lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from
unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known
location and Nest finding are reliable ways to locate items. ↫ Dave
Kleidermacher In addition, when you’re at home, your devices won’t
contribute any information either. There’s a whole bunch of other things
in there, too, so head on over if you’re curious.</p>

<h2 id="on-tesla-nazis-x-and-the-macintosh-of-cars">On Tesla, Nazis, X
and the Macintosh of cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I’d buy a Tesla today because of Musk’s politics which he
puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their
nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of
people dying.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who
developed it, who I don’t know. I hope they’re not Nazis. I don’t see
how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla">2021</a>,
the year I bought mine, could be anything like that.
</p>
<p>
This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that
comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up
to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original.
</p>
<p>
To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be
hard for me to do. I don’t think my “support” of Tesla could mean that
much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car
(one of its innovations).
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It’s
like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even
if I wasn’t one of Apple’s top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs
didn’t design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did.
Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial.
That’s a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept
like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that
Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way.
</p>
<p>
Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I
got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don’t want these
products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would
have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic
idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one
who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those
are some of the brightest people out there.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile I’m looking at other company’s EVs with lust. I might like a
Kia or a BMW. If you’re making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not
a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too.
</p>

PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by

<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern
lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not
fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from
instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample
multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these
limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop
instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more
than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about
the amazing physics happening within the aurora.</p>

<h2 id="ten-years-ago-windows-xp-received-its-final-update">Ten years
ago, Windows XP received its final update</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final
security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for
one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at
Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was
using at the time – BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x – Windows XP felt kind of
like a bad joke I wasn’t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn’t seem to
offer anything substantial, and it didn’t take long for major security
incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn’t
until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into
its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better
alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I’m of course talking
about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today
though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP
has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows
XP – the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense – the
sound set, the wallpaper of course – has become iconic, warts and all,
and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as
they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few
service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I
would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and
Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that’s more of a personal thing
and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly
been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will
suddenly get good, either.</p>

launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant
leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app
servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory
caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training
and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of
purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out
offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like
networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and
improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads
storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that
decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically
provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM
processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In
other words, we’ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to
eBay in a few years.</p>

engine in Qt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project
originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project’s
still got a long way to go, it’s definitely a serious contender to
become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it’s
starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on
bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine
inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++.
This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for
webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They’re
already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using
Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely
eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill
now.</p>

<h2>
Usage example
</h2>
<p>
pl/dotnet gives you the full power of C# and F# in your PostgreSQL
procedures, functions, and triggers.
</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    upperLimit = lim.HasValue ? lim : System.Int32.MaxValue;  
    for(long i=0;i&lt;upperLimit;i++){ yield return new object?[] { i, $"Number is {i}" }; }  
$$ LANGUAGE plcsharp;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf_fsharp(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    let upperLimit = Option.defaultValue (int64 System.Int32.MaxValue) lim  
    seq { for i in 0L .. upperLimit - 1L do yield [| box i; $"Number is {i}" |] }  
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
</code></pre>
<h2>
SQL features
</h2>
<p>
We support all SQL function modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
normal procedures and functions
</li>
<li>
trigger functions, will full trigger support: trigger arguments, old/new
row, row rewriting (where allowed), and all the standard trigger
information
</li>
<li>
set-returning functions, nicely mapped to iterators in C# and sequences
in F#
</li>
<li>
table functions, as well as functions returning records or sets of
records
</li>
<li>
full support for IN/OUT/INOUT functions
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Data type support
</h2>
<p>
We support 40 PostgreSQL types, with all mapped to their NPGSQL-standard
dotnet types. The only notable exceptions are multirange, enum, and
struct types, which we hope to add in the future. All datatypes are
nullable, have full array support, and are fully unit-tested for C# and
F#. (Formatted as a list of (PostgreSQL type: Dotnet type) instead of a
table for technical reasons.)

<h2>
SPI
</h2>
<p>
Our SPI leverages the NPGSQL client library to provide a native dotnet
implementation which is maximally compatible with existing client code.
We intercepted the NPGSQL calls at a very low level to replace the
client protocol handling with SPI calls; otherwise, NPGSQL was
unmodified. We imported the NPGSQL test suite as stored procedures and
are using it for our testing, giving us very good understanding of our
compatiblity level.
</p>
<p>
Work remains to improve the compatibility and add features. Our biggest
category of NPGSQL tests that continue to fail is error mapping, because
SPI throws exceptions differently than NPGSQL does. Such
incompatibilities are minor but numerous; we continue working to improve
them.
</p>
<p>
Here are our currently tested SPI operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>
What we don’t have
</h2>
<p>
We lack support for multirange, enum, and composite/table types. We
intend to add them.
</p>
<p>
Our SPI implementation lacks some minor features like sub-transactions,
and we sometimes raise errors in a different (and therefore slightly
incompatible) way from NPGSQL.
</p>
<p>
Our build system, with both dpkg and binary output, is functional but
not as tidy as we would like.
</p>
<p>
We welcome code submissions to address any of these issues, and we hope
to improve them all in time.
</p>
<h2>
Where to get it
</h2>
<p>
Our operating system support:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We fully support Linux and provide dpkg’s for Debian and Ubuntu.
(Details on our
<a href="https://pldotnet.brickabode.com/how-to-install-pl-net">installation
page</a>)
</li>
<li>
We have built and tested the system on OSX (arm and x86), but we have
not packaged it yet.
</li>
<li>
We look forward to having Windows support soon; ping us if you would
like to help.

iGPU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Intel and AMD both tried to ship iGPUs fast enough to compete with
low end discrete cards over the past 10 years with mixed results.
Recently though, powerful iGPUs have been thrown back into the
spotlight. Handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS’s ROG Ally
demonstrated that consumers are willing to accept compromises to play
games on the go. AMD has dominated that market so far. Valve’s Steam
Deck uses AMD’s Van Gogh APU, and the ROG Ally uses the newer Phoenix
APU. Unlike Van Gogh, Phoenix is a general purpose mobile chip with both
a powerful CPU and GPU. Phoenix doesn’t stop at targeting the handheld
segment, and threatens Intel’s laptop market share too. In response,
Meteor Lake brings a powerful iGPU to the party. It has the equivalent
of 128 EUs and clocks up to 2.25 GHz, making it modestly wider and much
faster than Raptor Lake’s 96 EU, 1.5 GHz iGPU. Raptor Lake’s Xe-LP
graphics architecture gets replaced by Xe-LPG, a close relative of the
Xe-HPG architecture used in Intel’s A770 discrete GPU. At the system
level, Meteor Lake moves to a GPU integration scheme that better suits a
chiplet configuration where the iGPU gets significant transistor and
area budget. I’ll be testing Meteor Lake’s iGPU with the Core Ultra 7
155H, as implemented in the ASUS Zenbook 14. I purchased the device
myself in late February. ↫ Chips and Cheese I’m absolutely here for the
resurgence in capable integrated GPUs, both for PC gaming on the go and
for better graphics performance even in thinner, smaller laptops. I
would love to have just a bit more graphics power on my thin and small
laptop so I can do some basic gaming with it.</p>

<h2 id="google-launches-new-find-my-device-network-on-android">Google
launches new Find My Device network on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices
around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new,
crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device
can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items
quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out. ↫ Erik Kay
on the Google blog This old Android feature has basically been updated
to be the same thing as Apple’s Find My, but with more than just one
vendor making the tracking tags. Of course, this means it also comes
with the same problems, from its use by stalkers to controlling
partners, and everything in between. This is a very problematic
technology, one which I think is almost impossible to make safe. Still,
I have a Samsung tracker that I don’t use anymore – because I bought a
Pixel 8 Pro, and don’t want to install any Samsung applications – and I
do plan on getting a new tracker that’s compatible with this new Find My
Device network. With two small kids, it’s easy to lose track of
something like my car keys, and instead of stressing about where they
are when we need to leave on time, I can just ping them using our Google
Home devices instead. Sometimes, these silly smart technologies really
do take just that little bit of stress out of your life – you just have
to be really picky and honest with yourself about what you really
need.</p>

id="microsoft-adds-driver-to-windows-that-prevents-changing-the-default-browser-using-the-registry">Microsoft
adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using
the registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar
defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this
is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft
is not particularly happy with this, as they’ve recently introduced a
new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by
blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of
registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was
discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based
protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd
party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but
in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education
environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver
during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of
executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly
and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph
Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do,
Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an
additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert
the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the
changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU’s DMA, but the
driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it’s all a bit
unclear at the moment.</p>

Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub
and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and
tries out new ideas.

ActivityPub you know who’s following you and in RSS you don’t. This may
sound like a negative until you think about it from the user’s
standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn’t
like RSS btw.

It has been
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed
out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can
testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind
of spooky but I guess ok. I can’t recall ever receiving spam as a result
of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I
unsub begging me to come back. So it isn’t a huge problem in a real way
at least for me, yet.
</li>
<li>
I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you
attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You’re
just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don’t abide
that. Have a nice day.

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
ALGOL is one of those topics that’s haunted the show for a while. It
comes up any time we talk about programming languages, and with good
reason. Many of the features and ideas found in modern languages have
their roots in ALGOL. Despite that influence, ALGOL itself remains
somewhat obscure. It never reached the highs of a C or LISP.
</p>
<p>
In this series we are going to look at ALGOL from 1958 all up to 1968,
keeping a careful eye on how the language evolved, how it’s problems
were addressed, and how new problems were introduced.

<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Users recently noticed that third-party apps for customizing the user
interface no longer work in the upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2. Not
only does Microsoft not allow you to run those apps, but it even blocks
you from upgrading to newer builds. StartAllBack, a popular tool for
tweaking the taskbar and Start menu in Windows 11, was among the first
to fail on 24H2. Sadly, it is not the only one. ExplorerPatcher also no
longer works in Windows 11 24H2. ExplorerPatcher from Valinet is quite a
popular app that lets you bring back the old Windows 10 taskbar in
Windows 11, apply additional modifications to make Windows 11 slightly
better, and restore some of its missing features. Windows 11 version
24H2 is now flagging ExplorerPatcher as incompatible due to “security or
performance issues” with the following message. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin
I guess the taskbar and Start menu are incredibly important real estate
for Microsoft, since it’s the absolute prime spot for showing ads. If
users replace their taskbar and Start menu with something from a third
party, that prime real estate is gone. Major conspiracy vibes, yes, and
I know this isn’t the reason, but why else would they be blocking these
applications? I can’t think of anything that makes more sense.</p>

<h2 id="outlook-is-microsofts-new-data-collection-service">Outlook is
Microsoft’s new data collection service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows, it appears
the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance tool for
targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing campaigns
of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate
advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply
an email service; it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 801
external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. ↫
Edward Komenda on the Proton blog Now, note that this is an article
written by Proton, posted on the company blog, so of course they’re not
going to be too kind towards their competitors. That being said, the
article’s not wrong: the new Outlook web application, now the default in
Windows, not only shared your data with around 800 partners, it also
displays ads inside of the application. On macOS, it will even show yo
fake emails that are, in fact, ads. Furthermore, once you add your
accounts to this new Outlook web application, you’ll also be uploading
your username and password to Microsoft, giving them access to your
email accounts for advertising and data collection purposes, a shady
practice a ton of email clients on mobile devices tend to do as well.
Suffice it to say you really shouldn’t be using this new Outlook, and
you should make sure friends and family don’t either. This is yet
another nail in the coffin of Windows, now an advertising and data
collection platform first, and operating system second.</p>

open-source btrfs driver for Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem
Btrfs. A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the
Linux kernel, and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It
is also included as part of the free operating system ReactOS. ↫
WinBtrfs GitHub page If you’re running a distribution that defaults to
Btrfs, or you actively choose to use it on other distributions, and you
also happen to dual-boot Windows because your boss makes you use some
garbage corpo software, this driver will make your setup a bit easier to
manage.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>You may have read yesterday’s New York Times report by Cade Metz and
others on how many of the biggest AI companies have been cutting ethical
corners in a race to gather as much data as possible (“OpenAI, Google
and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and
discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to
train their newest artificial intelligence systems”).</p>

Bluesky, Andrew Hickey
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b">explains</a>
how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his
house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my
house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I
had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the
chaos. It wasn’t until the work was over that I was able to start to get
back into my flow.
</p>
<p>
In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a
good five or six hours before it’s time to do the next thing. The first
hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about
where I’m going next. By hour two, I’m not quite at my highest rate but
getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I’m in a good
groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I’m taking short breaks to check
email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my
attention to be available, for a short period.
</p>
<p>
After 5-6 hours of this, I’m wiped out.
</p>
<p>
I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.
</p>
<p>
But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if
I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my
head. It doesn’t take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole
thing, and basically have to start over the next day.
</p>
<p>
Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything
other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I’m sure of it.
Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual
achievement. If you’re doing something that few other people do well,
you’re not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and
a lot of detail, and memory, but you’re sometimes inventing things that
no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other.
And you’re doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you’re
burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they
don’t interfere at all. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won’t edit it until
the evening, when I do lite work that doesn’t require much focus for any
duration.

2024-04-06 Travelling
</h1>
<p>
The last ten years, travels – even holiday travels! – have made me more
and more nervous. I used to be so cool about travel. We lived abroad and
travelled so much. And now I’d prefer to just stay in Switzerland all
the time. But my wife still loves to travel and once I’m there, wherever
it is, I feel OK again.
</p>
<p>
I can’t say what it is. A vague anxiety about everything. From the
smallest thing like it’s spring and I’m going to miss the next two weeks
of flowers, and the bees are all emerging from their reed tubes and I
hope our friend is OK with watering the gazillion plants we have and I
hope we didn’t forget anything and I hope security checks are going to
be OK and foreign dictatorship and secret services are going to stay out
of our lives and out of our phones and I hope we have enough money for
tips and how much does one tip again?
</p>
<p>
Back when I was about thirty I argued that equipped with a credit card
nothing else mattered. I’d just buy whatever I was missing. These days
we start our “packing mound” days beforehand.
