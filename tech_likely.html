<p>Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/29/twowaysofsupport.png">perfect
illustration</a> how ChatGPT can improve customer relations. I bought an
iPhone that I now don’t need, and it’s arriving today via FedEx. I
wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and
then return it. Obviously it’s easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT
and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple’s chatbot saw it as a “technical”
question and wasn’t prepared to help. Sales support is one of those
applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost
a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling
1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn’t
find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-politics-and-communities">Thoughts on politics and
communities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Kev has written about the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com/blog/politics-and-communities&quot;&gt;politics and communities&lt;/a&gt; on his blog and it was related to his recently announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com/blog/introducing-500-social&quot;&gt;500.social&lt;/a&gt; project. In his post, he mentioned blog posts written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://baty.net&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nice-marmot.net&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in the full discussion go read the various blog posts, they’re all relatively short.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not interested in commenting on the opinions expressed in those blog
posts but I am interested in the source of the discussion, and that was
a bullet list item in the 500.social
<a href="https://about.500.social/#expectations">“Member expectations”
section</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Posts about politics and religion should be avoided, if you strongly
feel the urge to post about these topics, please put them behind a
Content Warning Member expectations
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Years ago, during the COVID era, the 37signals company got into hot
water online because they announced in an internal communication that
they were going to ban “societal and political discussions” on their
internal work chat.
<a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">The
announcement is online</a> if you’re interested in reading it.
</p>
<p>
People online reacted in all sorts of ways to that news and many, many
opinion pieces got published. I remember talking about it with a few
people privately and had some interesting conversations around that
topic. As you can see, years later, positions on topics such as politics
and religion are still controversial in the context of online spaces.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think the issue is not with politics, religion or any
other topic. The problem is a mixture of expectations and the tools we
use. In his post, Dave wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If there is a “public square” anymore, where we ought to be able to try
to hash those things out, it seems to me that it’s in those “small
social networks,” unless they’re intended to be bespoke bubbles where
it’s all just happy talk and we never have difficult conversations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don’t disagree that small communities are the space where those
conversations can happen which is why I think no topic should be banned
or be off limits. At the same time though, I do think that having
conversations means something very different than posting a reactionary
tweet to comment on a piece of news. That’s why people like Kev end up
with rules against politics and religion. Because if you dig deeper,
people don’t want to have a conversation on social media. They want to
vent.
</p>
<p>
I think social media platforms, like Mastodon, are not designed to have
conversations. You can have them on there, sure, but the experience is
going to be sub-par. Social media is designed to be reactionary and
generating reactions is different than having a conversation. What would
Mastodon look like if everyone was forced to post at least 500 words?
What would Mastodon look like if you could only post once an hour? The
reason why some people, like Kev, end up with rules like that is because
social media is an imperfect tool. I don’t have a no politics rule
attached to my email address. People can write to me and talk about
whatever they want. If they write about something I don’t care about I
can simply ignore that topic and don’t engage in conversation which is
exactly what happens in real life.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What prompted me to consider joining 500.social was recalling the
feeling I had when we learned that Biden had dropped out of the race.
That’s the sort of event that evokes an immediate, emotional response
because of its significance to a broad range of people, presumably my
“community.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the perfect example of why I think social media is a flawed
tool. Can you imagine doing the same in the phone era? Can you imagine
reading a piece of news and start calling hundreds, potentially
thousands of people simply to share what you think about some news? And
can you imagine doing that with people who don’t even live in your
country and couldn’t care less about that specific news? Now can you
imagine if everyone was doing the same for the news that evoked a strong
reaction to them? You’d quickly put your phone on airplane mode because
there are only so many random opinions on news you can bear to listen
to. I can have a 3 hours discussion about politics, I can’t listen 3
hours of soundbites.
</p>
<p>
The problem with social media and politics is that way too many people
are interested in sharing what they think about social media but very
few are interested in having actual, real discussions. Because blasting
out a tweet takes 10 seconds while having an actual conversation might
take hours and span days.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to know what you think about this whole situation though. Do
you think some topics should be banned on social platforms? If you have
opinions get in touch or even better write a blog post!

<h2 id="microsofts-crowdstrike-post-mortem">Microsoft’s CrowdStrike
post-mortem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has published a post-mortem of the CrowdStrike incident,
and goes into great depths to describe where, exactly, the error lies,
and how it could lead to such massive problems. I can’t comment anything
insightful on the technical details and code they show to illustrate all
of this – I’ll leave that discussion up to you – but Microsoft also
spends considerable amount of time explaining why security vendors are
choosing to use kernel-mode drivers. Microsoft lists three major reasons
why security vendors opt for using kernel modules, and none of them will
come as a great surprise to OSNews readers: kernel drivers provide more
visibility into the system than a userspace tool would, there are
performance benefits, and they’re more resistant to tampering. The
downsides are legion, too, of course, as any crash or similar issue in
kernel mode has far-reaching consequences. The goal, then, according to
Microsoft, is to balance the need for greater insight, performance, and
tamper resistance with stability. And while the company doesn’t say it
directly, this is clearly where CrowdStrike failed – and failed hard.
While you would want a security tool like CrowdStrike to perform as
little as possible in kernelspace, and conversely as much as possible in
userspace, that’s not what CrowdStrike did. They are running a lot of
stuff in kernelspace that really shouldn’t be there, such as the update
mechanism and related tools. In total, CrowdStrike loads four kernel
drivers, and much of their functionality can be run in userspace
instead. It is possible today for security tools to balance security and
reliability. For example, security vendors can use minimal sensors that
run in kernel mode for data collection and enforcement limiting exposure
to availability issues. The remainder of the key product functionality
includes managing updates, parsing content, and other operations can
occur isolated within user mode where recoverability is possible. This
demonstrates the best practice of minimizing kernel usage while still
maintaining a robust security posture and strong visibility. Windows
provides several user mode protection approaches for anti-tampering,
like Virtualization-based security (VBS) Enclaves and Protected
Processes that vendors can use to protect their key security processes.
Windows also provides ETW events and user-mode interfaces like
Antimalware Scan Interface for event visibility. These robust mechanisms
can be used to reduce the amount of kernel code needed to create a
security solution, which balances security and robustness. ↫ David
Weston, Vice President, Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft In what
is surely an unprecedented event, I agree with the CrowdStrike criticism
bubbling under the surface of this post-mortem by Microsoft. Everything
seems to point towards CrowdStrike stuffing way more things in
kernelspace than is needed, and as such creating a far larger surface
for things to go catastrophically wrong than needed. While Microsoft
obviously isn’t going to openly and publicly throw CrowdStrike under the
bus, it’s very clear what they’re hinting at here, and this is about as
close to a public flogging we’re going to get. Microsoft’s post-portem
further details a ton of work Microsoft has recently done, is doing, and
will soon be doing to further strenghthen Windows’ security, to lessen
the need for kernelspace security drivers even more, including adding
support for Rust to the Windows kernel, which should also aid in
mitigating some common problems present in other, older programming
languages (while not being a silver bullet either, of course).</p>

2024-07-27 Tired of programming
</h1>
<p>
My summer break has begun, and I am tired.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on some sort of editor. I contributed some lines to
Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to
text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much
effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again… I’m experimenting with using
<code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it’s not so bad if you’re
just writing, like writing an email. But really writing, organizing,
moving things around… it really doesn’t work all that well. I had
imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is
your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu
site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of
editor would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point. Then I
dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain. Then I
started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz,
Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per
language), and on and on. It’s too much.
</p>
<p>
But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed? Am I in fact
reinventing vi, badly?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a
Javascript web application in production. This is a single file, a
stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a
native application that would work without a browser.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or
Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding. Vanilla JS and the
browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for
this Common Lisp app I’m looking at really makes me want to drop it all
for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead. It can’t be that
bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for
free…
</p>
<p>
And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various
states of neglect is draining. Switching from one to the other is tricky
since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other
is lacking. But the first one is lacking a gfx port. Then again, I guess
I can add circle drawing using lines.
</p>
<p>
Everything takes so long. So damn long.

<p>
A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on
browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks
were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was
Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep
<a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It’s great.
</p>
<p>
I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and
when new items get added, a feed is updated. Just a little program… it
doesn’t seem hard. So I gave it try. I like documentation first, these
days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that
perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses. So I needed
to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be? It’s a bit harder than
writing it in Perl. Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too. Or use
SQLite to store data. It keeps getting harder.
</p>
<p>
Well, I spent some time on it and now I’m tired again. This too, takes
too long!
</p>
<p>
I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?
</p>
<p>
I should read a book.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I
decided to spice up my shell life…
</p>
<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>
<p>
I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to
set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and
contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you know of other such tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the
bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl:
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>.
🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" />
</p>
<p>
I installed a daily cron job:
</p>
<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>
<p>
The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files…
feed-file</code>. The files it looks at once a day are my
<a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>. The feed it generates is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>. The database it uses is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40
items for the feed.
</p>
<p>
When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the
Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted –
they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the
whole category, which pretty weird.

backwards</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I don’t when technology moves backwards.
</p>
<p>
I’m always trying to push it the other way.
</p>
<p>
It’s like being a ball player wanting to win a game.
</p>
<p>
Or a musician wanting to record a hit.
</p>
<p>
A VC wanting a 10x return.
</p>
<p>
A diplomat achieving growth and peace.

Despite my best efforts this weekend, I have yet to watch every video on
TikTok.
</p>
<p>
But I made a ton of progress.

<p>If you don’t live in a swing state, but would like to do more than
just send money to help encourage voter turnout in those places, what
are your options? For me the best one is Vote Forward, which
orchestrates letter-writing to registered voters. I sent hundreds of
such letters in 2020 and am aiming …

Microsoft’s tool to create BSoDs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Blue screens of death are not exactly in short supply on Windows
machines lately, but what if you really want to cause your own kernel
panic or complete system crash, just because you love that shade of
crashy blue? Well, there’s a tool for that called NotMyFault, developed
by Mark Russinovich as part of Sysinternals. NotMyFault is a tool that
you can use to crash, hang, and cause kernel memory leaks on your
Windows system. It’s useful for learning how to identify and diagnose
device driver and hardware problems, and you can also use it to generate
blue screen dump files on misbehaving systems. The download file
includes 32-bit and 64-bit versions, as well as a command-line version
that works on Nano Server. Chapter 7 in Windows Internals uses
NotMyFault to demonstrate pool leak troubleshooting and Chapter 14 uses
it for crash analysis examples. ↫ Mark Russinovich Using this tool, you
can select exactly what kind of crash you want to cause, and after
clicking the Crash button, your Windows computer will do exactly as it’s
told and crash with a lovely blue screen of death. It comes in both a
GUI and CLI version, and the latter also works on minimal Windows
installations that don’t have the Windows shell installed. A tool like
this may seem odd, but it can be particularly useful in situations where
you’re trying to troubleshoot an issue, and to learn how to properly
diagnose crashes. Or, you know, you can use it to create a panic at your
workplace.</p>

microkernel-based OS with fully asynchronous I/O</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ah, another microkernel-based hobby operating system. The more, the
merrier – and I mean this, without a hint of sarcasm. There’s definitely
been a small resurgence in activity lately when it comes to small hobby
and teaching operating systems, some of which are exploring some truly
new ideas, and I’m definitely here for it. Today we have managarm. Some
notable properties of managarm are: (i) managarm is based on a
microkernel while common Desktop operating systems like Linux and
Windows use monolithic kernels, (ii) managarm uses a completely
asynchronous API for I/O and (iii) despite those internal differences,
managarm provides good compatibility with Linux at the user space level.
↫ managarm GitHub page It’s a 64bit operating system with SMP support,
an ACPI implementation, networking, USB3 support, and, as the quoted
blurb details, a lot of support for Linux and POSIX. It can already run
Weston, kmscon, and other things like Bash, the GNU Coreutils, and more.
While not explicitly mentioned, I assume the best platform to run
managarm on are most likely virtualisation tools, and there’s a detailed
handbook to help you along during building and using this new operating
system.</p>

Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from
my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it
isn’t even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing
tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything
like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can’t even reach
it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I
absolutely can’t do this on my own. No time, patience, and it’s not my
job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be
spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This
is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source
thing.</p>
