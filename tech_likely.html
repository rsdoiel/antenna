people who follow me via RSS or email, or on Bluesky or Mastodon, thus
giving them a chance to sell others on paying $0.50 to read the freaking

<p>This is not a joke: Google will now let you perform a “web” search.
It’s rolling out “web” searches now, and in my early tests on desktop,
it’s looking like it could be an incredibly popular change to Google’s
search engine. The optional setting filters out almost all the other
blocks of content that Google crams into a search results page, leaving
you with links and text — and Google confirms to The Verge that it will
block the company’s new AI Overviews as well. ↫ Sean Hollister at The

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">microSD

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;insert-image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-m2-hat-plus.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
For years, SBCs that aren’t Raspberry Pis experimented with eMMC and M.2
storage interfaces. While the Raspberry Pi went from full-size SD card
in the first generation to microSD in every generation following
(Compute Modules excluded), other vendors like Radxa, Orange Pi, Banana
Pi, etc. have been all over the place.
</p>
<p>
Still, <em>most</em> of the time a fallback microSD card slot remains.
</p>
<p>
But microSD cards—even the fastest UHS-II/A2/V90/etc. ones that
advertise hundreds of MB/sec—are laggards when it comes to any kind of
SBC workflow.
</p>
<p>
The two main reasons they’re used are cost and size. They’re tiny, and
they don’t cost much, especially if you don’t shell out for
industrial-rated microSD cards.

<h2 id="the-new-apt-3.0-solver">The new APT 3.0 solver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>A crucial but often entirely transparent feature of a modern package
management system like Debian’s APT is its solver – basically the set of
rules and instruction on how to handle dependencies when installing a
package. APT is currently in the process of radically changing its
solver, the first bits of which can be found in APT 2.9.3, referred to
as solver3. Many of the changes and improvements get a little into the
weeds and will mostly be transparent to users, but there is one feature
the new solver will enable that many of you will be incredibly excited
about. One of the core new capabilities of solver3 is the implication
graph. As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication
graph, albeit a partial one: The first package installing another
package is marked as the reason (A -&gt; B), the same thing for
conflicts (not A -&gt; not B). ↫ Julian Andres Klode Seems rather
innocuous at first sight, but here’s what the implication graph will
make possible: The implication graph building allows us to implement an
apt why command, that while not as nicely detailed as aptitude, at least
tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show
the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we
record. ↫ Julian Andres Klode If you’ve ever dealt with packaging issues
– probably when running -testing or similar unstable distributions that
use APT, a command that tells you exactly why a package is installed is
an absolute godsend. Sure, aptitude exists, but aptitude takes you out
of your current CLI workflow, whereas this will be much easier to
quickly run. There’s more features solver3 will enable, but this one is
definitely one of my favourite low-level additions to APT in a long,
long time.</p>

<h2 id="google-details-some-of-the-ai-features-coming-to-android">Google
details some of the “AI” features coming to Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google I/O, the company’s developer conference, started today, but
for the first time since I can remember, Android and Chrome OS have been
relegated to day two of the conference. The first day was all about
“AI”, most of which I’m not even remotely interested in, except of
course where it related to Google’s operating system offerings. And the
company did have a few things to say about “AI” on Android, and the
general gist is that yeah, they’re going to be stuffing it into every
corner of the operating system. Google’s “AI” tool Gemini will be
integrated deeply into Android, and you’ll be able to call up an overlay
wherever you are in the operating system, and do things like summarise a
PDF that’s on screen, summarise a YouTube video, generate images on the
fly and drop them into emails and conversations, and so on. A more
interesting and helpful “AI” addition is using it to improve TalkBack,
so that people with impaired vision can let the device describe images
on the screen for them. Google claims TalkBack users come across about
90 images without description every day (!), so this is a massive
improvement for people with impaired vision, and a genuinely helpful and
worthwhile “AI” feature. Creepier is that Google’s “AI” will also be
able to listen along with your phone calls, and warn you if an ongoing
conversation is a scamming attempt. If the person on the other end of
the line claiming to be your bank asks you to move a bunch of money
around to keep it safe, Gemini will pop up and warn you it’s a scam,
since banks don’t ask you such things. Clever, sure, but also absolutely
terrifying and definitely not something I’ll be turning on. Google
claims all of these features take place on-device, so privacy should be
respected, but I’m always a bit unsure about such things staying that
way in the future. Regardless, “AI” is coming to Android in a big way,
but I’m just here wondering how much of it I’ll be able to turn off.</p>

Workstation Pro and Fusion pro go free for personal use</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>After Broadcom acquired VMware, there’s been a steady stream of
worrying or outright bad news for people using VMware products at home,
for personal use, as enthusiasts. The biggest blow to the enthusiast
market was the end of perpetual licensing, forcing people into
subscriptions instead. Finally, though it seems we’re getting some good
news. The most exciting part is that Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will
now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a
Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide
based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required.
This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac,
Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and
downloading the bits from the new download portal located at
support.broadcom.com. ↫ Michael Roy on the VMware blog This is
definitely good news for us enthusiasts, and it means I won’t have to
buy a cheap VMware license off eBay every few years anymore, so I’m
quite satisfied here. However, with VMware under Broadcom focusing more
and more on the enterprise and squeezing every last penny out of those
customers, one has to wonder if this ‘free for personal use’ is just a
prelude to winding down the development of enthusiasts’ tools
altogether. It wouldn’t be the first time that a product going free for
personal use was a harbinger of worse things yet to come.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I spend my time doing things online. I design and code websites for clients, I make websites for friends, and I start—and almost always shut down—all sorts of weird side projects. It’s easy to take this online life too seriously. If you go online you’ll immediately find people discussing business strategies and ways to monetise everything they do. Which is fine but also exhausting. The web is so caught up in the hustler mentality that it’s forgetting that some things can just be hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I interviewed 37 people for my P&amp;B series at this point and if I’m
not mistaken, all 37 of them are just happy to have a blog they pay for
and have no plans to monetise it whatsoever. It’s a hobby, they enjoy
doing it and that’s absolutely fine.

so far generated 0<span

just for the domain at this point. But should I care? Should I monetise
this? Hell no. Carl and I built it because it’s fun, because the idea of
helping people discover some new random wacky website is fun.
</p>
<p>
The other day I was doing some design admin on my
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> because I wanted to
update a few of the graphics in there. And while I was doing that I had
this completely stupid idea of creating a new membership tier called
<em>The “I have F** you money” Club</em>. Do I expect anyone to actually
subscribe? Obviously not, I did it because it’s silly, because I hope
someone will laugh at the stupidity of it all. I did it because it’s fun
to do silly things.

Did you make anything silly recently? If you did show it to me! Send me
an email, I want to see it.

id="google-is-experimenting-with-running-chrome-os-on-android">Google is
experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that Android – since version 13 – ships with the Android
Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with
it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is
run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed
around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of
Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no
reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of
fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows
11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never
officially provided support for running anything other than its custom
build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the
case. The company has started to offer official support for running
Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones
through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other
companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a
special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a
virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running
on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external
display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display
output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of
positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and
Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that
Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in
allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and
input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting
approach to the longstanding dream of convergence – one device for all
your computing needs – but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted
to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation.
What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years
of trying, Google just can’t seem to make Android and its applications
work in a desktop form factor. I’ve tried to shoehorn Android into a
desktop workflow, and it’s quite hard, despite third parties having made
some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just
does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.</p>

<p>As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are
inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually
provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full
install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by <span
class="citation" data-cites="PatRyk">@PatRyk</span> on Twitter, who
actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial
installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were
unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom’s Hardware Silly, sure, but
efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will
eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and
they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we’ll
need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.</p>

Here’s my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly
did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a
double team, to free up one of the Knicks’ assassins. Or maybe he’ll be
more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or
three.

sure thing. I don’t know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up
nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good
PR training somewhere, it’s probably not just from the genes, he is a
freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised
him well. I’m voting for Biden of course. I’m not that crazy. But people
are tired of Biden, I understand why – and they want a president they
can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something
grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump.
Before it’s over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a
possible future president, where “future” is less than a year away.</p>

prototyping in-game ads even as we speak</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more
money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears,
the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO
Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when
an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad
insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s
already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right
now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of
our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in
games are definitely not new – we’ve seen countless games built entirely
around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for
7-Up – and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a
thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several
steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that
when you’re playing some racing game, you’ll get an ad for your local
Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you’re playing GTA in the
US. Either way, it’s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in
line with EA’s mission.</p>

<p>
This year’s public data file is now available, featuring over 156
million metadata records deposited with Crossref through the end of
April 2024 from over 19,000 members. A full breakdown of Crossref
metadata statistics is available
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/06members/53status.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like last year, you can download all of these records in one go via
Academic Torrents or directly from Amazon S3 via the “requester pays”
method.

In January, Martin Eve
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">announced</a>
that we had been experimenting with alternative file formats meant to
make our public data files easier to use by broader audiences. This
year’s file will be published alongside the tools that can be used on
the public data file to produce two experimental formats:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/packer" target="_blank">JSON-lines</a>
and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>
(and a bonus
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/rustsqlitepacker" target="_blank">Rust
version</a>). You can read more about our thinking behind this work in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">Martin’s
blog post</a>, and we are keen to hear your thoughts on these
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Our annual public data file is meant to facilitate individuals and
organizations interested in working with the entirety of our metadata
corpus. Starting with the majority of our metadata records in one file
should be much easier than starting from scratch with our API, but
because Crossref metadata is always openly available, you can use
<a href="https://api.crossref.org/" target="_blank">the API</a> to keep
your local copy up to date with new and updated records.
</p>
<p>
If you’re curious about what you’ll get with the public data file, we’ve
also published a sample version so that you can take a peek before
committing to downloading the ~212 gb file. This file includes a random
sample of JSON files and is available exclusively via torrent

<h2 id="ibm-introduces-entry-level-power10-server-and-tower">IBM
introduces entry-level Power10 server and tower</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Each S1012 node has a single Power10 processor, which can have 1, 4,
or 8 cores activated, which suggests that it is the same single chip
module (SCM) implementation of the Power10 processor that was used in
the Power S1022s entry machine. The Power S1012 node has four ISDIMM
memory slots (using the differential signaling created by Big Blue for
its Power10 memory) with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. The node has four
half-height, half-length PCI-Express 5.0 slots and room for four
NVM-Express U.2 drive bays that come in a maximum 1.6 TB capacity each
for a total of 6.4 TB of storage. The eight-core version of the Power10
SCM is only available in the rack configuration, while the one-core and
four-core versions are available in rack or tower configurations. The
four-core and eight-core versions can run IBM i, AIX, or Linux, but the
one-core version can only run IBM i and it has its main memory capped at
the same 64 GB that other single-core Power Systems machines have been
subjected to. We have suggested that 128 GB or even 256 GB is more
appropriate given modern workloads, but Big Blue is standing its ground
here. If you need more memory than 64 GB, then this machine is not for
you. ↫ Timothy Prickett Morgan at IT Jungle I understand full well that
these machines are by no means meant for people like you and I, sitting
at home playing with our toys. That being said, I still wish there was
some way for IBM to offer unique hardware like this – perhaps in a more
standard, paired-down configuration – so more people than just
enterprises could explore and use them. It wouldn’t make any economic
sense for IBM to do so, and even in a more standard, paired-down
configuration they’d probably still be ungodly expensive, but when I
look at this unique tower, with its POWER10 hardware and the ability to
run AIX, desires are stirred within me that are banned in at least 46
countries. Such a machine would surely be wasted on someone like me, who
would just be shoehorning whatever desktop tasks he could into it, but
what a grand ol’ time we would have. There is absolutely, positively,
unequivocally zero percent chance IBM would ever send one of these over
for review to someone like me, but I wonder if I should try anyway. I’ve
got nothing to lose. Does anyone here work at IBM? Perhaps IBM wants to
sponsor OSNews? How about like 12 weeks of free sponsorships in exchange
for a tower model of the Power S1012? I also have two POWER9 machines to
compare it to! It’s the only way you’ll ever get a Power S1012
screenfetch screenshot go viral on nerd social media, and we all know
that deep down, that’s all you IBM folks really want.</p>

id="macrelix-a-unix-like-environment-that-runs-in-classic-mac-os">MacRelix:
a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>MacRelix is a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS.
MacRelix natively supports classic 68K and PPC Mac OS, as well as Mac OS
X on PPC via Carbon. ↫ MacRelix website The creator of MacRelix, Josh
Juran, published an article in 2019 detailing the origins of the
project. As a Mac OS developer, he was so unhappy with both CodeWarrior
and Apple’s Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW), that he set out to
create what would become MacRelix in 1999. Reading through the
limitations and roadblocks he experienced with CodeWarrior and MPW, it’s
not hard to see why he got frustrated – CodeWarrior’s targets were
apparently a mess and a half to deal with. Then came target
multiplication. Whereas the initial CodeWarrior developer releases
shipped with each combination of language (C and Pascal) and
architecture (68K and PPC) supported in a separate application, a later
version of the IDE unified these, allowing the developer to have a
single project file per project. To allow the same project to be built
for both 68K and PPC architectures, the project data model included
targets: One target would compile for 68K and link against 68K
libraries, another would do the same for PPC. Targets could also be used
to select an optimized build versus one for debugging. Combining both
dichotomies yields four targets: 68K debug, 68K optimized, PPC debug,
and PPC optimized. Then if your project involves multiple executables,
like a code resource or shared library in addition to an application,
you now have eight targets. Or, if you support one of, say, 68020
optimization, profiling, or a third executable, make that twelve. Or,
for all of them, twenty-seven. ↫ Josh Juran Changing an option in your
application required you to change it in every single target, too, which
I can easily see is incredibly frustrating. MPW, for its part, was a
massive improvement, he argues, but while it was clearly inspired by
UNIX, it didn’t seem to actually implement any of the features and
characteristics of UNIX. However, very much unlike Unix, the MPW Shell
had only a single thread of execution — only one program could be
running at once. Not only that, but there was no way for MPW’s compiled
plugins (called tools) to invoke other tools or scripts — not even via
system() (which blocks the calling program until the called program
exits). Therefore, Make couldn’t actually do anything, but only printed
out the commands for the user to run manually. You could code in Perl
instead of the built-in language, but then your scripts couldn’t run
other programs — only MPW shell scripts could do that. ↫ Josh Juran The
limitations Juran was experiencing with these two tools pushed him to
create his own solution, which went well beyond what MPW offered, even
in 2019 when this article was published. Nowadays, MacRelix has pipes,
signals, system calls, TCP sockets, and more. It works on both 68K and
PowerPC Mac systems and builds as Carbon to run natively in OS X. It can
be used on any Mac OS version from System 7 to Mac OS X 10.6 “Snow
Leopard” (after which Apple removed the Rosetta PowerPC emulator). I
haven’t implemented fork() yet, but I know how to do it. In addition to
a Unix-like file system interface (which even handles long names by
storing them in Desktop database comment fields)), MacRelix has a /proc
filesystem (with human readable stack crawls) and also maps various
parts of Mac OS (e.g. the ROM image in /sys/mac/rom). ↫ Josh Juran I had
never heard of MacRelix, but it seems like an amazing tool Juran put a
lot of thought, effort, and love into. Sadly, with the number of PowerPC
Mac OS X users being vanishingly small, and the number of classic Mac OS
users even smaller so, the future of MacRelix seems uncertain. I wonder
what parts of it can be salvaged and upgraded to work on ARM macOS or
even Intel macOS, because I think the ideas and concepts are incredibly
cool. A related project by Juran is something called FORGE, a portable
windowing API that used a virtual file system, meaning that instead of
using functions as objects, it uses files. Juran mentions the example of
a window title – which is a file, and if you want to change the title of
that window you just change the file, which will be instantly reflected
in the GUI. Here’s a Hello World example: Even though I’m not a
programmer, this little tidbit of code makes perfect sense to me, and I
understood it instantly. Of course, anything more complex will quickly
leave my wheelhouse, but intuitively, I really like this. FORGE exists
as a prototype inside MacRelix, so you can play with this concept while
using MacRelix.</p>

feel like crap today, the Knicks were blown out by the Indiana team, the
series is tied 2-2 but it feels much worse. The headline in the
<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/12/pacers-blow-out-knicks-tie-series/">Daily
News</a> reads “Pacers blow depleted, dead-legged Knicks out of the
water in Game 4, tie series 2-2.” Yeah. I don’t know how we recover from
this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. “It’s
been a great season, but we’re tired. We’re headed to the beach, we’ll
see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support.” I would nod my
head and say “Yeah that makes sense.” Whatever. I may spend today

<p>Lately I’ve started using streaming library by default instead of the
utilities in Data.List. The standard manipulation functions for list are
part of the Haskell Report and are a staple of every introductory
Haskell tutorial, but I’m over it. I don’t think they’re very useful for
everyday programming, and I don’t even think they’re great as an
introductory topic either.</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos&quot;&gt;migrate my photo library from Apple&#39;s now-defunct Aperture to Photos&lt;/a&gt;, so I could take advantage of Apple&#39;s iCloud Photo Library (don&#39;t worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple&#39;s iCloud originals).&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models,
their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like
Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work
with the new camera models.
</p>
<p>
I don’t envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple’s official
successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits
as a semi-decent library organizer), they’ve <em>generally</em> done
well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS
17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.

<p>This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s
Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &amp; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest

Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I
suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good
intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric
shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make
mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two
parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames
(including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a
testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision
Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult
than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if
you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an

almanac</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Window management in Emacs gets a bad rap. Some of this is deserved,
but mostly this is a consequence of combining a very flexible and
granular layout system with rather coarse controls. This leaves the door
open to creating and using tools for handling windows that employ and
provide better metaphors and affordances. As someone who’s spent an
unnecessary amount of time trying different approaches to window
management in Emacs over the decades, I decided to summarize them here.
Almanac might be overstating it a bit – this is a primer to and a
collection of window management resources and tips. ↫ Karthik
Chikmagalur I honestly had no idea Emacs was this… Advanced, complex,
and feature-laden. I mean, I thought Emacs’ complexity was just a meme,
but reading this article it seems the memes don’t do it justice.</p>

I just put one idea on my blog for a day and leave it at that because I
think the idea is important enough on its own, and that any explanation
would dilute it. Yesterday’s one sentence
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was
based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their
executive editor in a recent
<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>,
who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not
reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion
leaders, to determine what they cover, that’s marketing, not journalism.
Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over
another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is
not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my
readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept
this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their
responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the
tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the

<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I’m never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It’s real, it’s
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by “green” I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we’re not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn’t help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here’s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there’s no “thinking it through” when things are
so complex unless you’re a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don’t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.

The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there’s an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don’t know what to do. But also: there’s your answer if
you’re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
This is why a public “chain of trust” needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don’t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)

<p>People usually say that I’m a pleasure to work with and that I’ve a
highly collaborative spirit. The fact that I’m good at teamwork doesn’t
mean that it comes naturally to me. Quite on the contrary, being a good
teammate is a skill that I constantly need to train and refine. The
following are things I remind myself on a daily basis, à la Dune’s inner
monologues, to be a better teammate at work.</p>

<h2 id="apple-ii-desktop-currently-testing-1.4-alpha-releases">Apple II
DeskTop currently testing 1.4 alpha releases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Disassembly and enhancements for Apple II DeskTop (a.k.a. Mouse
Desk), a “Finder”-like GUI application for 8-bit Apples and clones with
128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics (560×192),
an optional mouse, and the ProDOS 8 operating system. ↫ Apple II DeskTop
GitHub page The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer Apple II
DeskTop, and fix bugs and enhance it in the process. I didn’t actually
know that the Apple IIgs initially shipped with this instead of the 16
bit GS/OS, which is the operating system I personally associate with the
IIgs. Apple II DeskTop was largely 8 bit, and built on top of ProDOS 16,
and didn’t really take full advantage of the IIgs hardware. It wasn’t
until version 4.0 of the system software that the IIgs switched over to
GS/OS. The latest release is v1.4-alpha9, released a few days ago. Apple
II DeskTop is still entirely compatible with Apple II machines and
clones from before the IIgs, as well, and it runs in emulators, too. We
actually already covered this project a few years ago, but a reminder
that this exists never hurt anyone.</p>

using Arduino</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Lloyd Rochester Blog</p>
<p>Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino After looking through numerous
libraries and examples to control the SSD1306 with Arduino, I’ve found
nothing simple. There are some really powerful libraries with lots of
support. In this post I’ll post the simplest possible “Hello World”
example on an SSD1306 using an Arduino Due. Note, if you need to draw
shapes, lines, movement you’ll have to extend this example. Code Used in
Arduino IDE.</p>
