<p>Until January, most stories from 404 Media were available to read for

<p>The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I could
totally do without all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it’s
all about gambling. I bet it’s ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking
the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it’s so
easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give
them all your money.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of
the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to
hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way
through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series.
Makes me so happy.
</li>
<li>
Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the
site—a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new
navigation</a>, a new
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section
and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to
do.
</li>
<li>
My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month
experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I
think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable
way.
</li>
<li>
I’m hosting the
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb
Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the
link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.
</li>
<li>
I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very
familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure
will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things
here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my
20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox
is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.

government, so here’s the deal. Trump tried to overthrow the government
and he took an oath to protect the government, and therefore the 14th

Colorado.</p>

<h2 id="one-way-is-always-better-than-two">One way is always better than
two</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about
personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday’s
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847">thread</a> about
OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I
guess) said something personal and ugly.
</p>
<p>
I wonder why after all this time we can’t see how pointless it is to
have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed
through someone else’s filters, so you’re getting a huge dose of their
personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they’re
talking about.
</p>
<p>
And don’t forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">obstacle</a>
in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies
by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of
that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich
companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to
interop without the cost of interop.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always
trying to compromise. It’s not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS
that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed,
but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same
format, RSS.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had
the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of
four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to
be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of
professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at
the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and
2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the
entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in
the steady stream of announcements in the archive of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and
responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of
the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do
that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires
two, one person can’t collaborate on their own. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but sometimes people don’t look for the other party who made
compromise possible.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think even the people who were closest to it at the time
understood the move. And I don’t think very many appreciate the power
that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet
project to attain unity.
</p>
<p>
One way of doing something is always better than two. That’s just a
restatement of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.">Postel’s
Postulate</a>. Be conservative in what you send.
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively.
Every time you add something that already exists we’re all going to pay
for it.
</p>
<p>
If you think that saying this makes me
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous">cantankerous</a> –
well, I say okay – but you’re wrong because it’s generous and brilliant
to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don’t like to
hear they’re doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating
complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that.
Complexity is a force against interop.
</p>
<p>
We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create
something greater than anything any one of us can create.

history of all Windows UI frameworks and libraries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The official way to create user interfaces for the Windows operating
system changed quite a lot of times during the last years. Microsoft
created and (partially or fully) abadoned a lot of APIs which where
intended to replace the respective previous ones. They changed names and
ways how it’s supposed to be done a few times, and left a lof of
developers confused. Here is a small historical overview. ↫ Nikolaus
Gebhardt If you’re ever wondering how we ended up at a situation where,
on the desktop and in Explorer, context menus have their own context
menus, well, this is why.</p>

X.org and Wayland in one paragraph</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Wayland and X.org are both part of freedesktop. Whatever maintenance
is still happening on X.org is mostly being done by people who primarily
work on Wayland. There isn’t some kind of holy war going on between The
Wayland Developers who want to kill X.org, and The X.org Developers who
believe it is great and want to keep it. They’re nearly all the same
people, and they all want X.org to die. AFAIK there isn’t anybody who is
actually clamoring to <em>do the work of maintaining X.org
upstream</em>. There are people who don’t want it to die because Wayland
doesn’t yet have the features they need or the NVIDIA proprietary driver
doesn’t work well on Wayland or whatever, but AFAIK, none of those
people is actually volunteering to maintain X.org long-term. ↫ Adam
Williamson There’s really no clearer summary of the current state of
affairs than this.</p>

Desktops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux
spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity,
we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to
offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where
it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore
we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss
rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins. ↫ Joseph Gayoso for
Fedora Magazine You can get pretty much any major desktop environment as
an rpm-ostree (inaccurately referred to as ‘immutable’) version of
Fedora, so it makes sense to standardise the naming scheme.</p>

id="accidentally-making-windows-vanish-in-my-old-fashioned-unix-x-environment">Accidentally
making windows vanish in my old-fashioned Unix X environment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the somewhat odd things about my old fashioned X Window System
environment is that when I ‘iconify’ or ‘minimize’ a window, it (mostly)
winds up as an actual icon on my root window (what in some environments
would be called the desktop), in contrast to the alternate approach
where the minimized window is represented in some sort of taskbar. I
have strong opinions about where some of these icons should go, and some
tools to automatically arrange this for various windows, including the
GNU Emacs windows I (now) use for reading email. ↫ Chris Siebenmann
Iconification should be possible in any modern desktop environment, and
it’s sad that this paradigm has pretty much entirely vanished. I would
love for iconified windows to be treated essentially the same way as
files, so you can move them around, drop them inside directories, and
even move them from one computer to another (assuming they have the
application in question installed). If I’m working on a project, and I
have a bunch of LibreOffice documents, spreadsheets, browser tabs, notes
in a text editor, some images open, and so on, I should be able to
iconify them all, keep them in the project’s directory, and de-iconify
them as if nothing had ever happened. Right now, you have to use files
and application states for that, which is cumbersome and annoying.
Sadly, advanced window management is dying. Shame.</p>

<p>
So, recently I’ve been rereading old journal entries, which is
<em>always</em> playing with fire a bit, but this time I decided to try
this new thing where I ONLY read the fuckin’ hilarious entries (and the
sexy ones, after a certain point) and none of the traumatic ones and oh
my god, this way is so much better. There’s so much shit I completely
forgot about. Why is it always the bad memories that stick in your mind,
and never the good ones! Feeling a bit of nostalgic sorrow now, but
still, this has been good fun.
