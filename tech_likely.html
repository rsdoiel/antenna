One thing that’s great about ChatGPT is they can help you make a
decision in an area you lack expertise and where there is no human you
can ask for help making the decision. It’s making this human smarter,
and it’s hard to see the downside of that.

Here’s an
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/be9ca3a4-4e74-4fe0-a778-d5595fe8482d">example</a>.
I’m trying to decide whether I should get size 11 rental ski boots or
size 11.5. The person behind the counter at the rental place isn’t
capable of having a long conversation about this, where I get to ask two
follow-up questions.

<p>
Instead they would say sorry, what size did you say you wanted sir?

<h2 id="the-surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility">The
surprising truth about pixels and accessibility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Should web developers use pixels or ems/rems for accessible fonts?
It’s an emotionally-charged question because there are a lot of
conflicting opinions out there, and it can be overwhelming. Maybe you’ve
heard that rems are better for accessibility. Or maybe you’ve heard that
the problem is fixed and pixels are fine? The truth is, if you want to
build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels
and ems/rems. It’s not an either/or situation. There are circumstances
where rems are more accessible, and other circumstances where pixels are
more accessible. ↫ Joshua Comeau The linked article isn’t just an
explanation of why, but also a tutorial.</p>

sells training data to unnamed AI company ahead of IPO</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Reddit has signed a contract
allowing an unnamed AI company to train its models on the site’s
content, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as
the social media platform nears the introduction of its initial public
offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next month. Reddit
initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be worth $60 million a
year, earlier in 2024 to potential investors of an anticipated IPO,
Bloomberg said. The Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could
serve as a model for future agreements with other AI companies. ↫ Benj
Edwards at Ars Technica Properly paying for the content you’re feeding
into your “AI” model is a huge improvement over just taking it without
users’ consent, but it does add yet another area of concern for users of
all kinds of platforms. Whatever you write, create, or post might be fed
into “AI” models without you ever realising it, and while the platform
you use gets paid for that, you aren’t. In any event, OSNews is not
selling your comments to an “AI” company, but with how old we are,
there’s no doubt both your comments and our stories have already found
their way into countless “AI” black holes.</p>

<h2 id="ghostbsd-24.01.1-released">GhostBSD 24.01.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>This new release is based on FreeBSD 14.0-STABLE. Update Station got
a significant change to upgrade to a major FreeBSD version, allowing
upgrading GhostBSD from 13.2-STABLE to 14.0-STABLE. Also, a major change
to the installer is the user created is an admin, and the root user gets
the same password as the admin. If the admin password is changed after
the installation, the root password will not change. ↫ GhostBSD’s
website GhostBSD is a user-friendly, desktop-first ‘distribution’ of
FreeBSD – a project which, in my humble view, should be part of the
FreeBSD project-proper. With some old-time Linux feeling a sense of
disenfranchisement towards Linux due to things like Wayland and systemd,
FreeBSD could serve as an excellent alternative, and an official
desktop-first ISO could play a role in that. Of course, that’s not
exactly core to FreeBSD’s mission, and they really shouldn’t be
listening to idiots like me, but I think it’s an idea worth
pondering.</p>

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">My
TODO list is a .txt file on the desktop</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;About six months ago, I finally reached a breaking point: my email-based TODO system stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
It was beyond its breaking point for a few years, actually… ever since I
my average daily email volume increase from maybe 5-10 ‘important’
emails to deal with to 50+.
</p>
<p>
My email-based TODO system used to go like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Email myself things I deemed important enough to do the next day
</li>
<li>
Next morning, when I checked my email, knock off the top item in that
list, and try to work down the list a bit
</li>
<li>
Anything else, forward that email again for the next day
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once an item got maybe 5-10 <code>Fwd:</code>s in the Subject line, I
would decide whether to nix the TODO item entirely, or move it off into
a Trello board—in either case, likely to be forgotten forever.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t say the system was <em>good</em>.
</p>
<p>
But it did work, before my inbox became full of <em>actually important
stuff</em> relating to running my business.

<p>Tim Hardwick: If you press and hold the + button, you will be dropped

deemed a “gatekeeper” messaging platform by the European

documented source code for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>This site contains reconstructed source code for Lander, David
Braben’s epic game for the Acorn Archimedes, with every single line
documented and (for the most part) explained. Lander was the very first
game to be released for the ARM processor, and it is both a milestone
and a masterpiece. My hope is that this site will be useful for those
who want to learn more about Lander and what makes it tick. It is
provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping
people appreciate the second classic game from this legend of 3D coding
(the first classic being Elite, of course). ↫ Mark Moxon An incredibly
valuable resource.</p>

are people willing to work on making the systems work together in new
interesting ways. That’s what it’s going to take – we have to capture
the imaginations of the smartest web writers. And the only thing that’s
going to get their attention is developers working together to create
new experiences for everyone. Now I believe it’s going to happen.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/293">Random
thought</a> – maybe the fastest way to get full ActivityPub support for
WordPress is to offer a feature in any WP site to cross-post to a
Mastodon gateway operated by Automattic. It’s possible I don’t
understand the problem of course. But Mastodon is open source, so it’s
not like depending on another vendor to do this for you. And then you
avoid all the hassles with having to say what part of the protocol is
ActivityPub and what part is Mastodon’s API.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
mostly kept Trump off the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a>
of this blog since he left office in 2021, but things are changing, and
this is shaping up as a Trump year. I read today in the NYT that the
resistance
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&smid=url-share">is
exhausted</a>. Bullshit. We’re very well rested. Anyway I look forward
to once again, pretending Trump doesn’t exist, next year or the year
after, Murphy-willing.
</p>
<p>
The other day when I was skiing at
<a href="https://www.belleayre.com/">Belleayre</a>, I got to ride up on
a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it
wasn’t a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from
Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but
they deserve to live too. He said he didn’t get vaccinated, he doesn’t
like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath.
I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a
house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least
twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured
appendix at 9 years old. I also said you’re really lucky not to have
needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to
myself but didn’t say out loud that what about your parents and
grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly
healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real
anger, but – you also can’t walk away from the other person. There’s a
lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.

makes so much sense. A few weeks ago, my local supermarket converted to
a “Woolworths Metro” store, and I had no idea what the implications of
that were, except that they stopped stocking some stuff I actually want
and need (cooking ingredients, mainly) in favour of expanding their
range of potato chips. <em>Now</em> I see why they’ve done this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[W]hile Woolworths supermarkets are subject to a flat pricing system —
which means all products except fresh produce are sold at the same price
wherever you are in the country — the same does not apply to Metros.

<p>I’ve used NixOS and Morph to manage the servers in my house for about
a year now, and while I have many gripes with both the Nix language and
the documentation around the nixpkgs and NixOS ecosystem, it’s been a
great help. This post is for users of Morph and its near-drop-in
replacement, Colmena. If you don’t already use one of these tools, take
a look at them first! Why Pin nixpkgs?</p>

I don’t have a concrete plan, but to run Swift user code on iGodot I am
contemplating a few options:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>exploring the LLVM interpreter to run the code<br />- exploring
compiling to wasm and bridge wasm
</p>
<p>
I suspect SIL is too fluid to build and interpreter for.
</p>
<p>
Any other options that might be on the table?

<h2 id="were-in-valais-again">2024-02-18 We’re in Valais again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-18, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-18 We’re in Valais again
</h1>
<p>
Oh yeah. Hiking down on the valley floor. There’s a nice dry forest.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Pfynwald or Bois de Finges is a natural reserve and one of the
largest continuous Scots pine forests of Europe. It is located on the
language border between German- and French-speaking Valais, Switzerland,
on the alluvial cone below the Illgraben valley. –
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfynwald">Pfynwald</a>, on
Wikipedia
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The trail started along site names like Hexenplatz (witche’s square) and
Galgenweg (gallow way). Creepy.
</p>
<p>
The forest was nice, though. Very different from the forest we have
around Zürich.
</p>
<p>
It is dry and coniferous.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A trail leads through a dry forest with snow covered mountains in the
back.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The trail continues.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illgraben">Illgraben</a>. It is
very unstable. Wikipedia says there are mudflows two or three times a
year.
</p>
<p>
No water is visible but there’s a big scar in the ground.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking into the Illgraben we see how the edge keeps crumbling. There’s
a barrier made of twigs whenever the trail comes close to the edge.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This is the Bhutan bridge, designed by engineers and blessed by priests
living in France. It is a result of 2002 being the
<a href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/263509">International Year
of Mountains</a>. It’s a hanging bridge that crosses the Illgraben.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, there are actually tracks of some sort of construction
vehicle in the valley.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We saw some <em>Hepatica nobilis</em> (Leberblümchen).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-8.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-9.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A rock covered in moss.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A huge rock cliff rising behind the forest.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A tree felled by beavers. We loved that water-logged part of the hike.
We didn’t see any beavers, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-13.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There were two stone towers we saw. I fear these were built for hermits.
What a shit way to spend the few days you have in life.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-14.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
As the sun begins to set, we see the industrial zone of Sierre.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-02-18-wallis-again-15.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Just as we were about to leave the forest, we saw <em>Pulsatilla
vulgaris</em> (Küchenschelle).

<h2 id="on-dreams-and-goals">On dreams and goals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-18, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I don’t know about you but I spent most of my life not knowing what I
wanted to do. I never had dreams or big goals. Never had a dream job,
never aimed for something specific. I spent most of my life drifting
through it, without trying to stir the ship all that much. I don’t know
why I did it, it’s probably because of the kind of person I am. I never
knew what I wanted to do, but I think I do now. It only took me 34
years, 7 months, and 12 days.
</p>
<p>
Over the past couple of years, my mind has slowly pieced things
together. I stumbled on this profession of website maker almost at
random and in the same random way I found myself starting a blog. I had
no idea what I was doing back then, and I still don’t, to be totally
honest with you. This blog is a bizarre mix of rants and half-baked
thoughts on whatever topic is floating in my mind at any given moment.
</p>
<p>
But through this mix of random events, I stumbled on something great. I
stumbled on you. Yes, you, the person reading this. You represent
everything that’s great about the web and personal websites. You are a
gateway through which I can access new places, and new realities. You
are an opportunity to learn new things, and to expand my horizons.
</p>
<p>
Being able to interact with people is by far the best outcome of this
website. And I think more people should be able to experience that.
Because it’s important. And that’s my goal. That’s what I decided I want
to try to do more of. I want to try, as much as I can, to help people go
online with a personal website they own. That’s why I made
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms">that list of blog
platforms the other day</a>, that’s also why I’m going to make available
a few blog designs I coded a while back. But it’s also why I’m going to
keep encouraging people to ditch social media, and why I’m going to
spend time replying to every single person that gets in touch with me.
And it’s also why I’m going to start designing and coding bespoke
websites, for free. I’m not going to be able to make a ton of those
unfortunately because, as you can imagine, I have to earn money somehow,
and that somehow is doing client work that will consume most of my days.
</p>
<p>
The title of this post mentions dreams though, not just goals. The goal
is to spend as much time as possible helping people ditching social
media and going online with personal websites. The dream is for that to
be my actual full-time job. A job that’s entirely supported by the
kindness and the generosity of the people who decide to join my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">One a Month</a>
membership thingy.
</p>
<p>
Can that dream become a reality? Hard for me to say. As of right now,
some very generous people are providing around 5% of what I need to earn
every month to live my normal life and I’m incredibly grateful for that.
</p>
<p>
That’s my goal, that’s my dream. I’m genuinely happy to have finally
figured it out and I’m grateful to the people who have helped me come to
this realization. You can expect more weird experiments in the upcoming
months and if you need help going online with your website, please,
<a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">get in touch</a>. I’m happy to
help. And if you can and want to support this bizarre life mission,
consider joining the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a
Month club</a>.

trying out using various social networks to start threads. Still going
to use GitHub for serious stuff, but the last few days, some of my posts
on Mastodon and Twitter have gotten unexpected interest. Not sure what
to attribute it to, some people have theories, but why not just go with
the flow.</p>

<p>
I was talking with
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@splitbrain" title="@splitbrain@octodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="splitbrain">@splitbrain</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> about git logs. I
claimed the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Git does not have wiki culture. If I could rebase and squash and edit to
my hearts delight, that would work for me. But git has blockchain
culture: write once, append only, no take-backs, and I don’t like it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason I say this is because the artefact I’m interested in is the
git log as a readable text. When I need to upgrade software such as
Mojolicious or GoToSocial, I often look at a release page, but I hardly
every look at the details. I don’t care for long lists of issues and I
certainly do not read the git log.
</p>
<p>
My claim is that the git log is useless for the purposes of learning
about new features added or migrations to run during upgrades. And my
own commit logs are just as useless because I don’t dare edit and squash
the history. The git log is simply a comment for the edits made to the
code and does not serve as a replacement for release notes, as far as I
am concerned.
</p>
<p>
So, while it is true that the wiki history is not edited either, the
wiki text as the readable end-product is in fact edited. The git log and
its messages are not.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’m an undisciplined programmer who is convinced the feature is
done and then discovers an edge case, and the I realize I forgot the
docs, and then I find a better way to describe it, oh and here is a test
that makes sense, oh and I found a typo and here is a grammar fix. It’s
hard for me to know when the feature is done-done. There never is a good
point where I think to myself: Now is a good point to merge.
</p>
<p>
This is just like buying and selling stock. It is hard to know what the
future brings. All that you can do is try and make sure there are no
catastrophic failures when things go wrong.
</p>
<p>
The Perl code archive (CPAN) suggests a <code>Changes</code> file. I
think I’ll try that.

<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> left the

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Git does not have wiki culture. […] But git has blockchain culture
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s not quite what you started with. I said git has wiki culture. Git
makes the entire software world one big wiki. I had just been reflecting
on that earlier, finally having fixed* a long standing bug in markdowku.
That’s such a marvel to me, that thanks to git I could make a version
that works for me and my friends and I could send the fix upstream so
they could apply it or not. When I see a typo or error on a webpage, if
that webpage is a wiki, I can fix, I can fix! And thanks to git, it
makes even more things be like wikis in that regard.
</p>
<p>
Git is not a linear line of append append append. It’s a flexible bowl
of paperclips, malleable, friendly, it helps me, it’s my friend. If
upstream doesn’t merge I’m still gonna be OK. I love git. Don’t slag it.
</p>
<p>
And the log isn’t just linear either: it makes the source repo be like a
wiki in that there’s both a global “recent changes” and a local “page
history” for each file, even each line with a good blame viewer.
</p>
<p>
Now, is documentation outside of the log, for migrations for example, a
good idea? Yes. We want README and INSTALL and TODO and COPYING, we want
docs. Never disputed that.
</p>
<p>
*: here’s hoping 🤞🏻

Sandra is right, of course. The original conversation went something

user-visible changes for Oddmu, my wiki/blog/memex/static site

all I know is that I never look at git log of other projects

<dt>
Sandra

<dd>
git log of other projects is like 99% of my reading
</dd>
<dt>
Alex
</dt>
<dd>
wow, sounds like IT hell! Or perhaps my own commit log is just so badly
written. And the only commits I know are from the office and they are
the worst.

<dt>
Sandra
</dt>
<dd>
Git logs are wiki culture

Alex

If I could rebase and squash and edit to my hearts delight, that would
work for me. But git has blockchain culture, write once, append only, no
take-backs, and I don’t like it. So effectively I’d like a user-facing
Changes file.

DESIRE</h2>

<p>If you haven’t started to watch Jack and Alice on Channel 4
television, I recommend you do so. Catch it by whatever means. Not soon.
Not tomorrow. Now. But, if you must put it off, go first to St James’s
Park or some comparable place where you can observe the pelicans. Love
is in the air and the pelicans are feeling it. Watch pelicans mate - in
particular watch the large male fasten his beak, in what looks like an
act of murder, about the neck of the sedentary female - and you realise
how much you have still to learn about the mysteries of desire. Then run
home and catch</p>

<h2 id="running-gnu-on-dos-with-djgpp">Running GNU on DOS with
DJGPP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>I remember using DJGPP back in the 1990s before I had been exposed to
Linux and feeling that it was a strange beast. Compared to the Microsoft
C Compiler and Turbo C++, the tooling was bloated and alien to DOS, and
the resulting binaries were huge. But DJGPP provided a complete
development environment for free, which I got from a monthly magazine,
and I could even look at its source code if I wished. You can’t imagine
what a big deal that was at the time. But even if I could look under the
cover, I never did. I never really understood why was DJGPP so strange,
slow, and huge, or why it even existed. Until now. As I’m in the mood of
looking back, I’ve spent the last couple of months figuring out what the
foundations of this software were and how it actually worked. Part of
this research has resulted in the previous two posts on DOS memory
management. And part of this research is this article. Let’s take a
look! ↫ Julio Merino Having access to tools such as this, including the
source code, must’ve been a huge deal to a lot of people, even if ti was
“strange, slow, and huge” as the author notes.</p>
