Scripting News</strong> (date: 2024-05-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting
News)</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to create a
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> news service for your
friends or co-workers, and it’ll plug into a lot of the stuff we’re
working on now for presenting news without requiring people to learn a
feed reader. That’s a bridge too far for many people. In other words,
your understanding of feeds (RSS, Atom, etc) can be of service to
others. And by collecting useful sources of news, maybe even insightful
ones, we can help upgrade the quality of news we all get. The first step
is to learn how to use FeedLand, and
<a href="https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md">it’s pretty
easy</a>, esp if you already understand feeds. And with categories and
OPML subscription lists, you can organize your feed reading everywhere,
not just in FeedLand.</p>

id="cosmic-improves-its-application-store-display-mirroring-and-more">COSMIC
improves its application store, display mirroring, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly
update about COSMIC, System76’s new Linux desktop environment written in
Rust. This month, they’ve further polished and shored up their
application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it’s
supposedly incredibly fast – something I can’t say for its GNOME and KDE
counterparts, which tend to be so slow I’ve always just defaulted to
updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has
support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage
like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text
editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways
as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for
icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more
tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of
issues with colour selection being too dark. There’s also display
mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have
different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now
also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now
also selling ARM servers. There’s also a bunch of work being done by the
community as the alpha release nears.</p>

windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being
replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from
the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which
require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and
create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file
and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it
fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each
other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in
the process of going, it’s still an incredibly powerful set of tools
that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has
come with its own window manager – twm – for decades, and it includes
several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is
actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to
desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It’s
quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there’s anyone out there
unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without
advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on,
it’s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and
applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn’t
be surprising – it’s the X Window System, after all – but you so rarely
hear or read about it that you’d almost forget and just assume something
like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.</p>

<p>We’ve been on the lookout for the arrival of the ChromeOS App Mall

is arriving to do one, simple task: put the apps users want in one place
to be found a Chromebook. While we have access to web apps, PWAs,
Android apps and Linux apps on Chromebooks, it’s not always clear how to
go about finding them. Should you install the web version or the Play
Store version? Which Play Store apps install a PWA versus an Android
app? Where should you go to find the right one for you? ↫ Robby Payne at

<h2 id="i-bought-a-steam-deck">I Bought a Steam Deck</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
A couple of days I posted about
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2024/05/getting-back-into-the-sims-games.html">wanting
to get back into The Sims (2 &amp; 4)</a>. What I didn’t mention then,
that I will now, is I’d kinda been wanting to get back into casual
gaming already. I’ve never been a real Gamer™ exactly, but I have
purchased a bunch of indie games through Steam and itch.io over the
years, and spent a fair bit of time… you know… casually gaming. For the
most part I like turn-based
<abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr>, simulation games, and the
occasional puzzle game. Nothing with too grim or dreary an atmosphere.
And, of course, I’ve only really played games on computers (well, and
the occasional mobile game, I guess). My parents never let us have a
gaming console growing up, and with my disability it’s too hard to use a
controller anyway – my right hand just isn’t dexterous enough to operate
its side of the controls.
</p>
<p>
When I was playing a lot of indie games between about 2018–2020, I
mostly did so on a desktop computer, running Linux. Not only did a ton
of indie games support Linux natively, but Steam rolled out an embedded
implementation of Wine called Proton, so most games <em>without</em>
official Linux versions worked on Linux, too. I mean, in 2017 I’d been
using PlayOnLinux to play <cite>The Sims 4</cite>, so I already knew
Wine wasn’t too bad by that time, but I guess Steam’s real triumph was
in rolling the compatibility layer into the client, moving a lot of the
hassle behind the scenes and out of the player’s way. Even though I
haven’t been playing games so much since 2020, as I understand it,
Proton has just got better and smoother ever since, such that these days
the only games that really don’t work with it are always-online
multiplayer games with kernel-level anticheat, which I don’t play,
anyway. At any rate, even five years ago, life as a Linux-using indie
gamer was good.
</p>
<p>
<em>But</em>, time passes. I stopped being able to use that desktop so
much when a) the monitor broke and, because it was within warranty, I
spent a couple of months working through the warranty process with the
retailer instead of just buying a new one; and b) Viv started working
from home a lot when the Covid pandemic began, and commandeered that
desk and computer for himself. I started using a MacBook Air as my
primary computer, and switching back and forth between it and the
desktop was a bit of a hassle, and since the only thing the desktop was
really <em>better</em> for was playing games, I just… stopped doing that
so much. I could still play a number of games on the Mac anyway… just
not the more demanding ones, but also not the ones <em>so</em>
undemanding that they only had 32-bit versions, and definitely not the
ones that lack native Mac versions. (There’s no equivalent of Proton for
Mac.) But a few games, sure.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, getting to the Steam Deck. It had been playing on my mind for a
while that I really did have this backlog of games that I should
probably work through at some point. The desktop has become really
inconvenient to use (and as I mentioned in the Sims post, its Linux
install is currently not even working properly, for reasons I have not
been able to work out), and my MacBook Air isn’t designed for gaming.
I’d kind of presumed that the eventual answer would be to buy
<em>another</em> Linux computer – preferably a laptop, for the
portability – but a gaming laptop is like AUD$3000 and not even really
very portable and honestly I didn’t even <em>want</em> a whole new
computer, just a gaming device, and then one day the obvious answer
finally hit me… a Steam Deck. Duh!
</p>
<p>
Valve, for some reason, has declined to sell Steam Decks in Australia,
but you can easily buy grey-imported ones. Last week, after about a
month of dithering, I took the plunge and ordered one – one of the new
OLED screen ones, with 512GB storage space. Today, it arrived!

<p>
There are a number of reasons I think the Steam Deck is a very exciting
device. Firstly, it’s purpose-built to make it really easy to just pick
up and jump straight into a game, suspend and resume as needed, etc..
It’s all the convenience of picking up your phone to scroll social
media, except doing something that is actually fun instead of
doomscrolling social media. You can use it easily on the couch (well,
maybe not if your cat is as obsessed with sitting on your lap as mine,
but in theory). It’s just like… if one of the biggest obstacles to me
working through my game backlog is the <em>hassle</em>, the Steam Deck
should really help with that.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, it offers a lot of different ways to control your games
(D-pad, joysticks, A/B/X/Y buttons, trackpads, a touchscreen, bumper
buttons…) and <strong>they are all reconfigurable</strong>! There is
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804823261">a

Like I mentioned in my introduction paragraph, I’ve never been able to
play with a video game controller and I wanted to make sure I wasn’t
going to have any accessibility issues with the Steam Deck. Well, I’m
not sure it’d enable me to play the kinds of fast-paced action games or
high-precision platformers that I don’t feel able to play already, but
you can totally do things like tell the D-pad to work as A/B/X/Y and use
the left joystick for directions so you can control a game entirely from
the left side of the device. No problem. Plus, with any game that’s
designed to work entirely with a mouse, you can just use the
touchscreen. I think it’s really cool just how customisable the Deck is
in this regard.
</p>
<p>
And <em>thirdly</em>, I love the fact that the Steam Deck is really just
a Linux computer under the hood, after all. If you remember my post
about the Sims the other day, and how miffed I was that I couldn’t play
my copy of <cite>The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection</cite> on my Mac, you’ll
be pleased to hear that one <strong>can</strong> play it on the Steam
Deck. There is

which links to another, seemingly more detailed, guide on YouTube. The
process isn’t quite as easy as “find game in Steam store, purchase,
install” of course, but it’s doable! You can also use your Steam Deck to
play games from other online stores like itch.io or GOG, you can connect
to most providers of cloud storage you might use to share data
painlessly with your other computers, and you can install and use other
software beyond games – pretty much anything available on Linux. You can
connect peripherals like a keyboard, external monitor and mouse/touchpad
and play like on a more traditional computer if you want. It’s very
flexible. And much, much cheaper than a gaming laptop 😁

At approx. AUD$1,075, it was still a bit of a splurge, but I haven’t
treated myself to any “new shinies” since 2020, and honestly I’m excited
to get into this thing. Let’s see how it goes!

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="taichara">@taichara</span></a> pointed me
to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court
cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that
their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright
infringement. CC does not agree.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe
that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use
doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what
purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to
train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. –
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair
Use: Training Generative AI</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess I don’t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA
thing and I don’t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don’t say
“this material is fine for AI training” – so whether this is fine or not
will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be
working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for
AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the
license. There is no automatic upgrade option.
</p>
<p>
This is why I feel fine.
</p>
<p>
Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, “Yeah, well, that’s just,
like, their opinion…”
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still
get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI
training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can
still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise
prices on electricity and water. The fight isn’t over. Not by a long
shot.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values
and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI
training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in
the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers
trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our
understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the
trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations
exercising their rights.”
</p>
<p>
The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this
approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or
that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for
the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and
authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people
double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The
communities where these corporations build their computing centres
suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the
computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing
centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is
required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is
delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste
ends up on our lands.
</p>

a powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor… no highly
esteemed deed is commemorated here… nothing valued is here. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages">Long-term

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit
slop that’s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in
customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites
degrading. The corporations don’t mind that they’re feeding us slop as
long as they are making money.
</p>
<p>
We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich.
They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don’t pay
the taxes they ought to pay and then they don’t deliver on the jobs, and
the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we’d prefer to be
creative and free. We thought we’d be writing and painting all day while
the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the
writing and painting, badly!
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge
required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don’t read about it
in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their
experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press
releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory
capture works.
</p>
<p>
So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for
the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force
them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our
company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the
technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it
all into AI slop. It is revolting.
</p>
<p>
And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from
training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are
still wrong.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@eloquence" title="@eloquence@social.coop"><span
class="citation" data-cites="eloquence">@eloquence</span></a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The folks who are calling such training “theft” might regret what they
seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright.
Copyright law won’t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from
making shady licensing deals, but they’ll prevent the free/open
community from keeping up.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s true, I don’t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still
oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mcc">@mcc</span></a> recently wrote about a
similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our
software for the benefit of our fellow humans but not necessarily to
train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the
slop.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting
preserved after I lose interest, I die, BitBucket deletes every bit of
Mercurial-hosted content it ever hosted, etc? Am I supposed to rely on
<em>Microsoft</em> to responsibly preserve my work? Holy crud no. We
<em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed.
That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But
if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people
want their code mirrored? –
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/112209218607258564">mmc</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We’re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our
software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also
circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free
software has to fight for its freedom.
</p>
<p>
This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I
look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy.
</p>
<p>
This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations
bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model
doesn’t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I
guess that’s just that. We are under no obligation to support their
business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the
world in order to improve it for all of us. We’ve been doing it for a
very long time.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to hoping for the next AI winter.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of
reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The
field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment
and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest
years or even decades later. –

<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-structure.html">single-line
comments</a> (<code>– style comments</code>) following expression.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Updating
</h2>
<p>
All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor
releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or
use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you
may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
</p>
<p>
For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish
to remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the
<code>share</code> directory of your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in
<code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it from the PostgreSQL
git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to use the
script that matches your major version:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL

<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>
From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says “raw” to download a
version that you can copy and paste.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version.
If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only
PostgreSQL 14, 15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old
to have the fix.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In each database of the cluster, run the
<code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as a database superuser. For
example, in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this
command would look like:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>/usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code> databases, or the vulnerability will still exist
in databases you create later. To fix <code>template0</code>, you’ll
need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You can do this with
the following command:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code>
</p>
<p>
After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in
<code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>, you should revoke the
ability for <code>template0</code> to accept connections. You can do
this with the following command:
</p>
<p>
<code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code>
</p>
<p>
Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run
additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier
versions for details.
</p>

<h2 id="did-github-copilot-really-increase-my-productivity">Did GitHub
Copilot really increase my productivity?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yuxuan Shui, the developer behind the X11 compositor picom (a fork of
Compton) published a blog post detailing their experiences with using
GitHub Copilot for a year. I had free access to GitHub Copilot for about
a year, I used it, got used to it, and slowly started to take it for
granted, until one day it was taken away. I had to re-adapt to a life
without Copilot, but it also gave me a chance to look back at how I used
Copilot, and reflect – had Copilot actually been helpful to me? Copilot
definitely feels a little bit magical when it works. It’s like it
plucked code straight from my brain and put it on the screen for me to
accept. Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I
need to write boilerplate code – “Ugh, Copilot would have done it for
me!”, and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the
answer to my question above is a very definite “no, I am more productive
without it”. Let me explain. ↫ Yuxuan Shui The two main reasons why Shui
eventually realised Copilot was slowing them down were its
unpredictability, and its slowness. It’s very difficult to understand
when, exactly, Copilot will get things right, which is not a great thing
to have to deal with when you’re writing code. They also found Copilot
incredibly slow, with its suggestions often taking 2-3 seconds or longer
to appear – much slower than the suggestions from the clangd language
server they use. Of course, everybody’s situation will be different, and
I have a suspicion that if you’re writing code in incredibly popular
languages, say, Python or JavaScript, you’re going to get more accurate
and possibly faster suggestions from Copilot. As Shui notes, it probably
also doesn’t help that they’re writing an independent X11 compositor,
something very few people are doing, meaning Copilot hasn’t been trained
on it, which in turn means the tool probably has no clue what’s going on
when Shui is writing their code. As an aside, my opinion on GitHub
Copilot is clear – it’s quite possibly the largest case of copyright
infringement in human history, and in its current incarnation it should
not be allowed to continue to operate. As I wrote over a year ago: If
Microsoft or whoever else wants to train a coding “AI” or whatever, they
should either be using code they own the copyright to, get explicit
permission from the rightsholders for “AI” training use (difficult for
code from larger projects), or properly comply with the terms of the
licenses and automatically add the terms and copyright notices during
autocomplete and/or properly apply copyleft to the newly generated code.
Anything else is a massive copyright violation and a direct assault on
open source. Let me put it this way – the code to various versions of
Windows has leaked numerous times. What if we train an “AI” on that
leaked code and let everyone use it? Do you honestly think Microsoft
would not sue you into the stone age? ↫ Thom Holwerda It’s curious that
as far as I know, Copilot has not been trained on Microsoft’s own
closed-source code, say, to Windows or Office, while at the same time
the company claims Copilot is not copyright infringement or a massive
open source license violation machine. If what Copilot does is truly
fair use, as Microsoft claims, why won’t Microsoft use its own
closed-source code for training? We all know the answer. Deeply
questionable legality aside, do any of you use Copilot? Has it had any
material impact on your programming work? Is its use allowed by your
employer, or do you only use it for personal projects at home?</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-connect-remote-desktop-for-your-pi">Raspberry Pi
Connect: remote desktop for your Pi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re pleased to announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi
Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi
remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser. It’s
often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop
remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do
this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can
be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a
machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition
to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support
is no longer available. We wanted to be able to provide you with this
functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry
Pi Connect. ↫ Gordon Hollingworth Pi Connect uses WebRTC, and a daemon
running on your Pi listens for incoming screensharing requests from the
Raspberry Pi website to connect the VNC server on your Pi to the VNC
client running in your browser. The service is in beta, it’s free, but
the one major downside is that for now, there’s only one TURN server for
this service, located in the UK, but they might set up more of them if
demand is high enough. If you want to try this service on your own Pi
running Raspberry Pi OS, you’re going to need to be using a Raspberry Pi
5, 4, or 400, using the latest version of the operating system running
Wayland. Update your operating system, install the rpi-connect package,
reboot, and you’re good to go.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>The U.S. has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel
and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned
Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies, three people
familiar with the matter said. ↫ Alexandra Alper, Fanny Potkin, David
Shepardson The timing of this news is very interesting, as despite the
massive sanctions the United States levied against Huawei, the company
seems to be doing really well, with its smartphone business seeing
massive gains in the Chinese market, at the expense of everyone else.
This proves that Huawei does not need access to western chips and
technologies to be successful, which must definitely sting in the US and
Europe. Strong financial results, using hardware and chips designed not
by western companies but by Chinese ones, combined with the only mobile
operating system that has any serious potential to at least somewhat
threaten Android and iOS. The various sanctions were clearly intended to
hurt Huawei and possibly contain it to just China, but it seems they’re
not having their desired effect at all.</p>

free idea for Apple that might boost their stock price. I use the
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134">Voice
Memo app</a> to take notes while I’m programming. Sometimes I talk for
as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff
out this way. I’m sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do
automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few
minutes or seconds later, there’s an email waiting for me with the text
of the memo. Now here’s how they boost the stock price. They also
provide an <i>edited</i> version of the memo, without repetition and
rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at
the end). I understand that
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/">$AAPL</a> is depressed

immediately. Huge value. I’m sure others are doing it. But Apple has the
high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the
middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my
doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I’ve owned a bunch of
Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and
I’m right.)</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetBSD 10 and NetBSD 9.4 were only recently released, leaving one
final branch to receive what will be its last update: NetBSD 8.3. NetBSD
8.0 was originally released in 2018, so this final release marks six
years of updates, which is a good track record, especially now that two
newer main releases are available to choose from. With 8.3 being the
final release, this means no more regular or security updates, pkgsrc no
longer supports the 8.0 branch either – so yeah, time to upgrade. NetBSD
8.3 brings various updates and bug fixes for libX11, xterm, tmux, and
httpd, and the root name servers and time zone data have been updated to
their latest iterations as well. There’s of course a full list of
changes to peruse through if you want to know every little detail that’s
changed. You can update your installation in-place, of course, or
download the installation media for 8.3 from one of the many
mirrors.</p>

<h2 id="lpcamm2-memory-is-finally-here">LPCAMM2 memory is finally
here</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this
looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable,
upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips
for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or
under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs,
you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more
RAM as needed. Imagine that! ↫ Carsten Frauenheim LPDDR memory, used in
modern laptops, has been difficult – or impossible – to upgrade because
its low power nature means it needs to be located as close to the
processor as possible with short traces, since the longer the traces,
the more power is needed to maintain signal integrity between the
processor and RAM. This would defeat the entire purpose of low-power DDR
memory to begin with. Originally developed by Dell and eventually
adopted by JEDEC and the wider industry, LPCAMM2 solves this problem by
using screw-down RAM modules located right next to the processor. These
modules can, like regular memory modules, be replaced and upgraded when
needed or desired. This is a great leap forward, and I really, really
hope we’re going to see quick, widespread adoption.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>GCC 14.1 has been released, and it should come as no surprise that
the new features are not exactly something I, someone who doesn’t
program, can properly parse. So, here’s the three items GCC itself
thought were important to list first. The C frontend when targeting
standards newer than C89 now considers many non-standard constructs as
errors that were previously only warnings. See
https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html#warnings-as-errors for more
details. C23 _BitInt Bit-precise integer types are now supported, for
now only on IA-32, x86-64 and AArch64. The C++ frontend now implements
several C++26 features, some missing C++23 bits and defect report
resolutions. Diagnostics involving C++ templates now quote source from
the instantiation context. The libstdc++exp.a library now includes all
symbols for the Filesystem TS and the experimental symbols for the C++23
std::stacktrace class, so -lstdc++exp can be used instead of -lstdc++fs.
The libstdc++_libbacktrace.a library is not longer installed. Improved
experimental support for C++20, C++23, and C++26. Updated parallel
algorithms that are compatible with oneTBB. ↫ GCC 14.1 release
announcement GCC 14.1 is available for download, of course, but most of
us will get it once it hits our distribution’s package repositories.</p>

Overflow signs deal with OpenAI, bans users trying to alter answers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re all aware of Stack Overflow – it’s a place where programmers
and regular users can ask technical questions, and get answers from
anyone who thinks they know the answer. Stack Overflow has become so
ubiquitous among programmers and developers, the concept of “I just
copied the code off Stack Overflow” has become a consistent meme to
indicate you don’t fully grasp how something works, but at least it
works. If you’ve ever contributed answers to Stack Overflow, you might
want to consider deleting them, altering them, or perhaps even go as far
as request a GDPR removal if you’re in the European Union, because Stack
Overflow has just announced a close partnership with “AI” company OpenAI
(or, more accurately, “Open” “AI”). Stripped of marketing speak, the
gist is exactly as you’d expect: OpenAI will absorb the questions and
answers on Stack Overflow into its models, whether their respective
authors like it or not. As much as you may want to try and delete your
answers if you’re not interesting in having your work generate profit
for OpenAI, deleting popular questions and answers is not possible on
Stack Overflow. The other option is altering your answers to render them
useless, but it seems Stack Overflow is not going to allow you to do
this, either. Ben Humphreys tried to alter his highest-rated answers,
and Stack Overflow just reverted them back, and proceeded to ban him
from the platform. Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that
have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge
from the community. So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a
protest message. Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and
suspended my account for 7 days. ↫ Ben Humphreys Now that they’ve made
what is most likely an incredibly lucrative deal with OpenAI that’s
going to net Stack Overflow’s owners boatloads of money, they obviously
can’t let users delete or alter their answers to lower the monetary
value of Stack Overflow’s content. Measures to prevent deletion or
alteration are probably one of the clauses in the agreement between
Stack Overflow and OpenAI. So there’s likely not much you can do to not
have your answers sucked into OpenAI, but you should at least be aware
it’s happening in case of future answers you might want to
contribute.</p>

Raspberry Pi today launched
<a href="https://connect.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a
free remote VPN service for all Pi OS users.
</p>
<p>
If you create a <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi
ID</a>, you can sign up for Connect, install <code>rpi-connect</code> on
a Pi 4 or 5 running 64-bit Pi OS 12 ‘Bookworm’, and register that Pi
with the service.
</p>
<p>
Then, on any other device’s web browser, you can log in and remote
control your Pi through Connect’s web-based VNC viewer.

The VNC server is based on
<a href="https://github.com/any1/wayvnc">wayvnc</a>, and the Connect
service allows for as many registered Pis as you want (though I’m
guessing the interface is optimized for the majority use case of one or
a few).

using bhyve</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>I want to run GoToSocial on some *BSD system. Because I am who I am,
I went for using NetBSD 10.0 . And because my hypervisor is running
bhyve on OmniOS , you get the title of this blog post. Don’t get too
anxious, it is quite straightforward. So let the journey begin. ↫ Joel
Carnat Bhyve is a hypervisor originating from FreeBSD, while OmniOS is a
distribution of illumos, a continuation of the last open source Solaris
release from Oracle. GoToSocial, meanwhile, is an ActivityPub social
network server, so it belongs in the same family as Mastodon, Glitch,
Akkoma, and countless others. This guide makes this whole process look
like a piece of cake, so if you’ve ever been interested in running your
own ActivityPub server – read on. On a slightly related sidenote,
there’s no OSNews AT instance, partly because I don’t want to deal with
the moderation and costs, and partly because I’m incredibly happy being
a member of Exquisite, a Glitch instance running on OpenBSD, managed by
OpenBSD enthusiasts. Never say never, of course, but the odds of seeing
an OSNews AT instance in the future are very slim.</p>

<h2 id="getting-back-into-the-sims-games">Getting Back Into the Sims
Games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve felt this rising tide of nostalgia
building up in me and urging me to revisit the <cite>Sims</cite> games.
I used to be an avid player of <cite>The Sims 2</cite> in the late 2000s
and early 2010s, playing legacy challenges (where you strive to play the
same family over 10 generations) and participating in the thriving
LiveJournal Sims community of the era. Around the time this nostalgic
impulse started, I stumbled upon a corner of Reddit where people are
still talking about, and playing, <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, and that in
turn got me sucked into YouTube videos such as

on the scourge of hood corruption, and how many of the things Simmers
long thought cause it actually don’t.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it made me really want to play <cite>The Sims 2</cite> again. I
do actually own the Ultimate Collection via
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> Origin, but there was a slight
problem… the computer I use is a Mac. And we do have a Linux desktop as
well, and these days Wine/Proton/etc. is so good that
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> can easily be played on that
<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> now… but somehow that install
of Linux got borked and only works in recovery mode, which is sufficient
to run the Plex server I mainly use that desktop for these days, but not
really good enough for <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. Alas.
</p>
<p>
Another option would have been to purchase Aspyr’s Mac port – the Super
Collection – for AUD$50 in the App Store. I do want to admit that in
principle (even though I already own the game on another platform) this
seems like a worthy option. Unlike
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>, Aspyr has actually put the
effort in to keep their port updated for new versions of Mac OS,
including upgrading the game to 64 bits when Apple dropped support for
32-bit applications, and updating the game again to run natively on
Apple Silicon (the M1 chips and beyond). That’s great and they deserve
to be supported for that! My reasons for not just choosing that option
are a bit on the selfish and picky side. Firstly,
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> never allowed Aspyr to port the
last couple of expansion packs (<cite>FreeTime</cite> and
<cite>Apartment Life</cite>) to Mac OS, and <cite>FreeTime</cite> in
particular is so fundamental to all my nostalgic memories of the game
(plus, packed with quality of life features) that I just don’t know that
I’m willing to play without it. Secondly, the April Black video I linked
in paragraph #1 introduced me to the fact that Macs have a hardcoded
limit of approximately 10,000 files that can be open at one time… which
can be a potential cause of corruption in <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which
was designed to draw on a large number of tiny, atomic files (e.g. every
Sim in a neighbourhood gets its own individual file) instead of large
consolidated ones. Considering that on top of that, I have a folder of
all the custom content I was using at the time I stopped playing
<cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which I actually think is pretty lean, and yet
by itself it has 4,242 files in it… yeah, I was nervous about the
possibility that playing <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on a Mac
would not be very sustainable for me. Alas.
</p>
<p>
So, I turned my sights to the newest instalment of the franchise,
<cite>The Sims 4</cite>. Now I played this version of the game quite a
bit in 2017–8, and I remember being impressed at first by the graphics
(it’s <em>so</em> much prettier than unmodded
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>) and the quality of life
improvements offered by the game engine, like better routing and Sims’
new ability to multitask. However… the shine wore off. The main issue I
had with <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> was just that it wasn’t as
<strong>fun</strong> as <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. The zany
shit that used to keep me so entertained as a teen was just so much
rarer in <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr>. Most Sims’ personalities
were so bland, with personality points gone and replaced with just
<strong>three</strong> traits (plus an aspiration trait) and no more
than a handful of those traits did anything more than “give Sims an
emotion buff sometimes”. There were no more wants and fears, just
“whims” which were rarely interesting, and nothing bad happened if you
ignored them entirely (Sims couldn’t go into aspiration failure any
more). So… I started playing a legacy in <cite>The Sims 4</cite> and did
get up to generation 6. After a couple of fun generations where I really
put effort into making my Sims generate drama, I got a generation where
my heir had TRIPLETS and my entire game became a production line of
desperately trying to build up the toddlers’ potty training skill to the
point that they could at least fucking toilet themselves and it was
literally a neverending process and none of my adult Sims were doing
anything interesting either and I got so frustrated that I just… never
opened the game again. 😅
</p>
<p>
That said, quite a few years have passed since 2017–8. It occurred to me
that more mods might’ve come out giving the Sims more personality and
making their autonomous behaviour more individualised. It also seems
like the game itself has come out with updates addressing some of the
stuff I criticised (for example they supposedly replaced whims with
wants &amp; fears again, and as of a recent expansion Sims can
“self-discover” new traits?)… basically, I started to wonder if it was
worth trying again.
</p>
<p>
So, I installed the base game via the Origin app (which supposedly
already booted off everyone in favour of
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>’s new app, but it hasn’t booted
<em>me</em> off) and started a new save. I haven’t got very far into it
yet, and I’m also adding mods progressively, bit by bit, rather than
adding <strong>every</strong> “give your Sim more personality!” mod all
at once, to make the investigation easier for myself if I inadvertently
add something bugged or something that conflicts with another mod. That
said, some of the mods I’m interested in playing with are:

Now, having said all of this… I’m not sure how much it’ll satisfy that
part of me nostalgic for the Sims community on LiveJournal. Because a
big part of my fun wasn’t just <em>playing my game</em>, it was
publishing updates on my legacy and – perhaps even more important –
reading other people’s updates on their legacy. There are sooooo many
hilarious people whose legacies I used to read – hell, I started reading
them even before I owned a Windows computer to play
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on myself! – and I really also miss…
that. For nostalgia’s sake I went back to revisit some of them today,
but between Tinypic purging old pictures, Photobucket watermarking old
pictures, and LiveJournal itself becoming a gross ad-infested shell of
what it once was, it was just sad. I can put together legacy updates for
myself, and I can publish them on the internet (I even have

originally to host my pictures, but when LJ went downhill I started
backing up the actual updates there too), but… I have no idea where a
Simmer <em>shares</em> these things, these days, for potential
interested readers to find. At least in 2017–8, I knew Tumblr was
popular, but I tried searching tags like “sims 4 legacy”, “sims 4
gameplay” and so forth today and did not find a single “legacy update”
as I would think of them. Mostly I found custom content, people posting
their own challenge rules based on the original legacy challenge, and
the occasional “artsy” highly edited screenshot with no or minimal
commentary. I don’t really want contextless game screenshots… I want
funny shit. I want quirky Sims autonomously starting drama and being
hilarious! Where is that?! Or does everyone who wants that just stick
with <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>? Because like, at least I found
<strong>one</strong> active <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> legacy
posting updates on Reddit… actually I found an active
<abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> legacy on Reddit too, but it’s a bit
more serious and less “this is what happened in my game lol”. Are people
just making <em>videos</em> of that style of content now, instead of
screenshots with commentary, and posting them on YouTube? Because… I am
not going to do that. Haha.
</p>
<p>
Well… anyway… step 1 is to actually play my game, right. Experiment with
mods and see if it feels fun enough for me to persist with it. It’s sad
about the difficulty finding or sharing legacy updates, but it’s really
just an adjunct to actually playing the game anyway, I suppose.

<h2 id="the-vga-attribute-controller-is-weird">The VGA attribute
controller is weird</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>The grabber in Windows 3.1 was improved to save and restore the index
register as well, but it does not attempt to restore the flip-flop
state, which is significant. The problem with the VGA emulation was that
it erroneously applied the flip-flop state to reads from port 3C0h, and
Windows 3.1 would save the wrong index register value… but only the
second time through, because the flip-flop state was different at that
point. That is to say, the Windows 3.1 standard mode grabber read from
port 3C0h to query the attribute controller index register state, but
the emulation returned the currently selected data register contents
instead. And then, when restoring the attribute controller index
register the next time around, the register would be restored to the
wrong value which didn’t have bit 5 set, causing the screen to go blank.
↫ Michal Necasek It’s not every day that you learn how an aspect of the
workings of VGA causes a blank screen under very specific circumstances
when running Windows 3.1 in Standard mode under emulation, and that this
specific aspect of the workings of VGA was implemented to maintain
backwards compatibility with EGA. Absolutely bonkers.</p>

40x processor support to be dropped from the Linux kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>In addition to Linux 6.10 expected to drop support for very old DEC
Alpha processors (EV5 and earlier), it looks like the PowerPC 40x (early
PowerPC 400 series) processor and platform support will be retired too.
Back in 2020 was a proposal for dropping PowerPC 40x support from the
Linux kernel given that the code was orphaned for a long time with no
apparent users. The PowerPC 40x processors were found in thin clients,
set-top boxes, and other devices during the 90’s. Finally now it looks
like that the PowerPC 40x removal is set to happen. ↫ Michael Larabel
Spring cleaning in the hardware support department. I wonder what has
more users – Windows on ARM, or Linux on PowerPC 40x.</p>

Windows on ARM PCs will not be able to run Windows 11 24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows 11 supports a variety of ARM processors from Qualcomm.
According to the official documentation, you need a computer with the
Snapdragon 850 processor inside or newer to run the current operating
system officially. However, customers with PCs powered by the Snapdragon
835, the original Windows on ARM chip from 2016, can bypass hardware
requirements and install Windows 11 at their own risk. Sadly, those days
will be ending soon. Starting with Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft’s
operating system requires ARM v8.1 to run. An attempt to boot it from a
device with an ARM v8.0-based processor results in system crashes. For
reference, the Snapdragon 835 from 2016 is a chip with Kryo 280 cores,
which are derivative of ARM’s Cortex-A73 cores. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin
I’m sure all three Windows on ARM users are devastated.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Snikket is a FOSS project for creating private chat spaces for small
groups, such as families, friends, or clubs. It doesn’t depend on a
phone number, doesn’t upload address books anywhere, and doesn’t sell
data to advertisers. It supports all the features you expect, including
media and voice messages, audio and video calls, end-to-end encryption,
group messaging, and more. Use it from multiple devices at once with the
official apps, or even with unofficial, third-party apps. Snikket is
easy to self-host, and professional managed hosting is also available.
Our previous sponsor, JMP, opted to donate a free week’s sponsorship to
Snikket, which any paying OSNews sponsor can opt to do. This is our very
small way of giving something back to the countless open source and/or
smaller projects out there. Thank you Snikket for sponsoring OSNews!</p>

PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except
Data General)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>That’s right: it’s PowerPC, the most unloved of the architectures CE
ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC Windows CE device I’ve
ever found, and I’m the self-described biggest pro-PowerPC bigot in the
world. Here’s an unusual form factor Windows CE device, running on the
operating system’s least used CPU, from a storied computer company near
the end of its run, intended for medical applications, produced in very
small numbers and cancelled within months. What are we going to do with
it? Well, what do you think we’re gonna do with it? We’re going to
program it, so that we can finally have some software! And, of course,
since this wacky thing was there at the bitter end, we’ll talk more
about the last days of Data General and what happened next. ↫ Cameron
Kaiser I knew Windows CE supported PowerPC, but I never knew any
PowerPC-based Windows CE devices ever actually shipped and made it to
market. Only Windows CE 2.0 seems to have supported the architecture,
and it seems to have been eliminated in 3.0 and 4.0, so it’s not
surprising there weren’t many PowerPC Windows CE devices out there. The
device that’s the subject of this article, too, only lasted on the
market for a few months, so it’s definitely a rarity.</p>

In 1940 André Weil wrote a letter to his sister, Simone, outlining his
vision for translating between three distinct areas of mathematics.
Eighty years later, it still animates many of the most exciting
developments in the field.

you can log in on your Palm PDA? Worry no more, your prayers have been
answered, you can finally throw that Android or iOS garbage into the
sun. Get your 2-factor codes on your Palm, just like Google
Authenticator. Unlike Hotpants (an old port of a J2ME phone app), this
version takes up much less space and supports all Palm OS versions. ↫
Nathan Korth You can now generate 2FA codes on your Palm device. This is

<h2 id="cross-posting-in-2024">Cross-posting in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.
</p>
<p>
I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
I can’t send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface.
My way of doing it is now called “legacy.” The app that uses that
feature doesn’t work. But I don’t even remotely have the time to go back
and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a>
come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on
Masto and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
When I want broader distribution, I do this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open a new browser window.
</li>
<li>
Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don’t know why.
</li>
<li>
I write some text into the Twitter tab.
</li>
<li>
Paste an image if there is one.
</li>
<li>
I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</li>
<li>
I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.
</li>
<li>
I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I’m sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can
actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is
too.
</p>
<p>
One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit
is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can’t include them
in this rotation.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to see one of these support the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them
100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn’t be long before the
others did it, and we’d have a much more complete network writing
environment.

would happen. It didn’t even criticize me. It figured out what I was
trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am

when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the
XML people were asking developers to do that. “Now you can create your
own formats!” The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready
to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in
the back of my mind, “they don’t really mean it.” This was based on
experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized
their products when they were new, but took
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the
developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important,
don’t they know that’s what BigCo’s do. Anyway a few years later, that’s
exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft,
Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the
future, so they set about to do it as a “standard” and thus was born
Atom. My opinion,
<a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is
better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But
that’s not what they do. They’re still
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS
unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there’s no point
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that.
It isn’t going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p>
I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to
create a Busy Developer’s Guide to ActivityPub? Here’s the prompt. “I
want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that
runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are
basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post.
Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.” I
asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT
gave</a> what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project.

<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> is a
product of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut">Architecture
Astronauts</a>. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so
it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the
simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can
anything pragmatic. It’s why I said last week that they
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521">need a BDG
asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I
would help them design it, I’m a fairly typical “busy developer.” I
would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not
to be revised with breakage to apps. I’ve also seen this happen before,
in fact it happens more often than not. If you don’t understand a
format, you can’t actually support it. This is part of the

way we stumble into the first public disclosure of digital computers,
the first intentionally unimportant machine, and wild speculation about
the future of mechanical brains.

<h2 id="why-i-run-a-bsd-on-a-pc">Why I run a BSD on a PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>But the biggest differential factor between BSDs and GNU/Linux is the
way it is structured. In Linux, all components are designed to work
together, but are completely separate. You’ve got the kernel, init
systems, multimedia daemons, userland, bootloader, virtualization and
containerization mechanisms, package managers, and so on. They are all
separate projects with their own goals and are operated by separate
entities. This is why we’ve got different Linux Distributions instead of
Operating System. Everyone can take the kernel, start adding components
on top of it, and a few minutes later the DistroWatch is even harder to
keep up with. Each BSD on the other hand is designed as single system.
All components are created and developed together. Things work together
perfectly, because they are designed, coded, tested and released as one.
↫ Michał Sapka As I’ve mentioned here and there over the past few weeks,
I’ve been exploring the world of BSD lately, and after bouncing of
FreeBSD I’ve found a very happy home on OpenBSD. Now, this doesn’t mean
I’m now a full-time OpenBSD user or anything like that – Linux is the
main operating system on my gaming PC, my laptop, and my workstation,
and that’s not going to be changing any time soon. However, after
installing, exploring, and using OpenBSD on a machine cobbled together
from spare and older parts, I can definitely see the appeal. OpenBSD
feels more coherent than a Linux distribution – I use Fedora KDE, if
that matters – and the various lower-level systems seem to talk to each
other in ways that make more intuitive sense than the individually
developed systems in a Linux distribution do. Diving into the
command-line interface of a Linux distribution can sometimes feel
confusing because different tools use different conventions, because
they’re developed by entirely different people and projects, with
different ideas about how flags should work, how output should be
presented, and so on. On OpenBSD, it seems much easier to carry over
something you learn from one tool to the next. I simply feel more secure
and knowledgeable, even if it’s still the same idiot me. The
documentation plays a big role here. They’re in one place, written in a
consistent style, and reference each other left and right, making it
easy to find your way around to other commands or tools you haven’t yet
considered using. On Linux, you’re going from one project’s
documentation to another project’s documentation, and not only will the
style change, the quality will also vary greatly. That’s not to say
everything’s perfect on OpenBSD – it’s clearly a hardened server
operating system, and its focus on security will definitely throw up
annoying hurdles if you’re just trying to do workstation things.
Firefox, for instance, is hobbled by strict security rules through
unveil, which makes perfect sense for what OpenBSD is first and foremost
trying to be, but if you’re just a regular user like me, it’s annoying
that Firefox can only access ~/Downloads, or that it can’t set itself as
the default browser so unless you disable that check, Firefox will keep
complaining about it. Diving into Firefox and unveil is on my list,
though, because you should be able to ‘fix’ this. Furthermore, while
every piece of software, or an equivalent, is pretty much always
available for Linux, on OpenBSD it’s more hit and miss, and it seems to
take a bit longer for new releases of especially bigger software
packages to get updated. I mean, there’s obviously no Steam on OpenBSD,
but smaller, less well-known projects generally also don’t support
OpenBSD, so you’re either going to be compiling things yourself or hope
someone packages it up for OpenBSD. Then there’s the various vanity
things we’ve come to expect from modern Linux distributions, like slick,
fully graphical boot and shutdown sequences, detailed graphical tools
for managing your packages, graphical firmware and driver managers, and
so on. OpenBSD has none of these things, and while that’s no issue for
me, I can see how it would throw other people off. FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD, and the few others often kind of get lost in all the Linux,
Windows, and macOS violence, and to be quite honest – I feel like many
people in the BSD community seem mostly okay with that. If you’ve never
spent any serious time using any of the BSDs, but you’re interested in
operating systems and don’t mind spending a few hours learning how to
manipulate your system through CLI tools – dive in. There’s a ton of fun
to be had, and things to learn. For now, I’m continuing my exploration
of OpenBSD, and if things keep going as well as they are, I may consider
at least switching over the workstation in my office from Fedora KDE to
OpenBSD – but I highly doubt it’ll ever make its way to my gaming
desktop or my laptop.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes
ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. Got is still under
development; it is being developed on OpenBSD and its main target
audience are OpenBSD developers. Got uses Git repositories to store
versioned data. Git can be used for any functionality which has not yet
been implemented in Got. It will always remain possible to work with
both Got and Git on the same repository. ↫ Game of Trees website OpenBSD
is developing Game of Trees because they want a version control system
that adheres to OpenBSD coding conventions, implements various OpenBSD
security practices, and uses nothing but BSD-licensed code. It’s
important to note, as its developers make very clear, that GoT is not in
any way intended as a replacement for git.</p>

<h2 id="x.org-on-netbsd-the-state-of-things">X.Org on NetBSD: the state
of things</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The big question – does all this have a future? The good news is that
all new hardware has generic support in X. Someone writes either a
modesetting kernel driver or a classical wsdisplay kernel driver and
they will be automatically supported by the associated drivers in X. The
bad news is that to have applications running we require access to a
larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn and
is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels. The process of upstreaming
stuff to X.Org is an ongoing process, but it’s likely we’ll run into
things that will never be suitable for upstream. ↫ Nia Alarie on the
NetBSD blog I had no idea NetBSD did such heavy customisations of its
X.Org implementation, many of which have never made their way upstream.
The project also maintains support for several older GPUs, uses its own
input driver, and more – it’s quite impressive.</p>

The easy stuff is gone, but the remaining stuff is hard. I could brute

<h2 id="a-quick-light-dark-experiment">A quick light-dark()
experiment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function
<code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS
architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a
powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the
new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to
recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.
</p>
<p>
My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
But if every component is in charge of it’s own
<code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>,
<code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the
codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places,
leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution
for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root
scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token
level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark
experience and, like good children, your components abide in their
parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom
properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your
component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the
global variables if necessary.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I
deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for
<code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari
17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by
changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to
verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code><span
class="citation" data-cites="supports">@supports</span></code> query.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a
dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>
enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in
there so future versions of me will know when and
<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/you-want-border-color-transparent-not-border-none/">why
I built this fence</a>.

<h2 id="i-support-the-students">I support the students</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As
a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started
an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support
today’s students making their political opinions heard. I also see
journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on
violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn’t true then
and I’m pretty sure it isn’t true now.
</p>
<p>
And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not
what’s really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American
students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values,
only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war,
as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel.
</p>
<p>
We shouldn’t have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on
killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was
unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is
killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it’s exactly what
Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should
<i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust.
</p>
<p>
As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that’s
why I support the students. They aren’t right or wrong, but they are
continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and
journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the
2020s as it was in the 1970s.

<h2 id="why-is-my-elasticsearch-query-so-slow">Why is my ElasticSearch
query so slow?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog</p>
<p>
The center of my working hours for the past two years has been
<a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>, a platform for
teaching, learning, and performing text analysis with scholarly and
primary source content from JSTOR, Portico, and elsewhere.
</p>
<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<img src="/assets/images-display/constellate-builder.png" alt="The Constellate [dataset builder page](https://constellate.org/builder)." />
<figcaption>
<p>
The Constellate <a href="https://constellate.org/builder">dataset
builder page</a>.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Our dataset builder allows users to filter and explore a corpus of over
35 million documents. This search - and the analytical queries that
power the data visualizations in this builder - rely on an ElasticSearch
cluster on the backend. We rely heavily on ElasticSearch aggregations
every time a user updates their filters, taking the resulting set of
documents (no matter if it is 500 docs or 15 million) and count up the
different document types, providers, genres, decades of publication, and
more. These aggregations are memory-heavy actions, especially when
aggregating over 10+ million documents. Even so, ElasticSearch was
usually able to return results in under 3,000 milliseconds, providing an
acceptable user experience.
</p>
<h2 id="why-have-our-queries-gotten-slower-and-slower">
Why have our queries gotten slower and slower?
</h2>
<p>
But we started to see something concerning happening: over the past six
months, we watched the worst-case query durations (those the 95th
percentile execution time for all searches performed in a week) steadily
growing, starting to crest over an unbearable 10 seconds long. At that
point our default request timeouts on our backend services were truly
breaking the end user experience.
</p>
<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<figcaption>
<p>
Median and 95th percentile durations (in milliseconds) of search queries
on <a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I hadn’t made any changes to the way we composed the queries we sent to
ElasticSearch in that time. Our overall usage was increasing, yes, and
during very large bulk ingests we did see some overall slowdowns in
query processing as expected. But not at a pace that seemed liable to
explain why these pathological query times were growing steadily worse.
We had been steadily adding new documents to the index, some coming in
large monthly batches, but we’d been doing that for years without seeing
this kind of progressive slowdown.
</p>
<p>
So I started experimenting, running searches directly against our
cluster and one at a time, removing and adding back in the aggregations
to see if any oe was causing a particularly heavy load on the cluster.
The culprit: our aggregation of keyphrases, which were sets of
significant terms calculated for each document. For very large search
result sets that returned 20 or 30 million documents, the keyphrases
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code></a>
aggregation was adding between 3 and 8 ruinous whole seconds onto the
query.
</p>
<p>
Why was this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregation so slow, while the half-dozen others we were running were
fast as ever? Cardinality. While we only have a handful of different
providers, a few dozen subject categorizations, and maybe a hundred
different languages, there are over <strong>50 million distinct
keyphrases</strong> in the system. With such high cardinality,
ElasticSearch had to generate an extremely large set of global ordinals
when being asked for a terms query, and then actually rank those
ordinals and return the top fifty most frequently occurring. Even
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/eager-global-ordinals.html#_avoiding_global_ordinal_loading">precalculating
global ordinals</a> (the usual first step in addressing slow
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregations) was not enough to tame the IO needed to aggregate 30+
million documents’ intersection with 50+ million keyphrase values.
</p>
<p>
Why hadn’t this problem asserted itself before? Because for a few years,
we had only extracted keyphrases from about 1/3 of our documents, and
weren’t actively contributing new ones into the system. While better
automating our ingest pipelines this year, we took the opportunity to
regenerate a lot of our keyphrases, backfilling our database with an
enormous number of new keyphrase values. While this problem of
cardinality was in our system all along, the scale simply wasn’t large
enough to make its impact felt until recently.
</p>
<h2 id="so-make-the-problem-smaller">
So make the problem smaller
</h2>
<p>
Because we only want to get a relative ranking of the top keyphrases, a
straightforward way to reduce this problem is to use a
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-sampler-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sampler</code></a>
aggregation. By grabbing a sample of up to 5,000 documents before
running the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregation, we easily brought the impact of the keyphrases aggregation
back under control. This effectively puts a ceiling on the number of
files whose keyphrases need to be looked up in an aggregation, and
mitigates the real scaling issues that we were starting to encounter
with our data.

<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done
with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to
middle school next year. Unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and
with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here
we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf
on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.
</p>
<h2>
The Eclipse
</h2>
<p>
In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the
eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path
of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the
eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing
prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The
confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo
effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space
rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that
keeps our planet alive.
</p>
<p>
Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.
</p>
<h2>
44 and there’s so much more
</h2>
<p>
I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s
how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning
the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner”
at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through
the whole meal.
</p>
<p>
The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends
who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you
often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a
deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.
</p>
<h2>
Making Games
</h2>
<p>
I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but
I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game
either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s
<a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.
</li>
<li>
A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.
</li>
<li>
A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile
computer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t
have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon
maybe?
</p>
<h2>
Waiting for a life-changing email
</h2>
<p>
You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a
minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours
as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot
anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two
months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails
actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.
</p>
<p>
To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently
patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m
unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids
ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say
“Nope, not yet” over and over.
</p>
<p>
But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of
concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big
phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.
</p>

Stats and consumption

<p>
What you jackals come here for…
</p>
<h3>
🧠 <strong>Learning</strong>
</h3>
<p>
I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future,
so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a>
course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.
</li>
<li>
LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search
but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default
embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand
it.

<li>
Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by
yourself and it inspired me to make a game.

<h3>
💪 Wellness
</h3>
<p>
I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again
it’s stress-related.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Taking walks
</li>
<li>
Got a weighted vest for “rucking”
</li>
<li>
Rode my new bike once

<h2>
📖 <strong>Reading</strong>
</h2>
<p>
Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I’m mulling around
tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or
harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read
some wonderful pieces. If it’s sci-fi themed and has good art, I’m
all-in.

📝 <strong>Blogging</strong>
</h3>
<p>
Slowed down a lot on blogging. That’s okay. I still have three dozen
drafts but I’m being pretty choosy about where I toil. It’s easy for me
to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a
giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I
need to do that more often. Who knows.

DuckDB to seamlessly query a large parquet file over HTTP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>A neat property of the parquet file format is that it’s designed with
block I/O in mind, so that when you are interested in only parts of the
contents of a file, it’s possible to some extent to only read that data.
Many tools are aware of this property, and DuckDB is one of them.
Depending on which circles you run in, a lesser known aspect of HTTP is
range requests, where you specify which bytes in a file to be
retrieved.</p>
