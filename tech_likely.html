<h2 id="google-is-no-longer-bringing-the-full-chrome-browser-to-fuchsia">Google is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫ Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from “workstation” builds to porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices. We’re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency to kill this before it released it.</p>

<h2 id="effortless-openbsd-audio-and-desktop-screen-recording-guide">Effortless OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available. Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So, let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent of Linux users who aren’t happy with the spread of things like systemd and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That’s not a dig at BSD developers – BSD focuses on different things – but it does mean that people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more assistance.</p>

<h2 id="not-a-collector-but">Not a collector, but…</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf and think “This guy is a collector!” Or you might look a the bass guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my office and think, “Hey, this guy is a collector!” Or you might look at all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, “This guy knows how to collect!”
</p>
<p>
But you would be wrong.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a collector, I’m a serial project starter.
</p>
<p>
Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don’t look at a knitter’s socks and blankets and say “Wow, look at this yarn collector!” The same with the instruments; it’s not a collection of world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about objects that produce sound. The records? Well… most of those are from my step-father who –beyond tools he used for home improvement projects– wasn’t a collector either.
</p>
<p>
I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector and his house is pretty much the town’s museum stuffed with old WW2 memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize, catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="on-enjoying-the-process">On enjoying the process</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable. Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes, experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what makes the journey enjoyable.

<h2 id="howto-change-your-behavior">HOWTO: Change your behavior</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog</p>
<p>
In theory, behavior change should be easy.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.
</p>
<p>
So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn’t your behavior change as instantly as your desire to change it?
</p>
<p>
In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.
</p>
<p>
In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.
</p>
<p>
Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3) preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.
</p>
<p><img src="images/dall-e-escher-ttm.png" class="abstract-image" /></p>
<center>
<em>DALL-E’s depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical model.</em>
</center>
<p>
In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable to many habitual human behaviors.
</p>
<p>
The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change you’re in.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively change your behavior in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have struggled with behavior change in the past.

</p>
<p>
At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi’s CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040’s successor, the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers—Raspberry Pi’s bread and butter.
</p>
<p>
The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi 5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.
</p>
<p>
That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units <em>every month</em>.

Where we stand regarding the climate
</h1>
<p>
This is a repost of <a href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit/1117534198618423710">a thread</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green"><span class="citation" data-cites="peterdutoit">@peterdutoit</span></a>, with some additinal quotes from the sources linked. Peter du Toit has been posting climate related posts on fedi for quite a while. This is a recommendation to follow his account.
</p>
<p>
He says:
</p>
<p>
We are firmly on a path to chaos. We continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:

<p>
Graph sourced from this report:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop in emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes were the main contributors to the overall increase, accounting for about two thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases), which have higher global warming potentials and account for about one quarter of current GHG emissions, are increasing rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5 per cent, followed by CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at +1.45°C above the preindustrial average, based on the six international climate datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The annual average global temperature approached 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels – symbolic because the Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase (averaged over decades rather than an individual year like 2023) to no more than 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. – <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record">WMO confirms that 2023 smashes global temperature record</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have currently heated by about +1.29ºC above the preindustrial average using four of the above datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>

This number shows an up-to-the-second assessment of human-induced global warming since the second half of the 19th century. – <a href="https://www.globalwarmingindex.org/">Global Warming Index</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3ºC has become very clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the extreme events of 2023.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of global extreme weather events has seen a “staggering rise” in the past 30 years, said the United Nations, and experts warn climate change is “supercharging” the problem, per The Associated Press. – <a href="https://theweek.com/in-depth/1021278/2023-extreme-weather">The extreme weather events of 2023</a>, by Devika Rao, for The Week US, behind a subscription wall
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With the emission trajectory for both CO₂ and Methane still increasing, the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation with the physics of this.
</p>

</p>
<p>
With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track to pass the 1.5°C threshold in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will become the earth’s permanent background baseline temperature.
</p>
<p>
Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here is the projection from Copernicus Climate Change:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5°C by November 2033" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Global warming reached an estimated 1.26°C in December 2023. If the 30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming would reach 1.5°C by November 2033. – <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/software/app-c3s-global-temperature-trend-monitor">Global temperature trend monitor</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this threshold much sooner as they illustrate below.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7°C" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due to the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7°C relative to 1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ± 0.1°C during the following La Nina. Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be clear that the world is passing through the 1.5°C ceiling, and is headed much higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth’s energy imbalance. – <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2024/AnnualT2023.2024.01.12.pdf">Global Warming Acceleration: Causes and Consequences</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the 1.5°C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.
</p>
<p>
The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3°C of heating will seem mild as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid research that shows crossing 1.5°C permanently, will set in motion tipping points that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result of their cascading effects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly. Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The goal of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate system tipping points. – <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/abc5a69e-en/1/3/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/abc5a69e-en&amp;_csp_=6d00888f3885b1fcadfb107c6ede4c51&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book#">Climate Tipping Points: Insights for Effective Policy Action</a>, OECD iLibrary
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the emissions freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current policies put us on track for a +2.7°C world. Talk about an overshoot!
</p>
<p>
The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2°C pathway in 2030, the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024, reaching 8.7 per cent per year on average for the 1.5°C pathway. To compare, the fall in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 4.7 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to approach this with the same urgency and determination which was displayed during the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Look around, it’s all business as usual.
</p>
<p>
As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, “on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”
</p>
<p>
Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.
</p>
<p>
We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.

<h2 id="stitch-images-together-with-stitchy">Stitch images together with Stitchy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.
</p>
<h2>
How to use Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches images together.

<p>
If you’re feeling even lazier and don’t want to type file names, you can have Stitchy grab the <code>n</code> latest images in the directory and/or set the <code>–order</code> flag to <code>alphabetical</code>.

By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid. Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here’s an example of a responsive image treatment I did on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe Check</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" />
</p>

<p>
If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.

</p>

<p>
No one noticed I did this, no one said “thanks”, but these types of small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.
</p>
<h2>
Other things Stitchy can do
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>–maxw</code> or <code>–maxh</code> if that’s part of the effect. You can also set the output format to <code>–jpg</code> or <code>–png</code> if needed as well as control the <code>–quality</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Enjoy Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
And that’s Stitchy! It’s pretty handy if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there’s not much documentation beyond the <code>–help</code> command, so I wanted to have this to remember how to use it.
