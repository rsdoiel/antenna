<h2 id="start-now-dont-wait">Start now, don’t wait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Start now, don’t wait
</h1>
<p>
If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I
was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you
docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk
things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.
</p>
<p>
Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that
you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done
by people who were ill prepared.
</p>
<p>
It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until
the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not
right will have made the decisions for you.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that
we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody
is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it
is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just
speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right
people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to
make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though
you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for
the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world
that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing
that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still
time.
</p>
<p>
And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what
are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded.
Thank you!

<p>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and
say “learn this” and then a few hours or days later I’d be able to ask
it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents
wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then
ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of
therapy.</p>

She’s phenomenally talented across a wealth of media, and does amazing

a series of thinkers, beginning with Jacques Ellul and Marshall McLuhan,
began to describe the anatomy of our technological society. Then,
starting in the 1970s, a generation emerged who articulated a detailed
critique of that society. The critique produced by these figures I

observability, or measuring docs inside a product-docs system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
As technical writers we want to know if the docs we’re writing are
accomplishing their goals. In other words, we want to know how good are
docs relative to the business goals they’re aiming to support or
improve. Are docs serving their purpose? Which of
<a href="https://swizec.com/blog/the-3-budgets/">the three budgets</a>
are docs supporting? When tech bubbles burst, roles usually seen as cost
centers, such as tech writing, are ripe for layoffs, no matter how
staunchly we defend them. That’s why we continue mulling over the
question of value and
<a href="https://passo.uno/tech-writing-metricks-kpis/">how we measure
it</a>.

<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">sports writer</a>
and boasted of the current Celtics team (he’s from Boston). They’re
worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting
players. They were great before they added
<a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827">Kristaps
Porzingis</a>, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn
and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He’s one of
those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year’s
Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the
Warriors or Kings in this year’s finals. Anyway, I write sports for
people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves
politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it
all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and
front and center. I’m glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to
a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are
getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even
win. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

id="when-everything-becomes-too-much-the-npm-package-chaos-of-2024">When
“everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we’d seen it all, an npm user
named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a
group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a
troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This
package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package,
creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and
its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone
who installs it. We’re talking about storage space running out and
system resource exhaustion. But that’s not all. The creator took their
prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol,
showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from
Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to
the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you
shouldn’t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let’s be
honest here – this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a
rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn’t
seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or
compromised systems. What’s worse, it seems this isn’t even the first
time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do
this. What are they doing over there?</p>

regular date, which would have been the 3rd – and the guest speakers
will be Matthew and Hilary Philips from Sine Nomine. The subject of
their talk will be RiscOSM, their mapping application that takes data
converted from Open Street Map and makes it usable on RISC OS. However,

<p>The penultimate day of 2023 saw another release of ScummVM, which
includes a RISC OS version thanks to the efforts of Cameron Cawley. The
software is now at version 2.8.0, and the latest version brings with it
a number of new engines, enhancements to old ones – and of course, a
whole raft of newly supported games. ScummVM is a ‘virtual machine’ that
was originally developed to run games built around the Script Creation
Utility for Maniac Mansion, the underlying system designed by LucasArts
for the game Maniac Mansion, and…</p>

<p>The above might well be a sculpture of Zeus cradling his son
Dionysus. Or it might be me cradling my new novel. Grandiose? You bet
I’m grandiose. But it’s the grandiosity of fear - a parent’s dread that
the new arrival (only four weeks away now) won’t fulfil its
expectations, won’t live up to its billing, won’t be a prodigy, won’t
change the world.</p>

After reporting on the open access movement for 20+ years I have reached
the conclusion that the movement has failed. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, I shall no longer be writing about open access or updating
this blog.
</p>
<p>
I explain my reasons for reaching the conclusion I have
in <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/12/07/where-did-the-open-access-movement-go-wrong-an-interview-with-richard-poynder/" target="_blank">this
Q&amp;A</a> on <i>The Scholarly Kitchen</i> website. 
</p>
<p>
I would like to thank those who wished me well when
I <a href="https://x.com/RickyPo/status/1728308480321229067?s=20" target="_blank">announced
my decision</a> and I wish all those who continue to advocate for open
access the very best. 
</p>
<p>
My challenge to the latter is: please prove me wrong!
