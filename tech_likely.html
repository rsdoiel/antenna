<h2 id="void-linux-on-zfs">Void Linux on ZFS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last night, I ran through the¬†ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for
Void¬†and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD
plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea
of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box,
so the¬†Void Handbook¬†itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation
before¬†its own¬†(a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a
ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we‚Äôll be
following throughout this post. ‚Ü´ Juno Takano There‚Äôs a ton of good
stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers
Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy
style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily
underappreciated ‚Äì it gets a lot of mentions in the right places ‚Äì but I
do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a
perfect fit but who don‚Äôt yet know about it. So, time for a very short
introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very
user-friendly package manager that‚Äôs an absolute joy to use. Unlike many
other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are
vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you‚Äôll be hard-pressed
to be asking for some piece of software that isn‚Äôt packaged. Void
eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no
issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line
with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void
also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Void Linux is
the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu.
The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it‚Äôs a
self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux
kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be
launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier,
especially for systems that don‚Äôt over ZFS as an option during
installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that‚Äôs what the linked
post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation.
It‚Äôs a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.</p>

MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it
is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and
dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without
running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching
how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode
compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned
through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a
specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for
‚Äúfilling in the blanks‚Äù when executing code to understand what the code
should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64
assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly
in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to
launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach
a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing.
Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process
as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the
virtualization firmware. ‚Ü´ Nicholas Starke This is an old post ‚Äì from
late 2022 ‚Äì but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS
doesn‚Äôt change very much from year to year, it‚Äôs still mostly
relevant.</p>

<h2 id="ldap2pg-6.1-postgres-16-unprivileged-hooks-and-more">ldap2pg
6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em>
</p>
<p>
Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France
since 2005.
</p>
<p>
Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers
the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for
PostgreSQL. Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in
<code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure
roles from your enterprise directory.
</p>
<p>
Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1. This version
brings support for PostgreSQL 16 and its new unprivileged administration
or roles. Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make
this a practical and stable version. Follow the
<a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation
to install</a> this new version.
</p>
<h3>
Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16
</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to
delegating the administration of roles to an unprivileged user. This
change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security and was not consistent with the SQL
standard. Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de
facto grant himself rights he does not have.
</p>
<p>
Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL
up to version 15. ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code>
option on PostgreSQL 16, without superuser privileges.
</p>
<h3>
Configurability
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities. You can now write the
environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file or in the ldap2pg working directory.
</p>
<p>
In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working
directory of the command. This parameter determines the search for the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.
</p>
<p>
Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument: the connection
string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised. This connection
string can be in URL format or in key=value format.
</p>
<h3>
Compatibility
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after
connection to the LDAP directory. This operation is an extension of the
LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere. Removing this command
removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.
</p>
<p>
The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by
a space. If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this
client-side HA implementation.
</p>
<p>
LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol, only for ASCII characters. ldap2pg
6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.
</p>
<h3>
Execution hooks
</h3>
<p>
A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg : the
definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after
the creation of a role. For example, to create a schema specific to a
new user. The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code>
and <code>after_create</code> parameters. These requests can receive
dynamic values from the LDAP search.
</p>
<h3>
Continue on error
</h3>
<p>
Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing. For
example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving
up.

<h2 id="what-is-pid-0">What is PID 0?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn‚Äôt
shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel,
then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling
and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0,
because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There‚Äôs a
slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me
for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what
PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ‚Ü´ David Anderson What a
great read. Just great.</p>

terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI
training</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that
they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some
frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming
rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the
apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the
apps, without agreeing to the terms. ‚Ü´ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course
users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language,
locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms
is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers
certainly aren‚Äôt going to be particularly happy about. I‚Äôve never worked
an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I‚Äôm assuming
employees aren‚Äôt allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe
or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash,
Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim
ownership over anyone‚Äôs work, and that it‚Äôs not going to train its ML
models on customers‚Äô work either. The company states that to train its
Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it,
as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth,
it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which
is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI
or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly
licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from
rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that‚Äôs exactly
what they‚Äôre doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just
how ‚Äì rightfully ‚Äì weary people are of machine learning, and how their
works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.</p>

<h2 id="wikipedia-vs-chatgpt">Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I started replying to a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post
by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character
limit, so I moved my act over here. </i>
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It often only represents a story from one point of view.
</p>
<p>
So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.
</p>
<p>
Same with the story of RSS. I‚Äôm sure you know the story they tell, but
there‚Äôs a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got
together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and Motley Fool, and eventually
brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard
supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media
and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the
tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do
that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you‚Äôd get the idea that the
bigco‚Äôs heroically fought back against what exactly it‚Äôs not clear.
</p>
<p>
I can‚Äôt contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so
your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well
it‚Äôs not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it
on my blog (as I‚Äôm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and
fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is.
(Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)
</p>
<p>
Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things
other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name
for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT
made a mistake like that people would be howling. I‚Äôm sure Wikipedia is
filled with junk like that. Why wouldn‚Äôt it be.
</p>
<p>
And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all
other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while
other sources don‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in
advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the
open web. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs better at finding stuff, and also
understanding my queries even though they‚Äôre not rigorously specified,
my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way
I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a
weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able
to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would
work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out
prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which
of course they are being.
</p>
<p>
Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that‚Äôs a big difference
between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very
impatient with them and move on.
</p>
<p>
Also, I‚Äôm not here to debate. I don‚Äôt like online debates. <span

have a Mac Mini that keeps running out of space on its internal drive.
It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me
find the big stuff. I don‚Äôt know when this app came to be, but it‚Äôs very
helpful. In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for
all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device
that‚Äôs ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems).
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on
the 16TB external drive, but I sure don‚Äôt know how to do it nor do I
want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript,
CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a
lot longer than this Mac‚Äôs has. I desperately want to move my act to
Linux and reclaim all the memory I‚Äôm using to store stuff about the Mac,
which isn‚Äôt really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a
Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that‚Äôs my revenge,
and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with
what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would
make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a>
money, so I hedged. I figured at least they‚Äôd make me rich while
completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My
inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen
Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running
and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as
usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>

Developers by Chris Chinchilla, a regular of the Write the Docs

through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little

<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life
cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a
product‚Äôs life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each
stage on the environment (LCIA). There are a few pieces of LCA software
to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and
Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they‚Äôre expensive. But
there‚Äôs a free and open source alternative: Brightway.</p>
