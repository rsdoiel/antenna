id="us-judge-rules-google-is-a-monopoly-search-deals-with-apple-and-mozilla-in-peril">US
judge rules Google is a monopoly, search deals with Apple and Mozilla in
peril</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>That sure is a big news drop for a random Tuesday. A federal judge
ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in
the search and advertising markets. “After having carefully considered
and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the
following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to
maintain its monopoly,” according to the court’s ruling, which you can
read in full at the bottom of this story. “It has violated Section 2 of
the Sherman Act.” ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge Among many other things,
the judge mentions Google’s own admissions that the company can do
pretty much whatever it wants with Google Search and its advertisement
business, without having to worry about users opting to go elsewhere or
ad buyers leaving the Google platform. Studies from inside Google itself
made it very clear that Google could systematically make Search worse
without it affecting user and/or usage numbers in any way, shape, or
form – because users have nowhere else to realistically go. While the
ability to raise prices at will without fear of losing customers is a
sure sign of being a monopoly, so is being able to make a product worse
without fear of losing customers, the judge argues. Google plans to
appeal, obviously, and this ruling has nothing yet to say about
potential remedies, so what, exactly, is going to change is as of yet
unknown. Potential remedies will be handled during the next phase of the
proceedings, with the wildest and most aggressive remedy being a
potential break-up of Google, Alphabet, or whatever it’s called today.
My sights are definitely set on a break-up – hopefully followed by
Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft – to create some much-needed
breathing room into the technology market, and pave the way for a
massive number of newcomers to compete on much fairer terms. Of note is
that the judge also put yet another nail in the coffin of Google’s
various exclusivity deals, most notable with Apple and, for our
interests, with Mozilla. Google pays Apple well over 20 billion dollars
a year to be the default search engine on iOS, and it pays about 80% of
Mozilla’s revenue to be the default search engine in Firefox. According
to the judge, such deals are anticompetitive. Mehta rejected Google’s
arguments that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple
were not exclusionary and therefore shouldn’t qualify it for liability
under the Sherman Act. “The prospect of losing tens of billions in
guaranteed revenue from Google — which presently come at little to no
cost to Apple — disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search
engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,” he wrote. ↫
Lauren Feiner at The Verge If the end of these deals become part of the
package of remedies, it will be a massive financial blow to Apple – 20
billion dollars a year is about 15% of Apple’s total annual operating
profits, and I’m also pretty sure those Google billions are counted as
part of Tim Cook’s much-vaunted services revenue, so losing it would
definitely impact Apple directly where it hurts. Sure, it’s not like
it’ll make Apple any less of a dangerous behemoth, but it will
definitely have some explaining to do to investors. Much more worrisome,
however, is the similar deal Google has with Mozilla. About 80% of
Mozilla’s total revenue comes from a search deal with Google, and if
that deal were to be dissolved, the consequences for Mozilla, and thus
for Firefox, would be absolutely immense. This is something I’ve been
warning about for years now, and the end of this deal would be yet
another worry that I’ve voiced repeatedly becoming reality, right after
Mozilla becoming an advertising company and making Firefox worse in the
name of quick profits. One by one, every single concern I’ve voiced
about the future of Firefox is becoming reality. Canonical, Fedora, KDE,
GNOME, and many other stakeholders – ignore these developments at your
own peril.</p>

id="every-microsoft-employee-is-now-being-judged-on-their-security-work">Every Microsoft employee
is now being judged on their security work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>After a number of very bug security incidents involving Microsoft’s
software, the company promised it would take steps to put security at
the top of its list of priorities. Today we got another glimpse of the
step it’s taking, since the company is going to take security into
account during performance reviews. Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief
people officer, has outlined what the company expects of employees in an
internal memo obtained by The Verge. “Everyone at Microsoft will have
security as a Core Priority,” says Hogan. “When faced with a tradeoff,
the answer is clear and simple: security above all else.” A lack of
security focus for Microsoft employees could impact promotions,
merit-based salary increases, and bonuses. “Delivering impact for the
Security Core Priority will be a key input for managers in determining
impact and recommending rewards,” Microsoft is telling employees in an
internal Microsoft FAQ on its new policy. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge Now,
I’ve never worked in a corporate environment or something even remotely
close to it, but something about this feels off to me. Often, it seems
that individual, lower-level employees know all too well they’re cutting
corners, but they’re effectively forced to because management expects
almost inhuman results from its workers. So, in the case of a technology
company like Microsoft, this means workers are pushed to write as much
code as possible, or to implement as many features as possible, and the
only way to achieve the goals set by management is to take shortcuts –
like not caring as much about code quality or security. In other words,
I don’t see how Microsoft employees are supposed to make security their
top priority, while also still having to achieve any unrealistic goals
set by management and other higher-ups. What I’m missing from this memo
and associated reporting is Microsoft telling its employees that if
unrealistic targets, crunch, low pay, and other factors that contribute
to cutting corners get in the way of putting security first, they have
the freedom to choose security. If employees are not given such freedom,
demanding even more from them without anything in return seems like a
recipe for disaster to me, making this whole memo quite moot. We’ll have
to see what this will amount to in practice, but with how horrible
employees are treated in most industries these days, especially in
countries with terrible union coverage and laughable labour protection
laws like the US, I don’t have high hopes for this.</p>

<h2 id="years-ago-cpm-started-the-microcomputer-revolution">50 years
ago, CP/M started the microcomputer revolution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>CP/M is turning 50 this year. The ancient Control Program for
Microcomputers, or CP/M for short, has been enjoying a modest
renaissance in recent years. By 21st century standards, it’s
unimaginably tiny and simple. The whole OS fits into under 200 kB, and
the resident bit of the kernel is only about 3 kB. Today, in the era of
end-user OSes in the tens-of-gigabytes size range, this exerts a
fascination to a certain kind of hobbyist. Back when it was new, though,
this wasn’t minimalist – it was all that early hardware could support. ↫
Liam Proven I’m a little too young to have experienced CP/M as anything
other than a retro platform – I’m from 1984, and we got our first
computer in 1990 or so – but its importance and influence cannot be
overstated. Many of the conventions set by CP/M made their way to the
various DOS variants, and in turn, we still see some of those
conventions in Windows today. Had Digital Research, the company CP/M
creator Gary Kildall set up to sell CP/M, accepted the deal with IBM to
make CP/M the default operating system for the then newly-created IBM
PC, we’d be living in a very different world today. Digital Research
would also create several other popular and/or influential software
products beyond CP/M, such as DR DOS and GEM, as well as various other
DOS variants and CP/M versions with DOS compatibility. It would
eventually be acquired by Novell, where it faded into obscurity.</p>

anything I’ve ever used. I love it!

Today I’m practicing basics: straight stitches, zig-zag, overlock, blind
hems, joins, embroidery, curves, spacing, etc. Little break now, then
button holes.

I’ll start on some basic patterns soon. Maybe dice bags for the players

2024-08-05 Free speech advocacy on the fediverse
</h1>
<p>
It all started with
<a class="account" href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer" title="@jwildeboer@social.wildeboer.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jwildeboer">@jwildeboer</span></a>
<a href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer/112893255029322563">arguing</a>
that the original poster (OP) of a message should be in control of
what’s considered to be a reply to the their post. Apparently, this
would be within the realm of how ActivityPub works, but it’s not how
Mastodon works. From my point of view, I’d love the ability to unlink
replies from my post so that people clicking through to my post don’t
end up seeing those replies. I’d be protecting my readers from spam,
trolls and detractors. Jan also argued that as a positive side-effect,
servers getting the original post that starts a thread would immediately
get the whole tree of replies. Finally, Jan also argued that replies
should not be able to reduce the audience scope of the audience because
it was used for bullying. People replying with a “followers only”
audience can effectively pile-on the original poster with their friends
and followers without anybody else being able to see this – you have to
be a follower of the bully in order to see it.
</p>
<p>
There was a longer thread by
<a class="account" href="https://eattherich.club/@deflarerOfClouds" title="@deflarerOfClouds@eattherich.club"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="deflarerOfClouds">@deflarerOfClouds</span></a> arguing that
“silencing critics is an anti-speech injustice &amp; if their replies
are detached that obviously censors their ideas.” I disagree.
</p>
<p>
In situations like these I like to explain the situation without using
the word censorship as we’ll get bogged down in a word definition game
that I find fundamentally boring. I want to make sure that speech I
disagree with does not benefit from my reach; I want no part in
distributing it. If somebody wants to argue that this is censorship and
therefore bad, I’m bored. I’d like to hear an explanation that hows how
this attachment is something I should support. Note that I’m not
interested in the question of whether people can or cannot say their
words; all I care about is them not distributing their words along with
mine.
</p>
<p>
In this sense, running a blog without comments is perfect. There’s not
even the illusion of censorship. If people want to counter, let them put
it up on their blogs. I’m not in a debate club. Instead, I feel like an
essayist or a book author. Other people should feel free to write their
own books and their essays – and their own blog posts, possibly linking
to mine – but me having to endure the inane and the boring, and
inflicting it on my readers, is disrespectful to my readership. It’s
abuse of my distribution channel.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, I expect newspapers and academic journals to exercise their
editorial powers to filter and select the replies and comments and
letters to the editors worth their readers’ time. It is what I expect
because life is short and the number of boring comments are endless. A
world without curation is not my goal.
</p>
<p>
On my blog, people can find ways to contact me. And maybe I’ll post
their replies or additions. But really, adversarial comments can be
hosted elsewhere and I feel no compulsion to link them all. This sort of
third party comment aggregation is exactly what Hacker News, Reddit or
Lemmy do. It makes no sense to demand that blogs do the same. It makes
no sense to demand all social media to do the same. Tools can be
different and interaction models can be different.
</p>
<p>
To come back to the fediverse: I would prefer Mastodon (and the software
I use, GoToSocial) to change their defaults because I think the original
poster having control over comments provides exactly the kind of
curation I like. In this social media model, I’m following people so I
implicitly trust their curation. Calling this curation censorship or
suppression is an exaggeration.
</p>
<p>
I write on the web. I don’t plan to prevent other people from reading my
words and writing posts quoting my words. What I do want is the option
of having no part in their distribution. I’m not interested in
technology that allows people to use my blog or my posts to reach my
readership with their adversarial replies. In other words, I’m fine with
people writing replies on their blog posts and linking to mine. I don’t
need to link back. On social media, I’m willing to go a step further and
allow people to write public replies linked to my posts. I’d very much
like the option of detaching adversarial replies from my posts.
</p>
<p>
The important part about this is the realization that none of this is
“natural” – everything is engineered and the people writing the software
make decisions about how the people on these platforms interact and it’s
important to think about the choices being made and the consequences
these choices have. Replies being attached to original posts in the
fediverse is a feature somebody developed and it is not at all clear to
me that denying this features amounts to suppression or censorship.
</p>
<p>
The belief that denying technological features amounts to suppression
and censorship is a leap I am not willing to make.

But performance is only one aspect that interests me. This is the first

Storage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>To enable deep space missions, the capability to transfer and store
cryogenic fuels (typically liquid hydrogen, methane, and oxygen) without
significant leakage over long duration missions is critical. NASA has
been actively developing zero boil-off cryocooler technology to reduce
storage losses. Another source of fuel loss is from leakage at the fuel
disconnect used for in-space refueling. […]</p>

2024-08-04 Walliser Roggenbrot
</h1>
<p>
Wir waren zu Besuch bei Freunden in Oberösterreich und ich habe ein
„Walliser“ Roggenbrot mitgebracht.
</p>
<p>
Man nehme:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Salz
</li>
<li>
Dinkelmehl (ein Drittel oder ein Viertel vom Mehl); Weizenmehl geht auch
</li>
<li>
Roggenvollkornschrotmehl (doppelt oder drei Mal so viel wie Dinkel- oder
Weizenmehl)
</li>
<li>
Sauerteig Starter
</li>
<li>
Nüsse; z.B. Walnüsse
</li>
<li>
Trockfrüchte; z.B. Pflaumen, Aprikosen, Feigen, je nach Wunsch
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hier mit Paranüssen, Datteln, Pflaumen und Feigen:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-1.jpg" alt="Salz, Dinkelmehr, Roggenvollkornschrotmehl, Paranüsse, Datteln, gedörrte Pflaumen und gedörrte Feigen" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-2.jpg" alt="Nüsse nicht klein brechen, Früchte grob schneiden" />
</p>
<p>
Sauerteigstarter und ca. 150g Dinkelmehl:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-3.jpg" alt="Mehl" />
</p>
<p>
Etwa zwei bis drei Mal mehr Roggenvollkornschrotmehl, das wären also
300–450g, hier aufgefüllt mit etwas über 300g Roggenvollkornschrotmehl
auf ca. 500g:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-4.jpg" alt="Noch mehr Mehl" />
</p>
<p>
Eine Hand voll Salz, oder einen Suppenlöffel, oder etwa 10g:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-5.jpg" alt="Salz" />
</p>
<p>
Mit etwas mehr als zwei Drittel Wasser mischen. Bei 500g Mehl wären das
333ml Wasser gewesen. Hier habe ich fast 400ml zugegeben und auf 900g
aufgefüllt. Wie man nachher noch sehen wird, war das ein wenig zu viel
Wasser.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-6.jpg" alt="Wasser hinzufügen" />
</p>
<p>
Umrühren – langes kneten finde ich unnötig. Kommt aber vielleicht auf
das Mehl an.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-7.jpg" alt="Teig ist ein Klumpen" />
</p>
<p>
Über Nacht zudecken und gären lassen.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-8.jpg" alt="Geschirrtuch bedeckt die Schüssel" />
</p>
<p>
Weil es genug Dinkelmehl in der Mischung gab, ist aufgegangen.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-9.jpg" alt="Der Teig in der Schüssel ist aufgegangen" />
</p>
<p>
Weil es so viel Teig ist, werde ich zwei kleinere Brote machen und habe
den Teig deswegen halbiert. Nun gilt es, den Teig in viel Mehl zu
wenden, so dass er nirgends mehr anklebt. Weil ich etwas zu viel Wasser
verwendet habe, war das schwieriger als sonst.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-10.jpg" alt="Zwei Schüsseln mit Teigklumpen in Mehl gewendet" />
</p>
<p>
Nochmal zudecken und etwas gehen lassen.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-11.jpg" alt="Geschirrtuch bedeckt nun zwei Schüsseln" />
</p>
<p>
Diesmal warte ich nicht lange. nach einer halben Stunde oder Stunde hat
es schon wieder Risse und Blasen in der Mehlschicht, weil die Hefe aktiv
ist.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-12.jpg" alt="Bemehlte Teigklumpen mit Rissen und Blasen" />
</p>
<p>
Weil der Teig nicht sehr fest ist, lege ich ihn lieber in eine Schüssel
oder eine Kuchenform statt auf das Backblech. Traditionelles Roggenbrot
ist allerdings eher flach, deswegen nehme ich keine Kuchenform. Etwas
flach ist OK.
</p>
<p>
Unten im Boden hat es einen Wasserbehälter mit einem halben Liter Wasser
drinnen. Das kann man auch in eine dritte Schüssel geben, damit es im
Ofen schön feucht bleibt.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-13.jpg" alt="Zwei Teigklumpen in zwei Schüsseln im Ofen" />
</p>
<p>
50 Minuten backen bei 180°C und das Brot ist fertig.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-14.jpg" alt="Zwei Laib Brot mit schöner Kruste" />
</p>
<p>
Wer ein Kuchengitter hat, kann das Brot darauf trocknen lassen.
Alternativ in ein Geschirrtuch einwickeln oder kopfüber legen, damit es
auch von unten etwas antrocknen kann.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-15.jpg" alt="Brot auf einem Gitter" />
</p>
<p>
Üblicherweise wird das Brot relativ dünn geschnitten und mit allem
möglichen belegt. Fleisch, Käse, oder nur mit etwas Butter… und einem
Glas Wein.

Exkurs Sauerteig
</h2>
<p>
Online gibt es tausend Anleitungen hierfür. Hier meine Kurzfassung.
</p>
<p>
Variante 1 dauert ein paar Tage:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Etwas Mehl und gleich viel Wasser mischen, bis es einen zähen, feuchten
Teig gibt. Diesen mit einem Papier verschlossen im Kühlschrank
aufbewahren. Jeden Tag die Hälfte davon verwenden, für Pfannkuchen oder
sonst etwas. Dann wieder mit Mehl und Wasser auffüllen und mischen, bis
man wieder gleich viel im Glas hat. Anfangs hat es nur wenig Hefe darin.
Nach sieben Tagen sieht man durch das Glas, wie es jeden Morgen Blasen
im Teig hat. Der Sauerteig lebt!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Variante 2 ist um einiges schneller:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Etwas Mehl, Hefe und gleich viel Wasser mischen, bis es einen zähen,
feuchten Teig gibt. Diesen mit einem Papier verschlossen im Kühlschrank
aufbewahren. Schon nach einer Stunde sieht man Blasen im Teig. Der
Sauerteig lebt! Nun verwendet man die Hälfte davon für das erste Brot.
Dann gilt es, das Glas wieder mit Mehl und Wasser aufzufüllen und zu
mischen, bis man wieder gleich viel im Glas hat. Anfangs hat es nur
wenig Milchsäurebakterien darin, aber das wird im Laufe der nächsten
Tage besser.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Das funktioniert, weil es in der Luft Hefe und Milchsäurebakterien hat,
welche die Mischung besiedeln. Da wir immer die Hälfte entfernen, sorgt
die Auslese dafür, dass nur bleibt, wer sich wirklich schnell ausbreiten
kann. Und das sind die Hefe und die Milchsäurebakterien. Diese halten
sich gegenseitig mit ihren Produkten im Schach: Die Hefe produziert
Alkohol und die Bakterien die Milchsäure, was den Teig bei andere
Lebewesen unbeliebt macht. Unser Glück!
</p>
<p>
Theoretisch kann man den Sauerteig auch ausserhalb des Kühlschrankes
aufbewahren. Früher hatten wir ja auch keine Kühlschränke und trotzdem
gab es Brot. Da wir aber nicht jeden Tag ein Brot backen und deswegen
auch nicht die ganze Zeit Sauerteig verbrauchen, gibt das anderen
Lebewesen die Gelegenheit, unser Glas zu besiedeln. Im Kühlschrank wird
das etwas ausgebremst.
</p>
<h2 id="tipps-zum-glas">
Tipps zum Glas
</h2>
<p>
Ich schliesse das Glas nicht mit einem luftdichten Deckel, weil der
Sauerstoff ebenfalls unerwünschte Lebewesen fern hält.
</p>
<p>
Wenn ich in die Ferien gehe, mach ich eine besonders trockene Mischung,
weil ich mir vorstelle, dass die Hefe und die Milchsäurebakterien dann
in ein Dauerstadium übergehen und die Zeit ohne neue Nahrung besser
überstehen. Weniger Wasser sorgt dafür, dass in dieser Zeit weniger
unerwünschte Lebewesen das Glas besiedeln.
</p>
<p>
Alle ein bis zwei Wochen wechsel ich das Glas. Der halbe Sauerteig kommt
in das neue Glas, das alte Glas wird beim Brot backen mit dem
verwendeten Wasser ausgespült. Ich will so wenig Sauerteig wie möglich
wegspülen.
</p>
<p>
In den letzten vier Jahren hatte ich zwei Mal den Fall, dass ich den
weissen Flaum von Schimmel am Glasrand gesehen habe. Hier waren Hefe und
Milchsäurebakterien nicht stark genug, um sich zu wehren. Also habe ich
alles weggeworfen und eine neue Sauerteigkultur angefangen.
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykotoxin#Wirkung">Mit Schimmel
ist nicht zu spassen!</a> Der weisse Flaum sind die Fruchtkörper. Der
giftige Pilzkörper selber ist nicht sichtbar und breitet sich im
Sauerteig aus. Deswegen darf man nicht nur das weisse Zeug entfernen.
<em>Alles muss weg.</em>

<h2 id="freebsd-as-a-daily-driver">FreeBSD as a daily driver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Not too long ago I linked to a blog post by long-time OSNews reader
(and silver Patreon) and friend of mine Morgan, about how to set up
OpenBSD as a workstation operating system – and in fact, I personally
used that guide in my own OpenBSD journey. Well, Morgan’s back with
another, similar article, this time covering FreeBSD. After going
through the basic steps needed to make FreeBSD a bit more amenable to
desktop use, Morgan notes about performance: Now let’s compare FreeBSD.
Well, quite frankly, there is no comparison! FreeBSD just feels snappier
and more responsive on the desktop; at the same 170Hz refresh it
actually feels like 170Hz. Void Linux always felt fast enough and I
thought it had no lag at all at that refresh rate, but comparing them
side by side (FreeBSD installed on the NVMe drive, Void running from a
USB 4 SSD with similar performance), FreeBSD is smooth as glass and I
started noticing just the slightest lag/stutter on Void. The same holds
true for Firefox; I use smooth scrolling and on FreeBSD it really is
perfectly smooth. Similarly, Youtube performance is unreal, with no
dropped frames at any resolution all the way up to 4Kp60, and the videos
look so much smoother! ↫ Morgan/kaidenshi This is especially relevant
for me personally, since the prime reason I switched my workstation back
to Fedora KDE was OpenBSD’s performance issues. While those performance
issues were entirely expected and the result of the operating system’s
focus on security and hardening, it did mean it’s just not suitable for
me as a workstation operating system, even if I like the internals and
find it a joy to use, even under the hood. If FreeBSD delivers more
solid desktop and workstation performance, it might be time I set up a
FreeBSD KDE installation and see if it can handle my workstation’s 270Hz
4K display. As I keep reiterating – the BSD world has a lot to offer
those wishing to run a UNIX-like workstation operating system, and it’s
articles like these that help people get started. A lot of the steps
taken may seem elementary to many of us, but for people coming from
Linux or even Windows, they may be unfamiliar and daunting, so having it
all laid out in a straightforward manner is quite helpful.</p>

We’re depending on big companies that are nuzzling up with Trump, at
best hedging their bets, to let us use their networks to organize
ourselves politically. That’s never worked for us, in fact it’s worked
against us. Trump’s election in 2016, for example, could he have done it
without Twitter letting him go direct to organize?
</p>
<p>
The Harris organization is doing great, they have to take on the
journalists, where previous Democrats had no answer, they’ve done it in
a clever way, by using their channels to talk about the things
journalism should be talking about. People listen to their competition,
and that’s what this is.
</p>
<p>
It’s not hard to do this, a few of us, who are good listeners and
writers, to build lists of sources and provide them for people to access
away from the nonstop (often entertaining) bullshit of the social web of
2024.
</p>
<p>
I’ve asked for ideas for podcasts that would go into a list of shows
people who are voting Democratic would find interesting or useful. Not
for spreading religion, but based on facts, not the unhinged lunacy and
revenge of Trump. Our news now is too polluted by that. He shouldn’t be
able to lie about Harris’s race, and have that be an issue carried by
journalism, for example. That should not be possible but it happens.

Manifest v2 (MV2) extensions platform in favor of Manifest v3 (MV3).
“uBO is a Manifest v2 extension, hence the warning in your Google Chrome
browser. There is no Manifest v3 version of uBO, hence the browser will
suggest alternative extensions as a replacement for uBO,” Hill
explained. ↫ Sergiu Gatlan at Bleeping Computer If you’re still using
Chrome, or any possible Chrome skins who have not committed to keeping
Manifest v2 extensions enabled, it’s really high time to start thinking
about jumping ship if ad blocking matters to you. Of course, we don’t
know for how long Firefox will remain able to properly block ads either,
but for now, it’s obviously the better choice for those of us who care
about a better browsing experience. And just to reiterate: I fully
support anyone’s right to block ads, even on OSNews. Your computer, your
rules. There are a variety of other, better means to support OSNews –
our Patreon, individual donations through Ko-Fi, or buying our merch –
that are far better for us than ads will ever be.</p>

a modern, advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader and boot
manager</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Limine is an advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader that
supports Linux, multiboot1 and 2, the native Limine boot protocol, and
more. Limine is lightweight, elegant, fast, and the reference
implementation of the Limine boot protocol. The Limine boot protocol’s
main target audience is operating system and kernel developers that want
to use a boot protocol which supports modern features in an elegant
manner, that GRUB’s aging multiboot protocols do not (or do not
properly). ↫ Limine website I wish trying out different bootloaders was
an easier thing to do. Personally, since my systems only run Fedora
Linux, I’d love to just move them all over to systemd-boot and not deal
with GRUB at all anymore, but since it’s not supported by Fedora I’m
worried updates might break the boot process at some point. On systems
where only one operating system is installed, as a user I should really
be given the choice to opt for the simplest, most basic boot sequence,
even if it can’t boot any other operating systems or if it’s more
limited than GRUB.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-o3-optimization-for-ubuntu">Exploring O3 optimization
for Ubuntu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Following our recent work 5 with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS where we enabled
frame pointers by default to improve debugging and profiling, we’re
continuing our performance engineering efforts by evaluating the impact
of O3 optimization in Ubuntu. O3 is a GCC optimization 14 level that
applies more aggressive code transformations compared to the default O2
level. These include advanced function and the use of sophisticated
algorithms aimed at enhancing execution speed. While O3 can increase
binary size and compilation time, it has the potential to improve
runtime performance. ↫ Ubuntu Discourse If these optimisations deliver
performance improvements, and the only downside is larger binaries and
longer compilation times, it seems like a bit of a no-brainer to enable
these, assuming those mentioned downsides are within reason. Are there
any downsides they’re not mentioning? Browsing around and doing some
minor research it seems that -O3 optimisations may break some packages,
and can even lead to performance degradation, defeating the purpose
altogether. Looking at a set of benchmarks from Phoronix from a few
years ago, in which the Linux kernel was compiled with either O2 and O3
and their performance compared, the results were effectively tied,
making it seem not worth it at all. However, during these benchmarks,
only the kernel was tested; everything else was compiled normally in
both cases. Perhaps compiling the entire system with O3 will yield
improvements in other parts of the system that do add up. For now, you
can download unsupported Ubuntu ISOs compiled with O3 optimisations
enabled to test them out.</p>

<p>
Pino and crew have moved a lot in the past month. On the first of July,
we were in Sitka, Southeast Alaska, and then on the last day of the
month we were back in Millbrook Cove, very near to the top of Vancouver
Island. We sailed 590 NM and stopped in 15 different anchorages.
</p>
<p>
Leaving Sitka, we sailed along the west coast of Southeast Alaska for a
few days to try and take advantage of a good weather window, we had some
engine issues which too motivated the need for such a long passage(see
our
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/maps/sealaska_2024.jpg" target="_blank">track</a>)—we
spent two days troubleshooting the issue while anchored in Port Bazan, a
bay far from everything, with no internet connection or way to talk to
anybody, we were glad to have the physical engine manual on board.
Sailing on open waters is always nice, we saw black-footed albatrosses,
horned puffins, a whale per hour, and many more sea otters(Port Bazan
was full of them).
</p>
<p>
After checking back into
<a href="https://100r.co/site/prince_rupert.html" target="_blank">Prince
Rupert</a>, the way back south through Northern Canada was plagued with
unfavorable winds, we had to beat into it, or travel on quiet waters to
make progress. We resorted to doing short hops between anchorages,
conditions did not permit for long distances. Doing short hops though
did allow us to discover beautiful places we might have otherwise
missed. We spent many grey days waiting for weather, reading, drawing,
and beginning work on
<a href="https://100r.co/site/markl.html" target="_blank">markl</a>,
we’re giving it another go).

<p>
<b>Book Club:</b> This month we read <i>Erewhon</i> by Samuel Butler,
<i>Technophilia and Its Discontents</i> by Ellen Ullman, <i>The
Democracy Of Species</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer, <i>I Will Fight No More
Forever</i> by Merrill D. Beal, <i>In Cold Blood</i> by Truman Capote,
