too. But I know there’s interesting data here, how people are connected
to people. I’m still trying to figure out how to make a browser that
engages the mind in that. It can take a long time to figure these things
out. I had the basic idea for a blog in 1994, but it wasn’t until 1999
that we really had it figured out and implemented for non-techies. This
may be like that, or the browser might be just around the corner.</p>

<h2 id="on-being-humble-and-accepting-success">On being humble and
accepting success</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There’s a subtle difference between being humble and pretending to be something you’re not. If you are successful in some field you can—and should—recognise your success while still being humble and not letting the success make you arrogant. I find that not doing that, not recognising your success in any shape or form, can grind me in the wrong way. Because at some point you start to feel disingenuous. &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
People and Blog is a passion project. It’s not a “successful” project by
any metric. Combining RSS, Email and the site, it probably has a few
thousand readers. And don’t get me wrong, it’s great. I’m grateful for
that and I’ll continue to post these interviews for as long as I can. 71
incredibly <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">kind people</a>
have also decided to contribute some of their money to support it and
that’s also something I’m very appreciative of.
</p>
<p>
Still, I think of P&amp;B as a very niche side project, far from being a
successful one. Now let’s imagine that instead of a few thousand, the
P&amp;B audience was a few hundreds of thousands and instead of 71
people, 7000 were contributing something every month. At the current
average that would net me almost 16000$ a month. That’s around 200k a
year and it would make me in the top 0.5% of earners here in Italy.
Could I still go around claiming my project was not successful? Hell no.
I’d be a hypocrite if I were to do that. And you’d be rightfully pissed
at me if I were still nudging you to support for 1$ a month while also
being part of the 1%.
</p>
<p>
I find it interesting that the pursuit of endless growth is something we
despise when corporations are doing it but it’s not something that
bothers us too much when it’s done by “content creators”. And yet, after
a certain scale, it’s the same mindset. This is why I love to support
small creators who do things simply because they enjoy it and are not
driven by other incentives.
</p>
<p>
I love something <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik">Om said
in his interview </a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I love supporting the small media, but don’t have time for establishment
media outlets. I don’t much care for some of the larger blogs as well.
And same goes for the larger YouTubers and podcasts. You need to catch
them early — that’s when they really are pure and hustling to serve the
reader.

<h1>
GHC 9.6.6 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-07-01
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.6.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are
available on the <a href="/download_ghc_9_6_6.html">release page</a>.
</p>
<p>
This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues found
in the 9.6 series. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A fix for a bug in the NCG that could lead to incorrect runtime results
due to erroneously removing a jump instruction
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).
</li>
<li>
A fix for a linker error that manifested on certain platform/toolchain
combinations, particularly darwin with a brew provisioned toolchain,
arising due to a confusion in linker options between GHC and cabal
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>).
</li>
<li>
A fix for a compiler panic in the simplifier due to incorrect eta
expansion
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24718">#24718</a>).
</li>
<li>
A fix for possible segfaults when using the bytecode interpreter due to
incorrect constructor tagging
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24870">#24870</a>).
</li>
<li>
And a few more fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.6/docs/users_guide/9.6.6-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are
encouraged to upgrade promptly.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake
pool, Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!

<h2 id="psycopg-3.2-released">Psycopg 3.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
After 846 commits and close to two years in the making, we are very
happy to announce the release of
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/">Psycopg 3.2</a>!
</p>
<p>
This release adds several new features to the Psycopg 3 line, some of
which are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
support for Numpy scalar types
</li>
<li>
easier to use notifications reception
</li>
<li>
the possibility to run queries with PostgreSQL-format parameters
</li>
<li>
a row factory to return a scalar from a query
</li>
<li>
asynchronous, encrypted cancellations
</li>
<li>
support for the many new features added in the upcoming PostgreSQL v17
</li>
<li>
OpenSSL 3.x bundled with binary packages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A few bug bug fixes are included too, which have also been independently
released in the 3.1.20 package. Given the high level of compatibility
between 3.1 and 3.2, this could be the last release of the 3.1 line.
</p>
<p>
For further details please check out:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/news.html#psycopg-3-2">release
notes</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/06/30/psycopg-32-released/">news
entry</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please note that several new features in the 3.2 release require libpq
v17, but, because PostgreSQL version 17 has not been released yet, they
are not immediately available in the binary packages. In order to use
these features you will need a development version of libpq 17 on your
system and to use the Python or C source distribution. New packages
bundling libpq v17 will be released as soon as the official PostgreSQL
17 has been released.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much to everyone who contributed to the project,

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.18-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.18 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - June 22, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This is a maintenance release that fixes two bugs in the restore
process.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix double copy statements when a table name requires to be quoted.
</li>
<li>
Fix error when restoring a table with a GENERATED ALWAYS column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

<h2 id="greenmask-v0.2.0b1-release">Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h1>
Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release
</h1>
<h2>
PostgreSQL Logical Dump and Anonymization Tool
</h2>
<p>
This major <strong>beta release</strong> introduces new features and
refactored transformers, significantly enhancing Greenmask’s flexibility
to better meet business needs. Help us improve GreenMask and tailor it
to meet community needs. We welcome your feedback in the
<a href="https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask/discussions/129">release
discussion on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Greenmask Overview
</h2>
<p>
Greenmask is a versatile open-source tool for database backup,
anonymization, and restoration. Written in pure Go with ported
PostgreSQL libraries, it is platform-independent and stateless,
requiring no schema modifications. It is customizable and compatible
with existing PostgreSQL utilities.
</p>
<h3>
Greenmask is ideally suited for:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and
availability.
</li>
<li>
Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics,
<strong>protecting sensitive</strong> information while maintaining data
utility.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Key features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deterministic transformers</strong> — deterministic approach to
data transformation based on the hash functions. This ensures that the
same input data will always produce the same output data. Almost each
transformer supports either <code>random</code> or <code>hash</code>
engine making it universal for any use case.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic parameters</strong> — almost each transformer supports
dynamic parameters, allowing to parametrize the transformer dynamically
from the table column value. This is helpful for resolving the
functional dependencies between columns and satisfying the constraints.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Database type safe</strong> - Ensures data integrity by
validating data and utilizing the database driver for encoding and
decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data
formats.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> -
During obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation warnings
and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain
transformations effectively throughout the software lifecycle.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> - Define
transformation configurations once and apply them to all partitions
within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stateless</strong> - Greenmask operates as a logical dump and
does not impact your existing database schema.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Backward compatible</strong> - It fully supports the same
features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities. Dumps
created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore
utility.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Extensible</strong> - Users have the flexibility to implement
domain-based transformations in any programming language or use
predefined templates.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> - Greenmask offers a
variety of storage options for local and remote data storage, including
directories and S3-like storage solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Playground usage for the beta version
</h2>
<p>
If you want to run a Greenmask
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/playground/">playground</a> for
the beta version execute:
</p>
<p>
<code>git checkout tags/v0.2.0b1 -b v0.2.0b1 docker-compose run
greenmask-from-source</code>
</p>
<h2>
Changes overview
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/dynamic_parameters/">Introduced
dynamic parameters in the transformers</a>
<ul>
<li>
Most transformers now support dynamic parameters where applicable.
</li>
<li>
Dynamic parameters are strictly enforced. If you need to cast values to
another type, Greenmask provides templates and predefined cast functions
accessible via <code>cast_to</code>. These functions cover frequent
operations such as <code>UnixTimestampToDate</code> and
<code>IntToBool</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The transformation logic has been significantly refactored, making
transformers more customizable and flexible than before.
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/transformation_engines/">Introduced
transformation engines</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>random</code> - generates transformer values based on
pseudo-random algorithms.
</li>
<li>
<code>hash</code> - generates transformer values using hash functions.
Currently, it utilizes <code>sha3</code> hash functions, which are
secure but perform slowly. In the stable release, there will be an
option to choose between <code>sha3</code> and <code>SipHash</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/parameters_templating/">Introduced
static parameters value template</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Notable changes
</h2>
<h3>
Core
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Introduced the <code>Parametrizer</code> interface, now implemented for
both dynamic and static parameters.
</li>
<li>
Renamed most of the toolkit types for enhanced clarity and comprehensive
documentation coverage.
</li>
<li>
Refactored the <code>Driver</code> initialization logic.
</li>
<li>
Added validation warnings for overridden types in the
<code>Driver</code>.
</li>
<li>
Migrated existing built-in transformers to utilize the new
<code>Parametrizer</code> interface.
</li>
<li>
Implemented a new abstraction, <code>TransformationContext</code>, as
the first step towards enabling new feature transformation conditions
(#34).
</li>
<li>
Optimized most transformers for performance in both dynamic and static
modes. While dynamic mode offers flexibility, static mode ensures
performance remains high. Using only the necessary transformation
features helps keep transformation time predictable.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Documentation
</h3>
<p>
Documentation has been significantly refactored. New information about
features and updates to transformer descriptions have been added.
</p>
<h3>
Transformers
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_email/">RandomEmail</a>
- Introduces a new transformer that supports both random and
deterministic engines. It allows for flexible email value generation;
you can use column values in the template and choose to keep the
original domain or select any from the <code>domains</code> parameter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_date/">NoiseDate</a>,

<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_int/">NoiseInt</a>
- These transformers support both random and deterministic engines,
offering dynamic mode parameters that control the noise thresholds
within the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> range. Unlike previous
implementations which used a single <code>ratio</code> parameter, the
new release features <code>min_ratio</code> and <code>max_ratio</code>
parameters to define noise values more precisely. Utilizing the
<code>hash</code> engine in these transformers enhances security by
complicating statistical analysis for attackers, especially when the
same salt is used consistently over long periods.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_numeric/">NoiseNumeric</a>
- A newly implemented transformer, sharing features with
<code>NoiseInt</code> and <code>NoiseFloat</code>, but specifically
designed for numeric values (large integers or floats). It provides a
<code>decimal</code> parameter to handle values with fractions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_choice/">RandomChoice</a>
- Now supports the <code>hash</code> engine
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_date/">RandomDate</a>,
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_float/">RandomFloat</a>,
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_int/">RandomInt</a>
- Now enhanced with hash engine support. Threshold parameters
<code>min</code> and <code>max</code> have been updated to support
dynamic mode, allowing for more flexible configurations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_numeric/">RandomNumeric</a>
- A new transformer specifically designed for numeric types (large
integers or floats), sharing similar features with
<code>RandomInt</code> and <code>RandomFloat</code>, but tailored for
handling huge numeric values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_string/">RandomString</a>
- Now supports hash engine mode
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_unix_timestamp/">RandomUnixTimestamp</a>
- This new transformer generates Unix timestamps with selectable units
(<code>second</code>, <code>millisecond</code>,
<code>microsecond</code>, <code>nanosecond</code>). Similar in function
to <code>RandomDate</code>, it supports the hash engine and dynamic
parameters for <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> thresholds, with
the ability to override these units using <code>min_unit</code> and
<code>max_unit</code> parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_uuid/">RandomUuid</a>
- Added hash engine support
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_person/">RandomPerson</a>
- Implemented a new transformer that replaces <code>RandomName</code>,
<code>RandomLastName</code>, <code>RandomFirstName</code>,
<code>RandomFirstNameMale</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameFemale</code>,
<code>RandomTitleMale</code>, and <code>RandomTitleFemale</code>. This
new transformer offers enhanced customizability while providing similar
functionalities as the previous versions. It generates personal data
such as <code>FirstName</code>, <code>LastName</code>, and
<code>Title</code>, based on the provided <code>gender</code> parameter,
which now supports dynamic mode. Future minor versions will allow for
overriding the default names database.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/advanced_transformers/custom_functions/core_functions/#tsmodify">tsModify</a>
- a new template function for time.Time objects modification
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduced a new
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_ip/">RandomIp</a>
transformer capable of generating a random IP address based on the
specified netmask.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a new
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_mac/">RandomMac</a>
transformer for generating random Mac addresses.

id="vivaldi-takes-firm-stance-against-ai-will-not-include-it-in-its-browser">Vivaldi
takes firm stance against AI, will not include it in its browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The web browser Vivaldi is taking a firm stance against including
machine learning tools to its browser. So, as we have seen, LLMs are
essentially confident-sounding lying machines with a penchant to
occasionally disclose private data or plagiarise existing work. While
they do this, they also use vast amounts of energy and are happy using
all the GPUs you can throw at them which is a problem we’ve seen before
in the field of cryptocurrencies. As such, it does not feel right to
bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation
going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to
add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill
up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are
available. ↫ Julien Picalausa on the Vivaldi blog I’m not a particular
fan of Vivaldi personally – it doesn’t integrate with KDE well visually
and its old-fashioned-Opera approach of throwing everything but the
kitchen sink at itself is just too cluttered for me – but props to the
Vivaldi team for taking such clear and firm stance. There’s a ton of
pressure from big money interests to add machine learning to everything
from your operating system to your nail scissors, and popular tech
publishers are certainly going to publish articles decrying Vivaldi’s
choice, so they’re not doing this without any risk. With even Firefox
adding machine learning tools to the browser, there’s very few – if any
– browsers left, other than Vivaldi, it seems – that will be free of
these tools. I can only hope we’re going to see a popular Firefox fork
without this nonsense take off, and I’m definitely keeping my eye on the
various options that already exist today.</p>

most expensive hardware of the 4th generation. This begs the question:
how capable was it and how did it compare with the rest? In this entry,
we’ll take a look at the result of one company (SNK) setting budget
restrictions aside and shipping a product meant to please both arcade
owners and rich households. ↫ Rodrigo Copetti Rich households, indeed.
Back in the ’90s, when Nintendo was the only game in town – few people
in my area cared one bit about Sega – Neo Geo was a name we only knew of
vaguely. It was supposed to be a massively powerful console that was so
expensive nobody bought one, and some of us even doubted it was real in
the first place. Ah, the pre-internet playground days were wild.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The algorithm sucked me into another model craft hobby: Mini 4WD racing
(ミニ四駆). A Mini 4WD is a 1:32 scale model that is a mix between slot
cars and RC cars. You don’t control these cars with a remote control nor
do they drive in an electrified slot, rather you place your racecar in a
plastic track with high walls and send them speeding down the track at
~40km/h.

</iframe>
<p>
The twist is you don’t know
<a href="https://tamiya.com/japan/mini4wd/feature/2019/1206.html">what
the track looks like</a> until race day, so you have to be ready to
adapt. There might a big jump, moguls, or a tall mountain to climb. Once
racers have seen the course, they have some time to make adjustments by
balancing engineering choices about weight, power, braking, handling,
batteries, downforce, and more. Are you going to make your car lighter
and full send it over the tabletops? Or is slow and steady going to win
the race? The races are a brief cacophony of slapping plastic and
whirring motors but I can feel the electricity of the room through the
screen.

Where YouTube hooked me was watching custom 4WD Mini builders like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@azpaca0">アズパカ</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Niwakara">にわから</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@techyuuta">ユウタ</a>. They are
hellbent on making their cars as fast as possible. In Japanese they call
it “タイムアタック” (“Time Attack”). For their time attacks, they use
the
<a href="https://d7z22c0gz59ng.cloudfront.net/cms/japan/mini4wd/topics/feature/2019_12/circuit_1911_2c1_002.jpg">Japan
Cup Junior Circuit</a> (JCJC) course; a three lane track with a wave
feature and a wicked lane change from the inner lane to the outer lane
that will send light or fast cars flying off the course. The
standardized course (and video
format<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>)
is where the similarities stop because their cars are anything but
conventional.
</p>
<p>
The videos are all about iteration and experimentation. Testing all
kinds of parts and gimmicks like 3D printed chassis, side rollers,
battery types, motors, wheels, and downforce options. Sometimes the
tweaks are small, sometimes they are radical innovations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">An entirely
“blade” flat chassis</a>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKWx_TMOzvo">A chassis with a
motor on each wheel</a>
</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">A chassis with a
computer fan in the middle</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuqw_Bf08">A car with
knives</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1J8fqEXrv0">A dual-fan chassis

</li>
<li>
A car with model rocket engines!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRpmNh-kOkE">Why not</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That sort of raw, no-rules experimentation is refreshing to watch. It
looks like dumb fun. A reason to own a 3D printer. They experiments
don’t always work and will fail spectacularly, but lessons get learned.
And if you watch enough videos, you see them getting faster.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A stock car will complete all three laps in about 5 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Cars they made a year ago will go around in 3 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Cars they made six months ago, 2 seconds.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyoc3my8suY&amp;t=3s">A car
from one month ago, 1.63 seconds.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m not sure why Mini 4WD strikes such a chord with me. It could be
nostalgia for my RC car days as a ten year old. It could be my penchant
for Japanese model making. But I probably know what hooks me the most:
this is the flavor of engineering optimization work I like to do. Make
it lighter, faster, and able to handle bumps in the road. Websites are
of course vastly different than mechanical engineering… but the
correlation between weight and speed are enough to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240227130052/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alZvGsOVh3o">activate
my brain</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mini4wd.jpg" alt="Untitled" />
</p>
<p>
So I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3W5aHoc">Mini 4WD Starter
Pack</a> (and one for my son) to close the loop on my curiosity. They’re
only ~$20, so why not. The hitch in the plan is that a beginner track
costs $120. It would nice to have an opportunity to run around a complex
track without an upfront cost. My hobby shop used to host races and have
a track in-store before COVID, but not anymore. Maybe I can provide this
as a service to my kids’ friends… yeah… that’s a good justification.

Connecting the laptop to the server using UUCP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-30-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-using-uucp">
2024-06-30 Connecting the laptop to the server using UUCP
</h1>
<p>
I recently <a href="2024-06-15-uucp">connected my server to another
server via UUCP</a>. Now I’m thinking that perhaps I’d like to connect
my laptop as another node to it. I probably don’t need it, because I
<a href="2024-06-28-nncp">connected the laptop to the server via
NNCP</a>. But still. Perhaps
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a> still wants to do
stuff via UUCP. Perhaps it is the completionist in me.
</p>
<p>
For reference, see
<a href="https://www.bortzmeyer.org/uucp-over-ssh.pdf">UUCP over SSH</a>
by
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.gougere.fr/@bortzmeyer" title="@bortzmeyer@mastodon.gougere.fr"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bortzmeyer">@bortzmeyer</span></a>. Since
we’re using SSH, there will be a key pair, and since we’re using UUCP,
we’ll still a username and password. It’s going to be both.
</p>
<p>
I know, why aren’t we using NNCP.
</p>
<p>
Generate the key pair.
</p>
<pre><code>cd /var/spool/uucp
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown uucp:uucp .ssh
cd .ssh
sudo -u uucp ssh-keygen -C &quot;uucp@melanobombus&quot; -f id_rsa
</code></pre>
<p>
The file <code>uucp-key.pub</code> now has the public key.
</p>
<p>
On the server (!), add a line to
<code>/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, replacing the public
key:
</p>
<pre><code>restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Umelanobombus -l&quot; ssh-rsa KEY_FROM_ID_RSA_PUB uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
We will be using the username <code>Umelanobombus</code> to connect to
the server. This is not a real user!
</p>
<p>
On the server, save username and password in
<code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>
<p>
On the laptop, save system name, username and the same password in
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>sibirocobombus Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>
<p>
Now we have both levels: the public and private keys that allow the
<code>uucp</code> user to connect via <code>ssh</code> – and the
username and password that is used by <code>uucp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define our own name in <code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename melanobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s add the system to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code>. That is, on the
laptop, define the server we’re going to call. Since I already know that
sibirocobombus will report itself as <code>campaignwiki</code>, I’m
setting up an <code>alias</code>. The <code>chat</code> script waits for
the “Password:” prompt and then sends it. Note that this chat script is
much shorter than the one used in “UUCP over SSH”, linked above.
Apparently there’s no “Login:” prompt on my server so I had to change
it.
</p>
<pre><code>system sibirocobombus
alias campaignwiki
call-login *
call-password *
time any
chat Password: \P
chat-timeout 30
protocol i
port ssh_campaignwiki
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the new port to <code>etc/uucp/port</code>. Note that I’m listening
to incoming <code>ssh</code> connections on a non-standard port so I
have to provide. Also note that here we’re defining the
<code>uucp</code> “port” with a non-standard <code>ssh</code> “port”.
Just in case you’re not already confused.
</p>
<pre><code>port ssh_campaignwiki
type pipe
command /usr/bin/ssh -a -x -q -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
reliable true
protocol etyig
</code></pre>
<p>
Before doing our first test, make sure that the server is a “known host”
on the laptop, for the <code>uucp</code> user. Note how I am not using
<code>-q</code> because I want to see the prompt!
</p>
<p>
The password to give on the prompt is the one in
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
The authenticity of host '[campaignwiki.org]:882 ([2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:882)' can't be established.

This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Password: *secret*
Shere=campaignwiki
^C
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s add the laptop to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server. Since
the server is never going to call the laptop, no credentials and no port
is required.
</p>
<pre><code>system melanobombus
called-login Umelanobombus

local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic

protocol i
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s test it!
</p>
<p>
On the client:
</p>
<pre><code>echo hallo &gt; hallo.txt
uucp hallo.txt 'sibirocobombus!~/'
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s check the log.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like when things don’t work:
</p>
<pre><code>uulog|tail

uucico sibirocobombus - (2024-06-30 18:02:31.51 9275) ERROR: Line disconnected
</code></pre>
<p>
You can try to replace <code>-q</code> with <code>-v</code> in
<code>/etc/uucp/port</code> in order to see what <code>ssh</code> has to
say.
</p>
<p>
If you try again, the log says that the system is not ready to try
again:
</p>
<pre><code>uucp sibirocobombus alex (2024-06-30 18:04:47.94 9454) Queuing send of /home/alex/hallo.txt to ~/

</code></pre>
<p>
Force a call and check the log again.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -S sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
You might be specifying the wrong login, or using the wrong chat script.
On the server, the log might look as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>uulog|tail

uucico - - (2024-06-30 18:07:25.26 1248690) ERROR: Bad login
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the passwords:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code> on the laptop says what username and
password to use
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code> on the server says what username and
password to accept, separated by a TAB (!)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check the system:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop says what the client is
called
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the laptop says what the server is called
and how to connect to it, using what port
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/port</code> on the laptop describes that port
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server says what the client is called,
what username to expect
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check the login again, by going through it by hand. Check whether the
chat script would have worked.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0

^C
</code></pre>
<p>
When calling the server, specify a high debugging level:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -x 11 -S sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
To look at the debug output. Here’s an example where I mistyped the
nodename in <code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop:

<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/30/myOpenVoicemailToALongtimeFriendAboutTheNYTimes.m4a">podcast</a>,
what we need from Biden, and how we need journalism to get out of the
way. Biden has a base. He should communicate directly with us. Joe, tell
us you saw what we saw. A snake oil salesman. A con man. A loser. A
criminal. We heard the tape of him blackmailing the Secretary of State
of Georgia. He wanted the military to shoot Black Lives Matter
protestors. Did he sell our secrets to Putin and others? He did all
kinds of horrible stuff that the press has forgotten to talk about. The
biggest problem here isn’t Biden’s age, though it is a problem, it’s the
controlling nature of our journalism, and the lack of any oversight.
They can’t be criticized because all we have are our individual voices,
with no organization. We keep paying the price. This podcast is in the
form of a voicemail to an old friend,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who
I introduce at the beginning of the podcast. We share the same
frustrations, I can see it in his posts on various social media
networks. I’d like to elevate our discourse. And in the meantime, imho,
it’s a pretty good story. <i>10 minutes.</i> <span

<h2 id="the-mimo-diaries-feedback-and-directory">The Mimo Diaries:
Feedback and Directory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Another quick update for those who are interested on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalissimo.com&quot;&gt;Minimalissimo&lt;/a&gt; side of my digital life. For those who don’t know, at the beginning of 2024 I took charge of Minimalissimo and I’m now curating it, updating it, designing and coding for it, and steering it towards its future. It’s a fun project to work on and I have a ton of ideas but also very little time. It’s a one man show and there’s a lot to do.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Today I pushed live a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/feedback">feedback page</a> because I
have a couple of decisions to take and I don’t want to do it blindly. So
if you are a reader of the site I’d really appreciate if you can take a
moment and share your thoughts on a few subjects. It shouldn’t take too
long, maybe 5 minutes at most.
</p>
<p>
The other thing I’ve been working on is a new directory that collects in
one place links to people and brands that are aligned with the
Minimalissimo vision. It’s something that’s incredibly useful for me to
have online because it will make the curation of the site easier and
that’s huge because curation can be very time consuming.

</div>
</figure>
<p>
The directory is ready form a technical point of view but now I need to
add content to it and that will take me some time. I have more than a
thousand links to go through and my hope is to have it live before the
end of the summer. We’ll see how it goes.

<p>Challenging questions: Why don’t journalists cover the Biden base? Do
they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think
they are the base? I thought they weren’t supposed to care who the
nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should
withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this
through?</p>

clip</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>It’s been a long while since I have felt really positive about most
of what I have been reading and seeing in AI. Not because I inherently
dislike AI, but because I feel like so many folks have been brainwashed
by the “scale is all you need” notion and “AGI in 2025” (or 2027 or
2029) nonsense, none of which seems remotely plausible to me as a
cognitive scientist.</p>
