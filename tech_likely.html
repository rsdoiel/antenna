their best after the fact to undermine a hard-won compromise that
involved years of negotiations and multiple all-nighters.</p>

TikTok influencers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Television journalists have long been encouraged to have a social
media presence to build their brands and provide additional outlets for
network content. Journalists have always been influencers for their
stations — but in 2024, we’ll see them start to be additionally
compensated for this labor, and financially benefit from their own
social media presence….</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, &quot;what songs do you want me to play?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and
usually the songs are tolerable, at least.
</p>
<p>
But a few albums, like Bluey’s soundtrack, transcend the children’s
genre. They’re genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car.
</p>
<p>
Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you,
besides a few duds, Ladybug Music <em>slaps</em>. And the songs
incorporate diverse styles, too, it’s not just the same nursery rhymes
regurgitated in a bubbly voice.
</p>
<p>
So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed
out.
</p>
<p>
I tapped one, and <em>nothing</em>. Just this notice:

<p>

Not available in my region? Well, that’s weird. I pay for Apple Music.
And I know the artist is in the US, and <em>I’m</em> in the US…

<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time and energy in my life worrying about things I
felt like I had to do for one reason or another. Either everyone else
was doing the thing, or specific people were pressuring me to do the
thing, or I never saw real examples or models of people who didn’t do
the thing, etc. At some point I started to realize that, if I really
challenged myself, I didn’t have to do some of the things I believed I
had to in order to win at life (and I would include the idea of having
to “win at life” on this list).</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Apple pushed out the public releases of iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2,
macOS Sonoma 14.2, watchOS 10.2, and tvOS 17.2. iOS 17.2 and iPadOS
17.2’s flagship feature is the new Journal app, which Apple teased when
it first introduced iOS 17 earlier. The app mimics several existing
popular journaling apps in the App Store from third-party developers but
leverages data from your Photos, workouts, and other Apple apps to make
journaling suggestions. Other features include the ability to tap a
“catch-up arrow” to scroll to the first missed message in a conversation
in Messages, the ability to take spatial video photos for later viewing
on Vision Pro, and several tweaks and additions to the Weather app. ↫

<h2 id="bots-again">Bots, again</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Bots, again
</h1>
<p>
I come home from a friendly meetup and notice that my tiny web-server
has a load of 80 instead of the usual 0.5. What the hell is going on? I
look at the logs of the last 24 hours and see an IP number with more
than 100 000 hits in the last 24h. What are they doing?
</p>
<p>
Whois tells me it is from the “Alibaba Cloud”. Oh yeah? What are the
Chinese trying to do on my site?
</p>
<p>
I start poking around. More and more IP numbers from all over the net
show up. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.
</p>
<p>
All right, so I’m blocking some of them individually as I go, but after
a while I realize that I probably have to block them at the network
level.
</p>
<p>
For the moment I’m also taking down one of the wikis that’s overloading
my server.
</p>
<p>
Just looking at the top 10 offenders for two of my domains, and running
whois on them to find the entire network they belong to, and checking
that it’s Alibaba or Tencent:
</p>
<pre><code># Alibaba Cloud 2023-12-10
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.76.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.80.0.0/13'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.74.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.235.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.246.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.244.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.240.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.236.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
# Tencent Cloud
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '42.192.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '49.232.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '101.34.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '43.142.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '124.220.0.0/14'&quot;
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
If I want this to be for the entire server and not repeat it for each
location, I guess I’ll have to use Apache rewrite rules.
</p>
<p>
While I’m doing this, I notice a new pattern… My wiki software allows
you to fetch a feed for every page. Either it contains updates to the
page (Oddmuse), or a feed of the pages linked (Oddmu). It’s for humans.
</p>
<p>
Of course some shit engineer decided that it was a good idea to scan the
web for all the feeds that are out there (so rare! so precious!) and to
download them all, forever (uncover the darknet! server our customers!)
and now I have to block IP number ranges, add robot agents to robots.txt
files (not all of them provide one), or block user agents (not all of
them provide a useful one) and I block and block and block (for the
environment! to avoid +2.0°C and the end of human civilization!) and all
this while I know that all these shit requests exist out there, for all
the sites, everywhere – a hundred thousand requests or more per day, per
site, wasting CO₂ – and what am I going to do, kill the feeds for humans
because some shit engineer decided to feed a machine?
</p>
<p>
I’m on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian
Jihad</a> again.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Virgin Media is downloading tons of PDFs I’m hosting? Are they
looking for copyright violations? On the blocklist they go.
</p>
<p>
And what’s this, Feedly is also downloading feeds like crazy, every few
minutes? Slow down, idiots. My news is not important. On the blocklist
they go. Or are you trying to train your stupid intelligence? Fuck this
AI training stuff. I already use “X-Robots-Tag: noimageai” but I guess I
should add even more HTTP headers to block even more engineers
overstepping boundaries?
</p>
<p>
Ah, and MonitoRSS going into overdrive, from the Amazon Cloud. Really, I
don’t think there are humans in the Amazon Cloud. Onto the blocklist
they go. Well, at least this IP range.
</p>
<p>
And who’s that VelenPublicWebCrawler, zealously collecting pages? Onto
the blocklists they go.

id="is-risc-v-ready-for-hpc-prime-time-evaluating-the-64-core-sophon-sg2042-risc-v-cpu">Is
RISC-V ready for HPC prime-time: evaluating the 64-core Sophon SG2042
RISC-V CPU</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Sophon SG2042 is the world’s first commodity 64-core RISC-V CPU
for high performance workloads and an important question is whether the
SG2042 has the potential to encourage the HPC community to embrace
RISC-V. In this paper we undertaking a performance exploration of the
SG2042 against existing RISC-V hardware and high performance x86 CPUs in
use by modern supercomputers. Leveraging the RAJAPerf benchmarking
suite, we discover that on average, the SG2042 delivers, per core,
between five and ten times the performance compared to the nearest
widely available RISC-V hardware. We found that, on average, the x86
high performance CPUs under test outperform the SG2042 by between four
and eight times for multi-threaded workloads, although some individual
kernels do perform faster on the SG2042. The result of this work is a
performance study that not only contrasts this new RISC-V CPU against
existing technologies, but furthermore shares performance best practice.
↫ Nick Brown, Maurice Jamieson, Joseph Lee, Paul Wang The Sophon SG2042
is the RISC-V processor found in the Milk-V Pioneer workstation, which
was recently featured on LTT as well, for the video crowd among us.
There’s definitely still a way to go for RISC-V, but the gains over the
past few years are clear, and if this keeps progressing this way, it
won’t be long before RISC-V becomes a valid, competitive
architecture.</p>

election year, don’t forget there’s more than one story</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>To a journalist, a presidential election year is kind of like
Christmas morning to a six-year-old — as the event gets closer,
conversation, planning, and feverish anticipation accelerates to an
obsessive frenzy. To a great degree, it’s all they can think about. But
there is one piece of advice I give my friends, colleagues, and
clients…</p>

Smaller newsrooms are hungry for automation and AI. Along with my

<h1>
I bought a keyboard
</h1>
<p>
I was at the <a href="https://swissmk.ch/">Swiss Mechanical Keyboard</a>
Meetup. I wanted to get rid of my keyboards and instead I bought one. 😓
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://chaos.social/@xtaran" title="@xtaran@chaos.social"><span

colourful keyboards and a MNT Reform laptop in the middle:

<a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@deshipu" title="@deshipu@fosstodon.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="deshipu">@deshipu</span></a>’s table with a
lot of very flat keyboards with few keys, some of them steno keyboards:

Keyboards by Nicolas and Valerio:

<p>
This is the keyboard I bought from Sam:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
It is labelled as
<a href="https://www.monsgeek.com/product/m6/">Monsgeek M6</a>, KTT
Matcha, GMK DMG Clones.
</p>
<p>
Right now my fingers are confused and seemed to expect the Atreus layout
I had been using recently, at least as far as the thumbs go.
</p>
<p>
I get the feeling that not all keys work as intended, though. The right
Ctrl key <del>has no effect</del> is a layer switch that enables &lt;
and &gt; to control the volume, for example. The left Alt key is GUI.
The right Alt key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their
switch. The App key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their
switch. The App key is actually Alt. The ] and = keys <del>have no
effect</del> had a bent pin on their switches. The Volume Up key is
mapped to Delete. The Volume Down key is mapped to Prior. The Mute Key
is mapped to Next.
</p>
<p>
Hm.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the problem was the firmware. My guess is that it was
too old.
</p>
<p>
So here’s what I did:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
download <code>monsgeek_m6_via.bin</code> from

</li>
<li>
download <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases">QMK

</li>
<li>
install it and have it install all the drivers
</li>
<li>
plug the keyboard in while Esc is being pressed
</li>
<li>
pick the firmware downloaded and flash it
</li>

that should make you cry. So many of our friends on the web are happy to
let Facebook run the new Twitter. What is wrong with you. I don’t know
any better way to put it. Quitting Twitter is pointless, meaningless,
powerless. But not building Threads for Facebook is not meaningless. For
once can people look out for the future, keep the window open for
independence for writers and developers, and let us try out some new
ideas that might not be something Zuckerberg would love? Come on
already. This is the saddest moment, when there’s so much possibility,
and you all are ready to just throw it away. (And no, I don’t believe
for a minute they’re going to do anything that helps the Fediverse. I
know the playbook. Saying you’ll be open is what you do until you
dominate, then it’s just business. Truth is it’s always just business,
and saying you’re going to be open at this stage of network development
<i>is</i> good for business.)</p>

<p>
If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!
</p>
<p>
Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for
some reason I don’t find out about the work until it’s too late.
</p>
<p>
What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there’s a reason – I
want to learn from it.
</p>
<p>
I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

And of course I’ll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.

want to say this as loudly and clearly as I can. If we want independent
writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help
us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can
influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all
writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I
can refer back to it. I really don’t have a good way yet to find stuff
I’ve written. It’s all there on the web, for crying out loud.
</p>
<p>
More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very
little of that. It’s amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by
other developers. This is a huge problem, it’s why we’ve always been
dominated by big companies who don’t care about what we do.
</p>
<p>
Start with a search engine for bloggers. I’ll help. And let’s do lots of
them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas.

moving on to this year’s BOTY, I thought HCR could help figure out how
we could move past merely reporting on Trump’s danger to democracy,
something that was clear going back to 2015, the news could start
reporting on The Resistance, what we’re doing to prevent the end of
democracy. And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy
things for them to write about! We’re not doing that. It started out
well, with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.">Woman’s
March on January 20, 2017</a>, but that was it. We can and must keep
showing up, and I’m not advocating huge marches, I want to see
neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk
(if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music,
food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic
participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not
against something but <i>for</i> all of us. All we have to do is figure
out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The
idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our
democracy would be in the best shape it’s been in probably since
inception. I had another idea that’s worth considering. We should all
wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we
stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a
photo of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html">Martin
Luther King</a>. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but
it didn’t catch on. If we all did, it’s omission would be noticed, and
we’d know there’s someone we should talk with about America and offer
them a free button, nicely, if they’ll put it on right now. Anyway, I’m
putting this out there again, and I’ll keep doing it.</p>

<p>Starting in September or so I start thinking about
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty">Blogger
of the Year</a>, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many
people care, but it’s a good thing for me to do – to review what makes a
blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me – obviously.
We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved.
People think “well it’s just me and I don’t matter” – which is totally
true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least <i>they’ll</i>
know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value,
which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last
year I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915">chose</a>
Heather Cox Richardson, whose
<a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">Substack site</a>
is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different
times, and if I’m up and in the mood, I’ll spend a few minutes with HCR
and it’s always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her
writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started
reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from
my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.</p>

<p>The Unix philosophy of using compact expert tools that do one thing
well and pipelining them together to manipulate data is a great idea and
has worked well for the past few decades. This philosophy was outlined
in the 1978 Foreword to the Bell System Technical Journal describing the
UNIX Time-Sharing System: Items i and ii are oft repeated, and for good
reason. But it is time to take this philosophy to the 21st century by
further defining a standard output format for non-interactive use. ↫

<h2 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a
<a href="https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner">link</a>
to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you
through that. Now that it works on phones, I can see how nice it is to
be able to skim the news while you’re out and about.
</p>
<p>
When you’re working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep
your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been
some huge ones this year. The product’s identity system had to be
replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready
to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the
<a href="https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/">Automattic
VIP server</a> required fairly large pieces of the software to be
rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There’s
a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime
environment doesn’t include local storage. Everything has to be stored
in a database.
</p>
<p>
All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another
that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html">decided</a> we had
to have <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html">reading
lists</a>, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with
this product. And one more thing, let’s get this mofo working on mobile
devices as it was meant to, which turned out to be not as hard as I
imagined, and very nice to have.
</p>
<p>
The new version of the software with all the new code turned on is at
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>. That’s the version
that’s running on Automattic’s servers, and should be able to scale to
far more users. The docs aren’t converted yet, but the software is
basically the same. You should read the
<a href="http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml">first page</a> of
the docs, at least, so you aren’t surprised to find out that your
subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product,
it’s more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you
can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see
what would happen if instead of building something complicated around
conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see
where we could go with that. That’s what FeedLand is.
</p>
<p>
PS: I can’t believe how fast Automattic’s system is. I don’t understand
how it does all that work in so little time.
</p>
<p>
PPS: The menus are different on the mobile version, by necessity. I
included the Bookmarks menu, it’s really important to have the news you
want to read available one click away in mobile. I imagine doing setup
on your home computer, with links you’ll use when you’re using the
mobile version.
