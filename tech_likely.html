<p>
There’s a <a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll">new
plugin</a> that adds a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a>
to a WordPress site.
</p>
<p>
It would be helpful if people who are regular readers of Scripting News
who use WordPress, set up a test site, give it a try and let us know how
it goes. You can help us get to the next level with this stuff.
</p>
<p>
So there are two sides, the FeedLand side and the WordPress side.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The FeedLand side</b>.
<a href="https://feedland.com/?signonscreen=true">Sign on</a> to
FeedLand, create an account if you don’t have one, and subscribe to a
bunch of feeds. These will be the feeds in your blogroll. There are some
tips on how to find feeds, in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/24/132025.html#a134443">next
section</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>The WordPress side</b>. There’s a
<a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll">new plugin</a>,
developed by the people at the Team51 group at Automattic. They have a
<a href="https://github.com/a8cteam51/feedland-blogroll/blob/trunk/README.md">checklist</a>
for how to install the plugin in a WordPress site.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have questions or comments, or need help getting it working, post
a note in the <a href="">discussion group</a> here.
</p>
<p>
You can get ideas for feeds for your blogroll from reading other
people’s feed lists. When you see a checkbox that isn’t checked, you can
subscribe to the feed simply by checking the box.

<h2 id="how-i-tricked-ios-into-giving-me-eu-dma-features">How I tricked
iOS into giving me EU DMA features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>In iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new system called eligibilityd. This
works with countryd (which you might have heard about when it first
appeared in iOS 16.2) and the Apple ID system to decide where you
physically are. The idea is that multiple sources need to agree on where
you are, before giving you access to features such as those mandated by
the Digital Markets Act. ↫ Adam Demasi The way Adam Demasi managed to
convince Apple his very much Australian iPhone in Australia was, in
fact, a European Union iPhone in the European Union was by making sure
not a single wireless signal managed to escape the device. He had to
disable location services, insert an Italian SIM, set up a pfSense Wi-Fi
router using the regulatory country of Italy, and go into his basement
where there’s no mobile signal. Between all these steps, the phone was
reset multiple times. And then, and only then, did the iPhone think it
was in the European Union, with all the benefits that entails. Demasi
has no idea which of these steps are actually needed, but the process of
figuring this all out is ongoing, and more information is sure to be
discovered as smart people sink their teeth into the process by which
Apple determines where an iPhone is from.</p>

<h1 id="2024-04-24-micro-blogs">
2024-04-24 Micro-blogs
</h1>
<p>
Recently, I jokingly replied to
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@jameschip" title="@jameschip@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jameschip">@jameschip</span></a> when he
said “maybe we need a new word for types of blogs that have comments and
federation” that we should have kept the word micro-blogs. Regular
blogs, with a character limit.
</p>
<p>
Then again, micro-blogs in that sense, from Identi.ca to GNU Social,
Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and the Fediverse now have a big plus:
Notification actually works. If you mention another account, they get
notified. If you get a reply, you get notified. It’s glorious.
</p>
<p>
For regular blogs, notification works with the oldest, universal,
federated, communication medium online: email. Conversely, if you don’t
have email or don’t do, you don’t get notified and most likely you can’t
even comment. 😐
</p>
<p>
I tried web-mentions and they didn’t work I wanted them to. Far too few
other blogs supported them, and for this blog, I didn’t know what to do
with them. I didn’t want to send myself email so I turned them into
comments, but mentions aren’t as strong a signal as a comment. Mentions
aren’t public but comments are. Mentions don’t need a strong connection
to the main article but comments do. By turning mentions into comments,
I had made a mistake and the result was frustrating. So
<a href="2023-09-20-web-mentions-vs-referrals">I got rid of them</a>.
</p>
<p>
And so here we are, it’s 2024, and blogs still don’t have good
(spam-free) comments and notifications where as micro-blogs do. 😢

<h2 id="openbsd-as-a-daily-driver">OpenBSD as a daily driver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I always like it when I can link to an article written by an OSNews,
and this time it’s even relevant to me as I’m exploring OpenBSD myself.
OSNews reader and silver Patreon supporter Morgan has written an article
about using OpenBSD as a daily driver. OpenBSD is forever tied in first
place with Void Linux as my favorite desktop OS. This is particularly
funny because OpenBSD isn’t “just a desktop OS”; in its purest form, the
base installation without any installed packages, it makes for an
excellent Ethernet router, firewall, or web server. It even ships with
its own fork of X11 called Xenocara, along with fvwm2 and its own calm
window manager, so there’s a rudimentary desktop OS in there too. With
that said, in 2024 there is no such thing as a fully functioning desktop
computer or workstation without at least a web browser of some kind, and
if you’re adding packages you may as well build a full desktop system to
suit your needs. So how do you go from the amazing but unfortunately
limited base install to a “daily driver” workstation operating system?
There are many ways to do this, and I will present a couple of paths I
take depending on the hardware and use case involved. Before I do that,
a bit of prep is necessary to get OpenBSD into more of a desktop OS
mode. ↫ Morgan I’ll be using this guide over the coming days to make
sure I end up with something usable. I still haven’t decided on what
desktop environment I want to go for – I’m not interested in running
GNOME or KDE, so Xfce is probably the most likely option. I’d also love
to try out LXQt, but it seems the version OpenBSD has in its
repositories is very, very outdated (1.0.0 from years ago, when 2.0.0
was just released). There’s a small chance I might suck it up and use
one of those “build your own desktop environment” options, but I have no
idea which one I should go for.</p>

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">
Embeddable Game Engine
</h1>
<p>
<img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240> Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where
we were building cross-platform libraries for mobile developers, we
wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming capabilities for our users in the
form of adding 2D or 3D content to their mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired
libraries.
</p>
<p>
For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years,
and we contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).
</p>
<p>
Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great
UI support called Urho, and the other one was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>,
which had a great IDE, but did not support being embedded.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be
turned into such engine. While I tend to take copious notes of all my
meetings, those notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft
acquisition, but from what I can remember Juan told me, "Godot is not
what you are looking for" in two dimensions, there were no immediate
plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was not as advanced
as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.
</p>
<p>
We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go
into becoming a
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and
mobile platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR
headsets. Sadly, Microsoft’s management left UrhoSharp to die.
</p>
<p>
Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the
most popular open-source projects in the world.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Faolan-Rad">@Faolan-Rad</span>
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a
patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library that could be embedded into
applications. I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a>
and have been very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed
Godot content into their application.
</p>
<p>
However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one
Godot game as an embedded system and could not do much more. The folks
at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk Software</a> wanted to take this
further. They wanted to host independent Godot scenes in their app and
have more control over those so they could sprinkle Godot content at
their heart’s content on their mobile app
(<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)
</p>
<p>
They funded some initial work to do this and hired
<a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely Kis’s company</a> to do this work.
</p>
<p>
Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year. I came back very excited
from GodotCon and I decided to turn my
<a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype
Godot on iPad</a> into a
<a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete product</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of
Godot in discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to
productize and polish this patch for general consumption.
</p>
<p>
Now, there is a
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch
under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary Godot scenes into
their apps. For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot
scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is
done, I will update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift
users (bindings for other platforms and languages are left as an
exercise to the reader).
</p>
<p>
It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in
Godot land.

released with KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a big day for Fedora users such as myself – and especially for
Fedora KDE users, also such as myself. Fedora 40 has been released
today, and while the main focus is always on the GNOME release –
although not everyone is happy about that – the various other spins, in
Fedora parlance, have also seen major updates. Most prominently among
them is the KDE spin, which ships with KDE’s recent megarelease, KDE
Plasma 6. Starting at the top, Fedora 40 Workstation comes with the
latest GNOME release, 46, which we covered when it was released earlier
this year. It also comes with IPV4 Address Conflict Detection to resolve
duplicate IPV4 addresses in the same physical network, and the PyTorch
machine learning framework is now in the Fedora software repositories
for easier installation and implementation by developers – a harbinger
of what’s to come. The KDE spin comes, as already mentioned, with KDE
Plasma 6, and inherits the non-GNOME improvements and fixes as well, of
course. There’s also countless other spins covering pretty much every
desktop environment and window manager under the sun, and Fedora 40 is
also the first release to implement the new naming scheme for Fedora’s
various immutable editions – the Atomic Desktops.</p>

<p>Progress Software on April 19 said more about “considering” an offer
for MariaDB plc (the company not the foundation). They own NuSphere
which had a dispute with MySQL AB which was settled in 2002. My happy
history as a MySQL employee biases me but I thought that NuSphere was
not acting angelically. I think it…

big idea for the blogging world. I’d like to combine AI and search to

benefit from the collection. And when we browse, <i>it knows which blog
we write.</i> So it has a very good idea of what we mean when we ask a

<p>Hot on the heels of NetBSD 10.0 comes NetBSD 9.4, a minor release in
the previous release branch. NetBSD 9.4 is primarily a bug and security
fix release, however, there are some new features, such as support for
more MegaRAID controllers, ZTE MF112 and D-Link DWM222 USB 3G modems,
and improved CPU feature detection for newer AMD/Intel devices. All
users of netbsd-9 should upgrade if they are not following the stable
branch. ↫ NetBSD 9.4 release announcement A very important note here is
that the version of OpenSSL in NetBSD 9.4 is no longer supported unless
you have a support contract with OpenSSL. They suggest upgrading to
NetBSD 10.0, or to use OpenSSL from pkgsrc.</p>

<p>Tribblix, the unique ilumos distribution – think Solaris – has a new
SPARC milestone. It’s one of the few platforms still actively supporting
SPARC, so even if the amount of users might be slim, I think it’s an
important contribution to the ecosystem. The application software here
roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems, although the underlying
illumos is still closer to m25/m26. Note that there are no functional
illumos changes from the m28 sparc release – if that release didn’t work
on your system, this one won’t either. ↫ Peter Tribble I’m still looking
for my mythical, unobtanium Sun Ultra 45, a goal farther away now than
it’s ever been (Patreon maybe? One-time donation? Help me out after I
took OSNews full-time?), and the SPARC version of Tribblix would be my
first go-to.</p>

2024-04-22 Gopher, again
</h1>
<p>
Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to
be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept
thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version
of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a
library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully
grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>,
the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the
<a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a>
that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I
figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable
Gopher pages.
</p>
<p>
It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu
matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site
is back as a gopher hole on port 70!

<p>A misconfigured North Korean Internet cloud server has provided a
fascinating glance into the world of North Korean animation outsourcing
and how foreign companies might be inadvertently employing North Korean
companies on information technology (IT) projects. The incident also
underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their
outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on
computers in Pyongyang. ↫ Martyn Williams at 38 North What an absolutely

<h2 id="paying-for-it-doesnt-make-it-a-market">Paying for it doesn’t
make it a market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow, nailing it as usual. If you care about how people are
treated by platforms, you can’t just tell them to pay for services
instead of using ad-supported media. The most important factor in
getting decent treatment out of a tech company isn’t whether you pay
with cash instead of attention – it’s whether you’re locked in, and thus
a flight risk whom the platform must cater to. ↫ Cory Doctorow I’m sick
and tired of the phrase “if you’re not paying for the product, you’re
the product”, because it implies that if just you pay for a product or
service, you’re not going to be treated like ass. The problem is, as
Doctorow points out, that this simply is not supported by the evidence,
and that it isn’t whether or not you’re paying that makes you have a
good or bad experience – it’s whether or not you’re locked in. If you’ve
got nowhere else to go, then corporations can treat you like ass. There
are so, so many free services and products I use where I’m anything but
a “product”. My Linux distribution of choice, Fedora. My web browser,
Firefox. The countless open source applications I use on my desktops,
laptops, and smartphone. Those are all cases where even though I’m not
paying, I know I’m being treated with respect, and I feel entirely
comfortable with all of those. And no, you don’t get to exclude the open
source world just because it’s inconvenient for the “you’re the product”
argument. There are also countless services and products where the
opposite is true; I’m a paying customer, but I still feel like I’m the
product. I pay for additional Google Drive storage. I pay for an Office
364 subscription because I needed it as a translator (I’m working on
OSNews full-time now, and could use your help keeping the site going),
but I can’t cancel it because my wife, my parents, and my parents-in-law
use that same subscription. We pay for Netflix and one or two other
video services. I don’t know if our ISP or wireless provider do anything
malicious, but it wouldn’t surprise me. And so on. Being a paying
customer means nothing. It’s how easy it is for you to stop being a
customer that matters.</p>

opens its Android-based Quest operating system to other VR device
makers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re taking the next step toward our vision for a more open
computing platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating
system powering our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers,
giving more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to
build for. We’re working with leading global technology companies to
bring this new ecosystem to life and making it even easier for
developers to build apps and reach their audiences on the platform. Meta
Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work by Meta to build a
next-generation computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we
developed technologies like inside-out tracking, and for more natural
interaction systems and social presence, we developed eye, face, hand,
and body tracking. For mixed reality, we built a full stack of
technologies for blending the digital and physical worlds, including
high-resolution Passthrough, Scene Understanding, and Spatial Anchors.
This long-term investment that began on the mobile-first foundations of
the Android Open Source Project has produced a full mixed reality
operating system used by millions of people. ↫ Facebook’s blog In
summary, Facebook wants the operating system of their Quest series of
virtual reality devices – an Android Open Source Project fork optimised
for this use – to become the default platform for virtual reality
devices from all kinds of OEMs. Today, they’re announcing that both Asus
and Lenovo will be releasing devices running this Meta Horizon OS, with
the former focusing on high-end VR gaming, and the latter on more
general use cases of work, entertainment, and so on. Facebook will also
be working together with Microsoft to create a Quest “inspired by Xbox”.
The Meta Quest Store, the on-device marketplace for applications and
games, will be renamed to the Meta Horizon Store, and the App Lab, where
developers can more easily get their applications and games on devices
and in the hands of consumers as long as they meet basic technical and
content guidelines, will be integrated into the Meta Horizon Store for
easier access than before. In addition, in a mildly spicy move, Facebook
is openly inviting Google to bring the Google Play Store to the VR
Android fork, “where it can operate with the same economic model it does
on other platforms”. The odds of me buying anything from Facebook are
slim, so I really hope this new move won’t corner the market for VR
headsets right out of the gate; I don’t want another Android/iOS
duopoly. I’m not particularly interested in VR quite yet – but give it a
few more years, and I certainly won’t pass up on a capable device that
allows me to play Beat Saber and other exercise-focused applications and
games. I just don’t want it to be a Facebook device or operating
system.</p>

<h2 id="inside-the-super-nintendo-cartridges">Inside the Super Nintendo
cartridges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the remarkable characteristics of the Super Nintendo was the
ability for game cartridges (cart) to pack more than instructions and
assets into ROM chips. If we open and look at the PCBs, we can find
inside things like the CIC copy protection chip, SRAM, and even
“enhancement processors”. ↫ Fabien Sanglard When I was a child and
teenager in the ’90s, the capabilities of the SNES cartridge were a bit
of a legend. We’d talk about what certain games would use which
additional processors and chips in the cartridge, right or wrong, often
boasting about the games we owned, and talking down the games we didn’t.
Much of it was probably nonsense, but there’s some good memories there.
We’re decades deep into the internet age now, and all the mysteries of
the SNES cartridge can just be looked up on Wikipedia and endless
numbers of other websites. The mystery’s all gone, but at least now we
can accurately marvel at just how versatile the SNES really was.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">
This is a hefty one. I usually try to keep things as accessible as
possible, but this time we have to get a little more technical than
usual. We are picking up in 1964, with the first proposals for a new
version of ALGOL. From there we sail through the fraught waters of ALGOL
X, Y, W, and finally 68. Along the way we see how a language evolves
over time, and how people and politics mesh with technical issues.

<h2 id="niri-0.1.5-released">Niri 0.1.5 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we talked about Niri, a very unique tiling window
manager for Wayland that scrolls infinitely to the right. I’ve never
seen anything quite like it, and while it seems polarising, I think it’s
absolutely worthy of a dedicated niche. The project’s got a major new
release out, and there’s a lot of improvements here. First and foremost,
virtually all animations have been overhauled, and new ones have been
added for almost every kind of interaction. The videos on the release
page do a really good job of highlighting what they’re going for, and I
think it looks great, and for the animation-averse, every individual
animation can be turned off. Niri now also supports variable refresh
rate, and the IPC mechanism has been improved. Among the smaller
improvements is a welcome one: when using the touchscreen, the mouse
cursor disappears. I really think this one has to be tried before
judged, and I’m seriously contemplating setting up a Wayland environment
just for this one, to see if it works for me. My window “flow”, if that
makes sense, is already left-to-right, so the idea of having that
effectively automated with an infinite canvas sounds very appealing to
me, especially on smaller displays. I just need to figure out if it
works in reality.</p>

Maldives 2024
</h1>
<p>
The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey – our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There are still plenty of colourful fish.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical
island game is Race for the Galaxy.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we also played

<p>
<strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.
</p>
<p>
We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

<p>
There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don’t know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It’s easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at
night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another
step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There’s a huge dark bruise on
its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while.
😭
</p>
<p>
We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that
the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and
so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do
some whale watching.
</p>
<p>
The whale watching did not disappoint.
</p>

<p>
This adolescent
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback
whale</a> was about 8m long. It’s unusual to find a whales here, now, so
close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation
that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that
perhaps it was sick.
</p>

<p>
<strong>2024-04-13</strong>. To it is raining. Good for Claudia since
she is supposed to rest her foot.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much
seemed to be worth posting about.
</p>
<p>
Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a
few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don’t know what to do with
it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at
it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance
and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about
the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Malé island –
when we flew back, I got a closer look at Malé from the air as we landed
and while it wasn’t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with
nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and
glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a
perfectly normal city and it wasn’t shabby and it didn’t have slums and
so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate
importance in order to improve people’s lives and giving them options so
that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over
Thilafushi, the garbage island didn’t look “apocalyptic” but just like
some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it’s an island in
the middle of the ocean.
