id="i-fixed-a-6-year-old-.deb-installation-bug-in-ubuntu-mate-and-xubuntu">“I
fixed a 6-year-old .deb installation bug in Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I love a good bug hunting story, and this one is right up there as a
great one. Way back in 2018, Doug Brown discovered that after installing
Ubuntu MATE 18.04, if he launched Firefox from the icon in the default
panel arrangement to install Chrome from the official Chrome website,
the process was broken. After downloading the .deb and double-clicking
it, GDebi would appear, but after clicking “Install”, nothing happened.
What was supposed to happen is that after clicking “Install”, an
authentication dialog should appear where you enter your root password,
courtesy of gksu. However, this dialog did not appear, and without
thinking too much of it, Brown shrugged and just installed the
downloaded Chrome .deb through the terminal, which worked just fine.
While he didn’t look any deeper into the cause of the issue, he did note
that as the years and new Ubuntu releases progressed, the bug would
still be there, all the way up until the most recent release. Finally,
2.5 years ago, he decided to dive into the bug. It turned out there were
lots of reports about this issue, but nobody stepped up to fix it. While
workarounds were made available through wrapper scripts, and deeper
investigations into the cause revealed helpful information. The actual
error message was a doozy: “Refusing to render service to dead parents”,
which is quite metal and a little disturbing. In summary, the problem
was that GDebi was using execv() to replace itself with an instance of
pkexec, which was intended to bring up an authentication dialog and then
allow GDebi to run as a superuser. pkexec didn’t like this arrangement,
because it wants to have a parent process other than init. Alkis
mentioned that you could recreate the problematic scenario in a terminal
window by running gdebi-gtk with setsid to run it in a new session. ↫
Doug Brown Backing up a few steps, if the name “gksu” rings a bell for
you, you might have already figured out where the problem most likely
originated from. Right around that time, 2018, Ubuntu switched to using
PolicyKit instead, and gksu was removed from Ubuntu. GDebi was patched
to work with PolicyKit instead, and this was what introduced the actual
bug. Sadly, despite having a clear idea of the origin of the bug, as
well as where to look to actually fix it, nobody picked it up. It sat
there for years, causing problems for users, without a fix in sight.
Brown was motivated enough to fix it, submitted the patch, but after
receiving word it would be looked at within a few days, he never heard
anything back for years, not helped by the fact that GDebi has long been
unmaintained. It wasn’t until very recently that he decided to go back
again, and this time, after filling out additional information required
for a patch for an unmaintained package, it was picked up, and will
become available in the next Ubuntu release (and will most likely be
backported, too). Brown further explains why it took so long for the bug
to be definitely fixed. Not only is GDebi unmaintained, the bug also
only manifested itself when launching Firefox from the panel icon – it
did not manifest when launching Firefox from the MATE menu, so a lot of
people never experienced it. On top of that, as we all sadly know,
Ubuntu replaced the Firefox .deb package with the SNAP version, which
also doesn’t trigger the bug. It’s a long story for sure, but a very
interesting one. It shows how sometimes, the stars just align to make
sure a bug does not get fixed, even if everyone involved knows how to
fix it, and even if fixes have been submitted. Sometimes, things just
compound to cause a bug to fall through the cracks.</p>

A new episode for the <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0

</p>
<p>
After a break since June 20, we now resume my original “audio blog” from
the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.
</p>
<p>
I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and
rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I
published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve
Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers – we’ll have an original
audio blog post. That’s when the pulse really starts.

I’ve been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I
got the title wrong, it’s Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it,
and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast
clients, I’m just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of
the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as
this one is)? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I
wonder if links make it through to most clients?

Was originally doing some research to make sure Australian bureaucrats
can handle names with hyphens in them, and found this. Good thing we
don’t live in Queensland, so we can still name our baby “Down With
Capitalism”!

<p><img src="https://www.jayeless.net/media/2024/07/naming-rules.png" alt="Restrictions on Baby Names: To protect children against careless and harmful names, the government had set out rules in registering baby names in Australia. The rules state that a child’s name must: not be obscene or offensive or contrary to public interest; (no racial slurs or infringements on the rights of another; be short and easy to write (In NSW, under 50 characters); not include symbols without phonetic significance such as N@talie, Da!sy, J#ke) or use numerals; not include or resemble an official title or military rank recognised in Australia such as King, Lady, Father, Prince, Sir or Admiral.Â  This was after a law was passed sometime in 1995 prohibiting the use of titles as part of the baby’s given name. use English letters only; not be similar to a recognised body, organisation or trademark; and In Queensland, the name can’t include a statement, like Save Mother Earth or Down with Capitalism."></p>

bugs me that there’s all this focus on Biden, when what we really need
is to organize as voters so we can be ready to deal with whatever
happens. That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and
it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among
voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the
Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally
the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of
the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.</p>

3.2.1 - Multilingual fast full text search</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Hi,
</p>
<p>
PGroonga 3.2.1 has been released!
</p>
<p>
This release adds support for WAL resource manager!
</p>
<p>
With the WAL resource manager support, you can solve the following
problems with the general WAL approach in PGroonga &lt; 3.2.1:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You need to remove old WAL manually to avoid unlimited storage usage
</li>
<li>
You need to use additional mechanism to apply WAL in background
</li>
<li>
You need to recover from a crash after PostgreSQL started
</li>
</ul>
<p>
See also the following document how to use this feature:
<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/streaming-replication-wal-resource-manager.html">Streaming
replication by WAL resource manager</a>
</p>
<p>
Note that you need PostgreSQL 15 or later because this is based on
custom WAL resource manager feature that is available since PostgreSQL
15.
</p>
<p>
If you’re interesting in how to implement the WAL resource manager, see
also the following blog post:

<h3>
About PGroonga
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/">PGroonga</a> is a PostgreSQL
extension that makes PostgreSQL fast full text search platform for all
languages! It’s released under PostgreSQL license.
</p>
<p>
There are some PostgreSQL extensions that improves full text search
feature of PostgreSQL such as
pg_trgm<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgtrgm.html">^1</a>.
</p>
<p>
pg_trgm doesn’t support languages that use non-alphanumerics characters
such as Japanese and Chinese.
</p>
<p>
PGroonga supports all languages, provides rich full text search related
features and is very fast. Because PGroonga uses
Groonga<a href="https://groonga.org/">^2</a> that is a full-fledged full
text search engine as backend.
</p>
<p>
See the following benchmark results for performance:

PGroonga also supports JSON search. You can use each value for
condition. You can also perform full text search against all texts in
JSON like textsearch in PostgreSQL.

<li>
Added support for WAL resource manager
</li>
<li>
Added support for downgrading by using <code>ALTER EXTENSION …
UPDATE</code>
</li>
<li>
Added support for Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)
</li>
<li>
Added support for typo-tolerance search
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
See also <a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/news/#version-3-2-1">the
3.2.1 release note</a> for full changes.
</p>
<h3>
Usage
</h3>
<p>
You can use PGroonga without full text search knowledge. You just create
an index and puts a condition into WHERE:
</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX index_name ON table USING pgroonga (column);
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column &amp;@~ 'PostgreSQL';
</code></pre>
<p>
You can also use LIKE to use PGroonga. PGroonga provides a feature that
performs LIKE with index. LIKE with PGroonga index is faster than LIKE
without index. It means that you can improve performance without
changing your application that uses the following SQL:
</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%PostgreSQL%';
</code></pre>
<p>
Are you interested in PGroonga? Please
install<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/install/">^4</a> and try
tutorial<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/tutorial/">^5</a>. You can
know all PGroonga features.
</p>
<p>
You can install PGroonga easily. Because PGroonga provides packages for
major platforms. There are binaries for Windows.

id="google-extends-linux-kernel-support-to-keep-android-devices-secure-for-longer">Google
extends Linux kernel support to keep Android devices secure for
longer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Android, like many other operating systems, uses the open-source
Linux kernel. There are several different types of Linux kernel
releases, but the type that’s most important to Android is the long-term
support (LTS) one, as they’re updated regularly with important bug fixes
and security patches. Starting in 2017, the support lifetime of LTS
releases of Linux was extended from two years to six years, but early
last year, this extension was reversed. Fortunately, Google has
announced that moving forward, they’ll support their own LTS kernel
releases for four years. Here’s why that’s important for the security of
Android devices. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority I fully support
the Linux kernel maintainers dropping the LTS window from six to two
years. The only places where such old kernels were being used were
embedded devices and things like smartphones vendors refused to update
to newer Android releases, and it makes no sense for kernel maintainers
to be worrying about that sort of stuff. If an OEM wants to keep using
such outdated kernels, the burden should be on that OEM to support that
kernel, or to update affected devices to a newer, supported kernel. It
seems Google, probably wisely, realised that most OEMs weren’t going to
properly upgrade their devices and the kernels that run on them, and as
such, the search giant decided to simply create their own LTS releases
instead, which will be supported for four years. Google already
maintains various Android-specific Linux kernel branches anyway, so it
fits right into their existing development model for the Android Linux
kernel. Some of the more popular OEMs, like Google itself or Samsung,
have promised longer support life cycles for new Android versions on
their devices, so even with this new Android-specific LTS policy,
there’s still going to be cases where an OEM will have to perform a
kernel upgrade where they didn’t have to before with the six year LTS
policy. I wonder if this is going to impact any support promises made in
recent years.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-opts-to-extended-windows-788.1-support">Mozilla opts to
extended Windows 7/8/8.1 support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Among them, Byron Jourdan, Senior Director, Product Management of
Mozilla, under the Reddit username ComprehensiveDoor643 revealed that
Mozilla plans to support Firefox on Windows 7 for longer. When asked
separately about whether it also included Windows 8 and 8.1 too, Jourdan
added that it was certainly the plan, though for how long the extended
support would last was still undecided. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin Excellent
move by Mozilla. I doubt there’s that many new features and frameworks
in Windows 10 or 11 that are absolutely essential to Firefox working
properly, so assuming it can gracefully disable any possible Windows
10/11-exclusive features, it should be entirely possible to use Firefox
as an up-to-date, secure, and capable browser on Windows 7/8.x. Windows
7 and 8.x users still make up about 2.7% of Windows users worldwide, and
with Windows’ popularity, that probably still translates to millions and
millions of people. Making sure these people have access to a safe and
secure browser is a huge boon, and I’m very happy Mozilla is going to
keep supporting these platforms as best they can, at least for now. For
those of us who already consider especially Windows 7 a retrocomputing
platform – I sure do – this is also great news, as any retro box or VM
we load up with it will also get a modern browser. Just excellent news
all around.</p>

<h2 id="no-more-boot-loader-please-use-the-kernel-instead">No more boot
loader: please use the kernel instead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with GRUB, a powerful, flexible,
fully-featured bootloader that is used on multiple architectures
(x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le OpenFirmware). Although GRUB is quite
versatile and capable, its features create complexity that is difficult
to maintain, and that both duplicate and lag behind the Linux kernel
while also creating numerous security holes. On the other hand, the
Linux kernel, which has a large developer base, benefits from fast
feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities and greater
overall scrutiny. We (Red Hat boot loader engineering) will present our
solution to this problem, which is to use the Linux kernel as its own
bootloader. Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, and packed into a unified
kernel image (UKI), the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line,
contain everything they need to reach the final boot target. All
necessary drivers, filesystem support, and networking are already built
in and code duplication is avoided. ↫ Marta Lewandowska I’m not a fan of
GRUB. It’s too much of a single point of failure, and since I’m not
going to be dual-booting anything anyway I’d much rather use something
that isn’t as complex as GRUB. Systemd-boot is an option, but switching
over from GRUB to systemd-boot, while possible on my distribution of
choice, Fedora, is not officially supported and there’s no guarantee it
will keep working from one release to the next. The proposed solution
here seems like another option, and it may even be a better option –
I’ll leave that to the experts to discuss. It seems like to me that the
ideal we should be striving for is to have booting the operating system
become the sole responsibility of the EUFI firmware, which usually
already contains the ability to load any operating system that supports
UEFI without explicitly installing a bootloader. It’d be great if you
could set your UEFI firmware to just always load its boot menu, instead
of hiding it behind a function key or whatever. We made UEFI more
capable to address the various problems and limitations inherent in
BIOS. Why are we still forcing UEFI to pretend it still has the same
limitations?</p>

2024-07-09 Murten
</h1>
<p>
We’re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a
circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years
ago</a> we ran around it – but today we ran about six or seven
kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We’re both
out of shape, sadly.
</p>
<p>
Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was
drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know
that this sleepy town was so rowdy!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Our destination was this village at the foot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Vully">Mont Vully</a>. A
rather small mountain.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very
tired.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Canals connect the lake of Murte, the lake of Neuchâtel and the lake of
Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going
up and down the channel. 🙄

Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart’s opening for the Daily Show on YouTube.
It’s always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he
says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing
President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the
people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice.
</p>
<p>
If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized
after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There’s never
been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on
organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue
about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren’t any
smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that’s been the
real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we’ve gotten the
tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And
now we’re at the last moment before it’s all flushed away and the NYT et
al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less.
</p>
<p>
Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don’t
think I’ve ever done that in a podcast, and I’m not sure I like it. But
the rage is real.

2024-07-08 Neuchâtel
</h1>
<p>
We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuchâtel. They came under Prussian
control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that
was far away and wouldn’t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic
and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the death in 1707 of Marie d’Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours
and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from
among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost
to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their
territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices.
Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but
the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I
of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion
through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability
assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry
(including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady
expansion. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel">Wikipedia</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La
Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.
</p>
<p>
At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead
fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.

<h2 id="some-more-thoughts-on-tbc">Some more thoughts on TBC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I know, I know. You’re tired of hearing me ranting about The Browser Company and their Arc “browser”. I’m also tired of reading about them but I keep stumbling on news about this silly company and I can’t help myself from yelling at the screen. They aired a commercial on TV the other day, clearly a reasonable thing to do when you have a product with no revenues and no business model. And not happy with that, they released a YouTube video with the CEO explaining the ideas “hidden” in the commercial and that tells you how good at marketing these people are. If you need to release an almost 5-minute video to explain the meaning of a stupid 1-minute ad you probably need a better marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what
prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in
the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them
offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he
must think you’re all a bunch of idiots.
</p>
<p>
He said in the video that there were three questions he wanted to ask:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is this internet we want to live within?
</li>
<li>
What if the web were truly made for you?
</li>
<li>
What are we here for?
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>
What is this internet we want to live within? What do we want to create
for ourselves?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just to make it clear, what this company is allegedly making is a
browser. It’s in their fucking name: The Browser Company. They’re not
making a new internet. They’re not creating anything. As I wrote before,
they’re not even making an actual browser like the awesome people at
<a href="https://ladybird.org">Ladybird</a>. They’re building a wrapper
around Chrome. This makes the CEO rant about browser monoculture even
more hilarious since by doing that they’re part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
In the video, he tries to argue that Silicon Valley companies are driven
by efficiency, you type something in Google and he gives you an answer
but there are times when you don’t want an answer, you want to get
access to the best set of results because you’re after experiences and
serendipity and a bunch of other complete nonsense. He asked, “Do we
even believe in a single answer?“. The answer is no Josh. No, we don’t.
This is why all search engines have a SERP. No search engine gives you
one answer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A lot of other times something just seems really interesting to you and
you want to go wide and deep and be surprised there are a lot of other
things we might want to optimise for when we’re designing this new
internet
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Designing this new internet? You’re not designing a new internet. You’re
using some algorithm to decide for me which 6 or 8 results I should be
seeing. In doing that you’re worse than Google.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The second thing is what would it look like if truly the web was made
for you?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m gonna ask you a question Josh: how can you make a web for me without
profiling me? I’ll wait for an answer the same way I’m still waiting to
hear back from your support team on that ticket I opened months ago
where I was asking how to prevent your stupid ARC Search from accessing
my sites.
</p>
<p>
You asked “What does the personal web, the personal internet look like”
and there are various ways to tackle this question but it certainly
doesn’t look like a generated ARC Search result page that is the same
for everyone. You said the web doesn’t feel personal because we all see
the same stuff and yet you showed a screenshot of your stupid ARC Search
pulling in results from Reddit and Trip Advisor. Again, if you’re
reading this and you’re an ARC user, they must think you’re a complete
idiot to believe all this stuff.
</p>
<p>
As for the final question, what are we here for and why am I looking at
this video, well Josh, I work in tech. I code websites, I care about the
web. Especially the independent, personal one. The one you’re ranting
about but probably don’t care about at all. I also have to care about
your stupid browser because even though it’s Chrome sometimes it has
bugs that aren’t present on Chrome and so I have to test on it. I’d love
to not care about your browser and your stupid ARC Search but I have to
because this is the world I live in. My email is public if you want to
get in touch. You probably won’t because why would you, you have nothing
to gain from a private exchange after all.

because he’s like obsessed with it, hahah. Tonight he’s explaining to me
at length how many layers there are to it: the class divide, the
sectarian divide between Protestants and Catholics in that era,
contested notions of masculinity (is it about going off to kill people
abroad, or staying home to play sport?)… honestly, he has me convinced,
it’s an interesting topic.

Also, heavily borrowing the style from FinalCut Pro for their inspector.

<p>
My original attempt on the left, the one where I start to use fonts,
spacing and bubbles from FinalCutPro styled on the right - still a work
in progress, but it already feels better:

I loved the FinalCut Pro UI elements for entering rotation data. One
neat feature is that in addition to the swipe to choose an angle, if you
long-press the dial goes into high-precision input mode.
</p>
<p>
I think I finally got the animation just right:

Guys, we have one of those Brother printers that are supposed to be so
solid and reliable, but it is not cooperating today. Keeps sending
itself to sleep mid-job and “going offline” so I have to physically walk
to it and turn it back on. “Printing” blank pages. When told to print a
three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then
skips page 3. That “just buy this Brother printer everyone has, it’s
fine” article lied to me.

Wordle Kitty has become the Editor in Chief of the NY Times! That’s
pretty cool right. But she’s still cute. And she’s working late tonight,
trying to come up with the perfect cover story. She figured it out! She
put a picture of herself on the front page, with a huge headline saying
“She’s great!” In the picture she’s smart and cute and really adorable,
and she’s smiling and wearing a button that says “Hi Mom!”

Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-28-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-via-nncp">
2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP
</h1>
<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems. In
addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the
server. (In the following passages, I’m connected as <code>root</code>
to the server.)
</p>
<p>
Generate new configs on the systems that are missing
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine the file using a text editor. Each system needs to know the
public keys of the other.
</p>
<p>
So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server. I
also want to specify that I’m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my
“incoming” directory. I also want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop. I also
want to save incoming files from the laptop. And I want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the
laptop!
</p>
<p>
Let’s make sure those directories exist:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using
<code>nncp-file</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s connect to the server and check:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Nothing has arrived!
</p>
<p>
Let’s call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused
</code></pre>
<p>
Oops. It’s not running? That’s right, I need to run
<code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.
</p>
<p>
Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to
accept NNCP connections on port 5400:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/local/bin/nncp-daemon  nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR SP with sibirocobombus (nice MAX): reading: EOF
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR Connection to sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): EOF
</code></pre>
<p>
Back to the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z ERROR SP nice MAX: waiting for first message: unknown peer: ...
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z Connected to unknown
</code></pre>
<p>
Strange! That id listed there matches my laptop’s <code>noisepub</code>.
Checking the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> on the server again, I see
that pasted the wrong pubkeys… 🤦 Fix that and try again…
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>
<p>
Looking good! Check for the file on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s not there!
</p>
<p>
Let’s investigate on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z Packet QAROTFMX25ZPQOT5DEQQC7JE7EN3UD2FZIJNI6JKH75EC2DMSSZQ (486 B) (nice B): 0%
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z melanobombus has got for us: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>
<p>
This looks good, so we have the packet! And we can confirm this using
<code>nncp-stat</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-stat
melanobombus
    nice:   B | Rx:      486 B,   1 pkts | Tx:        0 B,   0 pkts
self
</code></pre>
<p>
What needs to happen now is “tossing” using <code>nncp-toss</code>. This
is, “processing” the packet and thereby delivering it.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss
2024-06-28T22:24:28Z ERROR Tossing file melanobombus/QAROTFMX25ZPQOT5DEQQC7JE7EN3UD2FZIJNI6JKH75EC2DMSSZQ (6 B): hello.txt: mktemp: open /home/alex/incoming/nncpfile17dd4b56c39f64d4: permission denied
</code></pre>
<p>
That’s right, the incoming file should be writable by more people…
</p>
<pre><code>chgrp nncp /home/alex/incoming
chmod g+w /home/alex/incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again!
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

2024-06-28T22:26:36Z Got file hello.txt (6 B) from melanobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
It worked:
</p>
<pre><code>ls -l /home/alex/incoming/
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 nncp nncp 6 29. Jun 00:26 hello.txt

cat /home/alex/incoming/hello.txt 
Hello
</code></pre>
<p>
🥳
</p>
<p>
I need to think about
<a href="https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Administration.html">admin
issues</a>, clearly.
</p>
<p>
I need to set up regular <code>nncp-call</code> on the laptop; I need to
set up regular <code>nncp-toss</code> on the server.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice to switch from <code>inetd</code> to
<code>systemd</code> perhaps? Surely they have written a replacement for
it. They have written replacements for everything! 😬

you’ve lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there
when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative
that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I’d never
see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No
way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we
cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn’t even
take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a
constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying
goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It’s why we’re
playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden’s presidency,
because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to
this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about
Biden’s flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The
problem isn’t that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were
to win, we’ll be right back here in another four years, and at that time
we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever
happens this year, what’s waiting for us is for most of us to wake up
from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It’s all
falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start
working together, intelligently, or else it’s over.</p>

This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the
corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our
attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House,
and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the
journalists, get away with it again.

<p>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the
press on our democratic process that I’m pretty depressed about the
future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who
moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I
asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said
he’d never do it. If they tried to force him, he’d get a gun and shoot
them. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard that, and I called bullshit.
You’re never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won’t
do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath
and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally –
and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a
social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn’t believe you
are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can’t get
back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone
number). I’ve been through all these miserable processes. And none of
them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who
demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where
we’re headed, again.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in
the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we’ve had
a grand total of 6 designs, and we’re currently on version 6, introduced
about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It’s now 2024, and for
a variety of reasons, we’re looking to work towards version 7 of our
almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea
of what I want OSNews 7 to be like – including mockups. The general
goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on
WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and
website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change
small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works.
Note that we’re not looking to change backends or anything like that –
WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer
skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape
the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology
news websites in the world, send me an email.</p>

<p>I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an
incredible
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a>
to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news
sites. It’s more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site
updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge
next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the
full story. Maybe it was a mistake calling this a blogroll. I’m trying
to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and
use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for
themselves. In any case I’m thinking about what to do next with
FeedLand, which is what’s behind the blogroll software. It hasn’t lived
up to my hopes, and I don’t think it’s likely to. I may be done writing
software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years,
between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of
writing for others was not a success. So I’m thinking about how to wind
down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using
it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a
bit. It’s that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few
years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span

<h2 id="getting-the-most-out-of-twm-x11s-default-window-manager">Getting
the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Graham’s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and
still isn’t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they
published an updated version with even more information, tips, and
tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat
1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing
System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists – how
many people even know X has a default window manager? – and even fewer
people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to
configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream
‘Ugh, thats awful!’ and head off to the ports tree or their distro
sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment.
There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick
around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod
it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :).
↫ Graham’s TWM page I’ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and
didn’t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend
some time with it now, because I’ve always liked the by-now classic
design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location
for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more
advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to
the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too
afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions
is almost always “yes” – do we have any TWM users in the audience? I’m
extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at
this point, or if, in 2024, it’s just junk code in the X.org source
repository, because I’m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel
a very strong urge to give it a serious go.</p>

brief summary of click-to-raise and drag-and-drop interaction on X11
and Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to drag an icon from a background window
without immediately raising that window and obscuring the drop target
window when using the click-to-focus mode. This is a barebones
description of what needs to happen. It assumes familiarity with code,
protocols, etc. as needed. ↫ Quod Video The articles describes how to
get there using both X and Wayland, and it’s clear there’s still quite a
bit of work to do. At least on my KDE Wayland setups, the way it works
now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to
a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover
for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this
only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible,
which might not always be the case. For usability’s sake, there needs to
be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next
without altering the Z-order.</p>

we’re not on speaking terms. Not that the nytimes ever listened, or
really twitter, for that matter.</p>

<p>
You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn’t
lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.
</p>
<p>
What you need to know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We all knew this would happen.
</li>
<li>
We all saw it happen, we don’t need you to tell us.
</li>
<li>
We’re going with him anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The plan is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election – VP
Harris steps up.
</li>
<li>
Now everyone can relax.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even
bigger story.
</p>
<p>
BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that
they all want Trump to lose? It’s logical that they would, but I thought
they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous
<a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View

I do regret my naïveté saying for years “one state or two state
solutions”.
</p>
<p>
The two state solution is merely gold-plating the turd of extermination.

<p>
On Mastodon,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara
Joy writes</a>: “Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger
Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he
falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step
in.”
</p>
<p>
I had a similar idea.
</p>
<p>
Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.
</p>
<p>
Let all the great next generation democrats shine.
</p>
<p>
Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.
</p>
<p>
Joe Biden dials in via satellite.
</p>
<p>
“Listen, I’m an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright
young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren’t
they wonderful!”
</p>
<p>
He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at
his feet and his grandchildren playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and
checkers…
</p>
<p>
And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn’t
spill his beer, so you know they have his back.
</p>
<p>
Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of
the Democratic Party.
</p>
<p>
Collect them all!
</p>
<p>
You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.
</p>
<p>
Some would be very rare.
</p>
<p>
Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack,
Michelle and Bill would have a concert.
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Mayor Pete!
</p>
<p>
Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.
</p>
<p>
Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift
wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit.
</p>
<p>
And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers.
</p>
<p>
Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and
the freedom fighters.
</p>
<p>
All the heroes of America, standing up for America.
</p>
<p>
The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course
Lynne Cheney.
</p>
<p>
We don’t need no freaking monarch, they all sing.
</p>
<p>
No we don’t! shouts the people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On
video</a>, the Dead sing “I’m Uncle Sam, how do you do!”
</p>
<p>
Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.
</p>
<p>
We all march together to victory.

I should add that once you have this volume of photos, Apple Photos
really shines - for searching events, people, locations, themes,
memories; and also to search text of screenshots and memes.

Two things I just learned:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>the iCloud storage is in addition to your AppleOne subscription, so
I don’t need to buy the 6 TB tier yet, I only have to buy the additional
2TB to extent the 2TB I have from AppleOne.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>you can share the storage with your family (our family is 5, not
sure if Apple Storage is Utah-friendly)
</p></li>

We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the
weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close
proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again
after Viv returned him home, though 😂
