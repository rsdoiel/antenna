Every few days I sacrifice some 50 good boys so I can continue browsing.

Today I discovered you can press this button and choose “new tab group

<h2 id="spreadsheets-are-the-best">Spreadsheets are the best</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Spreadsheets are the best
</h1>
<p>
I want to love Forth and Lisp and Perl and Go and I sort of want to know
Rust and Haskell and OCaml and Elixir, but really, the most important
electronic computing platform for the largest number people is …
spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
Formulas and graphs turn these into the multifunctional tool that spread
from accounting specialists to financial reporting to project managers
planning to household budgets to birthday and wedding guest lists.
</p>
<p>
If you think about it, spreadsheets for the masses succeeded where Emacs
failed. Spreadsheets allow you to build the tools you need. And sure, as
a programming professional I have heard my share of horror stories:
salary distributions and bonus programs, airport light systems, and many
other things that should have used relational databases and REST
services and whatever. But people know spreadsheets and use them to
solve their problems.
</p>
<p>
Spreadsheets are underappreciated. Certainly they are underappreciated
by programmers, I think.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@maxime_andre" title="@maxime_andre@mastodon.xyz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="maxime_andre">@maxime_andre</span></a>
linked me to the video
<a href="https://youtu.be/0yKf8TrLUOw?si=ZvLctptepVjLWXY3">Pure
Functional Programming in Excel</a> by Felienne Hermans where she
explains the benefits of spreadsheets for computing.
</p>
<p>
And I do think that the programming languages I listed failed us in as
far as they do not contribute to computers as
<a href="http://conviviality.ouvaton.org/spip.php?article1">convivial
tools</a>. Most people are not autonomous in their use of computers to
solve their problems because they cannot use the languages listed. They
must hope for an app to solve their problem. But they can use a
spreadsheet to solve their problem!
</p>
<p>
Emacs was supposed to be the editor for everybody, including
non-technical people. It’s just that our current design paradigms
optimize for the inexperienced users and penalize experienced users.
Users no longer expect Emacs-like tools and Emacs developers don’t
expect inexperienced users any more.
</p>
<p>
We feel it’s OK to feel overwhelmed by Emacs – but many people are
expected to navigate the real world in cars, on roads, with complex
traffic regulation, other traffic participants and machines we don’t
understand. To me, that illustrates a value judgement. On the one hand,
cars are a commodity. We no longer have to be an expert in combustion
engines to drive one. But we still need to learn how to use the tool.
There’s mandatory training, there are professional teachers, there are
enforcers of conventions, penalties, there’s financing available if we
want to lease a car, and so on. There is a lot of support and training
for users of cars and not so much for computers. The expectations are
different.
</p>
<p>
One might want to say that people need the car to get to work and that
explains the economic incentives. To this I might reply that when one
gets to work the actual work usually involves a computer and instead of
using a convivial tool that one has learned and mastered, customized and
extended to ones liking, one is forced to work with corporate software
that is as boring as it can be.
</p>
<p>
Except when it comes to spreadsheets. This is where everyday people
still can exercise mastery and solve their problems. It’s a tool and not
an app.
</p>
<p>
If we go back far enough, programming languages were designed to let
non-technical people solve their problems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> was a
programming language for business people.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> was a
programming language for faculty and students. From this point of view,
I’d argue, the programming languages I mentioned are in fact steps away
from this goal.
</p>
<p>
These programming languages solve more specialised problems. These are
tools for experts. But in doing this, they moved away from the realm of
everyday people using them to solve their problems. These languages fail
to make computers into convivial tools.
</p>
<p>
The ZX Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 both booted into BASIC. Sure,
that didn’t mean that we knew how to program. Loading and saving stuff
from cassette was hard. PEEK and POKE were hard. But the tools to turn
the computer into a convivial tool were right there. The computer came
with a manual.
</p>
<p>
My hope, my wish, my expectations are that we can do this and more. We
can make it even better! Spreadsheets are the saving grace. We should
put spreadsheets front and centre.
</p>
<p>
The sad reality is, however, that today we buy computers that
essentially boot into the app store.

few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even
back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you

tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser
like Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it
harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or
resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities
to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party
browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged
in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues.
With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we
think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent
process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical
standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend
to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage
and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The
official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.</p>

room?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons
I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was
finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for
winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room.
However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too
smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was
zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what
this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow
light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is
an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course,
how to hack it and make it more useful.</p>

PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 / Call for Papers &amp; Sponsors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 (P2D2 2024) will be held on June 4
and 5 in Prague, Czech Republic. The conference focuses on topics for
PostgreSQL users and developers. For more information about the event,
please see the website at
<a href="https://www.p2d2.cz/">https://www.p2d2.cz/</a>
</p>
<p>
We are now accepting proposals for talks and trainings in both Czech and
English. As in previous years, the conference is a single-track event
with a mix of talks in Czech and English.
</p>
<p>
To submit a talk, use this form:
</p>
<pre><code> https://p2d2.cz/call-for-papers
</code></pre>
<p>
The talk sessions are generally 45 minutes long (but may be shorter if
requested) and may be on any PostgreSQL-related topic. We’re also
looking for trainings (either half-day or whole-day) for the first day
(June 4). To submit a training proposal, use the same form as for
regular talks (there’s a field to pick talk/training).
</p>
<p>
Finally, we are considering to include a session of lightning talks
(short talks, five minute each). A separate call for proposals will be
made for them during the event.
</p>
<p>
The submission deadline is March 1 (which is Friday), end of day.
Selected speakers will be notified / confirmed shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The proposals will be considered by committee who will produce a
schedule to be published about a month before the event.
</p>
<p>
All selected speakers will get free entry to the conference (excluding
training sessions). We do offer covering travel and accommodations for
foreign speakers (generally enough for two nights in a hotel and travel
within Europe). If you require assistance with funding to be able to
attend, please make a note of this in the submission notes field.
</p>
<p>
We have also opened our call for sponsors. As usual, we we’ll offer
three sponsorship levels - the details are available at:
</p>
<pre><code>https://p2d2.cz/rocnik-2024/sponsorship

sponsorship, please contact us at sponsors@p2d2.cz (we’re happy to
answer any questions about the event and sponsorship conditions).
</p>
<p>
We look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you in Prague!

<h2 id="the-case-for-rust-in-the-freebsd-base-system">The case for Rust
(in the FreeBSD base system)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a
recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of
including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost
is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an
additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external
toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some
tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner
Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I’ve read and
what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn’t a programmer,
languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages,
and it’s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like
FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I’m not at
all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice,
but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A
big issue is FreeBSD’s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported
or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports,
which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting
barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea
either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development
of the Linux kernel.</p>

2024, Genode to focus on multi-monitor, suspend/resume, touchpads, and
much more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Without hesitation, our developer community quickly rallied behind
the topic “Sculpt OS usability”, desiring to boost the user experience
with respect to multi-monitor usage, convenient interactive UIs for
common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens,
tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging,
and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will
steadily continue with the gardening of Genode’s driver landscape,
fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux
kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable. In 2024,
we will also promote Genode’s custom (base-hw) microkernel to become the
default kernel for Sculpt OS, which is the culmination of a multi-year
effort. ↫ Official Genode news post The updated roadmap for 2024 details

realize that most of the people who read this blog aren’t sports fans,
something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series,
give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st
century that we don’t get any other way to imho. If we all watch
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>,
for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a>
and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>).
(No spoilers as to why he’s significant, and won the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a>
for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where
they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to
say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to
say to your friends – there! – <i>that’s</i> what I was talking about.
Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few
players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal
ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors,
which was one of those games you don’t ever forget, because of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a>
where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the
teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way
what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded
away. One day they’re our team, and the next day, supposedly they’re the
other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn’t just leave,
maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a
former
<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great
Hope</a> of ours, didn’t pan out, and now it’s nice to see him on the
court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could’ve
gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was
the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one,
the
<a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit
kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point
guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the
Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night’s
<a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a>
was something else. I understand that

How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader
</h1>
<p>
The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you
even get started?
</p>
<p>
There are four
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a>
(SK):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Regular infantry
</li>
<li>
Guns
</li>
<li>
Tanks
</li>
<li>
Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I didn’t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this
is not how it works. Start small.
</p>
<p>
You can get the
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules
for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.
</p>
<p>
Buy
<a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the
complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.
</p>
<p>
For online gaming, you need to download the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine
for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card
games. Vassal is free, open-source software.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to
run ASL on VASSAL.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The VASL site has a section called “Download Scenarios” where you can
download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you
load those games, you’ll see messages about all the extensions you’re
missing. Often you don’t need them, but feel free to install them.
</p>
<p>
If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be
aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff
that gets used in later boxes.

<h1>
Download the whole podcast.
</h1>
<p>
Feeling evil… Assume that there’s a podcast with a feed and you want to
download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.
</p>
<p>
First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we’re
going to need it in the next statement.
</p>
<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>
<p>
Then, get every enclosure:
</p>
<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>–continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume
downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes
already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That’s what I’m
hoping for, in any case.
</p>
<p>
The <code>–remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote
name. This is what most people would expect, I think.
</p>
<p>
You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular
expressions. I’m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!
</p>
<p>
I’m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing,
so it is what it is.

<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Let’s do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is
a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law.
She’s a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high
court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck’s, which she gets from a

on Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus.
Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of
her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture.
</p>
<p>
I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first,
because it’s closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard
