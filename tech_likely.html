accessibility</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Windows Accessibility team adheres to the disability community’s
guiding principle, “nothing about us without us,” emphasizing the
creation of products that empower everyone. We launched and announced
new and exciting features last September through our Windows 11 2022
Update and with your feedback, we have improved upon those experiences
in a number of ways. ↫ Divya Bhaskaran on Microsoft’s official Windows

<h2 id="the-hidden-secrets-of-the-fn-key-on-the-mac">The hidden secrets
of the Fn key on the Mac</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Even if you’ve used the Mac for decades, I suspect you have never
fully understood the Fn key. Not helping is the fact that Apple
sometimes calls it the Function key, but all Mac keyboards already have
12 or more numbered F-for-Function keys! The Fn key first appeared in
1998 in the PowerBook G3 Series (Wallstreet) and has become a fixture in
the lower-left corner of laptop keyboards ever since. The Fn key
migrated to standalone keyboards only in 2007 with the release of the
Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, where it occupies a spot between the
Delete key and the Home key. On Apple’s compact desktop keyboards, it
reverts to the lower-left corner. ↫ Adam Engst at TibBITS This article
made me wonder when the Fn key first appeared, but searching for it
leads to a lot of SEO spam that is clearly all wrong. As the article
notes, Apple first introduced it in 1998, and IBM already it in on the
monochrome ThinkPad 300 in 1992. It’s much older than that, though; the
IBM PC Convertible from 1986 also had one, as did the IBM PCjr from
1984. At this point I’m starting to think it was actually a fairly
common key, but with the explosion of IBM compatibles in the early ’80s
it’s basically impossible to check them all, and, of course, there’s the
possibility it may have existed on earlier systems, or third-party
keyboards long lost to time. This would be an interesting mystery to
solve.</p>

<h2 id="macos-sonoma-is-setting-records-for-update-size">macOS Sonoma is
setting records for update size</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It was Big Sur that focussed attention on the size of macOS updates.
In Mojave and earlier, updates had essentially been Installer packages
that brought a minimum of overhead. By the time that many had installed
Big Sur’s new Signed System Volume (SSV), we were starting to discover
just how large its updates were. Those were early days with its
completely new updating process that builds a new System volume, takes a
snapshot of it, and constructs a tree of hashes that verify the
integrity of every last bit within it. ↫ Howard Oakley I had no idea
macOS updates had become as big as they had, and good on Apple for
trying to bring this back down again, and speed up installation of
updates, too.</p>

<p>Early language acquisition students, at the elementary and middle
school levels, can see a problem with the language invisible to those of
us who are old, incurious, and set in our ways: The language contains
synonyms. These excess words which ancestors have failed to prune
represent the lack of insight and care that characterizes the older
generation which cares only about unscrutinized tradition with no regard
for the amount of labor that the legacy places, unwanted, upon the
people of today.</p>

understand the game much better now. I do sometimes make mistakes, and
always pay for them. The thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling
when you press Return to see the result of your first guess. It’s like
opening a present, only better. If you get two green tiles, you can bask
in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can
solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I’ve never gotten it in
two, and I don’t usually try, and when I do it’s usually a mistake, I
would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of
letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third
round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting
a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love,
self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five
green tiles open up

<h2 id="running-a-macbook-pro-with-debian">Running a MacBook Pro with
Debian</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Running a MacBook Pro with Debian
</h1>
<p>
Two days ago my
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">Purism laptop</a>
stopped working: As soon as the boot process tried to access the SDD, it
would shut down.
</p>
<p>
I started wondering about bringing the old MacBook Pro back to life. We
had stopped using it after my wife bought a new Mac. This seemed like
the best solution at the time. She only wanted a system where there was
at least a chance of getting decent support from friends or shops,
i.e. Windows or macOS. And we didn’t want to continue using the MacBook
Pro because Apple had decided to no longer support those machines with
macOS updates.
</p>
<p>
I always felt bad about having a perfectly usable laptop sitting around
that I had used myself for so long before buying the Purism laptop. But
now that the Purism laptop was out of order and my wife had moved to a
new laptop, I started wondering about installing Debian on the MacBook
Pro.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> suggested that I
might just try to plug the USB stick with the Debian installer into the
Mac since the chip architecture was compatible. I tried that, and it
worked!
</p>
<p>
Then
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> had an even strange
idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If it physically fits, you could even try the drive from the librem in
the macbook. Should only need fixing up the bootloader, if at all.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And so it was!
</p>
<p>
The SDD plugged into the MacBook Pro was mounted correctly by the rescue
system on the stick. I reinstalled GRUB on /dev/sda and after a reboot I
was running Debian on the MacBook Pro!
</p>
<p>
Everything seems a bit slow, but this is definitely workable. What a
great idea!
</p>
<p>
I installed <code>firmware-b43-installer</code> in order to get the
wireless card to run. The wireless card is a BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n
Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01). Broadcom is such a sadface.
</p>
<p>
I decided that perhaps Gnome was slow and I should go and try sway
again. I installed <code>gpomme</code> for the Apple hotkeys (change
display brightness, change volume) but then I couldn’t get the trackpad
to invert the y-axis and I’m back to Gnome…
</p>
<p>
A bit later, I figured that perhaps the input source detection wasn’t
working so I mashed it all together, and now it works!
</p>
<pre><code>input * {
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation disabled
    xkb_layout us
    xkb_variant altgr-intl
    xkb_options compose:caps
}
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s still looking good. The camera seems to be working, too.
</p>

<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Apple">#Apple</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Mac">#Mac</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2023-12-03</strong> Fixed the Purism laptop issue, switched the
drives back, and things still work. So for the moment the MacBook Pro is
back on the shelf. It’s just nice to know that I have a working backup
laptop should the need arise.
</p>
<p>
And I noticed a few things, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I like how the keyboard just works
</li>
<li>
I have a problem with the bottom left corner arrangement of fn ctrl alt
gui aka. Function Control Option and Command
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has an ethernet plug
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has a CD/DVD reader
</li>
</ul>

brand new BeOS, Mac OS X, and MS-DOS T-shirts in the OSNews Merch
Store!</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The holidays are coming, there’s a chill in the air (literally for
me, I live in the Arctic), so it’s time for a few new additions to the
official OSNews Merch Store. Do you live in the terminal, breathe the
terminal? We’ve got new shirts just for you. The opening message of the
terminals of Mac OS X, BeOS, and MS-DOS (let’s be generous and call
MS-DOS a terminal), with a command to call an osnews directory on the
file system, printed on the front of the shirt. They sport the correct
fonts, background colours, and exact verbiage used in the operating
systems themselves. For the Mac OS X one, I had to choose a last login
date and a username, so I opted for the exact time and date of birth of
my oldest son, and a username that’s a bit of an Easter egg. These
shirts of the organic cotton variety, and all proceeds go to supporting
OSNews’ continued existence so we don’t have to resort to SEO crap,
“AI”-generated garbage, and malvertising. Every item sold on the store
generates around $10 for us, with the rest going to our partner Bonfire
for producing the items and running the store. You can also support
OSNews through individual donations on Ko-Fi, by becoming a Patreon, and
by supporting us through LiberaPay.</p>

<h2 id="finally-proper-attribution">Finally: proper attribution</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>You may have noticed that starting today, I’ve been adding a
dedicated link to the main story in every post on OSNews. Our
old-fashioned 2001 method of “biggest link is main story” simply doesn’t
hold up today as proper attribution, so from here on out every post will
have a link marked by ↫ crediting the name and/or publication of the
main linked article (or multiple where it makes sense). I’ve been
unhappy with our attribution for years, and finally got my act together
and settled on this solution. While I’ve had, in total, maybe no more
than 2-3 complaints about this since I started in 2006 – it’s taken too
long, and I apologise for that. Credit and attribution matter. For the
curious: ↫ is part of the arrows Unicode block as U+21AB, titled
“Leftwards arrow with loop”. I settled on it because the path of the
loop and the arrow evoked a feeling of being yoinked back somewhere
else, and that’s what a link does. Sure, I could’ve opted for a chain
link or whatever, but that’s boring.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>I was always very interested in OpenBSD and a few months ago, I
decided to give it a try. I’ve quickly fallen in love with it! There is,
however, a big problem: Hare does not fully support OpenBSD! So, I
decided to port it and I am happy to announce that my work was merged
yesterday and OpenBSD is now fully supported by Hare. Let me show you
some of the tricky stuff that was involved in the port. ↫ Lorenz (xha)
on the official Hare blog Hare is a relatively new programming language,
and originally only supported Linux and FreeBSD. This post details the
process of porting it over to OpenBSD.</p>

I wrote this as a
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave/111517322418415422">Mastodon
post</a> to a bunch of people who somehow I got cc’d to. I figured I
should share it here too.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Let’s start with feeds and build as much of a Mastodon as we can,
without inventing anything new and see what we come up with.
</li>
<li>
That way we know at every step we’re standing on a solid foundation of
interop.
</li>
<li>
At the same time invest in the feed support of every contender, no
matter what “verse” its part of.
</li>
<li>
John Spurlock has done an exemplary implementation of RSS 2.0 feeds for
Bluesky. That
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">format</a>
should be copied everywhere. He did it in about a week in July and it’s
great. We’re building all kinds of stuff on it. Wish it were in
Mastodon, and wish Bluesky would bake it in.
</li>
<li>
Forget about clubs, what we want is interop, maximally as widely as
possible to force the silos to get on board. They won’t unless they have
to.

artcasting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I pinged Doc the other day saying he should do an artcasting feed.
</p>
<p>
Doc is in addition to being a prodigious blogger, also is a photo taker
and story teller, so he is perfect for artcasting.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/07/29/doc.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
was then going to think about what would be the easiest way to get him
going, and quickly realized the fastest way is Bluesky because
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock">John
Spurlock</a> did it right and his feeds coming out of Bluesky are
totally artcasting-compatible. Just like that. (Artcasting is one of
those cases where almost everyone was doing it the right way. Absolutely
no one invented it, it was just obvious how it should work, obvious to
enough people.)
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to talk about it with A8C people first, because it’s also
an opportunity to support it in WordPress, or to create a small app that
interfaces to WordPress, so it can lead here too. But Doc beat me to it,
he posted a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social/post/3kfnwb6dbf72b">beautiful
picture</a> of a building site his new hometown to Bluesky, and it
appeared in
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:dsearls.bsky.social">his
RSS 2.0 feed</a>, and of course it
<a href="https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social">showed</a>
<a href="https://feedland.com/?item=594431">up</a>
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social">in
FeedLand</a> when I subscribed to his feed.
</p>
<p>
So I added it to my collection of artcasting feeds, and the
<a href="https://lists.feedcorps.org/artshow.opml">new version</a> is
now
<a href="https://feedland.com/?readinglist=https%3A%2F%2Flists.feedcorps.org%2Fartshow.opml">available</a>
on <a href="https://feedland.com/?feedcorps=true">FeedCorps</a> and his
name shows up in the list in the
<a href="https://artshow2.scripting.com/">artshow app</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is how we do it, keep turning the wheel.
</p>
<p>
Interop my friends.

<h2 id="the-world-depends-on-60-year-old-code-no-one-knows-anymore">The
world depends on 60-year-old code no one knows anymore</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The problem is that very few people are interested in learning COBOL
these days. Coding it is cumbersome, it reads like an English lesson
(too much typing), the coding format is meticulous and inflexible, and
it takes far longer to compile than its competitors. And since nobody’s
learning it anymore, programmers who can work with and maintain all that
code are a increasingly hard to find. Many of these “COBOL cowboys” are
aging out of the workforce, and replacements are in short supply. This
puts us in a tricky predicament. We need to maintain and modernize the
code that underpins so much of the business and finance worlds, but we
don’t have enough skilled workers we need to carry out those updates.
This is precisely the kind of problem that IBM thinks it can fix with
AI. ↫ JD Sartain for PCMag It seems like learning and getting good at
COBOL is a surefire way to ensure job security. I wonder if there’s a
way to make modern applications or software in COBOL? I mean, there are
COBOL compilers for modern platforms, of course, but are there any
bindings (I think that’s the correct term?) for modern GUI toolkits like
GTK, Qt, and so on? The headline’s probably a bit hyperbolic, but the
core of the issue stands.</p>

you ever wanted to know about HP’s 9000 Series 300</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard’s 9000 Series 300 (HP300) was a range of technical
workstations based on Motorola 680×0 microprocessors. Superbly
engineered in modular form, and ahead of the curve in terms of
functionality, these workstations were used mainly as instrument
controllers and for desktop technical computing. The HP300 series
launched in 1985 with the models 310 (pictured below) and 320. It
evolved through numerous variants of increasing power, concluding with
the 38x models released in 1991. The series was officially obsolete as
of 1997. The definitive website dedicated to vintage Hewlett-Packard
computers is the wonderful HP Computer Museum, which has excellent and
wide-ranging archival resources. The present site is focused
specifically on the HP 9000 series 300 and is for anyone interested in
the history, conservation and restoration of these personal
workstations. ↫ hp-series300.net Everything you could possibly ever want
to know about the series 300, in one place. It’s incredibly detailed,
and if you have your eyes on buying one of these machines, I urge you to
keep this resource in a permanently open tab so you know what you’re
doing.</p>

shell and how control flow worked in it</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Unix, ‘test‘ and ‘[‘ are two names for (almost) the same program
and shell builtin. Although today people mostly use it under its ‘[‘
name, when it was introduced in V7 along side the Bourne shell, it only
was called ‘test‘; the ‘[‘ name was only nascent until years later. I
don’t know for sure why it was called ‘test‘, but there are interesting
hints about its potential genesis in the shell used in V6 Research Unix,
the predecessor to V7, and the control flow constructs that shell used.
↫ Chris Siebenmann I’m fairly sure if I read this about 12 more times,
I’ll start to maybe understand some of it.</p>
