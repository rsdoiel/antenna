id="nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-is-anti-blur-monitor-tech-aimed-squarely-at-your-eyeball">Nvidia’s
G-Sync Pulsar is anti-blur monitor tech aimed squarely at your
eyeball</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Motion blur, when it’s not caused by slow LCD pixel transitions, is
caused by “the persistence of an image on the retina, as our eyes track
movement on-screen,” as Nvidia explains it. Prior improvements in
display tech, like variable rate refresh, Ultra Low Motion Blur, and
Variable Overdrive have helped with the hardware causes of this
deficiency. The eyes and their object permanence, however, can only be
addressed by strobing a monitor’s backlight. You can’t just set that
light blinking, however. Variable strobing frequencies causes flicker,
and timing the strobe to the monitor refresh rate—itself also tied to
the graphics card output—was tricky. Nvidia says it has solved that
issue with its G-Sync Pulsar tech, employing “a novel algorithm” in
“synergizing” its variable refresh smoothing and monitor pulsing. The
result is that pixels are transitioned from one color to another at a
rate that reduces motion blur and pixel ghosting. ↫ Kevin Purdy for Ars
Technica Cool technology, of course, but also another attempt by Nvidia
to put Nvidia-specific chips inside monitors to cash in on royalties and
tie people to Nvidia GPUs. Their previous attempt – G-Sync – was
eventually thwarted, but they’re clearly trying again.</p>

<h2 id="a-guide-to-using-nix-flakes-the-non-flake-way">A guide to using
Nix flakes the non-flake way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Flakes also are a symptom or cause of much intra-community strife
between “pro-flakes” and “anti-flakes” factions, but this situation is
at some level a sign of broken consensus processes and various actors
trying to sidestep them, an assumption by many people that the docs are
“outdated” for not using flakes, and the bizarre proliferation of flakes
everywhere in blog posts or tutorials leading to a belief that they are
required for everything. This post is about how to architect Nix
projects in general, with a special eye on how to do so with flakes
while avoiding their limitations. It tries to dispel misconceptions that
can develop in such a monoculture. ↫ Jade Every time I hear about Nix
and Flakes I feel like I understand all of it a little less.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-from-moving-house">Quotes from moving house</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/moving.jpg" width="1200" height="630" alt="drawing of a cardboard box and some bubble wrap in an empty room">
<p>
I’ve moved house over sixteen times in my lifetime (more if you count
step-homes). Apartment to house, city to city, state to state, country
to country; I’ve done it all. I’ve even lived in a couple
pseudo-communes with over 6+ roommates. Thinking back, I realized I have
little phrases –some synesthetic little audio cues– attached to each
major life change. Here’s a handful of my favorites.
</p>
<h2>
“Always WATCH YOUR BACK.”
</h2>
<p>
In 2003 I got accepted to JET Programme and would be moving to Japan for
one to three years. You apply in December, interview in January, get
accepted in April, and leave in July. It’s a sudden transition for an
overseas move. In April I found out I’d be living in a small town called
Sasayama in Hyogo Prefecture. It looked cute, had a castle, and the
town’s website had an animated gif of a dancing mayor. Part of the JET
Programme’s tradition is that your predecessor writes you a little note
introducing the town and job before you arrive. In July I got an email
and inside was the following phrase repeated seven times…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Always WATCH YOUR BACK.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yikes. It’s two weeks or so before I board a plane to live in a country
I’ve never even visited. Although self-evident by the tone of the
letter, I later learned my predecessor had a hard time in our small
town. She entered a relationship with another JET teacher and when they
wanted to live together that caused a local stir where city hall got
involved. That’s small town life for you.
</p>
<p>
What an ominous letter to get before you move overseas!
</p>
<h2>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</h2>
<p>
We rolled up to our house in South Austin in a bright yellow Penske
truck. We trekked across the desert from California and would officially
become homeowners that day. As we were unloading the truck a neighbor in
her mid seventies stepped out to meet us. She was so kind and after some
small talk she asked a question I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And that began almost 9 years of weekly breakfasts at Dan’s Hamburgers
with our neighbor Cleo. She’s more than a sweet grandmotherly neighbor
to our children, she was their best friend. Every day my kids would wake
up and demand to go see Cleo.
</p>
<p>
I also can’t forget our eighty year old neighbor Nellie’s big entrance
after meeting Cleo. Fresh from cataracts surgery wearing a night gown
and an eye-patch, she stumbled across her yard into the street to start
giving us all the gossip we could ask for on the neighborhood. “That’s
old Gene and his wife died…”, “She’s an old maid…”, and another line
I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tread lightly with them over there…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
About as Texan as it gets. We stayed in that house nine years and saw
the street turnover. We outgrew our 2 bedroom/2 bath house, so we moved
north in 2018. There’s lots to miss about the old place (big yard,
proximity to Dan’s Hamburgers), but we miss our friend Cleo the most.
</p>
<h2>
“We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween”
</h2>
<p>
When I introduced myself to my new neighbor in North Austin, she was
friendly but a bit somber as she mentioned her husband passed away six
months prior. She welcomed us to the neighborhood, asked about our kids,
and then proceeded to lay out the two ground rules for the street…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I felt shame looking down at my unkempt yard. She handed me a business
card for her mowers and I hired them that day. And she wasn’t kidding
about Halloween. Our street is basically <em>the</em> street in the
neighborhood for Halloween. We have a 9-foot tall inflatable Beetlejuice
sand worm in our yard every October, so I like to think we’re fulfilling
our neighborly obligations… but my yard still looks like shit.

Webb Finds Signs of Possible Aurorae on Isolated Brown Dwarf</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Infrared emission from methane suggests atmospheric heating by
auroral processes. Astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope
have found a brown dwarf (an object more massive than Jupiter but
smaller than a star) with infrared emission from methane, likely due to
energy in its upper atmosphere. This is an unexpected discovery because

<p>
The <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT
Reform</a>’s design, the components, <em>everything</em>—is open source.
If iFixIt did a teardown, they’d probably give it an 11 out of 10.
</p>
<p>
You can replace <em>individual battery cells!</em> Some people with
these laptops hacked in their own speakers, added more internal
Ethernet, or even swapped out the CPU itself.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean I think you should buy it? No, probably not. It’s
expensive (<a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">starting
at €1199</a>), and it’s built for a certain type of person. It’s not
gonna replace a MacBook or a cheap Chromebook.
</p>
<p>
But why does this exist, and why am I excited about it?

haven’t paid me anything, and they have no input into the content of

I first heard this term in speeches given by a tech exec,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy">Scott McNealy</a>,
talking about a competitor’s product. A hairball is something a cat
coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software
becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product
is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new
paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a
human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before,
unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a
good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are
open to new ideas. I miss the role Twitter used to play, I imagine other
people do too.</p>

<p>I asked “Is news copyrightable” on various social web sites because
people aren’t making a distinction between the expression and the
underlying facts of news. If an AI bot reads a news article, and
extracts the facts, then there’s no problem, because no one owns the
facts.</p>

<p>A puzzle about ChatGPT. How can it get something right that both
Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a
source, thus propagating its lies and mistakes. I think this negates the
idea that they’re just scanning the news orgs to get their information.
The method obviously is more sophisticated.</p>

<h2 id="influxdb-fdw-2.1.0-release">InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 released
</p>
<p>
We have just released version 2.1.0 of the Foreign Data Wrapper for
InfluxDB. This release can work with PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
</p>
<p>
This release improves following item (from 2.0.0):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support PostgreSQL 16.0
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: Cannot delete when time series column defined as timestamptz
type
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FDW supports following features :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports pushed down some aggregate functions: count,
stddev, sum, max, min.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports INSERT, DELETE statements.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports bulk INSERT by using batch_size option from
PostgreSQL version 14 or later.
</li>
<li>
WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and now() functions are
pushed down.
</li>
<li>
LIMIT…OFFSET clauses are pushed down when there is LIMIT clause only or
both LIMIT and OFFSET.
</li>
<li>
Support schemaless mode that allows access to elements in the data file
without changing the table definition by using jsonb typed column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UPDATE is not supported.
</li>
<li>
WITH CHECK OPTION constraints is not supported. Following limitations
originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.
</li>
<li>
Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target
list. For example, SELECT field1 FROM t1 and SELECT field2 FROM t1
returns different number of rows if the number of points with field1 and
field2 are different in InfluxDB database.
</li>
<li>
Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of
PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.
</li>
<li>
Conditions like WHERE time + interval ‘1 day’ &lt; now() do not work.
Please use WHERE time &lt; now() - interval ‘1 day’.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i4oa-hall-of-fame---2023-edition">I4OA Hall of Fame - 2023
edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://i4oa.org/" target="_blank">Initiative for Open
Abstracts (I4OA)</a> was launched in September 2020 to advocate and
promote the unrestricted availability of the abstracts of the world’s
scholarly publications, particularly journal articles and book chapters,
in trusted repositories where they are open and machine-accessible. I4OA
calls on all scholarly publishers to open the abstracts of their
published works and, where possible, to submit them to Crossref.
</p>
<p>
Since the launch of I4OA, we have been tracking the openness of
abstracts for all Crossref members over time (for data and code, see
this <a href="https://github.com/bmkramer/I4OA" target="_blank">GitHub
repository</a>). For a subset of 40+, mostly larger, publishers, the
proportion of current journal articles (published in the current year
and preceding two years) that have abstracts deposited in Crossref is
shown in a
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=are%20shown%20in-,orange,-." target="_blank">chart
on the I4OA website</a>, which is updated quarterly (Figure 1).

<p>
<em>Figure 1: Proportion of current journal articles from selected
publishers that have open abstracts in Crossref. Data collected on
January 1, 2024 for publication years 2021-2023. Publishers already
supporting I4OA are shown in orange.</em>
</p>
<p>
These longitudinal data and accompanying visualisations allow us to
identify and highlight good examples from 2023: publishers (both large
and small) who newly started to make abstracts openly available last
year and/or who managed to get the proportion of their articles with
open abstracts close to 100%<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
While we highlight some of these examples below in our ‘Hall of Fame’,
it’s important to also acknowledge all the publishers that already were
depositing abstracts to Crossref for most or all of their journal
articles prior to 2023, thereby contributing to the availability of
abstracts as part of a rich ecosystem of open metadata,
<a href="https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs" target="_blank">for
others to use and build upon</a>. 
</p>
<h2 id="hall-of-fame---part-1-publishers-included-in-i4oa-visualisation">
Hall of Fame - Part 1: publishers included in I4OA visualisation
</h2>
<p>
For the set of (mostly larger) publishers included in the visualisation
on the I4OA website, Figure 2 shows the difference in the proportion of
abstracts available in Crossref between January and December 2023 for
journal articles published in 2021-2023.
</p>
<p>
A number of publishers stand out from this figure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Wiley</strong> announced in
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/open-access/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research" target="_blank">October
2022</a> that it was joining I4OA and would be making abstracts
available through Crossref. In August 2023, Wiley started to deposit
abstracts to Crossref, and at the end of 2023, the proportion of current
journal articles with open abstracts was 77%.
</p>
<p>
This makes Wiley the first of the four largest traditional commercial
publishers to deposit abstracts for the majority of journal articles
they publish. Springer Nature does this only for their current open
access articles, while Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis<sup>2</sup> do
not yet provide abstracts to Crossref at all. SAGE, the fifth largest
traditional commercial publisher, was a founding member of I4OA and has
open abstracts for 85% of current journal articles. <br><br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Among society publishers, the <strong>American Geophysical Union
(AGU)</strong> went from 7% to 99% open abstracts for current journal
articles last year, which is a great achievement. The publishing arm of
the <strong>American Institute of Physics (AIP Publishing)</strong>
joins them in reaching close to 100% open abstracts, going from 41% to
95% in 2023.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<sup>1</sup>Depending on the type of journal(s) of a given publisher,
the maximal coverage of open abstracts will often be somewhat below
100%, as in Crossref, all journal content is assigned the type ‘journal
article’. This includes e.g. editorials, letters to the editor and other
publication types that are not always expected to have abstracts.
</p>
<p>
<sup>2</sup>The numbers for Wiley and Taylor &amp; Francis do not
include Hindawi and F1000 Research, respectively, as these have separate
Crossref member IDs. As most full open access publishers, both Hindawi
and F1000 Research have high proportions of open abstracts (81% and 98%,
respectively).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>CAIRN</strong> and <strong>Project Muse</strong>, two publishing
platforms in the humanities and social sciences representing a number of
individual publishers, both started including abstracts in the metadata
they provide to Crossref in 2023. At the end of 2023, CAIRN had
abstracts available for 41% of current journal articles, while Project
Muse was just starting out at 5%. Both will hopefully increase further
this coming year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Returning to traditional commercial publishers, <strong>Wolters Kluwer
Health</strong>, part of Wolters Kluwer, had seen a slow growth in the
proportion of journal articles with open abstracts in the years prior to
2023, going from 2% to 10%. However, they showed a rapid increase in
2023, ending the year with 52% open abstracts.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While it is good to see publishers who have publicly committed their
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=Publishers%20supporting%20I4OA" target="_blank">support
for I4OA</a> follow through with opening their abstracts (like Wiley and
AIP), it is also very encouraging to see publishers who are not (yet)
listed as I4OA supporters do so. This shows a growing awareness and
action on this issue beyond advocacy through I4OA alone. And of course,
we would love to list these publishers on our website as official
supporters of I4OA!
</p>
<p>
Figure 2 also shows some cases where the proportion of open abstracts
has gone down during the year. This can be due to temporary technical
issues in depositing abstracts (as was the case for Hindawi).
Theoretically, the proportion of open abstracts can also go down when
publishers stop providing abstracts altogether during the year, but we
have not observed that to be the case.

Hall of Fame - Part 2: other publishers
</h2>
<p>
Among the many publishers not included in the limited selection shown in
the I4OA visualisation, there are also some interesting highlights of
publishers either starting out to deposit abstracts (and reaching a
sizeable proportion) or having deposited open abstracts for almost all
their current journal articles in 2023. The examples below drew our
attention in 2023; they include a number of medium-sized publishers as
well as a group of smaller publishers that deserve special attention.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)</strong> went
from 0% to 42% open abstracts in 2023. However, from January 2024
onwards, several EMBO journals were transferred to Springer Nature, so
EMBO can no longer be tracked at publisher level in Crossref. It will
still be possible to look at the development of open abstracts for
individual EMBO journals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)</strong>, a
medium-sized publisher, started to deposit abstracts in 2023, reaching
33% open abstracts for current journal articles at the end of the year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Acoustical Society of America (ASA)</strong> had open
abstracts for almost all their current journal articles at the end
of 2023, increasing from 50% to 97%.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, in the second quarter of 2023, a group of <strong>over 200
smaller Turkish publishers</strong> saw large increases in their
coverage of open abstracts, resulting in open abstracts for 95%-100% of
their current journal articles. Consultation with Crossref pointed to
the potential supporting role of
<a href="https://dergipark.org.tr/en/" target="_blank">DergiPark</a>,
one of the largest Crossref sponsors in Turkey. This is a great example
of developments in open metadata at smaller publishers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-forward">
Looking forward 
</h2>
<p>
At the beginning of 2024, the proportion of current journal articles
published by Crossref members with open abstracts has reached 49.7%, up
from 20.7% when I4OA was launched in September 2020. This is thanks to a
growing number of publishers who are depositing abstracts to Crossref,
often depositing open abstracts for close to 100% of their journal
articles.
</p>
<p>
This blog post has highlighted a number of publishers who contributed to
this growth in the availability of open abstracts in 2023. We hope these
examples will inspire other publishers to start doing the same and are
looking forward to following the growth in the availability of open
abstracts in 2024.
</p>
<p>
For publishers that started to deposit abstracts in recent years and are
doing so for newly published articles only, our data on open abstracts
for current journal articles will look better in 2024 than in 2023, as
only articles published in the current year and two preceding years are
taken into account.
</p>
<p>
However, the benefits of having abstracts openly available from a
central location such as Crossref (both for direct usage and for
integration in other open scholarly infrastructures) are not limited to
recent publications only. Hopefully, publishers currently depositing
abstracts to Crossref will continue to do so both for newly published
articles as well as for the backfiles of journal articles already
published.
</p>
<p>
Publishers who would like to be added to the list of I4OA supporters, or
who would like more information on how to deposit abstracts for both new
and existing journal articles, are very welcome to
<a href="mailto:openabstracts@gmail.com">reach out to I4OA</a>. More
information about open abstracts in general, and I4OA in particular, can
also be found in the
<a href="https://i4oa.org/faqs.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the I4OA
website.

through the eyes of a musl distribution maintainer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>systemd, as a service manager, is not actually a bad piece of
software by itself. The fact it can act as both a service manager and an
inetd(8) replacement is really cool. The unit file format is very nice
and expressive. Defining mechanism and leaving policy to the
administrator is a good design. Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum. I
don’t like the encouragement to link daemons to libsystemd for better
integration – all of the useful integrations can be done with more
portable measures. And I really don’t like the fact they consider glibc
to be “the Linux API” when musl, Bionic, and other libcs exist. I’d like
to dive into detail on the good and the bad of systemd, as seen through
my eyes as all of: end user, administrator, and developer. ↫ awilfox
awilfox is a maintainer of Adélie Linux, which does not use systemd, but
this blog post is one of the few reasonable, well-written, and
substantiated critiques of systemd – as opposed to the usual mindless
screeching you usually hear about systemd. A great read.</p>

<p>The developer OpenAI has said it would be impossible to create tools
like its groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT without access to copyrighted
material, as pressure grows on artificial intelligence firms over the
content used to train their products. Chatbots such as ChatGPT and image
generators like Stable Diffusion are “trained” on a vast trove of data
taken from the internet, with much of it covered by copyright – a legal

<p>Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system
(Motūrus OS) for the cloud. In more specific terms, Motūrus OS
(sometimes called Motor OS), is a new operating system targeting virtual
machine-based workloads such as web serving, “serverless”, edge caching,
etc. Motūrus OS is a microkernel-based operating system, built in Rust,
that targets virtualized workloads exclusively. It currently supports
x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in either Qemu or Cloud
Hypervisor. Rust is the language of Motūrus OS: not only it is
implemented in Rust, it also exposes its ABI in Rust, not C. ↫ Motūrus
OS GitHub page At this point, there are more alternative operating
systems written in Rust than there are Linux distributions, but you’re
not hearing any complaints from me. While not all of these will have a
bright future, they’ll teach a lot of people valuable skills and
introduce a lot of people to the concept of alternative operating
systems.</p>

<h2 id="start-now-dont-wait">Start now, don’t wait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Start now, don’t wait
</h1>
<p>
If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I
was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you
docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk
things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.
</p>
<p>
Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that
you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done
by people who were ill prepared.
</p>
<p>
It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until
the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not
right will have made the decisions for you.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that
we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody
is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it
is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just
speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right
people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to
make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though
you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for
the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world
that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing
that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still
time.
</p>
<p>
And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what
are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded.
Thank you!

it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents

observability, or measuring docs inside a product-docs system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
As technical writers we want to know if the docs we’re writing are
accomplishing their goals. In other words, we want to know how good are
docs relative to the business goals they’re aiming to support or
improve. Are docs serving their purpose? Which of
<a href="https://swizec.com/blog/the-3-budgets/">the three budgets</a>
are docs supporting? When tech bubbles burst, roles usually seen as cost
centers, such as tech writing, are ripe for layoffs, no matter how
staunchly we defend them. That’s why we continue mulling over the
question of value and
<a href="https://passo.uno/tech-writing-metricks-kpis/">how we measure
it</a>.

Lydon</a>. He said I was a good

and boasted of the current Celtics team (he’s from Boston). They’re
worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting
players. They were great before they added
<a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827">Kristaps
Porzingis</a>, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn
and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He’s one of
those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year’s
Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the
Warriors or Kings in this year’s finals. Anyway, I write sports for
people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves
politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it
all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and
front and center. I’m glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to
a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are
getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even
win. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

“everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we’d seen it all, an npm user
named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a
group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a
troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This
package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package,
creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and
its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone
who installs it. We’re talking about storage space running out and
system resource exhaustion. But that’s not all. The creator took their
prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol,
showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from
Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to
the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you
shouldn’t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let’s be
honest here – this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a
rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn’t
seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or
compromised systems. What’s worse, it seems this isn’t even the first
time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do
this. What are they doing over there?</p>

After reporting on the open access movement for 20+ years I have reached
the conclusion that the movement has failed.

<p>
As a result, I shall no longer be writing about open access or updating
this blog.

<p>
I explain my reasons for reaching the conclusion I have

I <a href="https://x.com/RickyPo/status/1728308480321229067?s=20" target="_blank">announced
my decision</a> and I wish all those who continue to advocate for open
access the very best.
