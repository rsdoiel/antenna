<h2 id="best-laptop-of-2024">Best laptop of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
You might be confused by the title of this post. You might be wondering
why on earth am I writing about the best laptop of 2024. I never
reviewed products on this blog. There was no best laptop of 2023 post
nor a best laptop of 2022. And fear not, there won’t be a post about the
best laptop of 2024 either.
</p>
<p>
You see, this is not going to be a post about laptops. It’s going to be
a post about words, about generated content, and about SEO. It’s also
going to be an experiment because I’m a curious person and the inner
workings of search engines fascinate me.
</p>
<p>
I was listening to a tech podcast the other day and in it, they were
talking about the evolving landscape of the publishing industry with the
increasing trend of companies making AI-generated listicles in an
attempt to rank high on Google. And then you have things like the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/28/24053882/arc-search-browser-web-app-ios">Arc
search browser</a> that will use Ai to generate summaries of the pages
they browsed on your behalf. The result is that you have Ai consuming
content written by Ai in an attempt to do… something? I’m not sure what
the end game is to be perfectly honest with you but I’m interested
because this all looks like a shit show.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to the best laptops of 2024. In that podcast, they
mentioned that one of the prime targets in the search results tech space
is, you guessed it, the first page of results for the query “best
laptops of 2024”. And while I was listening I thought “I wonder how high
can a stupid blog post get on that SERP if I don’t actually write
content that’s relevant to the query”.
</p>
<p>
And this is that post. I have no interest in laptops. I know nothing
about laptops. I don’t care about laptops. I don’t even know which
laptops came out in 2024. I do know people are interested in knowing
which laptop is the best laptop in 2024 which is why I just wasted some
of your time (I’m sorry) making you read a silly post about the best
laptops in 2024 that has nothing to do with laptops.
</p>
<p>
Will google pick this one up? Will I even reach the first page? Who
knows! But if for some reason you landed on this blog post searching for
the best laptop of 2024 send me an email. I promise you I’ll do my best
to help you figure out what’s the best laptop for you.

Two mathematicians have shown that origami can, in principle, be used to
perform any possible computation.

<p>A growing body of research suggests a link between epigenetic
mechanisms and a wide variety of illnesses and behaviors, including
cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune illnesses, and cognitive
dysfunction. Epigenetics also plays a role in the changes humans and
other living things experience in space. This phenomenon has become part

Apple sold some 200,000 VisionPro. So at least 700 million dollars.
</p>
<p>
That assumes everyone went with the cheapest option without accessories.
</p>
<p>
If people go with the high end models, a battery and apple care the
total is 900million.
</p>
<p>
So say 800million so far?

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>Last month Katherine called out the tension inherent in a “personal”
website which is that it is both public and personal, and one’s public
(or professional) persona is often different from that of their personal
life. Robin Rendle riffed on the concept and said that it’s totally fine
for personal websites to be messy or imperfect or weird (i.e., not
necessarily how you’d want to present a “professional” front) and
declared, in a pretty great and punchy/pithy statement, “You’re a poem
and not software”.</p>

<p>As a love-token to my readers here are the first few pages of my new
novel which is published on Feb 1 DAY ONE Kerpow! Funny - unless it’s
ominous - she had put that very word down on a Scrabble board only a day
or two or before. Jubilant, the k scoring triple. Her opponent - the man
she had known for over twenty years, slept with for five, no longer
slept with with for however many more that left, and now played Scrabble
with instead - contested the spelling. Kapow, yes. Kerpow, no. They
fought over it. Have it your way, she said in the end. Which meant she
had to remove a garment.</p>

asking which networks people check first, which they get the most out
of. As you might expect, the most common answer was the network I was
asking on (except Facebook, no one answered there, I guessed that might
happen, because Facebook is different from the others). I asked because
I’m trying to figure that out for myself, and I’m kind of disappointed
that I find myself going to Threads more often. It has the greater
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sweaty+Palms+Quotient">Sweaty
Palms Quotient</a>, the feeling I used to have every week in the 80s
when MacWeek or PC Week arrived. I always cleared the time to go through
each issue carefully to see what my friends and competitors were up to.
Then I would talk to my reporter friends, who wanted to know what I
thought, or what back-room perspectives I could share with them. This
was the time of the telephone, even before everyone had email, in the
tech industry, believe it or not. Anyway, this isn’t going the way I
hoped it would. For me an open network built on the idea of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> is what I want to
see, what I’m working towards. And seeing products like WordPress and
its competitors as full-class members of the social web, because they
already do textcasting, now all they need is to be hooked up to a social
web that understands that writing isn’t just
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+grunts+and+snorts">grunts
and snorts</a>. Anyway, it’ll give you some encouragement that people in
the fediverse are most optimistic about their preferred network being
the best of the new lot. I still like Bluesky, a lot, because of the
intelligence and creativity of the people who use it. And I like the UI,
for its simplicity and familiarity, but I’m concerned it’ll lose its
simplicity when they federate. And don’t count Twitter out yet, there’s
far more happening there than any of the other networks. And a lot of
what you read on the other nets is wishful thinking about the demise of
Twitter. Hasn’t happened yet, and my guess is it won’t. It’s really hard
to snuff out machines with the kind of momentum Twitter has, even though
Musk is doing his best. One more thing to think about, I don’t think
federation is what we need, I think we need
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>.
It’s a more permissive kind of compatibility, and will happen a lot
sooner than federation, which honestly, I don’t think ever will happen.
With the usual disclaimers, most important that I’m often wrong, and am
open to other constructive points of view.</p>

This is a blog post about a video, which is about new color-conversion
LUTs for Apple Log footage from the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (updated
from my <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">first set</a>). The
video is also a mini-travelogue of my recent trips to Taiwan and Peru.
This post dives a bit deeper into both the LUT workflows, and my state
of mind about shooting digital-cinema-grade footage with a device I
always have with me.

There’s a lot going on here.

I always have a moment when packing for a trip: Which camera to bring?
Which lenses? I know I’m always happier when I pack less, like just a
single prime lens. But sometimes FOMO gets me and I pack three zooms.
</p>
<p>
For my trip to Lima, I brought my
<a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1645238-REG/sony_ilce7rm4a_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony

35mm F2.8 prime</a>. I lugged it around for a few days, but wasn’t
really feeling it.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, my iPhone 15 Pro Max was calling to me with its ProRes Log
video mode. “I’m 10-bit!” It would say. “Think of the fun you’ll have
color grading me!”
</p>
<p>
I told my phone to shut up, and proceeded to shoot very little with it —
or my Sony. Like a squirrel in the middle of the street, drawn in two
different directions at once, I creatively froze.
</p>
<p>
Photography, for me, is made up of a lot of habits, and shooting iPhone
video with aesthetic intent is just not yet baked into my travel muscle
memory.

A month later, I took a family trip to Taiwan, one of my favorite places
in the world. I’d had some time to process my Peru deadlock, and decided
to stop judging my own creative impulses, and let inspiration guide me
in which camera I pulled out.
</p>
<p>
I wound up shooting a lot of video.

I <em>loved</em> shooting ProRes Log in Taiwan with the iPhone 15 Pro
Max. I’d occasionally reach for
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic
Camera</a>, but I often just used the default camera app. I stuck my
phone (with its
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@prolost/post/C0VGQ8gPPyU">crumbling
case</a>) out of taxi sunroofs and skyscraper windows, held it above
teeming crowds and shoved it between chain-link fences. Seeing the broad
dynamic range I was capturing in scenarios from noontime sun to neon-lit
nights got me excited about grading the footage later.
</p>
<p>
It’s exactly the way I feel about shooting raw stills with my Sony,
knowing that I’ll be able to go crazy on them in Lightroom. The
photographing act is just half of the process.

LUTs, Looks, and Magic Bullets
</h2>
<p>
There’s been a bit of a gold rush of people hawking creative LUTs that
apply a particular “look” to iPhone Log footage. My day job is, in part,
helping make color tools like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/looks">Magic
Bullet Looks</a>, which can do so much more than any LUT. Creative LUTs
are great, and by all means support the folks making them — but that’s
not what my iPhone LUTs
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">were</a> or are.
</p>
<p>
The Prolost iPhone LUTs convert Apple Log to various other color spaces,
and support three kinds of workflow:
</p>
<h3 id="grade-under-a-display-transform-lut">
Grade Under a Display Transform LUT
</h3>
<p>
Apple Log is a totally decent color space to work in, so color
correcting Apple Log can be as simple as applying
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/colorista">Magic
Bullet Colorista</a> and choosing one of my <strong>Monitor &amp;
Grade</strong> LUTs. That’s what you see me doing in the video above.
Colorista (set to Log mode) does its work on the native Apple Log
pixels, and the LUT converts the result to look nice on video.
</p>
<p>
Many other systems work like this, including
<a href="https://luma-touch.com">LumaFusion</a>, which
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtNJ8DbQrQ">ships with</a>
Prolost Apple Log LUTs.
</p>
<p>
The key is <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">color correcting
under the LUT</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="bring-apple-log-into-an-existing-workflow">
Bring Apple Log into an Existing Workflow
</h3>
<p>
Color work is often done in some intermediate color space. This is
usually some kind of wide-gamut, log format, such as Davinci Wide
Gamut/Intermediate, or one of the
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES log spaces</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Prolost <strong>ACES</strong> LUTs simply convert Apple Log to
either ACEScc or ACEScct log, allowing you to grade your iPhone footage
alongside any other professional camera, and output them all through the
same pipeline.
</p>
<h3 id="shooting-through-a-lut">
Shooting Through a LUT
</h3>
<p>
The Blackmagic Camera app allows you to load any LUTs you want and view
through them without baking them into your footage. With my LUTs, you
can shoot with the same LUTs you grade under later, for a truly
professional (no joke!) workflow.
</p>
<p>
The real stars of this update though are the <strong>FC</strong> LUTs.
They add an informative False Color overlay to the Shoot/Grade LUTs,
making sure you always nail your exposure. Watch the video to see them
in action. I already can’t imagine shooting without them.
</p>
<p>
These LUTs work well in Blackmagic Camera or even on an external HDMI
monitor.

<p>
As if this video wasn’t enough work already (I shot the a-roll in
mid-December), I decided to use it as a test case for creative editorial
in DaVinci Resolve. It’s the ACES LUTs that allowed me to incorporate
Magic Bullet Looks into my Resolve color workflow.
</p>
<p>
Maxon just shipped a really nice
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/article/maxon-red-giant-update-delivers-fast-beautiful-bokeh-and-realistic-lens-flares">update</a>
to Magic Bullet Looks, with simplified color management made possible by
more and more apps we support doing darn fine color management at the
timeline level.
</p>
<p>
So in Resolve, I can use my LUT to convert Apple Log to ACEScc, and then
apply Magic Bullet Looks, which can now be set to work in ACEScc with a
single click.

I can sneak additional Resolve corrector nodes in between those two for
local corrections. Resolve is great at this, and Looks is great at
creative look development, so this is a match made in heaven.

<h2 id="gear-inspires">
Gear Inspires
</h2>
<p>
Every photographer knows the feeling of lusting after new gear. We know
it so well that we remind ourselves constantly that “next camera
syndrome” is debilitating, and that “most cameras are better than most
photographers.” Gear is not the answer. Go shoot.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, a counterpoint to these truths: As shooters, we take
inspiration where we can get it. And sometimes a new technique, a new
locale, or even, yes, a new bit of gear is what provides it.
</p>
<p>
The key is to listen for that inspiration, and don’t judge it.
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s coming from your phone.

Register One of the biggest “what could have beens” of the past two
decades. Had Oracle not closed Solaris up after acquiring Sun, an open
source Solaris might’ve been something more tangible than what it is
today. Of course, Oracle gonna Oracle and they were always going to
screw things up, open source or not, but had Solaris stayed open we’d
have had a more concerted, centralised development effort instead of
what we have now, where the open source Solaris community is working off
the last OpenSolaris codebase from 14 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="new-renderers-for-gtk">New renderers for GTK</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, GTK gained not one, but two new renderers: one for GL and
one for Vulkan. Since naming is hard, we reused existing names and
called them “ngl” and “vulkan”. They are built from the same sources,
therefore we also call them “unified” renderers. As mentioned already,
the two renderers are built from the same source. It is modeled to
follow Vulkan apis, with some abstractions to cover the differences
between Vulkan and GL (more specifically, GL 3.3+ and GLES 3.0+). This
lets us share much of the infrastructure for walking the scene graph,
maintaining transforms and other state, caching textures and glyphs, and
will make it easier to keep both renderers up-to-date and on-par. ↫ GTK

of interest to y’all.</p>

<p>But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors
knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are
square, radio buttons are round. Maybe it was part of their internal
training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just
luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they
managed to stick to the convention. Until this day. Apple is the first
major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long

Apple — will have round checkboxes. ↫ Nikita Prokopov Unsightly. A lack

<p>Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and
rebooted to find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs
I was working on before the update. I don’t use Microsoft Edge
regularly, and I have Google Chrome set as my default browser.
Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a moment to realize that Microsoft Edge
had simply taken over where I’d left off in Chrome. I couldn’t believe
my eyes. I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm
whether I wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically
opening after a Windows update with all the Chrome tabs I’d been working
on. I didn’t even realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused
why all my tabs were suddenly logged out. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge I

<h2
id="roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry">RORing
ahead: using ROR in place of the Open Funder Registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago we announced our plan to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">deprecate
our support for the Open Funder Registry</a> in favour of using the ROR
Registry to support both affiliation and funder use cases. The feedback
we’ve had from the community has been positive and supports our members,
service providers and metadata users who are already starting to move in
this direction.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to provide an update on work that’s underway to make this
transition happen, and how you can get involved in working together with
us on this.
</p>
<p>
Overall, we are building more comprehensive support for ROR into
Crossref’s services. Some of this work is specifically to support using
ROR to identify funding organisations in place of funder registry IDs.
We have a number of parallel, complementary projects underway to support
different elements of this work:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in
places where we currently support the collection of Funder IDs.
</li>
<li>
We are analysing the coverage of Funder ID to ROR ID mappings and
testing the way we expose them in our APIs.
</li>
<li>
We are developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR
IDs.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-schema-updates">
<ol type="1">
<li>Schema updates
</h2>
<p>
Everything flows from being able to get ROR IDs into the Crossref
metadata!
</p>
<p>
We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in
places where we already support the collection of Funder IDs – for
instance, in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/funding-data-overview/">the
funding section of the metadata for works</a> and in the funder section
for grants.
</p>
<p>
We’re working with members and service providers so that they can try
sending us this data via a pipeline our Labs team has built to test
schema updates before they go live. We are actively recruiting members
to help us test our new pipeline by providing sample XML for
registration. Planned metadata inputs and outputs are detailed in
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/164h3UtBQ2mHf5lH5ZS6c_Oh8OuraoaQPvXhNNO3-Ko8/edit" target="_blank">Including
ROR as a funder identifier in your metadata (metadata prototyping
instructions)</a>, we’d encourage you to provide feedback on these in
the document, ideally in the next two weeks. We’re aiming to release an
updated schema that supports these changes in Q1 2024.
</p>
<h2 id="2-modelling-ror-idfunder-id-mappings-in-our-metadata-model">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Modelling ROR ID/Funder ID mappings in our metadata model
</h2>
<p>
We have integrated the ROR registry into our evolving metadata model,
and we have started work to integrate the Funder Registry. The aim is to
create more flexibility in how Crossref’s metadata can be supplemented
and queried, and give more clarity as to which party asserted or created
a metadata element.
</p>
<p>
We’re working on an early iteration of how the model handles ROR IDs,
funder IDs and their equivalencies. Once we have something to share,
we’ll welcome community feedback on this approach and on the metadata
model in general.
</p>
<h2 id="3-developing-new-matching-strategies-to-match-text-strings-to-ror-ids">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs
</h2>
<p>
Ideally, everyone would always use persistent identifiers to exchange
information about contributor and awardee affiliations, organisations
related to works, as well as funders supporting the research. In
practice, this information is often exchanged as data without
identifiers, such as affiliation strings (e.g. “University of Virginia,
Charlottesville, VA”), funder names, or even funding acknowledgements
(e.g. “Funding and support generously provided by the Ford Foundation”).
In such situations, a good metadata matching strategy can help map these
to persistent identifiers.
</p>
<p>
Currently, we are focused on developing reliable strategies for matching
affiliation strings to ROR IDs. In the future, we will adapt the
strategies to support funder names and funding acknowledgements as well.
All the strategies will be rigorously evaluated using real-life data. We
will make the strategies, as well as the evaluation datasets and
evaluation results, publicly available for anyone to use. If you are
interested in collaborating on the development or the evaluation of the
matching strategies, <a href="mailto:labs@crossref.org">please get in
touch</a>!
</p>
<p>
In the future, we might also apply some of the new matching strategies
at Crossref, to the metadata our members send us. This would allow us to
insert matched identifiers to the metadata to better connect
organisations with other items in the scholarly record. We already have
a process that matches the names of funders supporting research against
the Funder Registry and enriches the metadata with matched Funder
Registry IDs. Developing and evaluating reliable matching strategies
will allow us to modify this process to use ROR IDs instead, and extend
it to support other use cases, such as contributor affiliations.
</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-transition-mean-for-you">
What will the transition mean for you?
</h2>
<p>
We do recommend that you begin looking at what it will take to integrate
ROR into your systems and workflows for identifying funders. Talk to
your service providers about this to ready them for this change. To
reiterate the point from the earlier post, in the short term, and even
in the medium term, Funder IDs aren’t going away and the Funder IDs will
continue to resolve – they are persistent, after all. Eventually,
however, the Funder Registry will cease to be updated, so any new
funders will only be registrable in Crossref metadata with ROR IDs.
Legacy Funder IDs and their mapping to ROR IDs will be maintained, so if
Crossref members submit a legacy Funder ID, it will get mapped to a ROR
ID automatically. Note, too, that Crossref is committed to maintaining
the current funder API endpoints until ROR IDs become the predominant
identifier for newly registered content. We also know that there are
questions that we’ll want to tackle with the community as we all make
progress, some we know and some we don’t know. With that in mind:
</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-what-you-need">
Tell us what you need!
</h2>
<p>
We want to hear from you! We have set up several channels of
communication meant to ensure that you can tell both ROR and Crossref
what will make this transition easier for you and that you can get
answers to your questions.
</p>
<p>
First, we are conducting a series of Open Funder Registry user
interviews designed to deepen our understanding of where Funder IDs are
being used in workflows and systems. Write
<a href="mailto:community@ror.org">community@ror.org</a> if you’d like
to participate in these interviews to show and tell us how you’re using
Funder IDs.
</p>
<p>
Second, in 2024, we will be running a follow-up to the funding data
workshop we ran in June 2023. Please get in touch if your organisation
would be interested in participating in the discussion.

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>I get significantly more work done when I unplug my computer from the
Internet. Despite many of the tools that I use requiring a connection,
and certainly the Internet containing a wealth of information that might
expedite my work, these benefits are drastically outweighed by the
wealth of distractions also availabe. It’s very appealing, when the code
is compiling or the docker containers restarting, to sneak open a
browser tab with hacker news, or the Χ formerly known as Twitter,
youtube, or something else to pass those minutes.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL credcheck extension
</h2>
<p>
The credcheck PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential
checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the
password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can
define a set of rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
allow a specific set of credentials
</li>
<li>
reject a certain type of credentials
</li>
<li>
deny password that can be easily cracked
</li>
<li>
enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password
</li>
<li>
define a password reuse policy
</li>
<li>
define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is
banned
</li>
<li>
add a delay after all authentication failure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This release is a maintenance release to fix a major issue with the
backup of the password history file with pgBackRest and adds an
authentication delay feature.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add authentication delay feature to be able to add a pause on
authentication failure. Setting <code>credcheck.auth_delay_ms</code>
causes the server to pause for a given number of milliseconds before
reporting authentication failure. This makes brute-force attacks on
database passwords more difficult. This patch is purely a copy/paste
from the auth_delay extension just to limit the number of extensions to
preload. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-delay.html for
more information about the origin of this feature.
</li>
<li>
Force size of file <code>$PGDATA/global/pg_password_history</code> to be
a multiple of 8192 to fix pgBackRest error caused by the error message:
“page misalignment in file /…/global/pg_password_history: file size 2604
is not divisible by page size 8192”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Extension upgrade requires a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck
library.

Paris 2024: Schedule published &amp; Call for lightning talks
launched</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Hi,
</p>
<p>
The schedule for pgDay Paris 2024 on March 14 is now live and we are
really excited to share it with you. We have some great talks lined up
for you about everything Postgres - from Codd to community and from
logical decoding to LSM trees.
</p>
<p>
Check out the programme &amp; register now
<a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule">https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule</a>
</p>
<p>
But that’s not all!
</p>
<p>
The best news is that there’s still a chance for <strong>you</strong> to
be on stage! If you look at the schedule, you’ll notice we reserved a
slot for lightning talks because we know how much everyone loves them.
We also know how nerve-wracking it can be to sign up on the day and not
know until the last minute whether or not you’ll be speaking, so we’ve
decided to launch a separate lightning talk CFP. Whether you’re a
seasoned speaker or you’ve never been up on stage before, and whatever
your Postgres use-case, we want to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
Submissions (max 1 per speaker) should be sent by email to
lightning@pgday.paris.
</p>
<p>
The talk must be in English and no longer than 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
The subject of your email should be your name followed by the title of
the talk (e.g. “Slonik: What Elephants do for Fun”). The body of the
email should contain a very short description of your talk (max 50
words)
</p>
<p>
We recommend you submit your lightning talk by 23 February as that’s
when we’ll do the first round of selections, with selected speakers
notified by 8 March. You can, however, submit your lightning talk right
up until the day of the conference in case slots are still available
</p>
<p>
We look forward to seeing you in Paris on March 14, The pgDay Paris Team

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">EU
Digital Markets Act is making waves in the Apple ecosystem</a>. For the
first time ever you’ll be able to install a browser other than
Safari/Webkit on iOS (as long as you live in the EU). While there are
other browsers on the iOS App Store, they’re all Safari/Webkit under the
hood due to non-competitive App Store submission guidelines.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group
have spent years documenting the issues at hand. I haven’t participated
much there, but I’ve built countless web apps and have felt most (if not
all) the pain points that come with supporting Safari users and, as a
Mobile Safari user, not having access to features I’ve built. That
feature gap has closed considerably in the last couple years and the
Safari/Webkit team’s movement is impressive, their relative openness on
issues is welcome, and
<a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">declaring standards
positions</a> reduces risk and removes mystery. But this (potentially)
blows the doors open on competition.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see what happens from here. Will we break out
of the Chromium/Webkit duopoly? Or will we fall headlong into a Chromium
monopoly? Regardless, the EU ruling is a win for the Open Web because
now users have options beyond the OS-provided default browser. Before
there was nothing beyond a thin veneer of choice.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, there are
<a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/this-web-page-is-best-viewed-in-the-eu/">some
questions on how to test this</a> if you don’t live in the EU and it’s
not yet known if (or ever) the rest of the world might also get access
to other browsers. And there seems to be some malicious compliance
afoot… but hopefully over time the situation normalizes towards the
ideal outcome; an unfettered web.
</p>
<p>
Next, if the EU could fix the GDPR banners that are killing the web,
that would be wonderful.

Hi Dave Rupert LLC,
</p>
<p>
I liked your latest blog post
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick
toughts on chips</a> and see you are a business leader in accessibility,
Doritos®, and Jekyll blogging software. I thought we should connect. I
would like to inform you of an exciting opportunity.
</p>
<p>
I scraped or stole your email address from some list that you never
signed up for, but would you like help growing your company’s sales? I
can do the same impersonal, unsolicited, scumbag sales shit I’m doing to
you right now but on behalf of your company.
</p>
<p>
I generated this with AI, so it took me literally no time or effort but
I sent it anyways. The federal crime I just committed is utterly
offensive and every time I send this to you under a different fake
business name you instantly delete it, but some might also call it
“innovative”. I can provide this service for your company. Reach new
customers today by deploying large scale AI-driven spam operations.
</p>
<p>
I clearly have no ethics, but you should enter a business relationship
with me, a guy who found your email on the internet.
</p>
<p>
You are now signed up for a no-opt-out email drip campaign to send you
automated replies every day for the next week to get you to reply. Reply
and start a conversation with your harasser if you’d like it to stop.
</p>
<p>
Also, would you like to have my boss on your podcast? He’s a B2B Growth
Saas Fortune Trope 500 Under 500 Startups Entreprenuer and has a red
Porsche. There’s almost no trace of this guy on the internet but you
should absolutely have him on your super niche web development podcast.
I think he’d be a great fit for your audience.
</p>
<p>
What do you say? Are you ready to increase the size of your revenue?
</p>
<p>
Thanks,<br /> Helen

<h1>
Berlin School
</h1>
<p>
I’m listening to
<a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An
Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> recommended it.
</p>
<p>
We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my
podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory. A while ago
I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music
theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it. But all I
had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B
Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s
these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop …
here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full
half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳
</p>
<p>
But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the
circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn’t
need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are
rules because people figured out what generally “works”. Well, on the
other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a
replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules
they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are
immediately broken.
</p>
<p>
All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with
<sup>8</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a
<a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>
Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife’s oriental dancing and all
the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have
left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your
perspective. Or mine.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, writing all of this and I’m still not making music. What next, I
wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares
with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe
not. I don’t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine
and patterns below that!
</p>
<p>
That Synth Seeker video had a link to a
<a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet
Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or
Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works
for me!
</p>
<p>
All this listening and writing makes me realize that it’s Sunday, late
at night, I should go to bed, and then I’ll be working and playing
role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end
comes around. Whaaat!
</p>
<p>
I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.
</p>
<p>
This is my life.

we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new

Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech
gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of
the most tech-literate people you’ll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider,
Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the
technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a

odds.

I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write

VASL Templates
</h1>
<p>
I’m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL
Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for
Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code>
because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far
as I understand.
</p>
<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>
<p>
As it turns out, this is not enough:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>
<p>
So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by
vasl-templates:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>
<p>
Next error:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main

    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'

Fix:

<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog</p>
<p>this project needs a name and a domain. After many years of playing
with YAML in k8s, I’ve returned to using CFEngine (at work). The last
config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with
all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the
impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that’s
only for pods running in k8s (which are stateless), not the underlying
machines.</p>

Redefines Distributed PostgreSQL with the Launch of pgEdge Cloud
Developer Edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
First serverless distributed Postgres managed cloud service delivers low
latency and high availability in three minutes or less
</p>
<p>
Alexandria, Virginia – January 24, 2024 — pgEdge, Inc., the leading
company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the launch of
pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition, making it easy for developers to deploy
and access distributed Postgres databases for low latency and high
availability. pgEdge Cloud is the first fully distributed database as a
service (DBaaS) optimized for the network edge and based completely on
the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. pgEdge Cloud
Developer is a generous free tier for developers to rapidly and easily
experience the advantages of distributed Postgres.
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud addresses the growing demand for low-latency and “always
on” applications that need to be dispersed across multiple cloud
regions. As a fully managed distributed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS),
pgEdge Cloud empowers developers and database architects with an
intuitive user interface for creation, management and monitoring of
distributed database clusters running across multiple cloud regions.
</p>
<p>
By putting database nodes closer to global users, pgEdge Cloud can
dramatically reduce latency and application response times, particularly
page loads for database intensive applications. Additionally, having
multiple replicated database nodes across the network ensures high
levels of availability, since when a node fails or is not reachable
traffic automatically routes to the nearest still available node.
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development
platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel and Fastly. The ability to
place database nodes in multiple regions around the global network,
together with automated and seamless nearest-node routing, allow
developers to deploy very low latency applications that eliminate slow
round trips to a single centrally located database. pgEdge Cloud
Developer Edition includes built-in integration for Cloudflare Workers,
and support for Vercel and Fastly will be available in coming weeks. An
example demonstrating pgEdge Cloud’s ease of integration with Cloudflare
is https://github.com/pgEdge/cloudflare-worker-template. Additionally, a
demo application running against a distributed version of the well-known
“Northwind Traders” database, and implemented with Cloudflare Workers
and pgEdge Cloud, is at: https://northwind.pgedge.com/.
</p>
<p>
Key features of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition include:
</p>
<p>
Instant Deployment: Developers can now deploy a globally distributed
PostgreSQL serverless database in just a minute, streamlining the
database setup process and accelerating development.
</p>
<p>
Predefined multi-region clusters: Creation and deployment of pgEdge
distributed databases is simplified via prebuilt global clusters.
Developers can select from a set of predefined multi-region clusters
that span the continental US, US and Europe, or US, Europe and Asia.
</p>
<p>
Multi-Master (Active-Active) Architecture: Each database node can handle
both read and write traffic for low latency and high availability,
utilizing an eventually consistent multi-master architecture with built
in conflict resolution and reporting.
</p>
<p>
Latency-based DNS Routing: Geo-proximity routing ensures that users are
connected to the nearest pgEdge node that is up and running.
</p>
<p>
Generous Free Tier: Available for prototyping, application development
and evaluation of pgEdge capabilities with up to 12GB of storage across
three nodes.
</p>
<p>
Management and Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual infrastructure
configuration and management while providing automated backups, security
against misconfiguration, and continuous monitoring via a clean and easy
to use web dashboard.
</p>
<p>
“pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition marks a significant leap in our mission
to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed
database applications across the global network,” said Phillip Merrick,
Co-founder and CEO at pgEdge. “The innovative features of the pgEdge
Cloud fully managed service, from multi-region, multi-master support to
its intuitive user interface, empower developers to easily create and
manage distributed PostgreSQL databases.”
</p>
<p>
Availability
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition is available today in preview. Users
requiring more resources or capabilities beyond what is offered in the
Developer Edition free tier can upgrade to either pgEdge Cloud Team
Edition (coming in H1 2024), or pgEdge Cloud Enterprise Edition.
</p>

<h2 id="resizing-macos-app-windows-for-169-screen-capture">Resizing
macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing
macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I&#39;ve used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Somehow, that script (which I saved as a ‘one shot’ App
(<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off
my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>
<p>
You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters
accordingly—note that the width and height seem to be additive to the
X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).
</p>
<p>
In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>,
with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a
window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then
type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The
top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal
dialog for a project I’m working on. I’m combining the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I’ve used
both components before, but never together. And they’re always a bit
tricky to get working because I’m impatient and the docs are spread out,
and there are different versions. It’s all kind of a mess, so you just
get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely
end up with reusable code. But it’s certainly a lot better than starting
from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two
components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in
2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of
any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two
seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into
my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of
iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking
with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there
were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical
scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the
problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works
exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works.
Here’s the
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript
of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different
sessions.
</p>
<p>
I’ll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link
to this perspective.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I’d like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when
it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its
conventions to mine. In other words, I’d like to return the favor. It’s
doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I’d like to teach it how
to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it
can teach human programmers what I’ve learned about programming in over
50 years of doing this work.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
bit of philosophy. People say these things aren’t intelligent, but
seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more
intelligent in ways than I am, what’s the difference between that and
actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with
supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus
on the idea that the person we’re conversing with has an inner life
that’s vastly different from ours and no less complex, and
contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like
someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is
it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers
and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but –
<i>now we’re living it.</i> I’m so happy to have made it this far! An
amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don’t
understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the
first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so
lucky.
</p>
<p>
A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I’m identified as “anonymous,” but
I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting
which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe.
</p>
<p>
One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT.
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here
are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can’t ask
it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn’t know about the chat UI?
</p>
<p>
Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by
illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he
could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He
said his father would have loved it, and I don’t doubt that he would.
Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff,
wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The
machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans
are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn
from the machines.

<h2 id="drivethru-i-am-unhappy">Drivethru, I am unhappy!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Drivethru, I am unhappy!
</h1>
<p>
The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other
domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking
preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them
more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I’m already
ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from
cloudflare and really… I feel like they don’t want my money. Uuuugh.
</p>
<p>
I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by
a white page. I don’t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day
from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wrote:
</p>
<p>
I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and
their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start
locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger
installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as
they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It’s the right
thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru
becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the
right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech
corporations, helping them spy on me. It’s a revolting feeling. These
days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium
browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an
alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors
end up replacing you.
</p>
<p>
If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own
Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don’t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to
rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.
</p>
<p>
I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is
possible and I hope that you do, too.

creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you know your Windows history, you’ll know that the operating
system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and
started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns
out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it
back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11
has achieved, calling their new creation “Minwin.” The developer of
Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There’s
absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and
definitely no UI. It’s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt,
which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to
announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat
proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only
Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don’t need. I
wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for
Windows Server you’ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to
MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an
effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle
the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various
architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and
eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows
without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of
internal, low-level dependencies wasn’t mapped out.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering
engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the
proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making
this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast
majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual
rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn’t ready
for any prime time use – nor is anyone claiming it is. I’m incredibly
curious to see where Servo goes in the future.</p>
