<h2 id="snikket-this-weeks-sponsor">Snikket: this week’s sponsor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Snikket is a FOSS project for creating private chat spaces for small
groups, such as families, friends, or clubs. It doesn’t depend on a
phone number, doesn’t upload address books anywhere, and doesn’t sell
data to advertisers. It supports all the features you expect, including
media and voice messages, audio and video calls, end-to-end encryption,
group messaging, and more. Use it from multiple devices at once with the
official apps, or even with unofficial, third-party apps. Snikket is
easy to self-host, and professional managed hosting is also available.
Our previous sponsor, JMP, opted to donate a free week’s sponsorship to
Snikket, which any paying OSNews sponsor can opt to do. This is our very
small way of giving something back to the countless open source and/or
smaller projects out there. Thank you Snikket for sponsoring OSNews!</p>

PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except
Data General)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>That’s right: it’s PowerPC, the most unloved of the architectures CE
ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC Windows CE device I’ve
ever found, and I’m the self-described biggest pro-PowerPC bigot in the
world. Here’s an unusual form factor Windows CE device, running on the
operating system’s least used CPU, from a storied computer company near
the end of its run, intended for medical applications, produced in very
small numbers and cancelled within months. What are we going to do with
it? Well, what do you think we’re gonna do with it? We’re going to
program it, so that we can finally have some software! And, of course,
since this wacky thing was there at the bitter end, we’ll talk more
about the last days of Data General and what happened next. ↫ Cameron
Kaiser I knew Windows CE supported PowerPC, but I never knew any
PowerPC-based Windows CE devices ever actually shipped and made it to
market. Only Windows CE 2.0 seems to have supported the architecture,
and it seems to have been eliminated in 3.0 and 4.0, so it’s not
surprising there weren’t many PowerPC Windows CE devices out there. The
device that’s the subject of this article, too, only lasted on the
market for a few months, so it’s definitely a rarity.</p>

Mathematics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
In 1940 André Weil wrote a letter to his sister, Simone, outlining his
vision for translating between three distinct areas of mathematics.
Eighty years later, it still animates many of the most exciting
developments in the field.

<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Still rocking your Palm OS device, but mutter under your breath every
time you need to log into a website or service with two-factor
authentication? Sick of carrying around an Android or iOS device just so
you can log in on your Palm PDA? Worry no more, your prayers have been
answered, you can finally throw that Android or iOS garbage into the
sun. Get your 2-factor codes on your Palm, just like Google
Authenticator. Unlike Hotpants (an old port of a J2ME phone app), this
version takes up much less space and supports all Palm OS versions. ↫
Nathan Korth You can now generate 2FA codes on your Palm device. This is
wild, and I absolutely love it. I might if set it up on one of my dozens
of Palm OS devices and just put it next to my keyboard for easy access.
There’s no cooler way to handle 2FA than this.</p>

<h2 id="cross-posting-in-2024">Cross-posting in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.
</p>
<p>
I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
I can’t send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface.
My way of doing it is now called “legacy.” The app that uses that
feature doesn’t work. But I don’t even remotely have the time to go back
and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a>
come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on
Masto and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
When I want broader distribution, I do this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open a new browser window.
</li>
<li>
Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don’t know why.
</li>
<li>
I write some text into the Twitter tab.
</li>
<li>
Paste an image if there is one.
</li>
<li>
I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</li>
<li>
I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.
</li>
<li>
I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I’m sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can
actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is
too.
</p>
<p>
One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit
is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can’t include them
in this rotation.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to see one of these support the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them
100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn’t be long before the
others did it, and we’d have a much more complete network writing
environment.

unsung miracle of ChatGPT. I usually write my prompts very carefully,
esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring,
and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was
repetetive and had an error I didn’t bother to correct, to see what
would happen. It didn’t even criticize me. It figured out what I was
trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am
aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I
have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep
finding miracles in this tech.</p>

when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the
XML people were asking developers to do that. “Now you can create your
own formats!” The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready
to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in
the back of my mind, “they don’t really mean it.” This was based on
experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized
their products when they were new, but took
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the
developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important,
don’t they know that’s what BigCo’s do. Anyway a few years later, that’s
exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft,
Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the
future, so they set about to do it as a “standard” and thus was born
Atom. My opinion,
<a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is
better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But
that’s not what they do. They’re still
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS
unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there’s no point
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that.
It isn’t going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to
create a Busy Developer’s Guide to ActivityPub? Here’s the prompt. “I
want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that
runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are
basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post.
Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.” I
asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT
gave</a> what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> is a
product of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut">Architecture
Astronauts</a>. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so
it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the
simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can
anything pragmatic. It’s why I said last week that they
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521">need a BDG
asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I
would help them design it, I’m a fairly typical “busy developer.” I
would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not
to be revised with breakage to apps. I’ve also seen this happen before,
in fact it happens more often than not. If you don’t understand a
format, you can’t actually support it. This is part of the
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">you
can’t lie to a compiler</a> axiom.

I’ve been feeling like rambling, so it’s time for a classic ramble. This
time we are looking at the origins of books about computers. More
specifically, computer books targeted at a general audience. Along the
way we stumble into the first public disclosure of digital computers,
the first intentionally unimportant machine, and wild speculation about
the future of mechanical brains.

get a real phone number that operates over the internet using XMPP. They
provide numbers in the USA and Canada with everything you need to access
SMS/MMS/etc. and voice calls using your XMPP (or SIP) clients of choice
across all your devices. They are committed to growing the use of open

<h2 id="why-i-run-a-bsd-on-a-pc">Why I run a BSD on a PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>But the biggest differential factor between BSDs and GNU/Linux is the
way it is structured. In Linux, all components are designed to work
together, but are completely separate. You’ve got the kernel, init
systems, multimedia daemons, userland, bootloader, virtualization and
containerization mechanisms, package managers, and so on. They are all
separate projects with their own goals and are operated by separate
entities. This is why we’ve got different Linux Distributions instead of
Operating System. Everyone can take the kernel, start adding components
on top of it, and a few minutes later the DistroWatch is even harder to
keep up with. Each BSD on the other hand is designed as single system.
All components are created and developed together. Things work together
perfectly, because they are designed, coded, tested and released as one.
↫ Michał Sapka As I’ve mentioned here and there over the past few weeks,
I’ve been exploring the world of BSD lately, and after bouncing of
FreeBSD I’ve found a very happy home on OpenBSD. Now, this doesn’t mean
I’m now a full-time OpenBSD user or anything like that – Linux is the
main operating system on my gaming PC, my laptop, and my workstation,
and that’s not going to be changing any time soon. However, after
installing, exploring, and using OpenBSD on a machine cobbled together
from spare and older parts, I can definitely see the appeal. OpenBSD
feels more coherent than a Linux distribution – I use Fedora KDE, if
that matters – and the various lower-level systems seem to talk to each
other in ways that make more intuitive sense than the individually
developed systems in a Linux distribution do. Diving into the
command-line interface of a Linux distribution can sometimes feel
confusing because different tools use different conventions, because
they’re developed by entirely different people and projects, with
different ideas about how flags should work, how output should be
presented, and so on. On OpenBSD, it seems much easier to carry over
something you learn from one tool to the next. I simply feel more secure
and knowledgeable, even if it’s still the same idiot me. The
documentation plays a big role here. They’re in one place, written in a
consistent style, and reference each other left and right, making it
easy to find your way around to other commands or tools you haven’t yet
considered using. On Linux, you’re going from one project’s
documentation to another project’s documentation, and not only will the
style change, the quality will also vary greatly. That’s not to say
everything’s perfect on OpenBSD – it’s clearly a hardened server
operating system, and its focus on security will definitely throw up
annoying hurdles if you’re just trying to do workstation things.
Firefox, for instance, is hobbled by strict security rules through
unveil, which makes perfect sense for what OpenBSD is first and foremost
trying to be, but if you’re just a regular user like me, it’s annoying
that Firefox can only access ~/Downloads, or that it can’t set itself as
the default browser so unless you disable that check, Firefox will keep
complaining about it. Diving into Firefox and unveil is on my list,
though, because you should be able to ‘fix’ this. Furthermore, while
every piece of software, or an equivalent, is pretty much always
available for Linux, on OpenBSD it’s more hit and miss, and it seems to
take a bit longer for new releases of especially bigger software
packages to get updated. I mean, there’s obviously no Steam on OpenBSD,
but smaller, less well-known projects generally also don’t support
OpenBSD, so you’re either going to be compiling things yourself or hope
someone packages it up for OpenBSD. Then there’s the various vanity
things we’ve come to expect from modern Linux distributions, like slick,
fully graphical boot and shutdown sequences, detailed graphical tools
for managing your packages, graphical firmware and driver managers, and
so on. OpenBSD has none of these things, and while that’s no issue for
me, I can see how it would throw other people off. FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD, and the few others often kind of get lost in all the Linux,
Windows, and macOS violence, and to be quite honest – I feel like many
people in the BSD community seem mostly okay with that. If you’ve never
spent any serious time using any of the BSDs, but you’re interested in
operating systems and don’t mind spending a few hours learning how to
manipulate your system through CLI tools – dive in. There’s a ton of fun
to be had, and things to learn. For now, I’m continuing my exploration
of OpenBSD, and if things keep going as well as they are, I may consider
at least switching over the workstation in my office from Fedora KDE to
OpenBSD – but I highly doubt it’ll ever make its way to my gaming
desktop or my laptop.</p>

version control system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes
ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. Got is still under
development; it is being developed on OpenBSD and its main target
audience are OpenBSD developers. Got uses Git repositories to store
versioned data. Git can be used for any functionality which has not yet
been implemented in Got. It will always remain possible to work with
both Got and Git on the same repository. ↫ Game of Trees website OpenBSD
is developing Game of Trees because they want a version control system
that adheres to OpenBSD coding conventions, implements various OpenBSD
security practices, and uses nothing but BSD-licensed code. It’s
important to note, as its developers make very clear, that GoT is not in
any way intended as a replacement for git.</p>

<h2 id="x.org-on-netbsd-the-state-of-things">X.Org on NetBSD: the state
of things</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The big question – does all this have a future? The good news is that
all new hardware has generic support in X. Someone writes either a
modesetting kernel driver or a classical wsdisplay kernel driver and
they will be automatically supported by the associated drivers in X. The
bad news is that to have applications running we require access to a
larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn and
is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels. The process of upstreaming
stuff to X.Org is an ongoing process, but it’s likely we’ll run into
things that will never be suitable for upstream. ↫ Nia Alarie on the
NetBSD blog I had no idea NetBSD did such heavy customisations of its
X.Org implementation, many of which have never made their way upstream.
The project also maintains support for several older GPUs, uses its own
input driver, and more – it’s quite impressive.</p>

released: first release since 2015</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do any of you remember the browser Dillo? The project’s been through
a rough few years after the main developer of the layout engine sadly
passed away, the lead developer disappeared from the project, the
dillo.org domain was lost and taken over by spammers – but now there’s
new people at the helm, and the browser just released it first new
version since 2015. Dillo 3.1.0 brings a whole host of new features and
improvements. Dillo is open source, uses the FLTK toolkit, and runs on
Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows (Cygwin), and more.</p>

Update on SwiftGodot and strict concurrency.
</p>
<p>
The easy stuff is gone, but the remaining stuff is hard. I could brute
force my way to the end, but goal is not to just have it build, I want
to make sure that my users can rely on the guarantees and be able to
benefit from this additional level of safety.
</p>
<p>
So the next step will take some time to complete, as many of these will
require some research into some Godot features.

<h2 id="a-quick-light-dark-experiment">A quick light-dark()
experiment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function
<code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS
architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a
powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the
new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to
recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.
</p>
<p>
My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
But if every component is in charge of it’s own
<code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>,
<code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the
codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places,
leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution
for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root
scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token
level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark
experience and, like good children, your components abide in their
parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom
properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your
component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the
global variables if necessary.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I
deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for
<code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari
17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by
changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to
verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code><span
class="citation" data-cites="supports">@supports</span></code> query.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a
dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>
enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in
there so future versions of me will know when and

I built this fence</a>.

<h2 id="i-support-the-students">I support the students</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As
a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started
an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support
today’s students making their political opinions heard. I also see
journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on
violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn’t true then
and I’m pretty sure it isn’t true now.
</p>
<p>
And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not
what’s really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American
students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values,
only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war,
as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel.
</p>
<p>
We shouldn’t have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on
killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was
unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is
killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it’s exactly what
Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should
<i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust.
</p>
<p>
As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that’s
why I support the students. They aren’t right or wrong, but they are
continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and
journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the
2020s as it was in the 1970s.

<h2 id="why-is-my-elasticsearch-query-so-slow">Why is my ElasticSearch
query so slow?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog</p>
<p>
The center of my working hours for the past two years has been
<a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>, a platform for
teaching, learning, and performing text analysis with scholarly and
primary source content from JSTOR, Portico, and elsewhere.
</p>
<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<p>
The Constellate <a href="https://constellate.org/builder">dataset
builder page</a>.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Our dataset builder allows users to filter and explore a corpus of over
35 million documents. This search - and the analytical queries that
power the data visualizations in this builder - rely on an ElasticSearch
cluster on the backend. We rely heavily on ElasticSearch aggregations
every time a user updates their filters, taking the resulting set of
documents (no matter if it is 500 docs or 15 million) and count up the
different document types, providers, genres, decades of publication, and
more. These aggregations are memory-heavy actions, especially when
aggregating over 10+ million documents. Even so, ElasticSearch was
usually able to return results in under 3,000 milliseconds, providing an
acceptable user experience.
</p>
<h2 id="why-have-our-queries-gotten-slower-and-slower">
Why have our queries gotten slower and slower?
</h2>
<p>
But we started to see something concerning happening: over the past six
months, we watched the worst-case query durations (those the 95th
percentile execution time for all searches performed in a week) steadily
growing, starting to crest over an unbearable 10 seconds long. At that
point our default request timeouts on our backend services were truly
breaking the end user experience.
</p>
<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<figcaption>
<p>
Median and 95th percentile durations (in milliseconds) of search queries
on <a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I hadn’t made any changes to the way we composed the queries we sent to
ElasticSearch in that time. Our overall usage was increasing, yes, and
during very large bulk ingests we did see some overall slowdowns in
query processing as expected. But not at a pace that seemed liable to
explain why these pathological query times were growing steadily worse.
We had been steadily adding new documents to the index, some coming in
large monthly batches, but we’d been doing that for years without seeing
this kind of progressive slowdown.
</p>
<p>
So I started experimenting, running searches directly against our
cluster and one at a time, removing and adding back in the aggregations
to see if any oe was causing a particularly heavy load on the cluster.
The culprit: our aggregation of keyphrases, which were sets of
significant terms calculated for each document. For very large search
result sets that returned 20 or 30 million documents, the keyphrases
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code></a>
aggregation was adding between 3 and 8 ruinous whole seconds onto the
query.
</p>
<p>
Why was this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregation so slow, while the half-dozen others we were running were
fast as ever? Cardinality. While we only have a handful of different
providers, a few dozen subject categorizations, and maybe a hundred
different languages, there are over <strong>50 million distinct
keyphrases</strong> in the system. With such high cardinality,
ElasticSearch had to generate an extremely large set of global ordinals
when being asked for a terms query, and then actually rank those
ordinals and return the top fifty most frequently occurring. Even
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/eager-global-ordinals.html#_avoiding_global_ordinal_loading">precalculating
global ordinals</a> (the usual first step in addressing slow
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregations) was not enough to tame the IO needed to aggregate 30+
million documents’ intersection with 50+ million keyphrase values.
</p>
<p>
Why hadn’t this problem asserted itself before? Because for a few years,
we had only extracted keyphrases from about 1/3 of our documents, and
weren’t actively contributing new ones into the system. While better
automating our ingest pipelines this year, we took the opportunity to
regenerate a lot of our keyphrases, backfilling our database with an
enormous number of new keyphrase values. While this problem of
cardinality was in our system all along, the scale simply wasn’t large
enough to make its impact felt until recently.
</p>
<h2 id="so-make-the-problem-smaller">
So make the problem smaller
</h2>
<p>
Because we only want to get a relative ranking of the top keyphrases, a
straightforward way to reduce this problem is to use a
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-sampler-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sampler</code></a>
aggregation. By grabbing a sample of up to 5,000 documents before
running the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregation, we easily brought the impact of the keyphrases aggregation
back under control. This effectively puts a ceiling on the number of
files whose keyphrases need to be looked up in an aggregation, and
mitigates the real scaling issues that we were starting to encounter
with our data.

<p>
An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done
with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to
middle school next year. Unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and
with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here
we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf
on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.
</p>
<h2>
The Eclipse
</h2>
<p>
In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the
eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path
of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the
eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.

<p>
I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing
prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The
confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo
effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space
rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that
keeps our planet alive.
</p>
<p>
Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.
</p>
<h2>
44 and there’s so much more
</h2>
<p>
I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s
how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning
the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner”
at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through
the whole meal.
</p>
<p>
The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends
who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you
often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a
deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.
</p>
<h2>
Making Games
</h2>
<p>
I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but
I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game
either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s
<a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.
</li>
<li>
A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.
</li>
<li>
A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile
computer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t
have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon
maybe?
</p>
<h2>
Waiting for a life-changing email
</h2>
<p>
You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a
minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours
as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot
anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two
months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails
actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.
</p>
<p>
To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently
patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m
unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids
ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say
“Nope, not yet” over and over.
</p>
<p>
But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of
concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big
phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.
</p>

<p>
What you jackals come here for…
</p>
<h3>
🧠 <strong>Learning</strong>
</h3>
<p>
I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future,
so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a>
course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.
</li>
<li>
LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search
but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default
embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand
it.
</li>
<li>
Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by
yourself and it inspired me to make a game.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
💪 Wellness
</h3>
<p>
I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again
it’s stress-related.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Taking walks
</li>
<li>
Got a weighted vest for “rucking”
</li>
<li>
Rode my new bike once
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
📖 <strong>Reading</strong>
</h2>
<p>
Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I’m mulling around
tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or
harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read
some wonderful pieces. If it’s sci-fi themed and has good art, I’m
all-in.

📝 <strong>Blogging</strong>
</h3>
<p>
Slowed down a lot on blogging. That’s okay. I still have three dozen
drafts but I’m being pretty choosy about where I toil. It’s easy for me
to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a
giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I
need to do that more often. Who knows.

DuckDB to seamlessly query a large parquet file over HTTP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>A neat property of the parquet file format is that it’s designed with
block I/O in mind, so that when you are interested in only parts of the
contents of a file, it’s possible to some extent to only read that data.
Many tools are aware of this property, and DuckDB is one of them.
Depending on which circles you run in, a lesser known aspect of HTTP is
range requests, where you specify which bytes in a file to be
retrieved.</p>
