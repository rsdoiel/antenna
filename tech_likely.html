<p>I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and
was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and
that’s hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I
listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said
some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won’t
have a response to, since you can’t control or spin how old you are. We
can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like
those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it
much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in
Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was
speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v
Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to
fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all
American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I
just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to
pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening
people’s minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real
world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA.</p>

Knicks beat the Nets last night, in the way the Knicks used to get beat,
in the last minute of the game. I felt bad for the Nets. It wasn’t that
long ago that the Nets were super-irritating because they had been taken
over by two reallllly ugly NBA players, Kevin Durant who isn’t worthy of
NY’s basketball fans, what a total piece of shit, but even worse, his
best friend Kyrie who is either a complete fucking idiot, or a
Jew-hater. Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally
revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up
for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn’t have
said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and
is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would
happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past
that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the
haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy.
But – not saying the Knicks should have let them win, or that I was even
slightly rooting for them. But I was embarrassed that there were far
more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don’t admit
that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>

The grifter web
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana" title="@ohhelloana@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="ohhelloana">@ohhelloana</span></a> recently
wondered about personal websites. What is it that people like about
personal websites?
</p>
<p>
I think when I search online for a topic, I’d love to find pages by
people enthusiastic about the topic and not two dozen sites full of ads
that give me the impression of being people farms or bot farms. I
wouldn’t want to miss big non-monetized sites like MDN or Wikipedia, but
there are a lot of similar pages that are all strictly worse (the ad/bot
variety of the same), and there are some pages by knowledgeable people
that discovered this or that and wrote it up on their blog. The same is
true for non-technical subjects like gardening.
</p>
<p>
I want the big non-monetized documentation sites and the personal sites,
and I don’t care for the monetized sites because I feel they’re just
leeching off the sites I like: copying the text and pictures directly,
or copying them, training their bots on them and regurgitating a mix,
inserting themselves as middlemen, trying to profit from that large
value gap, slicing it up and taking a share, diminishing the value for
the rest of us.

<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Starting with today’s release of Chrome (M121), we’re introducing
experimental generative AI features to make it even easier and more
efficient to browse — all while keeping your experience personalized to
you. You’ll be able to try out these new features in Chrome on Macs and
Windows PCs over the next few days, starting in the U.S. Just sign into
Chrome, select “Settings” from the three-dot menu and navigate to the
“Experimental AI” page. Because these features are early public
experiments, they’ll be disabled for enterprise and educational accounts
for now. ↫ Parisa Tabriz Chrome will automatically suggest tab groups
for you (a sorting algorithm, very advanced technology), you can
generate themes (mashing other people’s real art togerher and picking a
dominant colour from the result), and Chrome can generate text in text
fields (spicy autocomplete). “AI” sure is changing the world as we know
it.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-creates-firefox-ppa-and-.deb-package">Mozilla creates
Firefox ppa and .deb package</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Great news for Linux users, after months of testing, Mozilla released
today a new package for Firefox on Linux (specifically on Ubuntu,
Debian, and any Debian-based distribution). If you’ve heard about Linux,
which is known for its open-source software and an alternative to
traditional operating systems (OS), and are curious to learn more, here
are four reasons why you should give our new Firefox on Linux package a
try. ↫ Gabriel Bustamente and Johan Lorenzo It’s a ppa and .deb package
straight from Mozilla itself, so you don’t have to to rely on your
distribution’s maintainers (as long as you use a Debian-based
distribution, that is). Do note, however, that some distributions
actually make changes to the default Firefox code, such as Fedora
enabling things like Wayland-by-default and hardware-accelerated video
decoding long before those became default in Firefox-proper. By using
Mozilla’s package, you’ll lose all of these changes. As a sidenote,
Mozilla’s instructions for enabling the ppa and installing the .deb are
a bit… Dubious, though.</p>

<p>Apple yesterday released iOS and iPadOS 17.3 as well as watchOS 10.3,
tvOS 17.3, and macOS Sonoma 14.3 for all supported devices. iOS 17.3
primarily adds collaborative playlists in Apple Music, and what Apple
calls “Stolen Device Protection.” Collaborative playlists have been on a
bit of a journey; they were promised as part of iOS 17, then added in
the beta of iOS 17.2, but removed before that update went live. Now
they’re finally reaching all users. When enabled, Stolen Device
Protection requires Face ID or Touch ID authentication “with no passcode
fallback” for some sensitive actions on the phone. ↫ Samuel Axon at Ars
Technica This last feature is something you should probably turn on
right away, as it serves as a reply to Joanna Stern’s investigation into
an apparently common way iPhones would get stolen to gain access to
users’ Apple accounts.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-to-unmaintainable-is-very-low">The time to
unmaintainable is very low</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
It’s so easy nowadays to get up and going on a project. I can burp some
<code>npm</code> commands into my terminal, burp some more to setup a
deployment pipeline and blam! Website. The time to product demo is so
low. You can get far on your own… very quickly… but then… you’re on your
own. And it’s possible you’ve built something way past your ability to
maintain.
</p>
<p>
To fix that problem or to allow you to do more business’y work, you add
people to the process. But people cost lots of money. Unless what you’re
building makes lots of money already, you probably have to raise VC.
With a squad of developers burping <code>npm</code> commands, now you’re
moving super fast. Hopefully money starts coming in, but the whole point
of investment was so you could price the application artificially cheap
to grow a user base that you upsell later. As the investment coffers
tick down, the pressure goes up to land a new feature or gimmick so you
can get another round of investment.
</p>
<p>
You can, of course, ride the hype cycles. This year that’s AI. Investors
might throw money at that. But now you’ve bolted on a feature from a
highly volatile, emergent, non-deterministic space into your overgrown
application. You’ll either need to hire more expensive people who know
the space or divert existing resources who were performing maintenance
over to the new feature.
</p>
<p>
Oops, AI costs more than you can charge for it. You burned through the
investment even faster and must do a round of layoffs. Now your app
maintained by 10 people has 8 people… then 5… then 2…
</p>
<p>
Paying people to burp <code>npm</code> commands is expensive, could AI
do that? Vercel’s <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a>, for example, farts
out entire UIs. Great. In a day I have twelve thousand screens built. I
have more UI than some developers will code in a lifetime. But I’m
getting the itch to update it and the machine isn’t doing what I want it
to… perhaps I’ll take some VC to hire some people to clean up these
robo-farts.
</p>
<p>
And by the time you finish all that work, it’ll be right in time for a
major version update on a core dependency. Good luck out there.
</p>
<p>
I realize I’m complaining about moving too fast but that’s not my
intent. Although, I could argue that while driving 200mph is fun and
exciting, you’re one small fuckup away from a major fuckup. My point is
that a key factor of sustainability is making sure maintainability stays
on par with growth. At the risk of sounding like a Luddite –
<a href="https://amzn.to/3NA62WE">which I am</a> – the ability to
<em style="font-family: fantasy;">fancy copy-paste</em> your way into an
unmaintainable situation is higher than ever and that’s a trade-off we
should think about.

<h2 id="one-big-one-little">One big, one little</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I often feel overwhelmed deciding what to do with my spare time. It’s a
problem with volume moreso than ambition. When the feeling hit the other
weekend I scribbled down seven ideas
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/bag-of-distractions/">rattling
around in my head</a> and stared at the list blankly. I’ve used
different prioritization systems in the past like the Eisenhower matrix
(Urgent vs. Important) and the Six Sigma matrix (Effort vs Impact); and
while those are good for evaluating required tasks… none of those work
well for voluntary activities self-created by a
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/not-a-collector/">serial project
starter</a>.
</p>
<p>
I need a system that helps prioritize <em>and</em> load balance projects
I give myself. When free time shows up, I don’t want to waste time
doomscrolling on social media or being in a state of overwhelm, I want
to hop right in to an idea. I also don’t want seven big thought benders
occupying my brain RAM at all times, I need less background noise. After
some thought, a tiny mantra started kicking around in my head, “One big,
one little.”
</p>
<p>
If I artificially limit myself to having one major and one minor active
side project at a time, my agility goes up because I’m not doing ten
projects at once, I’m doing one or two. When one
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">project
finishes</a>, I move to the next best idea that fits the available slot.
I will never be taking on too much and it’s easier to say “no” to new
distractions if I have to substitute projects.
</p>
<p>
Why two projects? Why not one? That would be the ultimate focus state,
but believe it or not it’s an intentional move because my pockets of
free time are differently sized. In my mind, a big project takes a week
or a month while a little project takes a day or less. You can slice up
big projects into smaller projects, but that itself is a small planning
project. I also like variety.
</p>
<p>
And because I have more than two responsibilities in life, one slight
modification to this system might be to have one big, one little project
for each major area of my life.
</p>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Careful! Adding more areas will put me back where I started, but 3 to 5
areas seems about right. What’s different between this list and the list
of seven ideas I made the other day? Not much except that areas of my
life tend to occupy particular timeframes: Work is during the day,
Personal is during the evenings, and Family is after school and
weekends. In practice my boundaries overlap (e.g. my work feeds my
family) but it’s pretty easy for me to discern which area of my life
needs attention.
</p>
<p>
I like how this limited structure builds some resilience against
“crash-ins” like urgent emails, taxes, or car problems. Those surprise
projects tend to be disproportionately problematic for me, like
delivering a new piece of furniture to an already crowded living room.
If I’m abiding in the one-in/one-out approach, a crash-in must take the
place of something else in that respective area. That paradigm is much
easier to manage than my current thought technology; a giant Jenga tower
of obligations.
</p>
<p>
No idea if this holds up but this past week I’ve been more focused and
centered than ever. Yesterday I cleared out a big work-related project
and freed up some mental allocation. Wiping a project off the board and
seeing a blank space made finishing the project even sweeter. Then last
night I had some extra energy after bedtime and decided to work on a fun
project for my podcast. I got about 80% finished in one night. Before
(like the last four weeks) I would have felt guilty or distracted about
picking up that project while thinking about four others I could/should
be doing.
</p>
<p>
That’s my new “One big, one little” system. Now when a rogue idea sneaks
into my periphery, I can chant my mantra and ward away those little
demons.

The cerebellum is responsible for far more than coordinating movement.
New techniques reveal that it is, in fact, a hub of sensory and
emotional processing in the brain.

<p>date: 2024-01-23, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">When
did Raspberry Pi get so expensive?</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gmktec-n100-pc-raspberry-pi-5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi 5 and N100 GMKtec Nucbox G3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I just bought this N100-based Intel x86 mini PC (<em>brand new</em>),
and it was cheaper than an almost equivalent—but slower—Raspberry Pi 5.
</p>
<p>
This GMKtec mini PC is called the
<a href="https://amzn.to/4b88MVp">Nucbox G3</a>, and it comes with an
Intel Alder Lake N100 4-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256 GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and
Windows 11 Pro—and mine cost just $131, after a couple coupons.
</p>
<p>
That’s… a lot of computer for a very good price. But the Raspberry
Pi—the famous “$35 computer”, should be well below that… right?
</p>
<p>
Well, I bought all the parts required to build a Pi 5 to the same
spec—including the adapters and parts to assemble it into one small
unit—and it turns out… the Pi is <em>more expensive</em>. And
<em>slower</em>.
</p>
<p>
The Pi 4 still starts at $35 (for a 1 GB model), but the Pi 5 starts at
$60 (for 4 GB) and climbs to $80 for the maximum 8 GB model.

<h1>
How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader
</h1>
<p>
The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you
even get started?
</p>
<p>
There are four
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a>
(SK):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Regular infantry
</li>
<li>
Guns
</li>
<li>
Tanks
</li>
<li>
Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I didn’t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this
is not how it works. Start small.
</p>
<p>
You can get the
<a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules
for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.
</p>
<p>
Buy
<a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the
complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.
</p>
<p>
As somebody recently told me: “Looking up the rules is 90% of the game!”
</p>
<p>
I like to call Advanced Squad Leader “the game to end all
rules-lawyering.”
</p>
<p>
For online gaming, you need to download the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine
for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card
games. Vassal is free, open-source software.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to
run ASL on VASSAL.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The VASL site has a section called “Download Scenarios” where you can
download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you
load those games, you’ll see messages about all the extensions you’re
missing. Often you don’t need them, but feel free to install them.
</p>
<p>
If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be
aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff
that gets used in later boxes.

in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I

were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our
“idea processor” ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a
couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be
an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people
at Apple who believed in us, notably

without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn’t have to find out. Thank
you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for
creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when
we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that
idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software
developers.</p>

<p>Winlator is an Android application that lets you to run Windows
(x86_64) applications with Wine and Box86/Box64. ↫ BrunoSX That’s all
you need to know. There are videos up of things like Mass Effect 2 and
Fallout 3 running through this, which is incredibly neat. I’m not
entirely sure what the use case is, but who cares – this is an excellent
idea.</p>

now lets EU users unlink their Facebook, Messenger and Instagram
accounts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>In a major move addressing European regulations, Meta will soon give
users in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland significantly more control over
how their data is used across Facebook and Instagram. The changes, set
to begin rolling out in the coming weeks, aim to comply with the Digital
Markets Act (DMA). ↫ Omer Dursun at NeoWin You’ll be able to unlink
Facebook’s various services – such as Instagram and Facebook’s main
social network thing – and you’ll be able to use Facebook Messenger as a
standalone service without needing to have a Facebook account. Sadly,
there’s no word on WhatsApp. This only applies to people in the EU/EEA.
Americans need not apply.</p>

<h2 id="rubywm-an-x11-window-manager-in-pure-ruby">RubyWM: an X11 window
manager in pure Ruby</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a minimalist (currently &lt;1K lines) pure Ruby (including the
X11 driver) X11 window manager. It is focused on tiling, but allows you
to choose to assign a tiling layout to specific desktops or leave them
floating. Currently whether or not you use tiling or floating layout
there is no window decoration and windows are not draggable or resizable
by pulling on borders (but you can do that with Windows key + left/right
mouse button) Like bspwm, which was an inspiration, the wm supports no
keyboard handling – all keyboard handling is deferred to separate tools
like sxhkd. Unlike bspwm this WM has no dedicated IPC mechanism.
Instead, so far, all communication happens via X11 ClientMessage events,
which means any tool, like xdotool etc. that can produce those events
can control the WM. ↫ Vidar Hokstad on RubyWM’s GitHub page In the blog
post announcing RubyWM, the author makes it very clear that while he
uses this WM full time, he is also willing to work around its bugs, and
that certain tools will simply break if you use it. He considers it more
of a tech demo, and that you really shouldn’t rely on this for any
serious work.</p>

<p>Sven “winni” Gohdes, Ehrenmitglied des Chaos Computer Clubs zeigte
uns mit seiner offenen positiven Art viele große und kleine Dinge,
welche das Leben noch lebenswerter machen. Trotz seiner Erkrankung an
Muskelschwund war er eine stetige Anlaufquelle für lange gemeinsame
Stunden sowohl in großer als auch in kleiner Runde, bei Tee und zur
Entspannung. Nun ist er im Januar mit 57 Jahren verstorben und wird uns
fehlen.</p>

As some of you know, I like living on the edge hovering around 480 tabs
open - and I keep hitting the 500 limit.

<p>
Every few days I sacrifice some 50 good boys so I can continue browsing.

<p>
Today I discovered you can press this button and choose “new tab group

separate group, and you get yourself another space with 500 windows to

<h2 id="spreadsheets-are-the-best">Spreadsheets are the best</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Spreadsheets are the best
</h1>
<p>
I want to love Forth and Lisp and Perl and Go and I sort of want to know
Rust and Haskell and OCaml and Elixir, but really, the most important
electronic computing platform for the largest number people is …
spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
Formulas and graphs turn these into the multifunctional tool that spread
from accounting specialists to financial reporting to project managers
planning to household budgets to birthday and wedding guest lists.
</p>
<p>
If you think about it, spreadsheets for the masses succeeded where Emacs
failed. Spreadsheets allow you to build the tools you need. And sure, as
a programming professional I have heard my share of horror stories:
salary distributions and bonus programs, airport light systems, and many
other things that should have used relational databases and REST
services and whatever. But people know spreadsheets and use them to
solve their problems.
</p>
<p>
Spreadsheets are underappreciated. Certainly they are underappreciated
by programmers, I think.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@maxime_andre" title="@maxime_andre@mastodon.xyz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="maxime_andre">@maxime_andre</span></a>
linked me to the video
<a href="https://youtu.be/0yKf8TrLUOw?si=ZvLctptepVjLWXY3">Pure
Functional Programming in Excel</a> by Felienne Hermans where she
explains the benefits of spreadsheets for computing.
</p>
<p>
And I do think that the programming languages I listed failed us in as
far as they do not contribute to computers as
<a href="http://conviviality.ouvaton.org/spip.php?article1">convivial
tools</a>. Most people are not autonomous in their use of computers to
solve their problems because they cannot use the languages listed. They
must hope for an app to solve their problem. But they can use a
spreadsheet to solve their problem!
</p>
<p>
Emacs was supposed to be the editor for everybody, including
non-technical people. It’s just that our current design paradigms
optimize for the inexperienced users and penalize experienced users.
Users no longer expect Emacs-like tools and Emacs developers don’t
expect inexperienced users any more.
</p>
<p>
We feel it’s OK to feel overwhelmed by Emacs – but many people are
expected to navigate the real world in cars, on roads, with complex
traffic regulation, other traffic participants and machines we don’t
understand. To me, that illustrates a value judgement. On the one hand,
cars are a commodity. We no longer have to be an expert in combustion
engines to drive one. But we still need to learn how to use the tool.
There’s mandatory training, there are professional teachers, there are
enforcers of conventions, penalties, there’s financing available if we
want to lease a car, and so on. There is a lot of support and training
for users of cars and not so much for computers. The expectations are
different.
</p>
<p>
One might want to say that people need the car to get to work and that
explains the economic incentives. To this I might reply that when one
gets to work the actual work usually involves a computer and instead of
using a convivial tool that one has learned and mastered, customized and
extended to ones liking, one is forced to work with corporate software
that is as boring as it can be.
</p>
<p>
Except when it comes to spreadsheets. This is where everyday people
still can exercise mastery and solve their problems. It’s a tool and not
an app.
</p>
<p>
If we go back far enough, programming languages were designed to let
non-technical people solve their problems.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> was a
programming language for business people.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> was a
programming language for faculty and students. From this point of view,
I’d argue, the programming languages I mentioned are in fact steps away
from this goal.
</p>
<p>
These programming languages solve more specialised problems. These are
tools for experts. But in doing this, they moved away from the realm of
everyday people using them to solve their problems. These languages fail
to make computers into convivial tools.
</p>
<p>
The ZX Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 both booted into BASIC. Sure,
that didn’t mean that we knew how to program. Loading and saving stuff
from cassette was hard. PEEK and POKE were hard. But the tools to turn
the computer into a convivial tool were right there. The computer came
with a manual.
</p>
<p>
My hope, my wish, my expectations are that we can do this and more. We
can make it even better! Spreadsheets are the saving grace. We should
put spreadsheets front and centre.
</p>
<p>
The sad reality is, however, that today we buy computers that
essentially boot into the app store.

<p>The Vikings was the first movie I ever saw — not in a standard movie
theater, but some years after its release, at a drive-in. I remember
being at once bemused and excited by the rituals of finding a parking

<p>Arp 300 consists of two interacting galaxies, UGC 05028 (the smaller
face-on spiral galaxy) and UGC 05029 (the larger face-on spiral). Likely
due to its gravitational dance with its larger partner, UGC 05028 has an

writing something that is usually meant to be private knowing that will

I like that it offers readers a glimpse into what corresponding with
people online looks like. As I wrote many times before, if you want to
engage with me, please do write me an email. I read every single one of
them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes
over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe
it’s important to connect with others.
</p>
<p>
I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about
others and their lives. I love to know what you do, and what you’re
passionate about so, again, if you want to make a new connection, please
do get in touch.

shifting the skills needed to build an adaptive and successful
workforce. As underscored in the 2023 National Defense Science &amp;
Technology Strategy, the United States cannot create 21st-century
capabilities using 20th-century education practices. The World Economic
Forum (WEF) further predicts that by 2025, 50% of all workers worldwide

<p>Smartwatches at the turn of the century were a more motley assortment
than today’s, with an even wilder range of functionality. If you had a
few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even
back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you
still weren’t left out, because in 2001 you could get the Web-<span

docking station, and you could slurp down about 93K of precious Web data
to scroll on the 59×16 screen — 10 characters by 2 characters — to read
any time you wanted! That is, of course, if the remote host the watch’s

virtually anything to download and install. Well, I want 95,488 bytes of

tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser
like Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it
harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or
resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities
to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party
browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged
in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues.
With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we
think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent
process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical
standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend
to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage
and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The
official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.</p>

room?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons
I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was
finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for
winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room.
However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too
smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was
zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what
this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow
light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is
an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course,
how to hack it and make it more useful.</p>

PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 / Call for Papers &amp; Sponsors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-22, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day 2024 (P2D2 2024) will be held on June 4
and 5 in Prague, Czech Republic. The conference focuses on topics for
PostgreSQL users and developers. For more information about the event,
please see the website at
<a href="https://www.p2d2.cz/">https://www.p2d2.cz/</a>
</p>
<p>
We are now accepting proposals for talks and trainings in both Czech and
English. As in previous years, the conference is a single-track event
with a mix of talks in Czech and English.
</p>
<p>
To submit a talk, use this form:
</p>
<pre><code> https://p2d2.cz/call-for-papers
</code></pre>
<p>
The talk sessions are generally 45 minutes long (but may be shorter if
requested) and may be on any PostgreSQL-related topic. We’re also
looking for trainings (either half-day or whole-day) for the first day
(June 4). To submit a training proposal, use the same form as for
regular talks (there’s a field to pick talk/training).
</p>
<p>
Finally, we are considering to include a session of lightning talks
(short talks, five minute each). A separate call for proposals will be
made for them during the event.
</p>
<p>
The submission deadline is March 1 (which is Friday), end of day.
Selected speakers will be notified / confirmed shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The proposals will be considered by committee who will produce a
schedule to be published about a month before the event.
</p>
<p>
All selected speakers will get free entry to the conference (excluding
training sessions). We do offer covering travel and accommodations for
foreign speakers (generally enough for two nights in a hotel and travel
within Europe). If you require assistance with funding to be able to
attend, please make a note of this in the submission notes field.
</p>
<p>
We have also opened our call for sponsors. As usual, we we’ll offer
three sponsorship levels - the details are available at:
</p>
<pre><code>https://p2d2.cz/rocnik-2024/sponsorship
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-case-for-rust-in-the-freebsd-base-system">The case for Rust
(in the FreeBSD base system)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a
recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of
including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost
is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an
additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external
toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some
tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner
Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I’ve read and
what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn’t a programmer,
languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages,
and it’s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like
FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I’m not at
all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice,
but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A
big issue is FreeBSD’s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported
or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports,
which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting
barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea
either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development
of the Linux kernel.</p>

2024, Genode to focus on multi-monitor, suspend/resume, touchpads, and
much more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Without hesitation, our developer community quickly rallied behind
the topic “Sculpt OS usability”, desiring to boost the user experience
with respect to multi-monitor usage, convenient interactive UIs for
common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens,
tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging,
and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will
steadily continue with the gardening of Genode’s driver landscape,
fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux
kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable. In 2024,
we will also promote Genode’s custom (base-hw) microkernel to become the
default kernel for Sculpt OS, which is the culmination of a multi-year
effort. ↫ Official Genode news post The updated roadmap for 2024 details

In this adventure Bull Mancuso is a woman, and is an astronaut on the
space station, performing experiments on her fellow astronauts. The goal
of the experiment is to determine if astronauts can play a new form of
basketball that was invented by SpaceXYZ founder Mucky Lonnegan, who is
in space with Astronaut Mancuso.

<p>
The vision hardware looks lovely, but I am more impressed by the depth
of the user experience, the guidance to developers, the design system,
the operating system and the tooling to support it.
</p>
<p>
Previous headsets have been cool and exciting (I own pretty much one of
each), yet none got this level of necessary scaffolding in place, so the
experiences are a mish-mash of half baked ideas.
</p>
<p>
We finally go from “this is a neat idea” to a viable platform.

realize that most of the people who read this blog aren’t sports fans,
something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series,
give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st
century that we don’t get any other way to imho. If we all watch
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>,
for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a>
and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>).
(No spoilers as to why he’s significant, and won the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a>
for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where
they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to
say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to
say to your friends – there! – <i>that’s</i> what I was talking about.
Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few
players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal
ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors,
which was one of those games you don’t ever forget, because of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a>
where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the
teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way
what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded
away. One day they’re our team, and the next day, supposedly they’re the
other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn’t just leave,
maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a
former
<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great
Hope</a> of ours, didn’t pan out, and now it’s nice to see him on the
court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could’ve
gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was
the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one,
the
<a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit
kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point
guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the
Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night’s
<a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a>
was something else. I understand that
<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel">Niners
and Packers</a> fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can
relate.</p>

<h1>
Download the whole podcast.
</h1>
<p>
Feeling evil… Assume that there’s a podcast with a feed and you want to
download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.
</p>
<p>
First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we’re
going to need it in the next statement.
</p>
<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>
<p>
Then, get every enclosure:
</p>
<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>–continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume
downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes
already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That’s what I’m
hoping for, in any case.
</p>
<p>
The <code>–remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote
name. This is what most people would expect, I think.
</p>
<p>
You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular
expressions. I’m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!
</p>
<p>
I’m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing,
so it is what it is.

<p>date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Let’s do another Bull Mancuso comic strip! In this version Ms Mancuso is
a professor at Harvard Law School, teaching a class on contract law.
She’s a former Supreme Court clerk and has been considered for a high
court appointment herself. She drinks Starbuck’s, which she gets from a
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3818612,-71.1198074,3a,75y,313.45h,86.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ss6IPyoxMNQaPkqRfO8TULg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">store
on Mass Ave</a> in Cambridge, just across from the Law School campus.
Her students all have tremendous respect for her. Just a few panels of
her giving an informative caffeine-enhanced lecture.
</p>
<p>
I was given two comic strips to choose from, and I went with the first,
because it’s closest to what I was thinking of! It looks like a Harvard
