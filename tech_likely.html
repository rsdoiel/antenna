id="google-is-bringing-fuchsia-os-to-android-devices-but-not-in-the-way-youd-think">Google
is bringing Fuchsia OS to Android devices, but not in the way you’d
think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>To evolve Fuchsia beyond smart home devices, Google has been working
on projects such as Starnix to run unmodified Linux binaries on Fuchsia
devices. In addition, since late April of this year, Google has been
working on a new project called “microfuchsia” that aims to make Fuchsia
bootable on existing devices via virtualization. Microfuchsia, according
to Google, is a Fuchsia OS build that targets virtual machines and is
designed to be bootable in virtualization solutions such as QEMU and
pKVM. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority The goal here might be,
according to Mishaal Rahman, might be to use this new microfuchsia thing
to replace the stripped-down Android version that’s currently being used
inside Android’s pKVM to run certain secured workloads. Relevant patches
have been submitted to both the Fuchsia and Android side of things for
this very purpose. At this point, it really seems that Google’s grand
ambitions with Fuchsia simply didn’t survive the massive employee
culling, with leadership probably reasoning that Android and Chrome OS
are good enough, and that replacing them with something homegrown and
possibly more suited – speculation, of course – simply isn’t worth the
investment in both time and money. It probably makes sense from a
financial standpoint, but it’s still sad.</p>

id="apple-bows-to-russian-censorship-once-more-removes-vpn-apps-from-russian-app-store">Apple
bows to Russian censorship once more, removes VPN apps from Russian App
Store</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I broke the news that Mozilla had removed several
anti-censorship Firefox extensions from its store in Russia, and a few
days later I also broke the news they reversed course on their decision
and reinstated the extensions. Perhaps not worthy of a beauty prize, as
a Dutch saying goes, but at least the turnaround time was short, and
they did the right thing in the end. Well, let’s see how Apple is going
to deal with the exact same situation. Novaya Gazeta Europe reports that
bowing under pressure from the same Russian censors that targeted
Mozilla, the company has removed a whole slew of VPN applications used
by Russians to evade the stringent totalitarian censorship laws in the
warmongering nation. Apple has removed several apps offering virtual
private network (VPN) services from the Russian AppStore, following a
request from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, independent news
outlet Mediazona reported on Thursday. The VPN services removed by Apple
include leading services such as ProtonVPN, Red Shield VPN, NordVPN and
Le VPN. Those living in Russia will no longer be able to download the
services, while users who already have them on their phones can continue
using them, but will be unable to update them. ↫ Novaya Gazeta Europe
Apple has a long history of falling in line with the demands from
dictators and totalitarian regimes, and Russia is no stranger to telling
Apple what to do. Earlier this year, Apple was ordered to remove an
application developed by the team of the murdered opposition figure
Alexey Navalny, and of course, Apple rolled over and complied. Much like
Apple’s grotesque suck-up behaviour in China, This stands in stark
contrast to Apple’s whining, complaining, and tantrums in the European
Union. It seems Apple finds it more comfortable to operating under
dictators than in democracies.</p>

<h2 id="psion-opl-when-we-owned-our-devices">Psion OPL: when we owned
our devices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>We talked about Psion last week, and we’re talking about Psion again
this week. This time, Kian Ryan highlights a very important capability
of Psion’s devices, a capability that’s entirely absent from today’s
mobile devices: a built-in IDE and dedicated programming language so you
can write code and build applications, including ones with a graphical
user interface, right on the device. All Psion devices could run OPL,
either preinstalled on the device or via a DATAPAK memory card. It’s a
BASIC-esque programming language, and while you could develop OPL
programs on your PC in DOS, Psion devices also shipped with an IDE
preinstalled so you could get just as much done on the device itself.
Back then, this wasn’t particularly unique, but these days, mobile
devices have become so locked-down and dumb that developing applications
on-device is basically a non-starter. Which can’t be said about my
current mobile. My mobile is a great device to consume content on, but
it has no built in tools to extend its functionality. If I want to build
an application for it, I have to use another computer to download a
build environment, build the application, sign it, and then transfer the
packaged app to my phone. On the Psion, all the tools are right there,
on my home screen. It does feel like we’re missing an opportunity here.
↫ Kian Ryan They’re entirely right, of course. Our current mobile
devices are faster and technically more capable than ever, but extending
the functionality of your smartphone using the smartphone itself by
writing and compiling code on it is far more cumbersome than it was in
the past. Even my Psion Organiser II LZ64, from 1986, has OPL on it, and
if I took the time to relearn the basic BASIC I once knew, I could
probably still program something useful on it today, almost 40 years
later, without being gatekept by anyone, and without needing any other
device. That’s something quite magical that we’ve lost, and that’s
sad.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a bunch of small projects involving
microcontrollers. Currently a lot of them are based around the Raspberry
Pi Pico boards because I like the development experience of those a lot.
They have a decent SDK and cheap hardware to get started and the
debugger works with gdb/openocd so it just integrates in all IDEs that
support that. One of my current projects is making a fancy hardware
controller for a bunch of video equipment I use. The main things that
will be controlled are two PTZ cameras (those are cameras that have
motors to move them). One stationary camera and the video switching
equipment that that’s hooked up to. ↫ Martijn Braam There’s more to
building something like this than connecting up hardware components –
there’s also software that needs to be taken care of. In this case, the
author is weighing several real-time operating systems for use in the
project, namely FreeRTOS, NuttX, and Zephyr. If you’re working on a
similar project, this article may help in choosing the RTOS that’s right
for you.</p>

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m originally from Ukraine, I grew up there and finished university.
Moved out in 2010 to explore the world. Since 2014 US was my home base.
</p>
<p>
I’m software engineer by trade. It was my education and first I worked
as a programmer because it was my career choice. But sometime around
2011 I fell in love with the web and programming. I worked at several
startups and few bigger tech companies and also created countless side
projects.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I created my personal site around 2013. It is 10+ years old. I think I
created it during the period when I was falling in love with programming
and ideas behind web and the Internet. I got exposed to them way later
in my life than people who grew up in Western Europe or US. I had a lot
of personal revelations at that time in my life.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
Super simple. I discovered that writing feels “painful” for me. I really
do struggle. The only way that works for me is to remove editing part
and also write in the “stream of consciousness style”. I write stuff in
one go. I write some essay in Apple Notes and it gets published
automatically to my site while I’m writing it. I might reread it some
time later and edit few things - but usually I don’t do that and just
discover some typos years later.
</p>
<p>
Another important thing is that I mostly write on topics I don’t want to
think anymore. Writing is the final step of thinking over something for
me. I write down about some topic, publish it and then don’t think about
that again for a while.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I wrote decent amount of essays on airplanes and trains. They are
uncomfortable physically, but I found them to be a great time to write
and to speed up the travel, Internet is flaky and I have space to
reflect. I also like to write(and program) in coffeeshops. I like noise
and I can usually fully block it out.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I’m software engineer. I always made custom stacks for my personal site.
For the past 2 years my website is powered by a small tool I made. It’s
a tool that publishes Apple Notes to my site. It’s called Montaigne.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I want to say: start even earlier. But that is also difficult because I
do feel that I didn’t have much to say before I was 25 yo and also I
didn’t discover my “voice”. But I think trying writing helps to discover
that voice.
</p>
<p>
Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good.
I collected many over the years and sometimes I open some and read and
get surprised with some insights I got. It’s a very interesting feeling.
</p>
<p>
I feel like even now I don’t capture most of the insights I have during
the year. So writing more is always a good advice.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
I think people should do what they feel is good for them. If you are in
the position where you want/need to monetize - do that. If money is not
critical, do not do it. Eg write for yourself first. On top of that
there might be some second order unpredictable benefits to writing. Eg
someone would reach out to you and would offer a job or collaboration.
This is way better than money(if you don’t need them).
</p>
<p>
Hard to say how much does it cost to run my site since it runs using the
tool that I made. But for other people this tool is free:)
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://tyler.cafe">tyler.cafe</a> - simplicity of the design,
color scheme, gradient background. It’s so lovely.

<h2 id="david-rosenthal-on-the-x-windowing-systems-40th-birthday">David
Rosenthal on the X Windowing System’s 40th birthday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>David Rosenthal, one of the primary contributors to the X Windowing
System, has published an awesome blog post about the recent 40 year
anniversary of X, full of details about the early days of X development,
as well as the limitations they had to deal with, the choices they had
to make, and the environment in which they were constrained. Once at Sun
I realized that it was more important for the company that the Unix
world standardized on a single window system than that the standard be
Sun’s NeWS system. At C-MU I had already looked into X as an alternative
to the Andrew window system, so I knew it was the obvious alternative to
NeWS. Although most of my time was spent developing NeWS, I rapidly
ported X version 10 to the Sun/1, likely the second port to non-DEC
hardware. It worked, but I had to kludge several areas that depended on
DEC-specific hardware. The worst was the completely DEC-specific
keyboard support. Because it was clear that a major redesign of X was
needed to make it portable and in particular to make it work well on Sun
hardware, Gosling and I worked with the teams at DEC SRC and WRL on the
design of X version 11. Gosling provided significant input on the
imaging model, and I designed the keyboard support. As the
implementation evolved I maintained the Sun port and did a lot of
testing and bug fixing. All of which led to my trip to Boston to pull
all-nighters at MIT finalizing the release. ↫ David Rosenthal They were
clearly right. During those days, the UNIX world was using a variety of
windowing systems, all tied to various companies and platforms.
Standardising virtually the entire UNIX world on X aided in keeping UNIX
compatible-ish even in the then-new graphical era, and X’s enduring
existence to this very day is evidence of the fact they made a lot of
right choices early on. Rosenthal also explains why one of the main
alternatives to X, Sun’s PostScript-based NeWS, which was also
co-developed by Rosenthal, didn’t win out over X. It had several things
working against its adoptions and popularisation, such as Sun requiring
a license fee for the source code, its heftier system requirements, and
the fact it was more difficult to program for. After trying to create
what Rosenthal describes as a “ghastly kludge” by combining NeWS and X
into Xnews, Sun eventually killed it altogether. Of course, this
wouldn’t be restrospective of X without mentioning Wayland. We and Jobs
were wrong about the imaging model, for at least two reasons. First,
early on pixels were in short supply and applications needed to make the
best use of the few they were assigned. They didn’t want to delegate
control to the PostScript interpreter. Second, later on came GPUs with
3D imaging models. The idea of a one-size-fits-all model became
obsolete. The reason that Wayland should replace X11 is that it is
agnostic to the application’s choice of imaging model. ↫ David Rosenthal
This is about as close to a blessing from the original X Windowing
System developers you’re ever going to get, but Rosenthal does correctly
note that XWayland is a thing, and since not every application is going
to be rewritten to support Wayland, X will most likely be around for a
long time to come. In fact, he looks towards the future, and predicts
that we’ll definitely be celebrating 50 years of X, and that yes, people
will still be using it by then.</p>

lets customers block AI bots, scrapers and crawlers with a single
click</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems the dislike for machine learning runs deep. In a blog post,
Cloudflare has announced that blocking machine learning scrapers is so
popular, they decided to just add a feature to the Cloudflare dashboard
that will block all machine learning scrapers with a single click. We
hear clearly that customers don’t want AI bots visiting their websites,
and especially those that do so dishonestly. To help, we’ve added a
brand new one-click to block all AI bots. It’s available for all
customers, including those on the free tier. To enable it, simply
navigate to the Security &gt; Bots section of the Cloudflare dashboard,
and click the toggle labeled AI Scrapers and Crawlers. ↫ Cloudflare blog
According to Cloudflare, 85% of their customers block machine learning
scrapers from taking content from their websites, and that number
definitely does not surprise me. People clearly understand that
multibillion dollar megacorporations freely scraping every piece of
content on the web for their own further obscene enrichment while giving
nothing back – in fact, while charging us for it – is inherently wrong,
and as such, they choose to block them from doing so. Of course, it
makes sense for Cloudflare to try and combat junk traffic, so this is
one of those cases where the corporate interests of Cloudflare actually
line up with the personal interests of its customers, so making blocking
machine learning scrapers as easy as possible benefits both parties. I
think OSNews, too, makes use of Cloudflare, so I’m definitely going to
ask OSNews’ owner to hit that button. Cloudflare further details that a
lot of people are blocking crawlers run by companies like Amazon,
Google, and OpenAI, but completely miss far more active crawlers like
those run by the Chinese company ByteDance, probably because those
companies don’t dominate the “AI” news cycle. Then there’s the massive
number of machine learning crawlers that just straight-up lie about
their intentions, trying to hide the fact they’re machine learning bots.
We fear that some AI companies intent on circumventing rules to access
content will persistently adapt to evade bot detection. We will continue
to keep watch and add more bot blocks to our AI Scrapers and Crawlers
rule and evolve our machine learning models to help keep the Internet a
place where content creators can thrive and keep full control over which
models their content is used to train or run inference on. ↫ Cloudflare
blog I find this particularly funny because what’s happening here is
machine learning models being used to block… Machine learning models.
Give it a few more years down the trajectory we’re currently on, and the
internet will just be bots reading content posted by other bots.</p>

C and C++ development on Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>The article’s from 2021, but I think it’s still worth discussing. A
hard reality of C and C++ software development on Windows is that there
has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation
for the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying
host facilities in order to ease portable software development. On
Windows, C and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces
that most portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work
perfectly elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside
of the English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly
political, originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which
adds insult to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s
wrong, and some easy techniques to deal with it in portable software. ↫
Chris Wellons As someone who doesn’t know how to code or program,
articles like these are always difficult to properly parse. I understand
the primary problem the article covers, but what I’m curious about is
how much of this problem is personal – skill issue – and how much of it
is a widely held belief by Windows developers and programmers. I know
there’s quite a few of you in our audience, so I’d love to hear from you
how you feel about this. The author also authored his on fix, something
called libwinsane, which I’m also curious about – is this the only
solution, or are there more options out there?</p>

2024-07-02 The importance of moderation
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> recently wrote
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>,
arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody
else, including spam and binaries. I agree with all the points made. The
idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying
all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall
of Usenet.
</p>
<p>
Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other
servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just
want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a
different net.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UUCP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to
have a username and password.
</li>
<li>
NNTP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on
IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.
</li>
<li>
Servers don’t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in
what they accept and in what they pass on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spam problem arises when two systems “trust” each other and peer
messages but one of the systems doesn’t act on abuse and moderation
reports. Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system
administrators so they stopped following up on those reports. Perhaps
some servers had become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances seem
too big to defederate from.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up on
an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post
shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users
that I don’t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me. I
can block them all individually or block the large instance including my
small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet. It was the lack of moderation that
killed Usenet. It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able
to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant. In the end, to all these
people federation was not as important as moderation.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with
people that needed moderation. This is a problem on all platforms with
groups, e.g. Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their
niches. At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again. IRC,
Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and
self-moderation was viable.
</p>
<p>
This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of
federation are the most important quality of a platform.
</p>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.

Ah, that’s not a super new post, it’s from September 2023. I dug it out
again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome. It
uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand things
correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not quite the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s a bad thing that I’ve being hesitant to defederate from m.soc
even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I’ve been getting
from email fro the past several years.
</p>
<p>
But I’m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don’t work the way people think.)
</p>
<p>
On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to mirror
the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what would be
necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring the entirety
of all the non-banned servers), I’d have to deal with thousands of
messages. My server would croak.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because on
there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I had
to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I’m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren’t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn’t work like that I’m not sure it even would be federated.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

my small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban
since every instance was expected to carry everything.
</p>
<p>
Individual blocks is one way around it. That’s why I, a small instance
op, while I’ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to ban
the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li’l lower
since I don’t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize “safe space”
instances would ban m.soc for example.
</p>
<p>
Also I “silence” every instance since I don’t have a “whole known
network” tab.
</p>
<p>
Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there was
<em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.
</p>
<p>
More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I’m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li’l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)
</p>
<p>
That problem, summarized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled over,
through following or commenting
</li>
<li>
So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of those
posts
</li>
<li>
Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like “I wanna
see all of Marie’s <code>#tidying</code> posts” or “I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends
<code>#mosstodon</code> posts” or even for filtering out stuff. I.e.
it’s OK as a tool for <em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em>
</li>
<li>
It’s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for “emulating
channels” which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked
there since those are centralized
</li>
<li>
For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would have
to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.
</li>
<li>
There was an effort in that direction early on, with the “relay” system.
</li>
<li>
But small servers would croak. <strong>That’s</strong> the problem. It’d
be an environmental waste heap.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that’s absolutely a protocol level problem!
</p>
<p>
A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I’ve got to add that not literally
<em>every</em> server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some
didn’t carry Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code>
hierarchy. But that’s the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" />
</p>
<p>
So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the “only send the relevant posts” nature of mailing lists,
and the “we’re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it once
in the SQL” nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy server is
subscribed to <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="garderning">@garderning</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="foo.bar">@foo.bar</span></code>, like an email user might be
subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy of that
group since it’s getting those messages anyway. It’s not perfect and
we’re still paying a hefty “decentralization tax”, but it’s more robust
than mail and news.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet
irrelevant.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the cost
(and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was the
nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.
</p>
<p>
Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed
although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)
</p>
<p>
But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn’t be nearly enough to fix that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Email can’t moderate their users since email isn’t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban someone
who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance banning is
very common on email.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Last time I talked about this I got the world’s most stubborn reply guy
on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use hashtags to
find at least some amount of interesting posts and was resistant to
change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my server would
croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about “scalability is only for
capitalists”.
</p>
<p>
Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they’re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.
</p>
<p>
My criticism of Usenet’s protocol here has nothing to do with capitalist
scaling, which is about “throwing computers at it”. Sure, that’d be one
solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other communities),
and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small overlapping villages
instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral channel.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that’s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).
</p>
<p>
Here are three network layouts:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" />
</p>
<p>
First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient way
to organize an “everyone-must-see-everything” protocol, but vulnerable
to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions, billionaire
takeovers, or earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it’s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why since
there’s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything for
everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is
super efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.
</p>
<p>
Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of “nearby”
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That’s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that’s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed, and
that’s what would be “needed” for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery to
“work”.
</p>

Here’s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community need
to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy
and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo company
would never in a million years set up a system like this because it’s
too wasteful ever for them, while we’re liable to do so since each
instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for the
network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization because for
them, the power consolidation in the first two network types is a
positive, while for us it’s a huge negative so we’re drawn to the third
type, so we need to be really careful and really responsible here.
</p>
<p>
But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it’s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see
everything. It’s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are sent
to my instance, I don’t mirror the entire server. It’s actually pretty
awesome! It’s good for moderation too because I only need to moderate my
“neighborhood”. Yeah, a “neighborhood” is the perfect analogy for this;
neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still small and managed. A
system set up like that can remain smol and cozy even as it invites
everyone on Earth. It’s great. ActivityPub is awesome.

<p>Another month, another report from the Redox team. The Rust-based
operating system saw another active month, including getting a whole
bunch of new funding deals for specific features, such as adding
UNIX-style signals to Redox, as well as the further development of
Termion, a Redox project that is “a pure Rust, bindless library for
low-level handling, manipulating and reading information about
terminals”. Furthermore, the default user interface Orbital got a small
makeover with new colours and a new default wallpaper, and there’s the
usual documentation and website improvements. More substantial are
doubling the performance of RedoxFS by improving the speed of block
reads and writes, and changes in how the xHCI drivers works to
drastically reduce CPU usage. The PCI/PCIe and x86 VirtIO drivers has
also been improved, and you can now do userspace debugging using the GNU
Debugger from outside the VM. There’s a lot more, so head on over to

<h2 id="how-dot-matrix-printers-created-text">How dot matrix printers
created text</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The impact printer was a mainstay of the early desktop computing era.
Also called “dot matrix printers,” these printers could print
low-resolution yet very readable text on a page, and do so quickly and
at a low price point. But these printers are a relic of the past; in
2024, you might find them printing invoices or shipping labels, although
more frequently these use cases have been replaced by other types of
printers such as thermal printers and laser printers. The heart of the
impact printer is the print head. The print head contained a column of
pins (9 pins was common) that moved across the page. Software in the
printer controlled when to strike these pins through an inked ribbon to
place a series of “dots” on a page. By carefully timing the pin strikes
with the movement of the print head, the printer could control where
each dot was placed. A column of dots might represent the vertical
stroke of the letter H, a series of single dots created the horizontal
bar, and another column would create the final vertical stroke. ↫ Jim
Hall at Technically We Write Our first printer was a dot matrix model,
from I think a brand called Star or something similar. Back then, in
1991 or so, a lot of employers in The Netherlands offered programs
wherein employees could buy computers through their work, offered at a
certain discount. My parents jumped on the opportunity when my mom’s
employer offered such a program, and through it, we bought a brand new
286 machine running MS-DOS and Windows 3.0, and it included said dot
matrix printer. There’s something about the sound and workings of a dot
matrix printer that just can’t be bested by modern ink, laser, or LED
printers. The mechanical punching, at such a fast rate it sounded like a
tiny Gatling gun, was mesmerising, especially when paired with
continuous form paper. Carefully ripping off the perforated edges of the
paper after printing was just a nice bonus that entertained me quite a
bit as a child. I was surprised to learn that dot matrix printers are
still being manufactured and sold today, and even comes in colour.
They’re quite a bit more expensive than other printer types these days,
but I have a feeling they’re aimed at enterprises and certain niches,
which probably means they’re going to be of considerably higher quality
than all the other junk printers that clog the market. With a bit more
research, it might actually be possible to find a brand new colour dot
matrix printer that is a better choice than some of the modern
alternatives. The fact that I’m not contemplating buying a brand new dot
matrix printer in 2024, even though I rarely print, is a mildly worrying
development.</p>

<p>Microsoft Defender is the endpoint security solution preinstalled on
every Windows machine since Windows 7. It’s a fairly complex piece of
software, addressing both EDR and EPP use cases. As such, Microsoft
markets two different products. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a
cloud based endpoint security solution that combines sensor capabilities
with the advantages of a cloud processing. Microsoft Defender Antivirus
(MDA), on the other hand, is a modern EPP enabled by default on any
fresh Windows installation. MDA is the focus of this analysis. ↫

Well this was a fabulous talk, and went into the subtle problems I had
struggled with in the past (assume memory bound vs load) and I am now
quite happy with my new gained understanding.

<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>An interesting blog post. I liked this note about trees in
Johannesburg by Herman. In our last apartment, the bedroom faced a quiet
tree-filled backyard despite the apartment itself being on a major
two-way avenue, so I woke up to birds chirping and almost non-existent
street noise, and a view of lush greenery. In our current apartment, the
bedroom faces a brick wall and a one-way side street adjacent to a
one-way main street, so now I have a classic New York wakeup call which
is horns honking, garbage trucks rattling, pigeons cooing and flapping,
and occasionally people walking.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>R9 is a work-in-progress effort to build a Plan 9 kernel to Rust. It
was started a couple years back by the maintainers of the Harvey OS
distribution of Plan 9, who threw in the towel after “loss of traction”.
R9 is a reimplementation of the plan9 kernel in Rust. It is not only
inspired by but in many ways derived from the original Plan 9 source
code. ↫ R9OS GitHub page For now, the project is obviously mostly
focused on running in virtual machines, specifically Qemu, in which it
can be run using a variety of architectures: aarch64, x86-64 (with or
without kvm), and RISC-V.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-hardening">2024-07-02 SSH hardening</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-02-ssh-hardening">
2024-07-02 SSH hardening
</h1>
<p>
Today I decided to harden my SSH server configuration and did the one
thing you should never do: I logged out before testing the new
configuration and promptly locked myself. Don’t be like me.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wanted to do: Positron Security’s
<a href="https://www.sshaudit.com/">SSH Configuration Auditor</a> gave
me a B+ grade and there were
<a href="https://www.sshaudit.com/hardening_guides.html#debian_12">some
suggestions</a>. I had already implemented some of them because a long
time ago I had followed
<a href="https://disknotifier.com/blog/simple-ssh-security/">a different
SSH hardening guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
The thing that broke my setup is that the new hardening guide specified
the following:
</p>
<pre><code>RequiredRSASize 3072
</code></pre>
<p>
The effect was that I could no longer log in:
</p>
<pre><code>alex@alexschroeder.ch: Permission denied (publickey).
</code></pre>
<p>
That’s because I have passwords disabled. You can only get in via public
key. And my public key wasn’t good enough: it has 2048 bits:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -lf .ssh/id_rsa
2048 SHA256:************/****************************** alex@Megabombus.local (RSA)
</code></pre>
<p>
So what I had to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Visit the hosting provider’s website
</li>
<li>
Enable VNC
</li>
<li>
Open a “NoVNC” window
</li>
<li>
Enable login using passwords without having access to Shift or Control
keys (wtf?)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That meant commenting these two in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>
<p>
Restarted <code>sshd</code> on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
I already had an <code>ed25519</code> identity:
</p>
<pre><code>ls .ssh/id* 
.ssh/id_ed25519  .ssh/id_ed25519.pub  .ssh/id_rsa  .ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>
<p>
I probably created them using the following:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</code></pre>
<p>
I used <code>ssh-copy</code> to copy them to the server:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519 sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added the correct setting to my <code>.ssh/config</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>Host sibirocobombus
  HostName alexschroeder.ch
  Port 882
  User alex
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</code></pre>
<p>
I use the <code>ssh</code> config file all the time!
</p>
<p>
This allowed me to uncomment these two in
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> again:
</p>
<pre><code>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>
<p>
I restarted <code>sshd</code> on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Note to self: Should I ever need to check the server fingerprints, see
<a href="ssh">ssh</a>.
</p>
<p>
My <code>git</code> server needed the same public key in
<code>/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.

<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/02/193103.html">two</a> podcasts
for today.
</p>
<p>
It started out being one podcast, but I hit the wrong button after 14
minutes and ended up with two audio files instead of one.
</p>
<p>
I don’t like editing, so you get two for the price of one. :-)
</p>
<p>
It’s a rambler, starts out with me talking about
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811">Elie
Mystal</a> on abortion and slavery.
</p>
<p>
The second podcast explains how we’re in a war, and it’s about time we
recognized it as such.
</p>
<p>
We need the Democrats to do what we elected them to do, save the
freaking United States, which by the way after yesterday’s decision by
the Supreme Court, doesn’t really exist any longer. We go into that in
the second episode.
</p>
<p>
It’s not enough to win the election. We have to get the Supreme Court
back to a semblance of what it was. They’re behaving in a way that’s
inconsistent with the continued existence of the country they’re
supposed to be part of the government of.
</p>
<p>
But we can have a laugh along the way. The world hasn’t completely
fallen apart, <i>yet.</i> <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
14 minutes.

Commission shoots down Facebook’s “pay or consent” model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union’s Digital Markets Act is the gift that keeps on
giving. This time, it’s Facebook’s turn to be slapped on the fingers
with a ruler – a metric ruler, of course – because of its malicious
compliance with the DMA. Today, the Commission has informed Meta of its
preliminary findings that its “pay or consent” advertising model fails
to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). In the Commission’s
preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the
combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less
personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks. ↫
European Commission press release The European Commission’s preliminary
conclusion takes issue with Facebook’s binary choice between “pay for
zero ads” and “full-on tracking and all the ads”. According to the DMA,
Facebook must offer users the option of an equivalent experience with
less tracking, and the company doesn’t offer such an option to users. In
addition, Facebook’s proposal does not allow users to “exercise their
right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data”. It’s
important to note that this is not some sort of definitive ruling of
finding; it’s preliminary, and Facebook now has the opportunity to state
its case and formulate its arguments. If the eventual ruling is that
Facebook does not comply, the company is liable for fines up to 10% of
its yearly worldwide turnover, which can rise up to 20% for repeated
infractions.</p>

Ansible on a RISC-V computer</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ansible runs on Python, and Python runs on... well pretty much &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Including newer RISC-V machines.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But Ansible has a lot of dependencies, and some of these dependencies
have caused frustration from time to time on x86 and Arm (so having
issues with a dependency is just a way of life when you enter
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency
hell</a>)… but in this case, for the past few months, I’ve never had
luck installing Ansible from PyPI (Python’s Package Index) on any RISC-V
system, using <code>pip install ansible</code>.
</p>
<p>
I prefer installing this way (rather than compiling from source or from
system packages) because it generally gets the latest version of
Ansible, with an easy upgrade/downgrade path. It’s also easy to add
<code>ansible</code> to a Python <code>requirements.txt</code> file and
install it alongside other package dependencies.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, the <code>cryptography</code> library, which requires a Rust
compiler to build if the package is not already built for a particular
system, has made it difficult to install Ansible from <code>pip</code>:

<li>
Arrest the members of the Supreme Court who just voted for the new rule
about presidential immunity.

Nominate six replacements, sorry no Repubs this time.

Once they’re installed, they hold an emergency session to restore Roe v

<h1 id="2024-06-28-biden">
2024-06-28 Biden
</h1>
<p>
When I see all this talk about Biden and the US elections I keep
thinking: almost all that matters is that Biden has a vice president
that can take over as soon as things break down. I still remember
thinking when Biden got elected: this guy has nothing; he is the most
boring and conflict averse choice. And this was exactly what the US
needed. And it’s what the US still needs. A boring candidate whose
administration gets stuff done.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the US also needs a lot of other things: reforms, policy
changes, and on and on. And you can have both! Do not vote for the
fascist and keep the criticism up. So I can say: racism, Israel,
Ukraine, immigration, gerrymandering, gun control, Snowden… work on all
these things!! Do it! But just because I’m unhappy about the lack of
progress does not mean you should abstain or vote for a fascist.
</p>
<p>
The fact that both candidates are old white men is a shame, yes of
course! But it is not a reason to hand power to the fascists.
</p>
<p>
And often things can get done at the local level. The Swiss based their
constitution on the US constitution (senate, congress, states,
federalism) and I know that what is impossible to achieve at the
national level can sometimes be achieved at the state level, and what
cannot be achieved at the state level can be achieved at the city level,
in the community, in the library, at the bar, at home.
</p>
<p>
Wherever things are not first past the post you can kick Democrats where
it hurts and beat them. And then, perhaps, one day, things will get
better.
</p>
<p>
Then again, here in Switzerland percentages go up and down here and
there and yet one feels that nothing really changes. It’s hard and
people aren’t as social I would prefer them to be.
</p>
<p>
I do like flowers and trees and birds and amphibians and bees and ants
and marine mammals and bison and many other things, though. The help me
through the dark times.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23USA">#USA</a>

<p>
<strong>2024-07-02</strong>. I found following
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke" title="@mekkaokereke@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mekkaokereke">@mekkaokereke</span></a> eye
to be quite interesting. He says stuff like the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quote from the Biden Trump debate. Which candidate said this, Trump or
Biden?
</p>
<p>
“I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration
has. He wants to cut the cops.”
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Biden is the candidate that needs more Black men to vote
for him, or he is likely to lose the election.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Biden is the one that pushed for and passed the 80s crime
bill.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Biden is the one that instructed cities to transfer ~$1B
of Covid relief funds to police budgets.
</p>
<p>
Y’all are betting the future of the free world on Biden being able to
say and do stuff like this, and then still get 95% of the votes of Black
men? Seriously? That’s the strategy?
</p>
<p>
Man, lemme go ahead and prepare for this next Trump term then, because
that strategy is awful.
</p>
<p>
How did y’all ever think that would work?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how he isn’t in favour of Trump. But he sure isn’t in favour of
Biden, either. The message that I’m hearing: Democrats, do better! And
by “do better”, I mean: Do better for the constituents that you expect
to vote for you.
</p>
<p>
This is what all the austerity has led to: People hate the current
government and don’t see anybody else to trust and vote for.
</p>
<p>
This is not about poor misguided undesirables voting for Trump. This is
about the Democrats not doing enough for the people that aren’t voting.

<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Online interactions are weirdly unique. They happen in shared, digital spaces—forums, chats, comment sections, social media platforms—where it’s easy to forget that more often than not, the people interacting with each other don’t share the same day-to-day reality. And sometimes that doesn’t matter. There are plenty of topics we can chat about that don’t have a connection with our lives. But there are also plenty who do have a connection and a profound one. From food to politics, from everything related to society to cultural norms. We all live in bubbles whether we like it or not. And it’s easy to forget about this fact when interacting online. Every time I stumble on someone making some wild claims about something I have to remind myself that maybe that specific thing appears wild to me because of my circumstances and it might be perfectly normal and reasonable somewhere else. And that’s why when I’m interacting with someone online I try to be both charitable in my interpretations of what others are saying and also generally curious and open-minded. Sometimes asking a question is all it takes to make a bubble pop and help a conversation move to a more interesting place.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;

<h2 id="crossmark-community-consultation-what-did-we-learn">Crossmark
community consultation: What did we learn?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In the first half of this year we’ve been talking to our community about
post-publication changes and Crossmark. When a piece of research is
published it isn’t the end of the journey—it is read, reused, and
sometimes modified. That’s why we run Crossmark, as a way to provide
notifications of important changes to research made after publication.
Readers can see if the resesarch they are looking at has updates by
clicking the Crossmark logo. They also see useful information about the
editorial process, and links to things like funding and registered
clinical trials. All of this contributes to what we call the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">integrity
of the scholarly record</a>.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/Crossmark-popup-example.png"
alt="The Crossmark popup provides information about whether a work is current and other metadata about integrity of the scholarly record." width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>
Crossmark has been around a long time and the context around it is
constantly changing. It last had a major update in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/get-ready-for-crossmark-2.0/" target="_blank">2016</a>
and in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/encouraging-even-greater-reporting-of-corrections-and-retractions/" target="_blank">2020</a>
we removed fees for its use.
</p>
<p>
The past few years have seen a more intense focus on research integrity,
leading to more retractions and calling out large-scale manipulation of
editorial processes. At the same time, we haven’t seen an increase in
the uptake of Crossmark, which is still used by only a minority of our
members. We would like to know why the uptake is low and whether there
is more we can do in this area. To dig into this, in the first part of
2024 we reached out to members of our community.
</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-do">
What did we do?
</h2>
<p>
We wanted to learn about attitudes towards Crossmark and related aspects
of research integrity. This was done in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Structured interviews with eight of our members.
</li>
<li>
Round tables at Crossref LIVE events in Bogota and Nairobi
</li>
<li>
Surveying a selection of our members, which led to 94 responses.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The topics we asked about were related to how post-publication updates
are made and communicated, and which metadata demonstrates good
practice.
</p>
<p>
We are extremely grateful to the members who contributed. They provided
valuable feedback and have helped to shape the future of Crossmark and
our approach to the integrity of the scholarly record.
</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-find">
What did we find?
</h2>
<p>
Across the various groups there were a few common themes, which fell
into several areas.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Communication of updates is highly valued, and seen as the most
important role that Crossmark can play. Some of those we spoke to would
like readers to see if there is an update as soon as a page opens,
without having to open a popup. This could be done by having a logo that
changes colour, shape, or size.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Conversely, not as much enthusiasm was shown for the metadata
assertions. These are additional fields that can be displayed to readers
in the Crossmark popup. There wasn’t a strong consensus on which
commonly-made assertions are the most important for research integrity.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There is diversity in attitudes towards making updates to published
works, what research integrity means, and approaches to workflows for
updates. Even within a single organisation, a number of different
workflows and multiple staff members might be called on to update
published research. This makes things complex and means that it can be
difficult to fit Crossmark in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are technical challenges to getting started with Crossmark. Those
responsible for implementing Crossmark are often technical staff who
struggle with the documentation we provide in English. There is also no
plugin for OJS, a widely-used open source editorial software. It is more
difficult to deposit Crossmark metadata for books than journal articles,
and many article types don’t permit Crossmark metadata at all. On the
other hand, those who successfully installed Crossmark found it easy to
use and low-maintenance.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, it seems that Crossmark still has an important role to play but
there are changes and improvements we can make.
</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
Here are the main areas we intend to follow up on in the coming months.
</p>
<h3 id="implementation">
Implementation
</h3>
<p>
We need to look at how to make implementation more straight-forward. Can
we provide multilingual documentation, plugins, run workshops or
webinars, or make changes to Crossmark to lower the barrier to entry?
</p>
<h3 id="understanding-workflows">
Understanding workflows
</h3>
<p>
Can we collaborate with our members and other organisations to reach a
better understanding of how to update published works? Are there
alternative workflows we need to support? Have we made it too difficult
to understand and implement the options we currently have?
</p>
<p>
While updates are always likely to be rare, we want to help members
understand the benefits of making them. We talked to some members who
were proud of never having published a retraction or correction, which
left us wondering whether they are missing legitimate opportunities to
correct the scholarly record. We also know that for some members and
many work types (preprints, for example), updates are made without a
separate published notification. Can we better understand the role that
the published updates play and communicate updates even if there isn’t a
published notice?
</p>
<h3 id="ongoing-feedback">
Ongoing feedback
</h3>
<p>
Clearly one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to implementing and
communicating updates. We need to find ways of keeping in touch with the
community to test new solutions with as broad a range of members as
possible. We want to avoid catering to a minority and leaving others
struggling to find ways to implement a solution.
</p>
<h3 id="custom-metadata">
Custom metadata?
</h3>
<p>
Is there an ongoing need for metadata assertions? Many of the assertions
currently made are possible as standard metadata and others could be
included in our deposit schema. We want to consider removing the option
to add assertions. This needs more feedback from the community,
especially those who currently make use of assertions.
</p>
<h3 id="redesign-the-ui">
Redesign the UI
</h3>
<p>
Crossmark doesn’t have the recognition with readers we would like. Is
there a way we can redesign it to make it more associated with Crossref
and accurate metadata? We intend to explore different designs, and test
them with members and readers.

browser goes serious: GitHub billionaire co-founder now involved</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, it seems we’ve got a better understanding now of why Andreas
Kling decided to leave the SerenityOS project to focus entirely on
Ladybird, the web browser that grew out of his hobby operating system.
They’ve got some big plans for where to take Ladybird, and I’m saying
“they” because it’s being backed by a big name. They’ve set up a fancy
new website for the project, which makes it all look a bit more
presentable to a general audience. The project is aiming for a first
alpha release for Linux and macOS in 2026, and Windows or mobile
versions are not something they’re currently interested in – they want
to get the desktop version to be presentable first. It also seems we’re
not in Kansas anymore – they’ve got four full-time paid engineers
working on Ladybird at the moment, with three more starting soon. Sure,
they’ve got some sponsors, but that seems like a lot of people, so
where’s the cash coming from? Well, the project also announced its first
two board members, and it won’t surprise you Andreas Kling himself is
one of them. The other name is none other than Chris Wanstrath, and if
that name doesn’t ring a bell – he’s the co-founder and former CEO of
GitHub, which he sold to Microsoft in 2018. He also created the Atom
text editor and led several other projects. Oh, he also happens to be a
billionaire who apparently has donated 1 million dollars to Ladybird. In
other words, the Ladybird project is a lot more of a serious, grown-up
effort than it may have seemed when Kling first announced his departure
from SerenityOS. This means the project has some serious money behind
it, an influential name with probably some great networking skills, and,
of course, Kling’s unique experience working on browser engines for
Nokia and Apple in the past. All in all, this is great news.</p>

<p>
I just did an approx 40 minute
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/jeffJarvisDiscusses.m4a">podcast</a>
interview and discussion with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>. I
know Jeff from the early days of blogging. He was one of the best
discussion leaders at BloggerCon. And he’s an accomplished author and
educator.
</p>
<p>
We talk about how to organize news for people who are information
starved by whatever it is that our news sources are doing, which is
really hard to figure out, but in the end (I argue) who cares why, we
have a problem to solve, so let’s get on with it.
</p>
<p>
I talk about the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, that’s how they
got around journalism. I’m sure that’s where we have to go, put together
what we think would be the Biden blog if the campaign was being run by
Joe and Nicco, and I’d be on board, so would Jeff, and we’d help Heather
Cox Richardson, and amplify anyone who is making sense and supports
democracy.
</p>
<p>
It could be funded by the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/01/1342.html">People’s PAC</a>, or
something like it. It wouldn’t take very much money, it’s just a blog.
But it would have powerful ideas that cut through the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/03/bullshit.m4a">bullshit</a>, and
great videos, and we’d organize marches where people show up to help
people.
</p>
<p>
And the campaign would never stop, we’d always be organizing.
</p>
<p>
This is the discussion I wanted to start.
</p>
<p>
Hope you enjoy! :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Jeff’s mike is much better than mine. Gotta work on that.

<p>In this writeup we provide a summary of technical information crucial
to evaulate the exploitability and impact of memory safety problems in
IBM i programs. As administrators and developers of IBM i aren’t
supposed to work “below MI level” this kind of information is not
officially documented by the vendor. The information presented here is
thus based on already published reverse engineering results, and our own
findings uncovered using IBM’s System Sertice Tools (SST) and the
POWER-AS specific Processor extensions we developed for the Ghidra
reverse engineering framework. Tests were performed on a physical POWER
9 system running IBM i V7R4. Programs were compiled by the default
settings of the system in the ILE program model. C language source code
will be provided separately. ↫ Silent Signal Some light reading.</p>

Connecting the laptop to the server using UUCP</h2>

<h1 id="2024-06-30-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-using-uucp">
2024-06-30 Connecting the laptop to the server using UUCP
</h1>
<p>
I recently <a href="2024-06-15-uucp">connected my server to another
server via UUCP</a>. Now I’m thinking that perhaps I’d like to connect
my laptop as another node to it. I probably don’t need it, because I
<a href="2024-06-28-nncp">connected the laptop to the server via
NNCP</a>. But still. Perhaps
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a> still wants to do
stuff via UUCP. Perhaps it is the completionist in me.
</p>
<p>
For reference, see
<a href="https://www.bortzmeyer.org/uucp-over-ssh.pdf">UUCP over SSH</a>
by
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.gougere.fr/@bortzmeyer" title="@bortzmeyer@mastodon.gougere.fr"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bortzmeyer">@bortzmeyer</span></a>. Since
we’re using SSH, there will be a key pair, and since we’re using UUCP,
we’ll still a username and password. It’s going to be both.
</p>
<p>
I know, why aren’t we using NNCP.
</p>
<p>
Generate the key pair.
</p>
<pre><code>cd /var/spool/uucp
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown uucp:uucp .ssh
cd .ssh
sudo -u uucp ssh-keygen -C &quot;uucp@melanobombus&quot; -f id_rsa
</code></pre>
<p>
The file <code>uucp-key.pub</code> now has the public key.
</p>
<p>
On the server (!), add a line to
<code>/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, replacing the public
key:
</p>
<pre><code>restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Umelanobombus -l&quot; ssh-rsa KEY_FROM_ID_RSA_PUB uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
We will be using the username <code>Umelanobombus</code> to connect to
the server. This is not a real user!
</p>
<p>
On the server, save username and password in
<code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>
<p>
On the laptop, save system name, username and the same password in
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>sibirocobombus Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>
<p>
Now we have both levels: the public and private keys that allow the
<code>uucp</code> user to connect via <code>ssh</code> – and the
username and password that is used by <code>uucp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define our own name in <code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename melanobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s add the system to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code>. That is, on the
laptop, define the server we’re going to call. Since I already know that
sibirocobombus will report itself as <code>campaignwiki</code>, I’m
setting up an <code>alias</code>. The <code>commands</code> line is
important because by default only <code>rmail</code> and
<code>rnews</code> are allowed but I want to allow <code>rsmtp</code>,
too. The <code>chat</code> script waits for the “Password:” prompt and
then sends it. Note that this chat script is much shorter than the one
used in “UUCP over SSH”, linked above. Apparently there’s no “Login:”
prompt on my server so I had to change it.
</p>
<pre><code>system sibirocobombus
alias campaignwiki
commands rmail rnews rsmtp
call-login *
call-password *
time any
chat Password: \P
chat-timeout 30
protocol i
port ssh_campaignwiki
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the new port to <code>etc/uucp/port</code>. Note that I’m listening
to incoming <code>ssh</code> connections on a non-standard port so I
have to provide. Also note that here we’re defining the
<code>uucp</code> “port” with a non-standard <code>ssh</code> “port”.
Just in case you’re not already confused.
</p>
<pre><code>port ssh_campaignwiki
type pipe
command /usr/bin/ssh -a -x -q -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
reliable true
protocol etyig
</code></pre>
<p>
Before doing our first test, make sure that the server is a “known host”
on the laptop, for the <code>uucp</code> user. Note how I am not using
<code>-q</code> because I want to see the prompt!
</p>
<p>
The password to give on the prompt is the one in
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org

On the client:

<p>
Let’s check the log.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like when things don’t work:

<p>
You can try to replace <code>-q</code> with <code>-v</code> in
<code>/etc/uucp/port</code> in order to see what <code>ssh</code> has to
say.
</p>
<p>
If you try again, the log says that the system is not ready to try
again:

<p>
Force a call and check the log again.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -S sibirocobombus

<p>
You might be specifying the wrong login, or using the wrong chat script.
On the server, the log might look as follows:

<p>
Check the passwords:
</p>

<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code> on the laptop says what username and
password to use
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code> on the server says what username and
password to accept, separated by a TAB (!)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check the system:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop says what the client is
called
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the laptop says what the server is called
and how to connect to it, using what port
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/port</code> on the laptop describes that port
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server says what the client is called,
what username to expect
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check the login again, by going through it by hand. Check whether the
chat script would have worked.

too. But I know there’s interesting data here, how people are connected
to people. I’m still trying to figure out how to make a browser that
engages the mind in that. It can take a long time to figure these things
out. I had the basic idea for a blog in 1994, but it wasn’t until 1999
that we really had it figured out and implemented for non-techies. This

vierzig europäischen Organisationen, die sich für Bürgerrechte und

Shout out to whoever at this block of flats decided to fly a Canadian

really my thing but it still put a, uh, smirk on my face as I walked
home from the shops.

Caught up with an old friend for lunch today, which has put me in a real
good mood :) Need to make sure to do this more often, and not get so
caught up in the endless “life” grind. It’d be nice if seeing friends
was still as easy as bumping into them at school/wherever, but it’s not,
so, making the effort is worth it, haha.

<h2 id="on-being-humble-and-accepting-success">On being humble and
accepting success</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There’s a subtle difference between being humble and pretending to be something you’re not. If you are successful in some field you can—and should—recognise your success while still being humble and not letting the success make you arrogant. I find that not doing that, not recognising your success in any shape or form, can grind me in the wrong way. Because at some point you start to feel disingenuous. &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
People and Blog is a passion project. It’s not a “successful” project by
any metric. Combining RSS, Email and the site, it probably has a few
thousand readers. And don’t get me wrong, it’s great. I’m grateful for
that and I’ll continue to post these interviews for as long as I can. 71
incredibly <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">kind people</a>
have also decided to contribute some of their money to support it and
that’s also something I’m very appreciative of.
</p>
<p>
Still, I think of P&amp;B as a very niche side project, far from being a
successful one. Now let’s imagine that instead of a few thousand, the
P&amp;B audience was a few hundreds of thousands and instead of 71
people, 7000 were contributing something every month. At the current
average that would net me almost 16000$ a month. That’s around 200k a
year and it would make me in the top 0.5% of earners here in Italy.
Could I still go around claiming my project was not successful? Hell no.
I’d be a hypocrite if I were to do that. And you’d be rightfully pissed
at me if I were still nudging you to support for 1$ a month while also
being part of the 1%.
</p>
<p>
I find it interesting that the pursuit of endless growth is something we
despise when corporations are doing it but it’s not something that
bothers us too much when it’s done by “content creators”. And yet, after
a certain scale, it’s the same mindset. This is why I love to support
small creators who do things simply because they enjoy it and are not
driven by other incentives.
</p>
<p>
I love something <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik">Om said
in his interview </a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I love supporting the small media, but don’t have time for establishment
media outlets. I don’t much care for some of the larger blogs as well.
And same goes for the larger YouTubers and podcasts. You need to catch
them early — that’s when they really are pure and hustling to serve the
reader.
</p>

GHC 9.6.6 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-07-01
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.6.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are
available on the <a href="/download_ghc_9_6_6.html">release page</a>.
</p>
<p>
This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues found
in the 9.6 series. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A fix for a bug in the NCG that could lead to incorrect runtime results
due to erroneously removing a jump instruction
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).
</li>
<li>
A fix for a linker error that manifested on certain platform/toolchain
combinations, particularly darwin with a brew provisioned toolchain,
arising due to a confusion in linker options between GHC and cabal
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>).
</li>
<li>
A fix for a compiler panic in the simplifier due to incorrect eta
expansion
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24718">#24718</a>).
</li>
<li>
A fix for possible segfaults when using the bytecode interpreter due to
incorrect constructor tagging
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24870">#24870</a>).
</li>
<li>
And a few more fixes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.6/docs/users_guide/9.6.6-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are

<h2 id="psycopg-3.2-released">Psycopg 3.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
After 846 commits and close to two years in the making, we are very
happy to announce the release of
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/">Psycopg 3.2</a>!
</p>
<p>
This release adds several new features to the Psycopg 3 line, some of
which are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
support for Numpy scalar types
</li>
<li>
easier to use notifications reception
</li>
<li>
the possibility to run queries with PostgreSQL-format parameters
</li>
<li>
a row factory to return a scalar from a query
</li>
<li>
asynchronous, encrypted cancellations
</li>
<li>
support for the many new features added in the upcoming PostgreSQL v17
</li>
<li>
OpenSSL 3.x bundled with binary packages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A few bug bug fixes are included too, which have also been independently
released in the 3.1.20 package. Given the high level of compatibility
between 3.1 and 3.2, this could be the last release of the 3.1 line.
</p>
<p>
For further details please check out:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

notes</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/06/30/psycopg-32-released/">news
entry</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please note that several new features in the 3.2 release require libpq
v17, but, because PostgreSQL version 17 has not been released yet, they
are not immediately available in the binary packages. In order to use
these features you will need a development version of libpq 17 on your
system and to use the Python or C source distribution. New packages
bundling libpq v17 will be released as soon as the official PostgreSQL
17 has been released.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much to everyone who contributed to the project,
especially to Denis Laxalde from
<a href="https://www.dalibo.com/">Dalibo</a>, indefatigable libpq
explorer and always available to solve challenging problems!

Psycopg, first v2, now v3, is the de-facto standard for the
communication between Python and PostgreSQL, two major components of
innumerable businesses and mission-critical infrastructures. Maintaining
such a critical library to the highest standard of reliability,
completeness, performance requires a lot of care and work.

<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - June 22, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This is a maintenance release that fixes two bugs in the restore
process.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix double copy statements when a table name requires to be quoted.
</li>
<li>
Fix error when restoring a table with a GENERATED ALWAYS column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

<h2 id="greenmask-v0.2.0b1-release">Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h1>
Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release
</h1>
<h2>
PostgreSQL Logical Dump and Anonymization Tool
</h2>
<p>
This major <strong>beta release</strong> introduces new features and
refactored transformers, significantly enhancing Greenmask’s flexibility
to better meet business needs. Help us improve GreenMask and tailor it
to meet community needs. We welcome your feedback in the
<a href="https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask/discussions/129">release
discussion on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Greenmask Overview
</h2>
<p>
Greenmask is a versatile open-source tool for database backup,
anonymization, and restoration. Written in pure Go with ported
PostgreSQL libraries, it is platform-independent and stateless,
requiring no schema modifications. It is customizable and compatible
with existing PostgreSQL utilities.
</p>
<h3>
Greenmask is ideally suited for:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and
availability.
</li>
<li>
Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics,
<strong>protecting sensitive</strong> information while maintaining data
utility.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Key features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deterministic transformers</strong> — deterministic approach to
data transformation based on the hash functions. This ensures that the
same input data will always produce the same output data. Almost each
transformer supports either <code>random</code> or <code>hash</code>
engine making it universal for any use case.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic parameters</strong> — almost each transformer supports
dynamic parameters, allowing to parametrize the transformer dynamically
from the table column value. This is helpful for resolving the
functional dependencies between columns and satisfying the constraints.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Database type safe</strong> - Ensures data integrity by
validating data and utilizing the database driver for encoding and
decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data
formats.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> -
During obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation warnings
and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain
transformations effectively throughout the software lifecycle.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> - Define
transformation configurations once and apply them to all partitions
within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stateless</strong> - Greenmask operates as a logical dump and
does not impact your existing database schema.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Backward compatible</strong> - It fully supports the same
features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities. Dumps
created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore
utility.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Extensible</strong> - Users have the flexibility to implement
domain-based transformations in any programming language or use
predefined templates.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> - Greenmask offers a
variety of storage options for local and remote data storage, including
directories and S3-like storage solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Playground usage for the beta version
</h2>
<p>
If you want to run a Greenmask
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/playground/">playground</a> for
the beta version execute:
</p>
<p>
<code>git checkout tags/v0.2.0b1 -b v0.2.0b1 docker-compose run
greenmask-from-source</code>
</p>
<h2>
Changes overview
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/dynamic_parameters/">Introduced
dynamic parameters in the transformers</a>
<ul>
<li>
Most transformers now support dynamic parameters where applicable.
</li>
<li>
Dynamic parameters are strictly enforced. If you need to cast values to
another type, Greenmask provides templates and predefined cast functions
accessible via <code>cast_to</code>. These functions cover frequent
operations such as <code>UnixTimestampToDate</code> and
<code>IntToBool</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The transformation logic has been significantly refactored, making
transformers more customizable and flexible than before.
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/transformation_engines/">Introduced
transformation engines</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>random</code> - generates transformer values based on
pseudo-random algorithms.
</li>
<li>
<code>hash</code> - generates transformer values using hash functions.
Currently, it utilizes <code>sha3</code> hash functions, which are
secure but perform slowly. In the stable release, there will be an
option to choose between <code>sha3</code> and <code>SipHash</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/parameters_templating/">Introduced
static parameters value template</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Notable changes
</h2>
<h3>
Core
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Introduced the <code>Parametrizer</code> interface, now implemented for
both dynamic and static parameters.
</li>
<li>
Renamed most of the toolkit types for enhanced clarity and comprehensive
documentation coverage.
</li>
<li>
Refactored the <code>Driver</code> initialization logic.
</li>
<li>
Added validation warnings for overridden types in the
<code>Driver</code>.
</li>
<li>
Migrated existing built-in transformers to utilize the new
<code>Parametrizer</code> interface.
</li>
<li>
Implemented a new abstraction, <code>TransformationContext</code>, as
the first step towards enabling new feature transformation conditions
(#34).
</li>
<li>
Optimized most transformers for performance in both dynamic and static
modes. While dynamic mode offers flexibility, static mode ensures
performance remains high. Using only the necessary transformation
features helps keep transformation time predictable.
</li>
</ul>

Transformers
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_email/">RandomEmail</a>
- Introduces a new transformer that supports both random and
deterministic engines. It allows for flexible email value generation;
you can use column values in the template and choose to keep the
original domain or select any from the <code>domains</code> parameter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_date/">NoiseDate</a>,
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_float/">NoiseFloat</a>,
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_int/">NoiseInt</a>
- These transformers support both random and deterministic engines,
offering dynamic mode parameters that control the noise thresholds
within the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> range. Unlike previous
implementations which used a single <code>ratio</code> parameter, the
new release features <code>min_ratio</code> and <code>max_ratio</code>
parameters to define noise values more precisely. Utilizing the
<code>hash</code> engine in these transformers enhances security by
complicating statistical analysis for attackers, especially when the
same salt is used consistently over long periods.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_numeric/">NoiseNumeric</a>
- A newly implemented transformer, sharing features with
<code>NoiseInt</code> and <code>NoiseFloat</code>, but specifically
designed for numeric values (large integers or floats). It provides a
<code>decimal</code> parameter to handle values with fractions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_choice/">RandomChoice</a>

<code>min</code> and <code>max</code> have been updated to support
dynamic mode, allowing for more flexible configurations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_numeric/">RandomNumeric</a>
- A new transformer specifically designed for numeric types (large
integers or floats), sharing similar features with
<code>RandomInt</code> and <code>RandomFloat</code>, but tailored for
handling huge numeric values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_string/">RandomString</a>
- Now supports hash engine mode
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_unix_timestamp/">RandomUnixTimestamp</a>
- This new transformer generates Unix timestamps with selectable units
(<code>second</code>, <code>millisecond</code>,
<code>microsecond</code>, <code>nanosecond</code>). Similar in function
to <code>RandomDate</code>, it supports the hash engine and dynamic
parameters for <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> thresholds, with
the ability to override these units using <code>min_unit</code> and
<code>max_unit</code> parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_uuid/">RandomUuid</a>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_person/">RandomPerson</a>
- Implemented a new transformer that replaces <code>RandomName</code>,
<code>RandomLastName</code>, <code>RandomFirstName</code>,
<code>RandomFirstNameMale</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameFemale</code>,
<code>RandomTitleMale</code>, and <code>RandomTitleFemale</code>. This
new transformer offers enhanced customizability while providing similar
functionalities as the previous versions. It generates personal data
such as <code>FirstName</code>, <code>LastName</code>, and
<code>Title</code>, based on the provided <code>gender</code> parameter,
which now supports dynamic mode. Future minor versions will allow for
overriding the default names database.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/advanced_transformers/custom_functions/core_functions/#tsmodify">tsModify</a>
- a new template function for time.Time objects modification
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduced a new
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_ip/">RandomIp</a>
transformer capable of generating a random IP address based on the
specified netmask.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a new
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_mac/">RandomMac</a>
transformer for generating random Mac addresses.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Deleted transformers include <code>RandomMacAddress</code>,
<code>RandomIPv4</code>, <code>RandomIPv6</code>,
<code>RandomUnixTime</code>, <code>RandomTitleMale</code>,
<code>RandomTitleFemale</code>, <code>RandomFirstName</code>,
<code>RandomFirstNameMale</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameFemale</code>,
<code>RandomLastName</code>, and <code>RandomName</code> due to the
introduction of more flexible and unified options.

id="celebrating-five-years-of-grant-ids-where-are-we-with-the-crossref-grant-linking-system">Celebrating
five years of Grant IDs: where are we with the Crossref Grant Linking
System?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
We’re happy to note that this month, we are marking five years since
Crossref launched its Grant Linking System. The Grant Linking System
(GLS) started life as a joint community effort to create ‘grant
identifiers’ and support the needs of funders in the scholarly
communications infrastructure.
</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<p><span><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/gls/gls-logo-stacked.png" alt="Crossref Grant Linking System logo" width="100%" ></span></p>
</div>
The system includes a funder-designed metadata schema and a unique link
for each award which enables connections with millions of research
outputs, better reporting on the research and outcomes of funding, and a
contribution to open science infrastructure. Our first activity to
highlight the moment was to host a community call last week where around
30 existing and potential funder members joined to discuss the benefits
and the steps to take to participate in the Grant Linking System (GLS).
<p>
Some organisations at the forefront of adopting Crossref’s Grant Linking
System presented their challenges and how they overcame them, shared the
benefits they are reaping from participating, and provided some tips
about their processes and workflows.
</p>
<p>
The funding organisations whose experiences were shared included
<a href="https://wellcome.org/" target="_blank">Wellcome</a>,
<a href="https://www.fct.pt/en/" target="_blank">FCT (Foundation for
Science and Technology, Portugal)</a>, and
<a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en" target="_blank">NWO (Dutch Research
Council)</a>. They were joined by a new group of foundations, research
councils, and private research funders from around the world—from Kenya
to Singapore to Estonia—to have a first introduction to the GLS and
connect them with colleagues who are further along on their journey.
</p>
<p>
We also heard about tools such as a new
<a href="https://github.com/oaworks/create-grant-doi-in-fluxx" target="_blank">open
source Crossref plugin</a> for the Fluxx platform, grant management
systems with in-built Crossref integrations such as
<a href="https://proposalcentral.com/" target="_blank">ProposalCentral</a>,
<a href="https://europepmc.org/grantfinder" target="_blank">Europe PMC
GrantFinder</a> which was first to implement the GLS on Wellcome’s
behalf and hosts their grants, and one of the first publishers,
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank">eLife</a> to start
referencing Crossref grant links in their publications both online and
in the open metadata for others to retrieve.

What is the Crossref Grant Linking System?
</h2>
<p>
The Crossref Grant Linking System, conceptualised in 2017, and launched
in 2019, captures and helps clarify funding relationships for scholarly
outputs. Thanks to interconnectedness with the 160 million metadata
records collected and curated by Crossref members, it enables funders as
well as scholars to track and analyse funding patterns and evaluate
programmes, and it supports assertions about the integrity of scholarly
records.
</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-gls">
Features of the GLS
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Globally unique persistent link and identifier for each grant
</li>
<li>
Connected with 160 million published outputs

and award-type information
</li>
<li>
Programmatic or no-code methods to send metadata
<ul>
<li>
Thanks to the <a href="https://www.moore.org/" target="_blank">Gordon

<br> The momentum for this programme is building - as illustrated by
increasing numbers of metadata records (and related relationships we’re
seeing). The 35 funder members represent over 100 funding programmes and
have created 125,000 grant records already.

During last week’s call, it was helpful to hear from the community what
they see as key benefits of the Crossref Grant Linking System:
</p>
<div class="shortcode-row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight">
<ul>
<li>
Meaningfully delivering on and supporting Open Science policies and
mandates, and contributing ‘their bit’ to the transparency of the
evidence trail in the scholarly ecosystem.
</li>
<li>
Reporting and evaluating the funding programmes, essential for the
public funders who need to demonstrate the value for money in allocating
their funds and other support.
</li>
<li>
Supporting a more holistic assessment of scholarship and scholars,
especially as and when metadata becomes included with a full array of
outputs, not limited to books and articles.

<h2 id="how-the-crossref-grant-linking-system-supports-open-science-policy">
How the Crossref Grant Linking System supports Open Science policy
</h2>
<p>
Since 2020, all the grant records are openly available through our REST
API which is queried more than 1.8 billion times every month so these
metadata records are distributed to thousands of systems across the
research enteprise. In a 2022 blog, Ed Pentz and Ginny Hendricks laid
out
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-funding-agencies-can-meet-ostp-and-open-science-guidance-using-existing-open-infrastructure/">guidelines
for research funders to meet open science guidelines</a> using existing
open infrastructure such as Crossref, ORCID, and ROR. Syman Stevens, a
grantmaking and private philanthropy consultant, highlighted on the call
that the funders he works with are increasingly interested in ways to
deliver on their open science policy and that particpation in the GLS is
a tangible thing they can do to meet this goal.
</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>
As part of its open science policy, NWO will start participating in the
Crossref Grant Linking System from July 2025. Research funders are a
part of the scholarly communications system; we not only provide the
funding to do the actual research but can also be the authoritative
source of data about the projects we have funded and the outputs arising
from that funding. Increasingly, all these elements – grants,
researchers, outputs - are linked with metadata and unique identifiers
to ensure that research is findable and accessible.

<h2 id="how-funders-leverage-the-grant-linking-system-in-their-reporting-and-assessment">
How funders leverage the Grant Linking System in their reporting and
assessment
</h2>
<p>
Looking back to the origins of the system, it’s important to recognise
the work of the initial working groups. Through their contribution,
funders helped design the initial metadata schema for grants as well as
establish the governance and fees for this service, and our Advisory
Group continues to inform further developments. In this way, the Grant
Linking System enables the needs and wishes of funders to contribute and
see their data as part of the wider ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
An excellent example of that synergy in action is the use case presented
by Cátia Laranjeira, manager of the PTCRIS programme at the Foundation
for Science and Technology, Portugal (FCT). PTCRIS is the Foundation’s
integrated national information ecosystem that supports scientific
activity management. Cátia reflected on the relative fragmentation of
spaces where the scientific outputs are found, and PTCRIS’s ambition for
aggregating metadata in one place to be able to trace and evaluate
programmes in light of the related outputs. At the start of the
programme, they identified lack of a persistent identifier for grants as
a major shortcoming of the system. Crossref GLS naturally fits in with
their goals.
</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>
The initiative by FCT to assign unique DOIs to national public funding
through Crossref is a game-changer for open science, linking funding
directly to scientific outcomes and boosting transparency. Join us in
this effort—let’s make every grant count and ensure open access to
research information!"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<cite>– Cátia Laranjeira, PTCRIS Program Manager at Fundacao para a
Ciencia e a Tecnologis (FCT Portugal)</cite>
</p>
</div>
<p>
FCT initially piloted a small subset of their grants (approximately
6,000 recent awards) at the end of 2023. Cátia pointed to researchers’
keen participation in this programme as one of its successes – and
thanks to the word of mouth, FCT has already been approached by
researchers requesting unique Crossref links for their grants! This
appetite for grant IDs will soon be more fully satisfied, as FCT is
readying to register all of their grants with Crossref, to enable
further insights into funding and outcome flows, supporting them in
demonstrating the value for money for the public resources they manage.
Via interfaces for grant management and standardised online CVs, the
system is also enabling researchers to use the system in their own
future reporting and career development.
</p>
<p>
In the ensuing discussion, Rachel Bruce of UKRI mentioned that she’s
hopeful that GLS will help funders ‘close the loop’ on more holistic
reward and recognition, allowing for inclusion of evidence for a broader
set of outputs in those processes.

How the community is working to integrate open infrastructure
</h2>
<p>
Melissa Harrison, Team Leader at EMBL-EBI, manages Europe PMC and a
complementary data science team, who were part of the initial FREYA
project – supporting infrastructure delivery for unique identifiers for
grants. The team has been adding grant records to Crossref on Wellcome’s
behalf since 2019. Melissa highlighted the shortcomings of internal
award numbers, which don’t tend to be understood outside of the
ecosystem where they are produced (that is the funder’s administrative
system), are almost certainly not unique, and don’t resolve to or
connect with anything in the wider ecosystem. Therefore internal award
numbers can’t signify relationships with other outputs or assets in the
wider world. By contrast, Crossref’s Grant IDs are unique, persistent,
resolvable, and interrelated with other Crossref metadata, whilst being
retrievable for other systems to link to too.
</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>
Persistent identifiers for grants was the next logical step after
identifiers for funders - open metadata registered with a PID in a
central service like Crossref is invaluable to build the full picture of
the research enterprise.

<p>
Ease of execution is important for scaling the Grant Linking System, and
enabling its use in a diverse set of circumstances in the open science
ecosystem. Altum was the trailblazer, first integrating its grant
management platform Proposal Central with GLS. It was good to hear that
others are now joining the integration efforts. Syman Stevens talked
about the recent work initiated by Joe McArthur at
<a href="https://oa.works/" target="_blank">OA Works</a>, to develop a
simple, open-source plug-in for any of the major grant management
systems, to enable funders to deposit their grant metadata with Crossref
GLS with a click of the button. Syman demonstrated the resulting
interface in Fluxx, that allows for creating a record and sending grant
metadata to Crossref as part of the regular grant management within the
platform. He pointed out that, while this integration was developed for
Fluxx, all code and documentation is openly available on
<a href="https://github.com/oaworks/create-grant-doi-in-fluxx" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
and this can potentially be forked or adapted as necessary for reuse in
other grant management systems.
</p>
<p>
It is heartening that others in the community are seeing such a need for
this that they’re funding and creating their own tools to advance
participation and use of the GLS.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Fred Atherden, Head of Production Operations at eLife,
presented how they include Crossref grant identifiers in publication
metadata for the version of record of the works published on their
platform. eLife is the first publisher to fully integrate Crossref grant
identifiers both within the article display and in the metadata. Fred
shared that in addition to collecting the data from the authors, eLife
also attempts matching, albeit using very restrictive methodology, to
enable more grant metadata in their publication records. They recognise
that so far there are very few publishers including persistent links for
grants in this way, and talked about plans to start collecting and
including this data further upstream, and including them in the future
for reviewed preprints.

arcade system out there. Then I blogged on getting the memory expansion
module so I could emulate Nintendo and Atari ST systems. This week,
we’ll look at running Commodore Amiga programs. This turned […]</p>

takes firm stance against AI, will not include it in its browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The web browser Vivaldi is taking a firm stance against including
machine learning tools to its browser. So, as we have seen, LLMs are
essentially confident-sounding lying machines with a penchant to
occasionally disclose private data or plagiarise existing work. While
they do this, they also use vast amounts of energy and are happy using
all the GPUs you can throw at them which is a problem we’ve seen before
in the field of cryptocurrencies. As such, it does not feel right to
bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation
going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to
add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill
up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are
available. ↫ Julien Picalausa on the Vivaldi blog I’m not a particular
fan of Vivaldi personally – it doesn’t integrate with KDE well visually
and its old-fashioned-Opera approach of throwing everything but the
kitchen sink at itself is just too cluttered for me – but props to the
Vivaldi team for taking such clear and firm stance. There’s a ton of
pressure from big money interests to add machine learning to everything
from your operating system to your nail scissors, and popular tech
publishers are certainly going to publish articles decrying Vivaldi’s
choice, so they’re not doing this without any risk. With even Firefox
adding machine learning tools to the browser, there’s very few – if any
– browsers left, other than Vivaldi, it seems – that will be free of
these tools. I can only hope we’re going to see a popular Firefox fork
without this nonsense take off, and I’m definitely keeping my eye on the
various options that already exist today.</p>

<h2 id="neo-geo-architecture-a-practical-analysis">Neo Geo architecture:
a practical analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Straight from the arcade world, the Neo Geo was, without a doubt, the
most expensive hardware of the 4th generation. This begs the question:
how capable was it and how did it compare with the rest? In this entry,
we’ll take a look at the result of one company (SNK) setting budget
restrictions aside and shipping a product meant to please both arcade
owners and rich households. ↫ Rodrigo Copetti Rich households, indeed.
Back in the ’90s, when Nintendo was the only game in town – few people
in my area cared one bit about Sega – Neo Geo was a name we only knew of
vaguely. It was supposed to be a massively powerful console that was so
expensive nobody bought one, and some of us even doubted it was real in
the first place. Ah, the pre-internet playground days were wild.</p>

<h2 id="mini-4wd">Mini 4WD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The algorithm sucked me into another model craft hobby: Mini 4WD racing
(ミニ四駆). A Mini 4WD is a 1:32 scale model that is a mix between slot
cars and RC cars. You don’t control these cars with a remote control nor
do they drive in an electrified slot, rather you place your racecar in a
plastic track with high walls and send them speeding down the track at
~40km/h.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ZZL5i8vOXM?si=ED2YFsLdI9z7BMbG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
The twist is you don’t know
<a href="https://tamiya.com/japan/mini4wd/feature/2019/1206.html">what
the track looks like</a> until race day, so you have to be ready to
adapt. There might a big jump, moguls, or a tall mountain to climb. Once
racers have seen the course, they have some time to make adjustments by
balancing engineering choices about weight, power, braking, handling,
batteries, downforce, and more. Are you going to make your car lighter
and full send it over the tabletops? Or is slow and steady going to win
the race? The races are a brief cacophony of slapping plastic and
whirring motors but I can feel the electricity of the room through the
screen.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Where YouTube hooked me was watching custom 4WD Mini builders like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@azpaca0">アズパカ</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Niwakara">にわから</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@techyuuta">ユウタ</a>. They are
hellbent on making their cars as fast as possible. In Japanese they call
it “タイムアタック” (“Time Attack”). For their time attacks, they use
the
<a href="https://d7z22c0gz59ng.cloudfront.net/cms/japan/mini4wd/topics/feature/2019_12/circuit_1911_2c1_002.jpg">Japan
Cup Junior Circuit</a> (JCJC) course; a three lane track with a wave
feature and a wicked lane change from the inner lane to the outer lane
that will send light or fast cars flying off the course. The
standardized course (and video
format<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>)
is where the similarities stop because their cars are anything but
conventional.
</p>
<p>
The videos are all about iteration and experimentation. Testing all
kinds of parts and gimmicks like 3D printed chassis, side rollers,
battery types, motors, wheels, and downforce options. Sometimes the
tweaks are small, sometimes they are radical innovations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">An entirely
“blade” flat chassis</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rgALusRMAs&amp;t=396s">A
chassis with all the weight to one side</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o--_xP1xBA">A bendy chassis to
bend around corners.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKWx_TMOzvo">A chassis with a
motor on each wheel</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">A chassis with a
computer fan in the middle</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuqw_Bf08">A car with
knives</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1J8fqEXrv0">A dual-fan chassis
that looks like a GPU</a>.
</li>
<li>
A car with model rocket engines!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRpmNh-kOkE">Why not</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That sort of raw, no-rules experimentation is refreshing to watch. It
looks like dumb fun. A reason to own a 3D printer. They experiments
don’t always work and will fail spectacularly, but lessons get learned.
And if you watch enough videos, you see them getting faster.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A stock car will complete all three laps in about 5 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Cars they made a year ago will go around in 3 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Cars they made six months ago, 2 seconds.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyoc3my8suY&amp;t=3s">A car
from one month ago, 1.63 seconds.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m not sure why Mini 4WD strikes such a chord with me. It could be
nostalgia for my RC car days as a ten year old. It could be my penchant
for Japanese model making. But I probably know what hooks me the most:
this is the flavor of engineering optimization work I like to do. Make
it lighter, faster, and able to handle bumps in the road. Websites are
of course vastly different than mechanical engineering… but the
correlation between weight and speed are enough to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240227130052/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alZvGsOVh3o">activate
my brain</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mini4wd.jpg" alt="Untitled" />
</p>
<p>
So I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3W5aHoc">Mini 4WD Starter
Pack</a> (and one for my son) to close the loop on my curiosity. They’re
only ~$20, so why not. The hitch in the plan is that a beginner track
costs $120. It would nice to have an opportunity to run around a complex
track without an upfront cost. My hobby shop used to host races and have
a track in-store before COVID, but not anymore. Maybe I can provide this
as a service to my kids’ friends… yeah… that’s a good justification.

what we need from Biden, and how we need journalism to get out of the
way. Biden has a base. He should communicate directly with us. Joe, tell
us you saw what we saw. A snake oil salesman. A con man. A loser. A
criminal. We heard the tape of him blackmailing the Secretary of State
of Georgia. He wanted the military to shoot Black Lives Matter
protestors. Did he sell our secrets to Putin and others? He did all
kinds of horrible stuff that the press has forgotten to talk about. The
biggest problem here isn’t Biden’s age, though it is a problem, it’s the
controlling nature of our journalism, and the lack of any oversight.
They can’t be criticized because all we have are our individual voices,
with no organization. We keep paying the price. This podcast is in the
form of a voicemail to an old friend,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who
I introduce at the beginning of the podcast. We share the same
frustrations, I can see it in his posts on various social media

<h2 id="the-mimo-diaries-feedback-and-directory">The Mimo Diaries:
Feedback and Directory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Another quick update for those who are interested on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalissimo.com&quot;&gt;Minimalissimo&lt;/a&gt; side of my digital life. For those who don’t know, at the beginning of 2024 I took charge of Minimalissimo and I’m now curating it, updating it, designing and coding for it, and steering it towards its future. It’s a fun project to work on and I have a ton of ideas but also very little time. It’s a one man show and there’s a lot to do.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Today I pushed live a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/feedback">feedback page</a> because I
have a couple of decisions to take and I don’t want to do it blindly. So
if you are a reader of the site I’d really appreciate if you can take a
moment and share your thoughts on a few subjects. It shouldn’t take too
long, maybe 5 minutes at most.
</p>
<p>
The other thing I’ve been working on is a new directory that collects in
one place links to people and brands that are aligned with the
Minimalissimo vision. It’s something that’s incredibly useful for me to
have online because it will make the curation of the site easier and
that’s huge because curation can be very time consuming.

<p>
The directory is ready form a technical point of view but now I need to
add content to it and that will take me some time. I have more than a
thousand links to go through and my hope is to have it live before the
end of the summer. We’ll see how it goes.

they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think

<p>It’s been a long while since I have felt really positive about most
of what I have been reading and seeing in AI. Not because I inherently
dislike AI, but because I feel like so many folks have been brainwashed
by the “scale is all you need” notion and “AGI in 2025” (or 2027 or
2029) nonsense, none of which seems remotely plausible to me as a

Zero Core We are very excited to announce that the NGI Zero Core program
from the NLnet Foundation will be funding our project Redox OS
Unix-style Signals. Redox currently has a basic implementation of
Signals, but this project will allow us to move most of signals code out
of the kernel into user-space, and bring us much closer to POSIX
compliance.</p>
