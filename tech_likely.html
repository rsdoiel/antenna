<h2 id="wal2mongo-v1.0.7-is-released">wal2mongo v1.0.7 is released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
HighGo Software is pleased to announce the first GitHub community
release of wal2mongo v1.0.7, which can be used to replicate PostgreSQL
database changes to an output format that can be directly fed into the
mongo client tool to achieve logical replication between PostgreSQl and
MongoDB. Wal2mongo plugin is useful for a case where PostgreSQL is used
as the main raw data source to collect data from outside world but
MongoDB is used internally for data analytics purposes. Manual data
migration between PostgreSQL and MongoDB poses a lot of potential
problem and having a logical decoding plugin like wal2mongo can help
reduce the data migration complexity between the two databases.

SwiftNavigation
</h1>
<p>
To celebrate that
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10103">RealityKit’s is
coming to MacOS, iOS and iPadOS</a> and is no longer limited to
VisionOS, I am releasing
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a>
for RealityKit.
</p>
<p>
Last year, as I was building a game for VisionPro, I wanted the 3D
characters I placed in the world to navigate the world, go from one
point to another, avoid obstacles and have those 3D characters avoid
each other.
</p>
<p>
Almost every game engine in the world uses the C++ library
<a href="http://recastnav.com">RecastNavigation</a> library to do this -
Unity, Unreal and Godot all use it.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a>
was born: Both a Swift wrapper to the underlying C++ library which
leverages extensively Swift’s C++ interoperability capabilities and it
directly integrates into the RealityKit entity system.
</p>
<p>
This library is magical, you create a
<a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/buildingmesh">navigation
mesh</a> from the world that you capture and then you can
<a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmeshquery">query
it</a> for paths to navigate from one point to another or you can create
a
<a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmesh/makecrowd(maxagents:agentradius:)">crowd
controller</a> that will automatically move your objects.
</p>
<p>
Until I have the time to write full tutorials, your best bet is to look
at the
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigationDemo">example
project</a> that uses it.

id="under-pressure-from-russian-censors-mozilla-removes-anti-censorship-extensions">Under
pressure from Russian censors, Mozilla removes anti-censorship
extensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was pointed to a post on the Mozilla forums, in
which developers of Firefox extensions designed to circumvent Russian
censorship were surprised to find that their extensions were suddenly no
longer available within Russia. The extension developers and other users
in the thread were obviously not amused, and since they had received no
warning or any other form of communication from Mozilla, they were left
in the dark as to what was going on. I did a journalism and contacted
Mozilla directly, and inquired about the situation. Within less than 24
hours Mozilla got back to me with an official statement, attributed to
an unnamed Mozilla spokesperson: Following recent regulatory changes in
Russia, we received persistent requests from Roskomnadzor demanding that
five add-ons be removed from the Mozilla add-on store. After careful
consideration, we’ve temporarily restricted their availability within
Russia. Recognizing the implications of these actions, we are closely
evaluating our next steps while keeping in mind our local community. ↫
Mozilla spokesperson via email I and most people I talked to already
suspected this was the case, and considering Russia is a totalitarian
dictatorship, it’s not particularly surprising it would go after browser
extensions that allow people to circumvent state censorship. Other
totalitarian dictatorships like China employ similar, often far more
sophisticated methods of state control and censorship, too, so it’s
right in line with expectations. I would say that I’m surprised Mozilla
gave in, but at the same time, it’s highly likely resisting would lead
to massive fines and possible arrests of any Mozilla employees or
contributors living in Russia, if any such people exist, and I can
understand a non-profit like Mozilla not having the means to effectively
stand up against the Russian government. That being said, Mozilla’s
official statement seems to imply they’re still in the middle of their
full decision-making process regarding this issue, so other options may
still be on the table, and I think it’s prudent to give Mozilla some
more time to deal with this situation. Regardless, this decision is
affecting real people inside Russia, and I’m sure if you’re using tools
like these inside a totalitarian dictatorship, you’re probably not too
fond of said dictatorship. Losing access to these Firefox extensions
through the official add-store will be a blow to their human rights, so
let’s hope the source code and ‘sideloaded’ versions of these extensions
remain available for them to use instead.</p>

<h2 id="apple-wwdc-2024-the-13-biggest-announcements">Apple WWDC 2024:
the 13 biggest announcements</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote has come to a close —
and the company had a whole lot to share. We got our first look at the
AI features coming to Apple’s devices and some major updates across the
company’s operating systems. If you missed out on watching the keynote
live, we’ve gathered all the biggest announcements that you can check
out below. ↫ Emma Roth at The Verge Most of the stuff Apple announced
aren’t particularly interesting – a lot of catch-up stuff that has
become emblematic of companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft when it
comes to their operating systems. The one thing that did stand out is
Apple’s approach to offloading machine learning requests to the cloud
when they are too difficult to handle on device. They’ve developed a new
way of doing this, using servers with Apple’s own M chips, which is
pretty cool and harkens back the days of the Xserve. In short, these
server are using the same kind of techniques to encrypt and secure data
on iPhones, but now to encrypt and secure the data coming in for
offloaded machine learning requests. The root of trust for Private Cloud
Compute is our compute node: custom-built server hardware that brings
the power and security of Apple silicon to the data center, with the
same hardware security technologies used in iPhone, including the Secure
Enclave and Secure Boot. We paired this hardware with a new operating
system: a hardened subset of the foundations of iOS and macOS tailored
to support Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads while
presenting an extremely narrow attack surface. This allows us to take
advantage of iOS security technologies such as Code
Signing and sandboxing. ↫ Apple’s security research blog Apple also
provided some insight into where its training data is coming from, and
it claims it’s only using licensed data and “publicly available data
collected by our web-crawler”. The words “licensed” and “publicly
available” are doing a lot of heavy lifting here, and I’m not entirely
sure what definitions of those terms Apple is using. There are enough
people out there who feel every piece of data – whether under copyright,
available under an open source license, or whatever – is fair, legal
game for ML training, so who knows what Apple is using based on these
statements alone. From Apple’s presentations yesterday, as well as any
later statements, it’s also not clear when machine learning requests get
offloaded in the first place. Apple states they try to run as much as
possible on-device, and will offload when needed, but the conditions
under which such offloading happens are nebulous and unclear, making it
hard for users to know what’s going to happen when they use Apple’s new
machine learning features.</p>

been driving me
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid024FDKvbd25XG3C2JQmfXBuvXGZuyw7btYnXRKZtVWmLbABdyH8ke93rqfTnK6EkUjl">crazy</a>
watching Stan Krute doing all these weird and often beautifully bizarre
ChatGPT images, and realizing they are only being seen by people on
Facebook when there’s this huge world of creative people that don’t or
won’t use FB.
</p>
<p>
Then it occurred to me, I have the perfect place for these images,
outside the facebookiverse, that would showcase them, and be easy to
produce (I don’t want to take on responsibility for big production
overhead myself).
</p>
<p>
I have images I put in the right margin of blog posts on
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Small little bits of
creative color, that may or may not be connected to the story they are
next to. And sometimes connected in non-obvious ways, intended to make
you think.
</p>
<p>
Then NakedJen sent me a recent picture of herself that’s perfect for the
right margin. Seen in the right margin of this post.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/manyImages.html">page</a>
where you can scroll through the collection of images I can choose from.
I’d love to add more creative stuff here. And I’d love to get some of
Stan Krute’s genius or Brad Pettit or whoever else might be so inspired.
</p>
<p>
No promises about when or if they’d be used. You can post them here, as
comments on this message if you like.
</p>
<p>
I may have to restrict this to people I follow, just letting you know,
based on past experience.

Repubs are coming uncloaked. Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It’s
the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything.
They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage
on. They don’t know how else to do it. It doesn’t have much to do with
inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It’s deeper than that. We’re
all living a lie, that if we had money we’d be happy. The sad truth is
no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don’t
believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all
that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling
proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the
previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew
who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the
aftermath, and it wasn’t pretty. “All of this has happened before, and
it will all happen again.” We’re at the beginning of the “happen again”
moment. My grandfather told me what to do, but I won’t do it, pretty
sure of that.</p>

Apple trained their models to work with the AppIntents schema (this
powers shortcuts and existing Siri commands), a great way of surfacing
the existing capabilities of apps and extend their reach.
</p>
<p>
While Microsoft could have done this, their equivalent frameworks are
just not widely used - a phenomenon caused in part by slow upgrading
windows users and in part by a void in evangelism for their Windows
platform.

<h2 id="the-money-conundrum">The money conundrum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I wrote about my dislike of money before on this site. Money and everything related to it is by far the part I enjoy the least about my job. And it’s a non-negligible part of it considering I worked solo my entire life. What’s hard for me is this idea of attaching a monetary value to what I do. I was struggling doing it 13 years ago, when I started my career, I’m struggling with it today and I’m sure it won’t change anytime soon. That’s because work, for me, is not a matter of trading money for a service. It’s a human interaction. And adding money to a human interaction makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I get why it does make sense in a practical sense.
I’m not an idiot. I just don’t understand it at a more deeply personal
level. What drives me is the desire to help people. This is either
directly, with my job or indirectly, with the other things I do online.
And when you’re driven by this desire to help others, money becomes a
painful obstacle. Because I just can’t spend my time helping others and
not earn a living. It’s just not an option. So I have to compromise.
</p>
<p>
I discussed this topic in the past with various people and one of the
feedback I got is to treat work just as a way of earning enough to free
more time that I can then use to help others. That’s a reasonable
suggestion but I just can’t apply it to my life. I don’t know why, I
can’t get into that type of mindset. I’m sure part of this is the good
old impostor syndrome which I’ll have to confront at some point but part
is just the nature of who I am as a person.
</p>
<p>
This is also why I struggle with the idea of monetising my side
projects. It’s why I love the “Pay What You Want” model because it
eliminates the burden of having to put a price on what I do.
</p>
<p>
This constant tension between money on one side and the desire to help
others on the other is also why I live on the edge of constant burnout.
Saying no to people is hard when you know you have the skills necessary
to help them. And it’s why I always end up with way too many projects
going on at the same time and find myself waking up in the middle of the
night thinking about all the things that I have to do and I won’t have
time to do. And it sucks. I know it’s not a healthy way of living but I
have not yet learned how to do things differently.
</p>
<p>
Money sucks. It sucks that we constantly have to keep it in mind. It
sucks that we can’t just ignore it and focus on the things that matter.
Money is also weird. You’d think that the same amount of money would
make the same type of impact in my life but it clearly doesn’t. Every
time someone signs up for my “one a month” membership I’m super happy.
And it’s just 1<span

because after the various fees I’m left with roughly 70 cents. But those
70 cents have meaning. But 70 extra cents on a client invoice is a
rounding error. I don’t even care. Hell, earning 2000$ doesn’t have the
same effect from a personal standpoint as getting one extra subscriber
for 1$ a month. Human psychology is fascinating.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Speaking of one-a-month members, I recently tweaked my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">supporters page</a>
because I hated the idea of not having a place to acknowledge those
people who were kind enough to support what I do at some point but are
no longer active subscribers. Just removing them from the list didn’t
feel right so I added an extra section for past members.
</p>
<p>
The internet would really benefit from having a native way to let people
support each other. It’s great that services like
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> exist but also part
of me would love to have all these functionalities integrated at the
browser level somehow. I’m sure someone is reading this and screaming
“Crypto! Blockchain!” but I doubt that’s a solution.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I’m curious to know if you have thoughts on this whole money
thing so if you do, please get in touch.

id="tuxedo-showcases-prototype-linux-laptop-with-snapdragon-x-elite">Tuxedo
showcases prototype Linux laptop with Snapdragon X Elite</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve long been waiting for a powerful ARM laptop that can run Linux
comfortably, and it seems that with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite
SoC, that’s finally going to happen. We talked earlier about how for
once, Qualcomm is taking Linux support for their new laptop-focused
processors very seriously, and that promise and associated effort is
paying dividend. Tuxedo, a popular Linux OEM from Germany, has announced
it’s working on a laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, and they
showed off a working prototype at Computex in Taiwan. We have been
working with a first prototype for some time, which will soon be
replaced by a second one. The development is still in the alpha stage,
as some drivers are still missing, which will hopefully be available
with the next two kernel versions. It is quite conceivable that an ARM
notebook from TUXEDO will be under your Christmas tree in 2024. However,
there are still too many pieces of the hardware, software and delivery
capability puzzle missing to even begin to set a release date. TUXEDO
for ARM will come, but we don’t yet know exactly when. ↫ Tuxedo’s
website Their timeline of more Qualcomm drivers making it into the next
two kernel versions lines up with Qualcomm’s own timeline, so it seems
we’re mostly just waiting for them to finish their Linux drivers and add
them to the kernel. This is quite exciting, and a much better option for
Linux users than buying a Windows version of an X Elite or Pro laptop
and hoping for the best.</p>

id="netbsd-10-with-disk-encryption-on-uefi-and-netbsd-10-on-the-pinebook-pro">NetBSD
10 with disk encryption on UEFI, and NetBSD 10 on the Pinebook Pro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetBSD 10 was released recently, so a lot of people are experimenting
with it and writing down their thoughts. I’ve got two of those for you
today, to help you in case you, too, want to install NetBSD 10 and play
around with, or just use, it. First, what if you want to install NetBSD
10 on a UEFI system, but with full disk encryption in case your device
gets stolen? It turns out there are countless guides for installing with
full-disk encryption on MBR-based systems, but once you use UEFI – as
you should be – things get a lot more complicated. The NetBSD installer
is apparently rather basic, and a better solution is to drop to a shell
and install NetBSD that way instead, and even then, full disk encryption
with UEFI is actually not possible, as it seems the root file system –
where the operating system itself resides – cannot be encrypted. The
restriction is in the root file-system. It needs to be in plain-text and
in a regular partition. It seems to me that rootfs in CGD or LVM is not
well supported. ↫ vsis.online This seems like something the NetBSD team
may need to take a look at, since full disk encryption should be an easy
option to choose, even, or especially in 2024, on UEFI systems. Such
encryption is easily achieved on Linux or Windows systems, and it seems
odd to me that NetBSD is lagging behind a bit here. In the meantime, the
linked guide will be a good jumping-off point for those of you
interested in going a similar route. The second article I want to
highlight concerns NetBSD 10 on the Pinebook Pro, the inexpensive ARM
laptop that normally ships with Linux. It turns out there’s a NetBSD 10
image for this device, so installation is quite a bit more
straightforward than the more exotic setup I mentioned earlier. It seems
most of the hardware works quite well out of the box, with the inly
exception being the on-board Wi-Fi, which the author addressed with a
USB W-Fi dongle. Other than that, NetBSD is running well on the Pinebook
Pro for the author, which is great to read since that makes this cheap
device a great starting point for people interested in running
NetBSD.</p>

<h2 id="void-linux-on-zfs">Void Linux on ZFS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last night, I ran through the ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for
Void and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD
plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea
of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box,
so the Void Handbook itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation
before its own (a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a
ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we’ll be
following throughout this post. ↫ Juno Takano There’s a ton of good
stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers
Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy
style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily
underappreciated – it gets a lot of mentions in the right places – but I
do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a
perfect fit but who don’t yet know about it. So, time for a very short
introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very
user-friendly package manager that’s an absolute joy to use. Unlike many
other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are
vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you’ll be hard-pressed
to be asking for some piece of software that isn’t packaged. Void
eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no
issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line
with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void
also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the “real” Void Linux is
the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu.
The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it’s a
self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux
kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be
launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier,
especially for systems that don’t over ZFS as an option during
installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that’s what the linked
post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation.
It’s a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.</p>

MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it
is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and
dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without
running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching
how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode
compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned
through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a
specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for
“filling in the blanks” when executing code to understand what the code
should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64
assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly
in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to
launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach
a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing.
Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process
as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the
virtualization firmware. ↫ Nicholas Starke This is an old post – from
late 2022 – but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS
doesn’t change very much from year to year, it’s still mostly
relevant.</p>

Had another crap night’s sleep BUT as I was lying there at 4:30am with
my hand on my belly, I felt definite movement 🥰 Like, a foot or
something running along the underside of the surface. Not the first time
I’ve thought I felt something, but the first time I’m sure I did. It was
wild the emotional reaction I had, too – just suddenly filled with love
for this defenceless little creature inside me. A very strong feeling!

<h2 id="ldap2pg-6.1-postgres-16-unprivileged-hooks-and-more">ldap2pg
6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em>
</p>
<p>
Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France
since 2005.
</p>
<p>
Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers
the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for
PostgreSQL. Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in
<code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure
roles from your enterprise directory.
</p>
<p>
Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1. This version
brings support for PostgreSQL 16 and its new unprivileged administration
or roles. Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make
this a practical and stable version. Follow the
<a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation
to install</a> this new version.
</p>
<h3>
Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16
</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to
delegating the administration of roles to an unprivileged user. This
change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security and was not consistent with the SQL
standard. Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de
facto grant himself rights he does not have.
</p>
<p>
Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL
up to version 15. ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code>
option on PostgreSQL 16, without superuser privileges.
</p>
<h3>
Configurability
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities. You can now write the
environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file or in the ldap2pg working directory.
</p>
<p>
In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working
directory of the command. This parameter determines the search for the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.
</p>
<p>
Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument: the connection
string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised. This connection
string can be in URL format or in key=value format.
</p>
<h3>
Compatibility
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after
connection to the LDAP directory. This operation is an extension of the
LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere. Removing this command
removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.
</p>
<p>
The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by
a space. If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this
client-side HA implementation.
</p>
<p>
LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol, only for ASCII characters. ldap2pg
6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.
</p>
<h3>
Execution hooks
</h3>
<p>
A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg : the
definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after
the creation of a role. For example, to create a schema specific to a
new user. The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code>
and <code>after_create</code> parameters. These requests can receive
dynamic values from the LDAP search.
</p>
<h3>
Continue on error
</h3>
<p>
Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing. For
example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving
up.
</p>

<h2 id="what-is-pid-0">What is PID 0?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn’t
shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel,
then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling
and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0,
because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There’s a
slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me
for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what
PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ↫ David Anderson What a
great read. Just great.</p>

id="adobe-terms-clarified-will-never-own-your-work-or-use-it-for-ai-training">Adobe
terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI
training</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that
they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some
frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming
rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the
apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the
apps, without agreeing to the terms. ↫ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course
users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language,
locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms
is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers
certainly aren’t going to be particularly happy about. I’ve never worked
an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I’m assuming
employees aren’t allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe
or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash,
Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim
ownership over anyone’s work, and that it’s not going to train its ML
models on customers’ work either. The company states that to train its
Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it,
as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth,
it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which
is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI
or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly
licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from
rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that’s exactly
what they’re doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just
how – rightfully – weary people are of machine learning, and how their
works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.</p>

<h2 id="wikipedia-vs-chatgpt">Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I started replying to a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post
by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character
limit, so I moved my act over here. </i>
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It often only represents a story from one point of view.
</p>
<p>
So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.
</p>
<p>
Same with the story of RSS. I’m sure you know the story they tell, but
there’s a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got
together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and Motley Fool, and eventually
brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard
supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media
and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the
tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do
that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you’d get the idea that the
bigco’s heroically fought back against what exactly it’s not clear.
</p>
<p>
I can’t contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so
your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well
it’s not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it
on my blog (as I’m doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and
fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is.
(Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)
</p>
<p>
Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things
other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name
for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT
made a mistake like that people would be howling. I’m sure Wikipedia is
filled with junk like that. Why wouldn’t it be.
</p>
<p>
And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all
other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while
other sources don’t.
</p>
<p>
But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in
advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the
open web. I don’t know why it’s better at finding stuff, and also
understanding my queries even though they’re not rigorously specified,
my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way
I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a
weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able
to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.
</p>
<p>
It’s also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would
work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out
prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which
of course they are being.
</p>
<p>
Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that’s a big difference
between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very
impatient with them and move on.
</p>
<p>
Also, I’m not here to debate. I don’t like online debates. <span

have a Mac Mini that keeps running out of space on its internal drive.
It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me
find the big stuff. I don’t know when this app came to be, but it’s very
helpful. In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for
all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device
that’s ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems).
I’m sure there’s a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on
the 16TB external drive, but I sure don’t know how to do it nor do I
want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript,
CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a
lot longer than this Mac’s has. I desperately want to move my act to
Linux and reclaim all the memory I’m using to store stuff about the Mac,
which isn’t really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a
Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that’s my revenge,
and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with
what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would
make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a>
money, so I hedged. I figured at least they’d make me rich while
completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My
inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen
Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running
and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as
usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>Just around the time I was complaining about the scarcity of books on
technical writing, I got a copy of Technical Writing for Software
Developers by Chris Chinchilla, a regular of the Write the Docs
community. Delighted by the chance of reading a book from one of the
sharpest pens in technical writing, I set aside some time to read
through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little
I didn’t already know – Chris and I use the same tools and methods.</p>

<p>I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who
are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks
like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those
connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of
relationships.</p>

<h2 id="lca-software-exit-the-matrix">LCA software: exit the matrix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life
cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a
product’s life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each
stage on the environment (LCIA). There are a few pieces of LCA software
to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and
Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they’re expensive. But
there’s a free and open source alternative: Brightway.</p>
