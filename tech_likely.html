When your mind is wandering, your brain’s “default mode” network is

networks of brain regions and how they interact with each other.

<p>You should assume that some day <i>all</i> these systems will
disappear. The web is ephemeral. But – my guess is
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> will be around longer.
However, honestly, I really have no idea, no one does.</p>

<p>If you’re creating something new, definitely create it on
feedland.com. If you’re already using feedland.org, for now you’re
welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a
new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving
useful to have around, so I don’t imagine it’ll go away, it’s much
easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based
server.</p>

<p>Org runs on a small

server</a>, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size
relatively small scale server that can’t expand, and the latter is
designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of
2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment.</p>

<p>BTW, while we’re doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a
small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a
combination of software that suddenly aren’t getting along with each
other. Obviously something changed. I’m running it in a somewhat
crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of
the downsides of having fun with server software.</p>

Seeing some of the apple headsets on social media and I’m struggling to
decide if my automatic reactions are genuine, fair, and kind. My first
thoughts are quite negative. Is it because I have a prejudice against
Apple? Or against augmented reality it whatever new term is getting
pushed? Does it look ridiculous because I’m judging people against a
deep seeded set of cultural norms I should be questioning? I’m really
not sure.

<h2 id="routines">Routines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting a different result. I found the inverse of that
to also be true for my life. Doing things differently day after day and
expecting the same–positive–outcome.
</p>
<p>
I’m the product of two terrible traits: I’m a morning person but I also
lack self-discipline. And that means keeping a morning routine is
incredibly hard for me. And yet, every time I manage to do that I feel
really well. My mind is in a much better place when I wake up at 6 am or
even 5 am. I feel a lot better when I’m out in nature with the sun
rising. I know it. I’m aware of all this. And yet keeping a morning
routine is incredibly hard. I’m getting better at it though so I’m
pleased with that.
</p>
<p>
Learning how my mind works is a fun process. You’re tempted to think you
just know yourself and yet there’s always a new discovery waiting behind
the corner. Thankfully I have my whole life to figure this stuff out.

<h2 id="why-netnewswire-isnt-available-for-vision-pro">Why NetNewsWire
Isn’t Available for Vision Pro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
I’ve been getting questions about NetNewsWire’s unavailability on Vision
Pro. Why isn’t it there? When might it be there?
</p>
<p>
Here’s the scoop:
</p>
<p>
I consider it risky to support an app running on a device I don’t own.
Imagine writing a Mac or iPhone app and not actually running it on one
of those machines — you wouldn’t.
</p>
<p>
I realize that the app would act as if it were running on an iPad — but
the Vision Pro is not really an iPad. It’s a device with
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/simple_tricks_and_nonsense">very
different interactions</a> from the direct manipulation we’re used to on
iPad. And the compatibility mode is a new thing because this device is a
new thing — we don’t know how well it works and what the gotchas might
be.
</p>
<p>
I could test it on the simulator, sure, but the simulator is a
convenience for developers. It’s no replacement for running it on a real
device.
</p>
<p>
And, yes, the app is open source, which could mean that other developers
with a Vision Pro could help support it — but it’s important to remember
that I’m the only person who <em>has</em> to support it. The NetNewsWire
team is awesome, but I’m the one on the line for this.
</p>
<p>
So I want to be careful and go slowly, because if I made it available it
would be extremely difficult to reverse the decision and take it away,
even with an excellent reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m hoping that a consensus will form among developers that running apps
on Vision Pro as iPad apps is fine, that it’s a cakewalk. If that
happens, I’d go ahead and do it too. But it’s too soon for us to know
that.
</p>
<p>
PS Why don’t I have a Vision Pro? I’m sure it’s an incredible technical
achievement and an amazing experience — and pretty damn wonderful in
just about every way — but it’s just not my thing. I like reading and
writing mostly, plus making apps for reading and writing. My personal
future of computing has been here for all these years — the Mac.
</p>
<p>
PPS Eventually the price will come down to where I’d consider buying one
as a test device and for a little fun — but that may be a few years
away. I’m hoping that we’ll find, sooner than that, that running as iPad
on Vision Pro is a-okay.

<p>Decarbonisation will lead to major efficiency gains. This could
reduce final energy demand while ‘energy services’ continue to

<p>One of the cool things about being a programmer is that you can
decide to run code that you know has zero chance of working. “Let all
hell break loose,” a programmer can be heard to say quietly before
clicking the Run button. Very few design professions get to do this, I
imagine, unless they’re psychotic.</p>

‘Temporary failure in name resolution’ on Pi OS 12 Bookworm</h2>

<p><span

‘Temporary failure in name resolution’ on Pi OS 12 Bookworm</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi OS version 12 (based on Debian 12 Bookworm) uses NetworkManager instead of dhcpcd for managing network connections, DNS resolution settings, DHCP, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I’ve already mentioned
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/nmcli-wifi-on-raspberry-pi-os-12-bookworm">using
<code>nmcli</code> and <code>nmtui</code> for managing WiFi
settings</a>, but I ran into a strange issue after installing Docker on
a fresh Raspberry Pi OS installation today. Suddenly DNS stopped
working.
</p>
<p>
Trying to ping anything on the Internet gave me:
</p>
<pre><code>$ ping www.google.com
ping: www.google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
</code></pre>
<p>
As always,
<a href="https://redshirtjeff.com/listing/it-was-dns-shirt?product=211">It
was DNS</a>. It was like DNS just gave up the ghost! Trying to change
settings via <code>nmtui</code> seemed to not work (I tried DHCP for
IPv4 with manual DNS, and that wasn’t working).
</p>
<p>
Luckily, I found <a href="https://serverfault.com/a/810639">this
post</a> and followup comments mentioning the proper <code>nmcli</code>
incantation to override DNS settings for an interface, so here it is
(assuming built-in Ethernet):

the edge: the use of design tactics to undermine browser choice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>In order to be able to choose their own browser, people must be free
to download it, easily set it to default and to continue using it – all
without interference from the operating system. Windows users do not
currently enjoy this freedom of choice. To investigate Microsoft’s
tactics and the impact on consumers, Mozilla commissioned Harry Brignull
and Cennydd Bowles, independent researchers and experts in harmful
design. Today, the researchers have published a report detailing how
Microsoft prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report,
they document how Microsoft places its own browser — Edge — at the
center of its operating system and weaponizes Windows’ user interface
design to undermine people selecting rival browsers. ↫ Mozilla Research
We all already know Microsoft does these things, and of course, a study
paid for by Mozilla agreeing with Mozilla is not exactly
earth-shattering, but stuff like this is important for aiding in
convincing regulators to do something about this stuff. It simply
shouldn’t be legal to employ all kinds of nasty tricks and dark patterns
to force people to use a certain browser.</p>

<h2 id="niri-a-scrollable-tiling-wayland-compositor.">Niri: a
scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Niri is a scrollable, tiling window manager for Wayland. What does it
mean for a tiling window manager to be scrollable? Windows are arranged
in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Opening a new window
never causes existing windows to resize. Every monitor has its own
separate window strip. Windows can never “overflow” onto an adjacent
monitor. Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically. Every monitor
has an independent set of workspaces, and there’s always one empty
workspace present all the way down. ↫ Niri’s GitHub page Definitely an
intriguing idea.</p>
