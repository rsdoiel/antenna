<h2 id="xeon-phi-support-removed-in-gcc-15-compiler">Xeon Phi support
removed in GCC 15 compiler</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in
GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14.
While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow
it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few
years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some
potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom
(and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the
Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ↫ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi
PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse
hovers over the buy button – but I always realise just in time that the
cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them,
already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support
for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he
plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the
card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of
headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point.
GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I’ve said
before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future,
and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this
deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.</p>

<h2 id="modernizing-the-antennapod-code-structure">Modernizing the
AntennaPod code structure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>AntennaPod has been around for a long time – the first bit of code
was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had
several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many
people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes
having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of
thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod
gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest
release, version 3.4, fixes this. ↫ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had
an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years,
they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the
code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they
achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for
this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the
meantime. Pretty incredible.</p>

id="microsoft-gives-windows-new-compiler-kernel-scheduler-and-x86-translation-layer-on-arm">Microsoft
gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer
on ARM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft’s developer conference Build is taking place this week, so
there’s been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once –
we’re not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even “AI”
shoehorned into, I don’t know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan.
First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and
scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing
version number won’t jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the
marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT
version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version
number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically
jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows
8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. “We really focused
on modernizing this update of Windows 11,” said Microsoft Corporate Vice
President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing
on Microsoft’s campus in mid-April. “We engineered this update of
Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the
Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For
us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We
built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new
schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC
architecture.” ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly
on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X
Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that
aren’t from Apple a real, competitive thing – so much so that Qualcomm
is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously
for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86
translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica
that Prism is as fast as Apple’s Rosetta 2, which is interesting because
Apple’s M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the
translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or
is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers
love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across
the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In
addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x
performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface
Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X
Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365
and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ↫ Pete Kyriacou on
the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X
Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings
with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing
unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second.
At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can
boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and
Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a
bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface
Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them
today, but they won’t be available until 18 June.</p>

<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a>
you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext.
Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any
direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two
parties work with each other, and that never happened.
</li>
<li>
In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep
developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn’t wait to
figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way
links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on
top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off,
broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.
</li>
<li>
A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants
to layer a new protocol on top of the web – the Semantic Web. He wanted
people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. “show
me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.” Like that.
</li>
<li>
It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn’t, it
required cooperation. You couldn’t just throw together a demo in an
afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak
from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking
minutes).
</li>
<li>
Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like
functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL’s
Semantic Web. It won’t require any cooperation and that’s why it will
work.
</li>

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6-comes-to-openbsd">KDE Plasma 6 comes to
OpenBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the
OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and
all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5,
2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely
operating system. This success is the result of years of development
work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of
its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous
updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely
proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update
so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS
tree, and the packages will soon be available. ↫ Rafael Sadowski
Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don’t wish to be using GNOME, Xfce,
or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My
dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD,
runs Xfce, because I feel a smaller desktop environment is a more
natural fit for OpenBSD, but I’m very happy to know that I have KDE to
fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the
long term. I’ll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that
community some more time to iron out any wrinkles, and then I’ll
probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with
the OpenBSD base system.</p>

Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool.
DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and
troubleshoot their system’s performance in real-time. DTrace allows
users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code
without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports
a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as
aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn
more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for
additional capabilities. ↫ What’s new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was
originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its
way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle
gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving
Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX,
and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With
Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.</p>

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.17-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add option <code>-C, –create</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the
database before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide
a database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>–dump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter
database statements.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

Let’s get the obvious question out the way first: “why?” And I, errr,
don’t have a good reason. It’s
<a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I’ve
done a big themed running project, but it’s by far the biggest I’ve
<em>ever</em> done.
</p>
<p>
Second obvious question: “was it a good idea?” Kinda… I really enjoyed
running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the
Thames Path is very easy to run on. It’s also mostly well connected with
public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs
manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling
than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than “just” 20
weekend half marathons.
</p>
<p>
The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and
communities across the length of the river. Until now my only
familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through
London or the college boathouses in Oxford.

<p>
An interesting historical pattern with the Thames — as with
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many
English cities</a> — is that effluence flows downstream and affluence
upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames’s role in London’s
history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river.
Land up river became more desirable. It’s no historical accident that
the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of
London.
</p>
<p>
Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices
have improved
(<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a
little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high
in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east
London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a
group of men lamenting the loss of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working
men’s clubs</a>, an important
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in
their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a
<em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group
of friends that taking the train to a party was a “terrifically smart”
decision. (Decisions they made in government weren’t quite so clever.)
</p>
<p>
Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through “green and
pleasant” English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed
a newfound appreciation for it. I’ve genuinely come to believe that
we’re <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to
so much accessible, open space.

I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of
snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch
Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they’re a false
economy: after a few runs they’d start to leak and I’d have to replace
them.

<p>
The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used
<a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned
route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both
OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the
former as they were clearer on the small display.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated
around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on
routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">
Conditions
</h2>
<p>
I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter
months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there
were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my
hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the
path. The
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment
Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden
path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I
had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.
</p>
<p>
I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20º+ and
sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I
regularly ran with a baseball cap.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">
Logistics
</h2>
<p>
I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities
in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one
another</a>.) All in I spent about £400 on train tickets, local buses,
and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but
otherwise I generally optimised for time. I’ve no doubt that booking
advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the
cost by at least £100.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or
equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further £200 on these.
</p>
<p>
Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is
interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities
for boaters, which
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the
Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late
(literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often
includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A
lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.
</p>
<p>
I’ve posted GPX files for all the routes below.

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_1_N_Teddington_Lock_to_Barnes_Bridge.gpx">[1/20]
Teddington to Barnes Bridge (12.7km)</a>: I started by running west with
one of the shortest runs. All of the London sections were very flexible
as the Thames path is rarely more than a few hundred meters from a TfL
connection. Teddington is the final lock on the River Thames and
therefore the start of the “tidal Thames”.

a bus to Wallingford for the start of this one. The Thames Path crosses
the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a
ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever

aside from colleges’ dreaming spires you also see Port Meadow, The Trout
Inn (which features prominently in Philip Pullman’s <em>The Book of
Dust</em>), and the ruins of Godstow Abbey (which features prominently
in <em>Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</em>). I’d argue these are the last
tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside
and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of
the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I
eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.

<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_18_N_Bablock_Hythe_to_Lechlade.gpx">[18/20]

opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe
<a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a>
operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I
therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John’s Lock is
the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream
from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back

Cricklade to Thames Head (22km)</a>: For the final leg through the
Cotswolds I didn’t push the pace at all. The Thames Path hugged the
river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge
I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much
interest in me for my liking … the correct solution was <em>not</em> to
climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them
calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.
</p>
<p>
By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the
spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some
woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn’t recommend doing what
I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few
centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and
then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the
other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em>
find the start.
</p>
<p>
I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of
the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners,
most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite
direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby,
but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught
the train back to London from Kemble.

The final obvious question: “what’s next?” … A break?! The lesson from
this project has been that I don’t mind travel for runs, just so long as
the travel doesn’t take significantly more time than the run itself.
That said, I’ve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the
pipeline…

I were desiging a system to compete with Twitter, I’d implement a
one-click Block button. It should be as easy to block someone as it is
to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To
users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don’t think about it
too much, and certainly don’t be intimidated into not doing it. It must
be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent
blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an
account but not quite this easy. I think they’re probably heading
there.</p>

<p>Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If
the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on
Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season">starts
all over again</a>. With love for the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&t=315s">heart of
gold</a> team. Either way we win, imho. I know you’re not supposed to
feel that way, but that’s how I feel right now. During the game, if
we’re losing, based on recent experience I won’t like that so much.

<h2 id="borg-backups">25. Borg backups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: Blair’s Science Desk</p>
<p>I haven’t posted here in a while! Today, I thought I’d get back in
the habit by posting my Borg backup script. Borg is a command-line
backup app written in Python. It’s blazing fast and features great
de-duplication. To get started with Borg, follow the installation
instructions here. Then, initialize a backup with this command: borg
init /path/to/backup Here’s my backup script. First we make a backup of
my /home directory:</p>
