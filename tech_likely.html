<h1 id="2024-06-23-adjudicating-the-difficulty">
2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty
</h1>
<p>
I was listening in on an exchange between
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a>. They were
talking about <a href="Traveller">Traveller</a> and Peter noted that he
didn’t like the “somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests”.
I don’t like this, either! It’s exhausting. I feel drained when I do it.
</p>
<p>
I started thinking about this for a while and maybe the following
provides for an interesting way to talk about rules in role-playing
games.
</p>
<p>
Note that the problem shows up in many places. For example, I don’t like
“the ladder” in <a href="Fudge">Fudge</a> and <a href="Fate">Fate</a>
games where I as the referee need decide whether opponents are “good” or
“very good” at fighting the player characters. For me, this is the same
problem, except it happens behind the screen. Player’s don’t know about
this.
</p>
<p>
Using classic D&amp;D or similar rules and running a megadungeon is
comparatively easy, because the monster hit dice are tied to dungeon
levels. Once I know the dungeon level, I can pick appropriate monsters
and their stats automatically determine “the difficulty classes of some
tests.” This might be one of the reasons that makes it easier to run
D&amp;D with self-made dungeons.
</p>
<p>
So this is the first solution to the problem of having to assign
difficulties to rolls: The game can have a small number of actions that
require a dice roll. Each roll has clear conditions of success. The
referee doesn’t have to assess the difficulty as soon as the situation
is established. D&amp;D would be an example of this kind of game. You
roll to hit, to do damage, to save, and all the target numbers are known
once the monster is on the table. In classic D&amp;D, traps have only
one difficulty setting so thieves only need to know a single number.
Hidden doors are either concealed or secret. Those are the two difficult
settings for finding the hidden door and thus the referee only needs to
know two numbers (1-in-6 or 2-in-6). Of course it breaks down sometimes
when a module tells you that a particular door is harder to find
(“1-in-8”) or that a lock is harder to pick (“add 20% to the check”).
But generally speaking, as a referee, very little thought is required.
The trade-of is that characters don’t have many “skills”. They have
their attack rolls, their saves, the thieves skills, some other d6
abilities like opening doors and listening, but that’s it.
</p>
<p>
As soon as skills are introduced, the situations in which dice can be
rolled explodes. One way to solve the problem of having to decide the
difficulty of every single roll is to a provide a long list of examples
from which to extrapolate. I haven’t played any game that does that
well. Zweihänder provides seven example uses of the skill, one for each
difficulty rating. That is amazing.
</p>
<p>
A game that has a single roll for every skill (great idea) but then
provides a lot of help adjudicating the rolls in general isn’t helping.
I found this to be the case for the few Basic Role-Playing, Warhammer
Fantasy Roleplay, Rolemaster and HARP games I tried. I didn’t try many
of them. I just checked HARP again and there are examples for some of
the skills and not for others, so I’d have to play it again to remember
whether this was even a problem.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps one possible solution is to just ignore difficulties and to
assume all skill rolls at the default difficulty to be appropriate for
adventures. As far as I can remember, this is how we often played these
games.
</p>
<p>
Mongoose Traveller isn’t helping, either. There, the target number is
always an eight. Almost all the modifiers appear to obvious and well
explained, but with the Task Difficulty Dice Modifiers the “somewhat
mysterious difficulty classes of some tests” is back.
</p>
<p>
Classic Traveller is worse it leans into the referee making up the roll.
Sometimes an examples of a skill is provided (“navigation expertise can
be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed
information”) but most of the time it’s simply a description of where
the skill might be applicable and it’s up to the referee to call for an
appropriate throw, if at all. At the very beginning, skills are
explained as follows: “The acquired skills table provides four basic
types of results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength),
weapons expertise (such as blade combat), transport skills (such as
ATV), and basic skills (such as navigation).” That is to say, sometimes
the skill simply means that something can be done. The example that
comes to mind is how to recover from serious wounds: “Recovery is
dependent on medical attention (a medical facility and an individual
with medical-3 skill; recuperation to full strength without medical
attention is not possible).” The medic doesn’t have to roll at all.
Having the skill is all that counts.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to the last category: negotiation. This what I learned
from Burning Wheel: Before a roll is made, players declare what they
want and the referee determines the difficulty of the roll and explains
the consequences of failure. Then players decide whether they want to
make the roll. Implicitly, they can change their mind, declare a
different goal and see whether they like the odds and consequences
better. I like this a lot.
</p>
<p>
Of course, turning every skill roll into a negotiation can be tiresome.
If people remember what the previous result of similar negotiations was,
the system takes on aspects of case law. As soon as the people of the
table realize that a similar situation was resolved using this or that,
and there are no circumstances that warrant a change, then the
negotiation is skipped.
</p>
<p>
Then again, a long lists of conditions and modifiers can also take on
aspects of case law.
</p>
<p>
So perhaps this is what I think all these rules texts evolve into: Any
rule system where referees set the difficulty imply a system where
players can enter a short negotiation. In order to avoid future
negotiations, the table remembers the outcomes and uses them as
shortcuts for future situations.
</p>
<p>
Once you know this, the approach by some games to simply do a fixed
difficulty roll such as 50% rate of success makes sense if you assume
that there is some sort of negotiation and case law powering it all.
Sometimes the penalty of failure is scorn and insults, sometimes it’s
death. It depends on the situation but there’s always a way to negotiate
for the two outcomes that seem acceptable to the table.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t found a perfect solution, for me. I like it both ways. A game
like <a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberts &amp; Helmets</a> is much
like D&amp;D where as a game like <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> is one
where all effects outside of combat have to be negotiated but it’s not
as wild and free as Classic Traveller.

<h2 id="the-name-siddhartha">The Name ‘Siddhartha’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Since Vivian was a teenager, apparently, it’s been his long-held dream
to name a son Siddhartha and call him Sid for short, so as to honour
both his Hindu heritage <em>and</em> Syd Barrett, his rock ’n’ roll
idol. Pretty much as soon as Viv told me this dream, I poured cold water
on it. Honestly, I did not believe that “Siddhartha” was a name that
actual, real-life human beings are given. Vivian insisted it was, so
after a few years of back-and-forth, I finally deigned to search the
internet to see if I could find any actual, real-life human beings with
this name. The result was that every single “Siddhartha” I found was a
French speaker (of Indian heritage) – professionals living in cities
like Lyon, Geneva, Montreal… so of course I took this back to Vivian and
said all accusatorily, “You want to give our child a French name!”
</p>
<p>
This turns out to be a really good way to wind him up – I can say this,
because he’s compelled me to make the same argument repeatedly since –
because he starts whining, “Nooooo, it’s an Indian name!” and I tell him
that random LinkedIn profiles on the internet don’t lie, and our child
is not getting a French
name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
It’s really funny how worked up he gets about it. Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Now that we’re actually <em>having</em> a child, of course, we’re having
all these discussions again, even though we don’t know Baby’s sex yet.
“Sid” has been Viv’s pet name for the growing creature in my belly, and
I do often go along with it, although I also point out regularly that
that’s <em>never</em> going to be their actual name.
</p>
<p>
“That’s okay,” he jokes, “when you die in childbirth, there’ll be no one
to stop me putting whatever I want on the birth certificate.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha-ha,” I retort, “I hope you’re not gambling on those odds.”
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, we <em>have</em> started putting together an
<em>actual</em> shortlist, consisting of names that are Indian in
origin, but are either <em>also</em> English/Irish names <em>or</em>, at
least, don’t sound markedly foreign in English. This is what Viv said he
really liked about the whole “Siddhartha”/“Sid” thing, and I think
<em>that’s</em> a fair enough goal… just not the actual name
“Siddhartha”. Un­for­tun­ately, Viv’s next favourite name isn’t so much “an
Irish name” as “the Irish word for ‘bread’”, but we’ll get there.

<h2 id="mozilla-acquires-ad-analytics-company-for-some-reason">Mozilla
acquires ad analytics company, for some reason</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of my biggest concerns regarding the state of the web isn’t ads
(easily blocked) or machine learning (the legal system isn’t going to be
kind to that), but the possible demise of Firefox. I’ve long been
worried that with the seemingly never-ending downward marketshare spiral
Firefox is in – it’s at like 3% now on desktop, even less on mobile –
Mozilla’s pretty much sole source of income will eventually pull the
plug, leaving the already struggling browser effectively for dead. I’ve
continuously been warning that the first casualty of the downward spiral
would be Firefox on platforms other than Windows and macOS. So, what do
we make of Mozilla buying an online advertising analytics company?
Mozilla has acquired Anonym, a trailblazer in privacy-preserving digital
advertising. This strategic acquisition enables Mozilla to help raise
the bar for the advertising industry by ensuring user privacy while
delivering effective advertising solutions. ↫ Laura Chambers They way
Mozilla explains buying an advertising network is that the company wants
to be a trailblazer privacy-conscious online advertising, since the
current brand of online advertising, which relies on massive amounts of
data collection, is unsustainable. Anonym instead employs a number of
measures to ensure that privacy is guaranteed, from anonymous analytics
to employing differential privacy when it comes to algorithms, ensuring
data can’t be used to tack individual users. I have no reason to doubt
Mozilla’s intentions here – at least for now – but intentions change,
people in charge change, and circumstances change. Having an ad network
integrated into the Mozilla organisation will surely lead to temptations
of weakening Firefox’ privacy features and ad-blocking abilities, and
just overall I find it an odd acquisition target for something like
Mozilla, and antithetical to why most people use Firefox in the first
place. What really doesn’t help is who originally founded Anonym – two
former Facebook executives, backed by a load of venture capital. Do with
that little tidbit of information as you please.</p>

<p>Amazon’s plans to shift its packaging strategy points at a new front
in the lengthy tug of war between paper and plastic—a war that started
in grocery stores.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search&quot;&gt;Should I remove this blog from Google Search?&lt;/a&gt;” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s
obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies
don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a
server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We
could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual
users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of
us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t
gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are
only two options left:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because
that’s just the world we live in
</li>
<li>
Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our
content
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas’s post made me also think
about something else. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals
content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it
all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the
TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I
would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar,
radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding
investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew
it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return
any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously
not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?

<p>I don’t think it does. Not for everything. We already have personal

<p>The tech news has had a lot of coverage recently of Microsoft’s
proposed ‘Recall‘ system, which (as a very rough approximation) takes a
screenshot of your display every five seconds, and uses their AI-type
Copilot system to allow you to search it. “What was that cafe or
restaurant that someone in the call recommended yesterday?”

<h2 id="andrew-s.-tanenbaum-receives-acm-software-system-award">Andrew
S. Tanenbaum receives ACM Software System Award</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU
Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which
influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple
generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used
operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987
to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.
MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM
PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code,
and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file
system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source
software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for
Tanenbaum, and it’s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens
to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in
2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our
belt.</p>
