Gerald P. Carr, Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue began the new

id="asus-new-graphics-cards-and-motherboards-replace-12vhpwr-connector-with-a-600w-pcie">ASUS’
new graphics cards and motherboards replace 12VHPWR connector with a
600W PCIe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>At CES 2024, ASUS unveiled a new standard for motherboards, graphics
cards, and cases. Called BTF (short for Back-to-The-Future), it offers
much cleaner cable management with power connectors at the back of a
motherboard. More importantly, it fully ditches the ill-fated 12VHPWR
plug in favor of a much tidier (and probably safer) 600W PCIe connector.
ASUS claims computers with BTF components are easier to assemble since
all plugs and connectors are located at the back side of the motherboard
tray without other components obstructing access to power, SATA, USB,
IO, and other connectors. Therefore, “you won’t have to reach as far
into the depth of your chassis to plug things in.” BTF should also make
cable management much more elegant, resulting in a tidy, showcase-ready
build. ↫ Taras Buria at NeoWin The interior of PCs effectively hasn’t
changed since the ’80s, and it feels like it, too. Many of the
connectors and plugs are unwieldy, in terrible places, hard to
connect/disconnect, difficult to route, and so on. A lot more needs to
be done than putting the connectors on the back of the motherboard and
integrating GPU power delivery into the PCIe slot, but even baby steps
like these are downright revolutionary in the conservative,
change-averse, anti-user world of PC building. I don’t say this very
often, but basically, look at the last Intel Mac Pro. That’s what a
modern PC should look and work like inside.</p>

<h2 id="ideas-for-reading-lists">Ideas for Reading Lists</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html">reading list</a>
is a list of feeds you can subscribe to.
</p>
<p>
The author of the list can add or remove feeds. When they do, people who
subscribe to the list are subscribed to the new feeds and unsubbed from
the ones that leave.
</p>
<p>
Reading lists are not a new topic, I and others have been
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+reading+lists">writing</a>
about
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=opml+reading+lists">them</a>
for years. But they’ve not been used seriously in the past because they
weren’t widely supported in feed readers.
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, my latest feed manager,
has reading list support built-in. And we’re serious about starting new
communities of feeds and users with this feature.
</p>
<p>
If you’re a feed reader user, you probably know about using OPML to move
your subscriptions from one app to another, or to share lists with
friends.
</p>
<p>
Reading lists take it one step further, you can subscribe to a reading
list, so you can control one app from another.
</p>
<p>
Say I had a reading list with my favorite podcasts and my podcasting
client could subscribe to it. Then when I add a feed to that list on my
desktop computer, the podcast client would automatically be subscribed
to it. Or if I used two or more podcast clients (say one on Android and
one on iOS), I could control both from the same subscription list.
</p>
<p>
It factors out subscribing. Now you can use one app to manage
subscriptions and use lots of apps to read them.
</p>
<p>
What’s cool about this is that it opens up the possibility for lots of
viewer apps. A podcast client is a special kind of feed reader. I’m sure
others are possible. But first, to make this practical we need to do
better with subscriptions. That’s what reading lists are for.
</p>
<p>
Another idea. Suppose we wanted to put together a big list of great
blogs about Major League Baseball (just an example). I might know a few
about the Mets, and my friend Scott who lives in Mountain View, CA,
would have a bunch about the Giants. We could put together a group of
100 avid baseball fans, and one of us could put out a reading list for
all of our feeds merged into one list. It’s not so far-fetched,
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> can do that today.
</p>
<p>
I could see a similar “big blogroll” for the IndieWeb, or for Bluesky
developers – or really anything. We just have to get started, prime the
pump, and learn how this works.
</p>
<p>
I felt it was really important to get reading lists built into FeedLand
in the current release, because now we’re in a position, with the
improvements in scaling, to act as a organizing node for new activities
with feeds.
</p>
<p>
This is another form of federation, it’s more ad hoc, and doesn’t
require very much technical knowledge. If you know how to use a feed
reader, and move around OPML files, you can do all of what I describe in
this piece.

<h2 id="ecosia">Ecosia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/ecosia.png" alt="screenshot of the ecosia homepage with a search bar in the middle and playful colors and illustrations at the borders" height="719" width="1200">
<p>
Last year I switched my default search engine twice. First from Bing to
Duck Duck Go. It felt different but during
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/01/shadow-banned-by-duckduckgo-and-bing/">my
Bing de-listing fiasco</a> I learned that Duck Duck Go and lots of other
smaller search engines use the Bing Index. One of the more interesting
engines I learned about was Ecosia, a green search engine that I
switched to a couple months ago.
</p>
<p>
Ecosia’s twist on the search engine game is that for every ~50 searches
you do, they plant 1 tree. They serve you ads and that revenue pays for
trees. It seems gimmicky or unbelievable, but Ecosia posts
<a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/">all
their financials are on their website</a>. I find that to be a
refreshing amount of transparency from a search engine. According to the
website, in October they financed the planting of ~2.5 million trees in
12 different countries. That’s admirable.
</p>
<p>
Getting rewarded by a search engine for searching isn’t new to me. I
switched to Bing in 2015 as part of #davegoeswindows and one neat side
effect was that I got “Bing Bucks” for my searches which I could convert
into gift cards to use at real stores; paid to play. For years I ran a
grift of converting Bing Bucks into Robux for the kids. Now I’m doing
that same grift, but for trees for my children’s future. In a couple
months since switching I’ve funded 20 trees which feels nice.
</p>
<p>
How big of a difference can a “green” search engine make? Good question
and I spent a dumb amount of time looking into this.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02001.pdf">Based on some
research</a> Ecosia calculates that one search offsets 50kg of CO₂.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The tree planting that we’re doing, with each search, you’re actually
removing around 50 kilograms of CO₂.” Source:
<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-rate-hikes-for-bing-use-may-put-this-google-alternative-out-of">PCMag</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Is 50kg a lot? It sounds like a lot, but I need that in terms I
understand. This summer I learned that
<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/contentincludes/co2_inc.htm">a
gallon of gas weighs 6.3lbs (2.8kg) yet produces 20lbs (9kg) of CO₂</a>.
Gas is a form of carbon emissions I understand, so let’s use that as a
baseline.
</p>
<p>
If my math is correct and every search removes 50kg of CO₂… that’s equal
to offsetting 5.5 gallons of gas… or about one jerrycan.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/search-jerry.svg" alt="illustration of a magnifying glass with 1x, two equals signs, and a crude jerry can" height="390" width="798">
<p>
<a href="(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/Standard_SUV_2WD2023.shtml)">According
to FuelEconomy.gov, the average non-hybrid/non-electric SUV in 2024 gets
an average of ~20.6
MPG</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.
One search then offsets ~113 miles of driving in an
SUV<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>.
Making that specific to my life, it takes three searches to offset a
tank of gas in my Volvo and seven for my F-150. Those numbers are good
enough to make me a bit skeptical.
</p>
<p>
Planting trees isn’t a climate silver
bullet<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>.
Trees take years to grow and a gallon of gas burns in less than an hour.
Trees will struggle to grow in hotter climates as well. There’s no
replacement for carbon reduction…but —as we say in Texas— it’s not
nothing? Tree planting is potentially
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aax0848#:~:text=Excluding%20existing%20trees%20and%20agricultural%20and%20urban%20areas%2C%20we%20found%20that%20there%20is%20room%20for%20an%20extra%200.9%20billion%20hectares%20of%20canopy%20cover%2C%20which%20could%20store%20205%20gigatonnes%20of%20carbon%20in%20areas%20that%20would%20naturally%20support%20woodlands%20and%20forests.">a
220 gigaton opportunity</a> and currently the only viable form of carbon
capture and storage.
</p>
<p>
I looked into how much planting a tree costs and the prices vary from $1
to $3 dollars. The
<a href="https://shop.arborday.org/campaign/reforestation-007/give">Arbor
Day Foundation</a> costs $1/tree,
<a href="https://preserve.nature.org/page/81927/donate/1?engrid_session=MTMxNDk0ZjEtOGEwYi00OWZhLTlkMzItN2I5ZWYzMTBlOGEyfDE3MDMxMjUwNDZ8MTcwMzEyNTA4OXwxfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3NpYS5vcmd8fGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3NpYS5vcmd8">The
Nature Conservancy</a> and
<a href="https://treeswaterpeople.org/give-a-gift">Trees, Water,
People</a> both cost ~$2/tree. And Ecosia’s own
<a href="https://plant.ecosia.org/products/trees-for-climate-action?variant=37125904662702">Ecosia
Tree Store</a> comes in at the highest at $3/tree. That means by
searching I’ve planted anywhere from $20-$60 worth of trees. It might be
more effective if I donated a lump sum and installed an ad blocker; but
Ecosia’s trees are an entirely passive benefit and that makes it
sustainable for me. I think about it like putting a solar panel on my
air conditioner.
</p>
<p>
Ecosia’s use of the Bing Index might be a dealbreaker for some, but all
that might be changing! Due to a price hike in the Bing Index,
<a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/new-search-features/">Ecosia announced
that in certain locales they’re switching to the Google Index</a>. I’ve
used Bing’s Index for years so this isn’t a problem for me, but I
understand people are picky about their search results. I’d also call
out that <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/birth-death-seo/">the entire
SEO ecosystem is changing with the advent of AI</a> and the reliability
of search results will experience a tectonic shift. Speaking of AI… at
the end of that same announcement post, Ecosia says they’re piloting an
experimental AI Chat feature.
</p>
<p>
Ecosia is a feel-good search engine and I love the idea of a
benefit-corp style search engine. I want my “behavioral exhaust”
(<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">Zubhoff,
2019</a>) to replenish the environment rather than fund the
techno-monopoly war chest. Ecosia is a welcome change in my online life.
It’s well-designed compared to other search engines and planting 20
trees feels good. If we all pointed our search bars at Ecosia for a
while, what kind of difference could we make. Alone, we will never make
a dent in the climate but together we stand a chance.
</p>
<p>
And that’s where I wanted to end this review but…
</p>
<p>
I wanted this to be a review of a new’ish search engine that I enjoy,
but I need to address the LLM in the room. In short, the AI feature
seems off-brand for Ecosia –like Captain Planet getting into Bitcoin. At
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generative-ai-water-use-environmental-impact-study-2023-4">500ml
of water for every 20 prompts</a> or
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-gpt4-iowa-ai-water-consumption-microsoft-f551fde98083d17a7e8d904f8be822c4">1.7
billion gallons of water to train GPT</a>, LLMs use a lot of energy and
resources. Ecosia claims they are able to offset the carbon costs of
LLMs – I’d love to see more data on this – but when every search engine
is experimenting in this space, it’d be nice to have an option that’s
taking a different path.

controversial firings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Yesterday, we told you about the tumult at the Houston Landing, where
the newsroom’s journalists are protesting Monday’s surprise firing of
editor-in-chief Mizanur Rahman and investigative reporter Alex Stuckey.
Later on Monday, staffers sent a letter to the Landing’s six-member
board decrying CEO Peter Bhatia‘s moves, which he said were necessary
for a still-vague “reset”…</p>

day 2 of using new keyboard. it’s lovely. the extra attention to
accoustics is really appreciated. it’s quiet and feels wonderful. even
bottoming out the keys has a soft feel from the baseplate being on
gaskets.

<p>
Travel distance to the arrow keys is about 2cm different than my last
keyboard, so i’m adjusting. But I once again have a glorious numpad!

<h2 id="ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux">Ayaneo
Next Lite handheld announced with SteamOS Linux</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>inally we’re seeing another handheld vendor jump in with Linux. The
AYANEO NEXT LITE was announced today and much like the Steam Deck, they
plan to ship it with SteamOS! AYANEO are one of the top brands when it
comes to PC handhelds, so it’s really interesting to see them be one of
the first to jump in like this. If Linux is a success for them, no doubt
they will do more and other vendors will follow along. ↫ Liam Dawe It
was inevitable for SteamOS to spread beyond just the Steam Deck, but an
important note to make here is that Ayaneo is not working together with
Valve. Instead, they’re using HoloIso, one of the community-maintained
variants of SteamOS anyone can use and install. I’m a bit surprised by
this, since moving SteamOS beyond just Valve products in an official
capacity seems like a no-brainer for Valve; they’re not really in it for
the hardware money, after all, and instead earn their money from Steam
game sales. I’m fairly convinced this isn’t the last time we’re seeing a
non-Valve product with SteamOS, but I’d rather have Valve involved in
the process before spending any money on one of these.</p>

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, students are increasingly
interacting with AI-powered applications when listening to music,
writing assignments, and shopping online. As educators, it’s our
responsibility to equip them with the skills to critically evaluate
these technologies. A key aspect of this is understanding
‘explainability’ in AI and machine learning (ML) systems. The

<h2
id="trying-to-be-the-ideal-american-family-with-a-small-fridge">Trying
to be the ideal American family with a small fridge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m coming to the realization when you’re a family with a small fridge
you cannot be all these platonic ideals at the same time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The buy in bulk Costco family
</li>
<li>
The big weekly shopping trip family
</li>
<li>
The cook/order extra and eat leftovers family
</li>
<li>
The cook extra and freeze it family
</li>
<li>
The meal prep family
</li>
<li>
The freezer full of frozen smoothie ingredients family
</li>
<li>
The buy one-off condiments, sauces, or pickles family
</li>
<li>
The keep fresh fruits and veggies on hand family
</li>
<li>
The make my kids lunches family
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At best you can be one of these or buy a garage fridge. People with two
fridges seem content. Some industrious folks keep a whole deer or half a
cow in there. I’m not going that overboard, I need a home for a bag of
chicken nuggies, tamales from Arizona, and some ice cream.
</p>
<p>
Interesting predicament, small fridges. Instagram Reel-esque lifehacks
could save my family some real money, reduce waste, and make food
choices more healthy or interesting. I don’t want an extra fridge
humming in the garage getting slimy, but I also don’t want to go to the
store every other day. Good grief, Charlie Brown.

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.14-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.14 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Zurich, Switzerland - January 10th, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
pg_dumpbinary 2.14 was released today, it adds two new options and fixes
some bugs reported by users since last release.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add new option <code>–with-child</code>, when <code>-t</code> or
<code>-T</code> options are used, to include or exclude child and
partition tables. pg_dump will be used instead with options
<code>–table-and-children</code> or
<code>–exclude-table-and-children</code>. It requires PostgreSQL &gt;=
16.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>-V, –verbose</code> option that lists tables included in the
dump.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>-A, –attach SNAPSHOT</code> to be able to attach pg_dumpbinary
to an existing snapshot instead of creating a dedicated one.
</li>
<li>
Fix dump failure when sequences name have spaces.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full list of changes and acknowledgments can be found
<a href="https://github.com/lzlabs/pg_dumpbinary/releases/tag/v2.14">here</a>
</p>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first ‘\0’, resulting in data loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

<h2 id="greenmask-v0.1.0-release">Greenmask v0.1.0 Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-11, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL Dump and Obfuscation Tool
</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the release of Greenmask v0.1.0, marking the
first production-ready version. This release addresses various bug
fixes, introduces improvements, and includes documentation refactoring
for enhanced clarity.
</p>
<h3>
Greenmask overview
</h3>
<h4>
Key Features
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Cross-Platform Support: Developed in Go, Greenmask is free of platform
dependencies.
</li>
<li>
Type-Safe Database Operations: Ensures data validation and encoding,
maintaining integrity.
</li>
<li>
Transformation Validation: Guarantees correct and maintainable data
transformations.
</li>
<li>
Partitioned Table Support: Eases configuration for partitioned tables.
</li>
<li>
Stateless and Backward Compatible: Compatible with standard PostgreSQL
utilities.
</li>
<li>
Parallel Execution: Boosts efficiency in dumping and restoration
processes.
</li>
<li>
Multiple Storage Options: Offers support for both local and remote
storage solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Use Cases
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Perfect for routine backup and restoration tasks.
</li>
<li>
Aids in anonymization and data masking for staging environments and
analytics.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Release notes
</h3>
<h4>
Improvements
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Improved verbosity in custom transformer interaction, accumulating
stderr data and forwarding it in batches instead of writing it one by
one.
</li>
<li>
Added positional arguments for the list-transformers command, allowing
specific transformer information retrieval (e.g., <code>greenmask
list-transformers RandomDate</code>).
</li>
<li>
Added version parameter –version that prints greenmask utility version
</li>
<li>
Added Numeric parameters support for Int and Float transformers, with
the caveat that in a few cases, it may lead to out-of-range errors.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Changes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Updated dependencies to newer versions.
</li>
<li>
Enhanced the stability of the JSON line interaction protocol by
utilizing the stdlib JSON encoder/decoder.
</li>
<li>
Modified the method for sending table metadata to custom transformers;
now, it is sent via stdin in the first line in JSON format instead of
providing it via command arguments.
</li>
<li>
Refactored template functions naming.
</li>
<li>
Rewritten NoiseDate transformer implementation for improved stability
and predictability.
</li>
<li>
Changed the default value for the Dict transformer fail_not_matched
parameter to true.
</li>
<li>
Rewritten Hash transformer, now providing a salt parameter and receiving
a base64 encoded salt. If a salt is not provided, it generates one
randomly.
</li>
<li>
Added validator for NoiseDate and RandomDate transformers for the
truncate parameter, issuing a warning if the provided value is invalid.
</li>
<li>
Increased verbosity of parameter validation warnings, now properly
forwarding warnings to stdout.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Fixes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Resolved pgx driver connection leakage issue.
</li>
<li>
Fixed deletion failure of dumps for S3 storage.
</li>
<li>
Corrected cobra autocompletion for the Greenmask utility.
</li>
<li>
Fixed NOT NULL constraint validation.
</li>
<li>
Addressed JSON API interaction issues that previously caused deadlocks
and timeouts.
</li>
<li>
Fixed encode-decoding for binary parameters, ensuring accurate
forwarding of values to custom transformers.
</li>
<li>
Fixed the RandomChoice transformer to correctly marshal and unmarshal

operating system interface made in Godot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to GodotOS, an operating system interface created entirely in
Godot! Browse folders, edit text files, view images, play games, and
more in one cohesive polished interface that can even be used on the
web! GodotOS is more of a toy than a serious project. It’s meant to push
the limits on UI design in Godot while creating a desktop that is
minimalist, distraction-free, and aesthetically pleasing. Aside from
that, GodotOS is also meant to be a hub for small games and experiences
that can easily be bundled in. ↫ GodotOS GitHub page You can try the
online version right here, but also download it and use it that way
instead.</p>

<p>Vcc – the Vulkan Clang Compiler, is a proof-of-concept C and C++
compiler for Vulkan leveraging Clang as a front-end, and Shady our own
research IR and compiler. Unlike other shading languages, Vcc aims to
stick closely to standard C/C++ languages and merely adds a few new
intrinsics to cover GPU features. Vcc is similar to CUDA or Metal in
this regard, and aims to bring the advantages of standard host languages
to Vulkan shaders. ↫ The Vcc website Note that this project is a work in
progress, and has several limitations the project’s open about.</p>

<h2 id="the-biggest-smallest-png">The biggest smallest PNG</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few days ago, my former coworker Evan Hahn posted “The world’s
smallest PNG”, an article walking through the minimum required elements
of the PNG image format. He gave away the answer in the very first line:
However (spoilers!) he later points out that there are several valid
67-byte PNGs, such as a 1×1 all-white image, or an 8×1 all-black image,
or a 1×1 gray image. All of these exploit the fact that you can’t have
less than one byte of pixel data, so you might as well use all eight
bits of it. Clever! However again…are we really limited to one byte of
pixel data? ↫ Jordan Rose You know where this is going.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>Big news today, via Stephanie Palazzolo at The Information: the group
Public Citizen yesterday petitioned the state California to reevaluate
OpenAI’s nonprofit status. As Robert Weissman, the President of Public
Citizen put it to me on a phone call, the OpenAI drama seemed in part to
be a showdown between for profit and nonprofit aspects of the
organization; it is not clear that organization as whole has remained
true to its nonprofit mission. “I don’t think it’s a radical argument we
are making. There was a competition here and the faction that won wanted
to pursue profit.”</p>

<h2 id="accessible-fart-machines">Accessible Fart Machines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>

</iframe>
<p>
I stumbled across this TED talk by Holly Cohen about building accessible
fart machines with Arduino. As someone who loves to tell jokes – and
particularly loves a good fart joke – the phrase “they were the ones
telling the jokes” makes me impossibly happy.
</p>
<p>
When I was a teacher in Japan I taught two young sisters with cerebral
palsy. Both girls could neither move nor talk but they loved to smile
and laugh at a good joke or goof about their teachers – like any other
junior high school kid. The highlight of my week was hanging out with
those girls, I know they would have loved their own fart machine.
</p>
<p>
In 2018 (two years after this talk), Microsoft launched their
revolutionary $99
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller">Xbox
Adaptive Controller</a> which is helping kids with motor control
difficulties play video games. It’s like the adaptive tech shown at the
end of Cohen’s talk, but way more professional. It must have cost a
pretty penny to design, research, and productize this device. So what’s
the ROI on creating an accessible interface? It doesn’t fuckin’ matter.
That’s what. It’s about bringing people in on the fun.

behind us, but I’ve only managed to do that in certain ways. For
example, I have standardized on a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedland/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a>
file for each of my projects and I’m pretty good about updating it. I
also publish the OPML source of my code, which contains a lot more in
the way of internal docs than the JavaScript files I publish alongside
them, simply because the outline format lends itself to inline docs, and
I have been doing that systematically for at least thirty years. And I
now include the OPML source in most projects in a file called
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark/blob/master/source.opml">source.opml</a>.
There’s a big comment at the top of each of the files at the top that
explains. If you’re interested, work backward through the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting?tab=repositories">directory</a> of
my repos.</p>

<h2 id="overturn-an-election">“Overturn an election?”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase
that seems wrong to me, I’ll work on it until I figure out why it seems
wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea.
</p>
<p>
That said, I don’t think Trump tried to “overturn an election.”
</p>
<p>
More accurately, he tried to “overthrow the government.”
</p>
<p>
Why I say that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of
a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would
be overturn. Overturn doesn’t convey the illegitimacy of what Trump
tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American
values. He tried to “overturn” our most sacred ritual, the transfer of
power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people.
Overthrow is a much better word for what was done.
</li>
<li>
When you commit a crime, say for example killing someone, we don’t say
they tried to illegally use a weapon, that’s too technical, we say
they’re “accused of murder.” We focus on the consequences. There are
lots of ways to illegally use a weapon, what matters is the intended
result.
</li>
<li>
There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all
circumstances. It’s spelled out in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">20th
Amendment</a>.
</li>
<li>
On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when
Joe Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0">took the
oath</a>, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath,
at 12PM exactly.
</li>
<li>
You can also look at the government as a continuous thing, the only
difference is there is a new person occupying the office of president.
Same government, the one defined by the Constitution. Always on.
</li>
<li>
So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy
the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn’t
follow the Constitution.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-mimo-diaries">The Mimo Diaries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/i-m-taking-over-minimalissimo-for-real-this-time">In
a post a couple of weeks ago</a>, I mentioned that I was going to take
over Minimalissimo—aka Mimo—starting January 1st and that I was planning
to blog about the whole experience.
</p>
<p>
Well, it’s January 10th, I am in charge of the site and I do plan to
post updates on this journey under the title <em>“The Mimo Diaries”</em>
and this is the first entry of the series.
</p>
<p>
So how is it going? I’d say so far so good. If you are a visitor of the
site you might have noticed that a first change is already in place:
posts no longer have short text content. Let me explain the reasoning
behind that decision.
</p>
<h2>
Writing on the web
</h2>
<p>
Minimalissimo started back in 2009 and the web was a very different
place. Content generation and content consumption were substantially
different than they are now and it made sense to have a “traditional”
blog/magazine with text and images.
</p>
<p>
But I believe that is no longer true in 2024. I’m not saying writing on
the web is pointless, quite the contrary. What I’m saying is that I
don’t think there’s much added value to the user in writing short posts
to go along with the images on the site. It’s probably useful from a SEO
perspective but, as you know, I don’t care about SEO all that much. I
care about users and user experience. And I think the value that Mimo
provides is in the visual curation, not in the written content.
</p>
<p>
Now, that is true for short posts but it’s definitely not true for the
newsletter. I do plan to keep that one going and make it a more
important part of the Mimo ecosystem. The newsletter is going to be the
place for longer content, focused on the topic of minimalism. That’s my
current plan and we’ll see how it goes. So,
<a href="https://buttondown.email/minimalissimo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make
sure you subscribe to the Minimalissimo newsletter</a> if you want to
get the full Minimalissimo experience.

<h2 id="hobbes-os2-archive-to-shut-down-in-three-months">Hobbes OS/2
Archive to shut down in three months</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve got some seriously bad news for the OS/2 community. Hobbes, the
massive software archive for OS/2 (and thus eComStation and ArcaOS),
which hosts both old software as well as more recent releases, is
shutting down in three months. After many years of service,
hobbes.nmsu.edu will be decommissioned and will no longer be available.
You the user are responsible for downloading any of the files found in
this archive if you want them. These files will no longer be available
for access or download as of the decommission date. As of April 15th,
2024 this site will no longer exist. No one will be able to access this
site or any information/files stored on this site as of April 15th,
2024. I don’t even know how old Hobbes is, but I feel like it’s been
around for decades. Seeing it being shut down is incredibly sad to read,
but also a sign of the times for whatever’s left of the OS/2 community.
Two of the four listed mirrors seem to be up, namely SunSITE Poland and
Infania Networks in Sweden. We’ll see how long those last, but my advice
to anyone interested in OS/2 – download the Hobbes archive and store it
locally.</p>

than that it perfectly illustrates the problems Windows on one side, and

2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s CES, and Google has made a number of disparate, small
announcements about upcoming Android features. 9To5Google has collected
them all, and it seems there’s not many things of interest here, nor are
there any big changes or improvements. The only thing that stands out to
me is that easy Bluetooth device pairing is coming to more scenarios.
First announced at CES 2022, Fast Pair support is rolling out to the
Chromecast with Google TV “in the next month.” This seamless Bluetooth
pairing with an onscreen “Connect now” prompt for headphones is coming
to “more Google TV devices later this year.” ↫ Abner Li for 9To5Google
Bluetooth pairing is an unpleasant experience, so seeing fast pairing
become more popular is good news.</p>

id="nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-is-anti-blur-monitor-tech-aimed-squarely-at-your-eyeball">Nvidia’s
G-Sync Pulsar is anti-blur monitor tech aimed squarely at your
eyeball</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Motion blur, when it’s not caused by slow LCD pixel transitions, is
caused by “the persistence of an image on the retina, as our eyes track
movement on-screen,” as Nvidia explains it. Prior improvements in
display tech, like variable rate refresh, Ultra Low Motion Blur, and
Variable Overdrive have helped with the hardware causes of this
deficiency. The eyes and their object permanence, however, can only be
addressed by strobing a monitor’s backlight. You can’t just set that
light blinking, however. Variable strobing frequencies causes flicker,
and timing the strobe to the monitor refresh rate—itself also tied to
the graphics card output—was tricky. Nvidia says it has solved that
issue with its G-Sync Pulsar tech, employing “a novel algorithm” in
“synergizing” its variable refresh smoothing and monitor pulsing. The
result is that pixels are transitioned from one color to another at a
rate that reduces motion blur and pixel ghosting. ↫ Kevin Purdy for Ars
Technica Cool technology, of course, but also another attempt by Nvidia
to put Nvidia-specific chips inside monitors to cash in on royalties and
tie people to Nvidia GPUs. Their previous attempt – G-Sync – was
eventually thwarted, but they’re clearly trying again.</p>

Nix flakes the non-flake way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Flakes also are a symptom or cause of much intra-community strife
between “pro-flakes” and “anti-flakes” factions, but this situation is
at some level a sign of broken consensus processes and various actors
trying to sidestep them, an assumption by many people that the docs are
“outdated” for not using flakes, and the bizarre proliferation of flakes
everywhere in blog posts or tutorials leading to a belief that they are
required for everything. This post is about how to architect Nix
projects in general, with a special eye on how to do so with flakes
while avoiding their limitations. It tries to dispel misconceptions that
can develop in such a monoculture. ↫ Jade Every time I hear about Nix
and Flakes I feel like I understand all of it a little less.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-from-moving-house">Quotes from moving house</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/moving.jpg" width="1200" height="630" alt="drawing of a cardboard box and some bubble wrap in an empty room">
<p>
I’ve moved house over sixteen times in my lifetime (more if you count
step-homes). Apartment to house, city to city, state to state, country
to country; I’ve done it all. I’ve even lived in a couple
pseudo-communes with over 6+ roommates. Thinking back, I realized I have
little phrases –some synesthetic little audio cues– attached to each
major life change. Here’s a handful of my favorites.
</p>
<h2>
“Always WATCH YOUR BACK.”
</h2>
<p>
In 2003 I got accepted to JET Programme and would be moving to Japan for
one to three years. You apply in December, interview in January, get
accepted in April, and leave in July. It’s a sudden transition for an
overseas move. In April I found out I’d be living in a small town called
Sasayama in Hyogo Prefecture. It looked cute, had a castle, and the
town’s website had an animated gif of a dancing mayor. Part of the JET
Programme’s tradition is that your predecessor writes you a little note
introducing the town and job before you arrive. In July I got an email
and inside was the following phrase repeated seven times…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Always WATCH YOUR BACK.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yikes. It’s two weeks or so before I board a plane to live in a country
I’ve never even visited. Although self-evident by the tone of the
letter, I later learned my predecessor had a hard time in our small
town. She entered a relationship with another JET teacher and when they
wanted to live together that caused a local stir where city hall got
involved. That’s small town life for you.
</p>
<p>
What an ominous letter to get before you move overseas!
</p>
<h2>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</h2>
<p>
We rolled up to our house in South Austin in a bright yellow Penske
truck. We trekked across the desert from California and would officially
become homeowners that day. As we were unloading the truck a neighbor in
her mid seventies stepped out to meet us. She was so kind and after some
small talk she asked a question I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And that began almost 9 years of weekly breakfasts at Dan’s Hamburgers
with our neighbor Cleo. She’s more than a sweet grandmotherly neighbor
to our children, she was their best friend. Every day my kids would wake
up and demand to go see Cleo.
</p>
<p>
I also can’t forget our eighty year old neighbor Nellie’s big entrance
after meeting Cleo. Fresh from cataracts surgery wearing a night gown
and an eye-patch, she stumbled across her yard into the street to start
giving us all the gossip we could ask for on the neighborhood. “That’s
old Gene and his wife died…”, “She’s an old maid…”, and another line
I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tread lightly with them over there…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
About as Texan as it gets. We stayed in that house nine years and saw
the street turnover. We outgrew our 2 bedroom/2 bath house, so we moved
north in 2018. There’s lots to miss about the old place (big yard,
proximity to Dan’s Hamburgers), but we miss our friend Cleo the most.
</p>
<h2>
“We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween”
</h2>
<p>
When I introduced myself to my new neighbor in North Austin, she was
friendly but a bit somber as she mentioned her husband passed away six
months prior. She welcomed us to the neighborhood, asked about our kids,
and then proceeded to lay out the two ground rules for the street…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I felt shame looking down at my unkempt yard. She handed me a business
card for her mowers and I hired them that day. And she wasn’t kidding
about Halloween. Our street is basically <em>the</em> street in the
neighborhood for Halloween. We have a 9-foot tall inflatable Beetlejuice
sand worm in our yard every October, so I like to think we’re fulfilling
our neighborly obligations… but my yard still looks like shit.

<p>
The <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT
Reform</a>’s design, the components, <em>everything</em>—is open source.
If iFixIt did a teardown, they’d probably give it an 11 out of 10.
</p>
<p>
You can replace <em>individual battery cells!</em> Some people with
these laptops hacked in their own speakers, added more internal
Ethernet, or even swapped out the CPU itself.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean I think you should buy it? No, probably not. It’s
expensive (<a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">starting
at €1199</a>), and it’s built for a certain type of person. It’s not
gonna replace a MacBook or a cheap Chromebook.
</p>
<p>
But why does this exist, and why am I excited about it?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The reform used in this review was sent to
me for testing; it’s already been shipped back to MNT Research. They
haven’t paid me anything, and they have no input into the content of

I first heard this term in speeches given by a tech exec,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy">Scott McNealy</a>,
talking about a competitor’s product. A hairball is something a cat
coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software
becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product
is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new
paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a
human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before,
unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a
good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are
open to new ideas.</p>

<p>I asked “Is news copyrightable” on various social web sites because
people aren’t making a distinction between the expression and the
underlying facts of news. If an AI bot reads a news article, and
extracts the facts, then there’s no problem, because no one owns the
facts.</p>

<p>A puzzle about ChatGPT. How can it get something right that both
Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a
source, thus propagating its lies and mistakes. I think this negates the
idea that they’re just scanning the news orgs to get their information.
The method obviously is more sophisticated.</p>

<h2 id="influxdb-fdw-2.1.0-release">InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 released
</p>
<p>
We have just released version 2.1.0 of the Foreign Data Wrapper for
InfluxDB. This release can work with PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
</p>
<p>
This release improves following item (from 2.0.0):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support PostgreSQL 16.0
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: Cannot delete when time series column defined as timestamptz
type
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FDW supports following features :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports pushed down some aggregate functions: count,
stddev, sum, max, min.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports INSERT, DELETE statements.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports bulk INSERT by using batch_size option from
PostgreSQL version 14 or later.
</li>
<li>
WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and now() functions are
pushed down.
</li>
<li>
LIMIT…OFFSET clauses are pushed down when there is LIMIT clause only or
both LIMIT and OFFSET.
</li>
<li>
Support schemaless mode that allows access to elements in the data file
without changing the table definition by using jsonb typed column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UPDATE is not supported.
</li>
<li>
WITH CHECK OPTION constraints is not supported. Following limitations
originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.
</li>
<li>
Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target
list. For example, SELECT field1 FROM t1 and SELECT field2 FROM t1
returns different number of rows if the number of points with field1 and
field2 are different in InfluxDB database.
</li>
<li>
Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of
PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.
</li>
<li>
Conditions like WHERE time + interval ‘1 day’ &lt; now() do not work.
Please use WHERE time &lt; now() - interval ‘1 day’.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i4oa-hall-of-fame---2023-edition">I4OA Hall of Fame - 2023
edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://i4oa.org/" target="_blank">Initiative for Open
Abstracts (I4OA)</a> was launched in September 2020 to advocate and
promote the unrestricted availability of the abstracts of the world’s
scholarly publications, particularly journal articles and book chapters,
in trusted repositories where they are open and machine-accessible. I4OA
calls on all scholarly publishers to open the abstracts of their
published works and, where possible, to submit them to Crossref.
</p>
<p>
Since the launch of I4OA, we have been tracking the openness of
abstracts for all Crossref members over time (for data and code, see
this <a href="https://github.com/bmkramer/I4OA" target="_blank">GitHub
repository</a>). For a subset of 40+, mostly larger, publishers, the
proportion of current journal articles (published in the current year
and preceding two years) that have abstracts deposited in Crossref is
shown in a
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=are%20shown%20in-,orange,-." target="_blank">chart
on the I4OA website</a>, which is updated quarterly (Figure 1).

<p>
<em>Figure 1: Proportion of current journal articles from selected
publishers that have open abstracts in Crossref. Data collected on
January 1, 2024 for publication years 2021-2023. Publishers already
supporting I4OA are shown in orange.</em>
</p>
<p>
These longitudinal data and accompanying visualisations allow us to
identify and highlight good examples from 2023: publishers (both large
and small) who newly started to make abstracts openly available last
year and/or who managed to get the proportion of their articles with
open abstracts close to 100%<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
While we highlight some of these examples below in our ‘Hall of Fame’,
it’s important to also acknowledge all the publishers that already were
depositing abstracts to Crossref for most or all of their journal
articles prior to 2023, thereby contributing to the availability of
abstracts as part of a rich ecosystem of open metadata,
<a href="https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs" target="_blank">for
others to use and build upon</a>. 
</p>
<h2 id="hall-of-fame---part-1-publishers-included-in-i4oa-visualisation">
Hall of Fame - Part 1: publishers included in I4OA visualisation
</h2>
<p>
For the set of (mostly larger) publishers included in the visualisation
on the I4OA website, Figure 2 shows the difference in the proportion of
abstracts available in Crossref between January and December 2023 for
journal articles published in 2021-2023.
</p>
<p>
A number of publishers stand out from this figure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Wiley</strong> announced in
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/open-access/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research" target="_blank">October
2022</a> that it was joining I4OA and would be making abstracts
available through Crossref. In August 2023, Wiley started to deposit
abstracts to Crossref, and at the end of 2023, the proportion of current
journal articles with open abstracts was 77%.
</p>
<p>
This makes Wiley the first of the four largest traditional commercial
publishers to deposit abstracts for the majority of journal articles
they publish. Springer Nature does this only for their current open
access articles, while Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis<sup>2</sup> do
not yet provide abstracts to Crossref at all. SAGE, the fifth largest
traditional commercial publisher, was a founding member of I4OA and has
open abstracts for 85% of current journal articles. <br><br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Among society publishers, the <strong>American Geophysical Union
(AGU)</strong> went from 7% to 99% open abstracts for current journal
articles last year, which is a great achievement. The publishing arm of
the <strong>American Institute of Physics (AIP Publishing)</strong>
joins them in reaching close to 100% open abstracts, going from 41% to
95% in 2023.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<sup>1</sup>Depending on the type of journal(s) of a given publisher,
the maximal coverage of open abstracts will often be somewhat below
100%, as in Crossref, all journal content is assigned the type ‘journal
article’. This includes e.g. editorials, letters to the editor and other
publication types that are not always expected to have abstracts.
</p>
<p>
<sup>2</sup>The numbers for Wiley and Taylor &amp; Francis do not
include Hindawi and F1000 Research, respectively, as these have separate
Crossref member IDs. As most full open access publishers, both Hindawi
and F1000 Research have high proportions of open abstracts (81% and 98%,
respectively).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>CAIRN</strong> and <strong>Project Muse</strong>, two publishing
platforms in the humanities and social sciences representing a number of
individual publishers, both started including abstracts in the metadata
they provide to Crossref in 2023. At the end of 2023, CAIRN had
abstracts available for 41% of current journal articles, while Project
Muse was just starting out at 5%. Both will hopefully increase further
this coming year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Returning to traditional commercial publishers, <strong>Wolters Kluwer
Health</strong>, part of Wolters Kluwer, had seen a slow growth in the
proportion of journal articles with open abstracts in the years prior to
2023, going from 2% to 10%. However, they showed a rapid increase in
2023, ending the year with 52% open abstracts.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While it is good to see publishers who have publicly committed their
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=Publishers%20supporting%20I4OA" target="_blank">support
for I4OA</a> follow through with opening their abstracts (like Wiley and
AIP), it is also very encouraging to see publishers who are not (yet)
listed as I4OA supporters do so. This shows a growing awareness and
action on this issue beyond advocacy through I4OA alone. And of course,
we would love to list these publishers on our website as official
supporters of I4OA!
</p>
<p>
Figure 2 also shows some cases where the proportion of open abstracts
has gone down during the year. This can be due to temporary technical
issues in depositing abstracts (as was the case for Hindawi).
Theoretically, the proportion of open abstracts can also go down when
publishers stop providing abstracts altogether during the year, but we
have not observed that to be the case.

Hall of Fame - Part 2: other publishers
</h2>
<p>
Among the many publishers not included in the limited selection shown in
the I4OA visualisation, there are also some interesting highlights of
publishers either starting out to deposit abstracts (and reaching a
sizeable proportion) or having deposited open abstracts for almost all
their current journal articles in 2023. The examples below drew our
attention in 2023; they include a number of medium-sized publishers as
well as a group of smaller publishers that deserve special attention.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)</strong> went
from 0% to 42% open abstracts in 2023. However, from January 2024
onwards, several EMBO journals were transferred to Springer Nature, so
EMBO can no longer be tracked at publisher level in Crossref. It will
still be possible to look at the development of open abstracts for
individual EMBO journals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)</strong>, a
medium-sized publisher, started to deposit abstracts in 2023, reaching
33% open abstracts for current journal articles at the end of the year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Acoustical Society of America (ASA)</strong> had open
abstracts for almost all their current journal articles at the end
of 2023, increasing from 50% to 97%.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, in the second quarter of 2023, a group of <strong>over 200
smaller Turkish publishers</strong> saw large increases in their
coverage of open abstracts, resulting in open abstracts for 95%-100% of
their current journal articles. Consultation with Crossref pointed to
the potential supporting role of
<a href="https://dergipark.org.tr/en/" target="_blank">DergiPark</a>,
one of the largest Crossref sponsors in Turkey. This is a great example
of developments in open metadata at smaller publishers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-forward">
Looking forward 
</h2>
<p>
At the beginning of 2024, the proportion of current journal articles
published by Crossref members with open abstracts has reached 49.7%, up
from 20.7% when I4OA was launched in September 2020. This is thanks to a
growing number of publishers who are depositing abstracts to Crossref,
often depositing open abstracts for close to 100% of their journal
articles.
</p>
<p>
This blog post has highlighted a number of publishers who contributed to
this growth in the availability of open abstracts in 2023. We hope these
examples will inspire other publishers to start doing the same and are
looking forward to following the growth in the availability of open
abstracts in 2024.
</p>
<p>
For publishers that started to deposit abstracts in recent years and are
doing so for newly published articles only, our data on open abstracts
for current journal articles will look better in 2024 than in 2023, as
only articles published in the current year and two preceding years are
taken into account.
</p>
<p>
However, the benefits of having abstracts openly available from a
central location such as Crossref (both for direct usage and for
integration in other open scholarly infrastructures) are not limited to
recent publications only. Hopefully, publishers currently depositing
abstracts to Crossref will continue to do so both for newly published
articles as well as for the backfiles of journal articles already
published.
</p>
<p>
Publishers who would like to be added to the list of I4OA supporters, or
who would like more information on how to deposit abstracts for both new
and existing journal articles, are very welcome to
<a href="mailto:openabstracts@gmail.com">reach out to I4OA</a>. More
information about open abstracts in general, and I4OA in particular, can
also be found in the
<a href="https://i4oa.org/faqs.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the I4OA
website.

through the eyes of a musl distribution maintainer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>systemd, as a service manager, is not actually a bad piece of
software by itself. The fact it can act as both a service manager and an
inetd(8) replacement is really cool. The unit file format is very nice
and expressive. Defining mechanism and leaving policy to the
administrator is a good design. Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum. I
don’t like the encouragement to link daemons to libsystemd for better
integration – all of the useful integrations can be done with more
portable measures. And I really don’t like the fact they consider glibc
to be “the Linux API” when musl, Bionic, and other libcs exist. I’d like
to dive into detail on the good and the bad of systemd, as seen through
my eyes as all of: end user, administrator, and developer. ↫ awilfox
awilfox is a maintainer of Adélie Linux, which does not use systemd, but
this blog post is one of the few reasonable, well-written, and
substantiated critiques of systemd – as opposed to the usual mindless
screeching you usually hear about systemd. A great read.</p>

OS: microkernel operating system for the cloud written in Rust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system
(Motūrus OS) for the cloud. In more specific terms, Motūrus OS
(sometimes called Motor OS), is a new operating system targeting virtual
machine-based workloads such as web serving, “serverless”, edge caching,
etc. Motūrus OS is a microkernel-based operating system, built in Rust,
that targets virtualized workloads exclusively. It currently supports
x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in either Qemu or Cloud
Hypervisor. Rust is the language of Motūrus OS: not only it is
implemented in Rust, it also exposes its ABI in Rust, not C. ↫ Motūrus
OS GitHub page At this point, there are more alternative operating
systems written in Rust than there are Linux distributions, but you’re
not hearing any complaints from me. While not all of these will have a
bright future, they’ll teach a lot of people valuable skills and
introduce a lot of people to the concept of alternative operating
systems.</p>

<h2 id="start-now-dont-wait">Start now, don’t wait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Start now, don’t wait
</h1>
<p>
If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I
was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you
docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk
things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.
</p>
<p>
Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that
you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done
by people who were ill prepared.
</p>
<p>
It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until
the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not
right will have made the decisions for you.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that
we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody
is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it
is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just
speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right
people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to
make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though
you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for
the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world
that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing
that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still
time.
</p>
<p>
And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what
are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded.
Thank you!

<p>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and
say “learn this” and then a few hours or days later I’d be able to ask
it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents
wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then
ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of
therapy.</p>

docs relative to the business goals they’re aiming to support or

surprise that this feature has been there since Emacs 26.3, see variable

friend and co-conspirator in podcasting
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Chris+Lydon">Chris
Lydon</a>. He said I was a good
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">sports writer</a>
and boasted of the current Celtics team (he’s from Boston). They’re
worth boasting about. What a team, such depth and so many interesting
players. They were great before they added
<a href="http://scripting.com/2019/11/09.html#a135827">Kristaps
Porzingis</a>, who we know well in New York. He was our rookie unicorn
and franchise player at the end of the Phil Jackson debacle. He’s one of
those ex-Knicks we still root for, so I feel an affinity for this year’s
Celtics. I would pay to see them kill a west coast team like the
Warriors or Kings in this year’s finals. Anyway, I write sports for
people who are not sports fans, though I think everyone who loves
politics or business should pay close attention to sports, because it
all happens quickly in sport, and the human element is so visible and
front and center. I’m glad Chris is a basketball fan. Maybe we can go to
a Knicks-Celtics game sometime, either in Boston or NYC. The Knicks are
getting good, and it likely would be a good game and Knicks could even
win. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

“everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we’d seen it all, an npm user
named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a
group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a
troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This
package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package,
creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and
its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone
who installs it. We’re talking about storage space running out and
system resource exhaustion. But that’s not all. The creator took their
prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol,
showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from
Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to
the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you
shouldn’t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let’s be
honest here – this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a
rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn’t
seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or
compromised systems. What’s worse, it seems this isn’t even the first
time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do
this. What are they doing over there?</p>

After reporting on the open access movement for 20+ years I have reached
the conclusion that the movement has failed.

<p>
As a result, I shall no longer be writing about open access or updating
this blog.

I explain my reasons for reaching the conclusion I have

I <a href="https://x.com/RickyPo/status/1728308480321229067?s=20" target="_blank">announced
my decision</a> and I wish all those who continue to advocate for open
access the very best.
