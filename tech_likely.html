<h2 id="freebsd-is-building-a-graphical-installer">FreeBSD is building a
graphical installer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is working on a graphical installer. Finally. The first
hurdle to overcome when testing a new Operating System is to get it
installed. What is more, the first impression new users gather from an
Operating System is its installation process. The state of the art for
Operating System installers nowadays definitely involves a graphical
process. This is the case for mainstream systems but also for other UNIX
systems comparable to FreeBSD: RedHat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian
GNU/Linux, or even Devuan GNU+Linux Regardless of the technical level of
the actual user, this is how the platform will be compared in the public
eye. Instead, with knowledge of the current bsdinstall(8) and
bsdconfig(8) utilities, I envisioned a BSD-licensed replacement for
Xdialog(1). Just like when invoking bsdconfig with the -X switch for
graphical mode, it could be dropped in instead of bsddialog(1) and allow
graphical installation – while sharing the infrastructure of the current
installer. To avoid confusion with the current implementation of Xdialog
from the x11/xdialog port, I have named its replacement gbsddialog(1).
It also has to be said that Xdialog is quite obsolete (latest release in
2006) and this shows visually too. ↫ Pierre Pronchery in the FreeBSD
status report I can’t believe it’s taken FreeBSD this long to both
consider and build a graphical installer. Currently being enveloped in
the world of OpenBSD, there’s clearly so much the BSD world has to offer
to desktop users such as myself, but at the same time, there’s a lot of
low-hanging fruit that the various BSDs can address to make the
experience just that little bit more pleasant. They obviously don’t have
to – not every project is aiming at desktop use – but it just makes
onboarding so much nicer. The next step – perhaps in 2037 – would be to
offer a desktop-oriented installation image, with a default desktop
environment and settings optimised for desktop use. Right now, a lot of
fiddling and optimisation for this use case is left to the user, and for
newcomers such as myself this means a lot of reading, making sense of
contradictory advice and suggestions, wading through endless, often
outdated, online guides, and so on. Now, I don’t particularly mind doing
this, but I’m sure it’s chasing people away who could end up making
meaningful contributions. Meanwhile, after trying out FreeBSD for a
while a few weeks ago but it not being a good fit for me, I’m now
exploring and using OpenBSD and it’s been a great experience. Although
unlikely, I hope OpenBSD, too, can perhaps consider making some minor
affordances to desktop users – because as I’ve learnt, OpenBSD feels
right at home on a desktop, more so than I ever expected.</p>

we will give you an overview about COSMIC DE and its features, and then
we will walk you through the steps to install COSMIC Desktop Environment
in the latest Fedora 40 Linux system. ↫ Senthilkumar Palani at OSTechNix
A very easy way to try out the current pre-alpha state of COSMIC. I’ll
definitely be waiting on a more official release later this year, but
man, does COSMIC ever seem way more polished and complete than it has
any right to be at this point in time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft is making security its number one priority for every
employee, following years of security issues and mounting criticisms.
After a scathing report from the US Cyber Safety Review Board recently
concluded that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires
an overhaul,” it’s doing just that by outlining a set of security
principles and goals that are tied to compensation packages for
Microsoft’s senior leadership team. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge The devil
is in the details regarding tying executive pay to security performance,
but it we take it at face value and assume good intent – which is a
laughable assumption in our corporatist world, but alas – I would like
to see more of this. It’s high time executives start paying – literally
and figuratively – for the failings of the companies and teams they
claim to run.</p>

<h2 id="the-soundtrack-of-your-life">The soundtrack of your life</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve developed new appreciation for two musicians from my generation:
George Harrison and Bob Dylan, thanks to the encouragement of two
friends, both of whom have links to my childhood believe it or not, but
who are current friends in my
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dotage">dotage</a> and they’re
both on Facebook.
</p>
<p>
So my first friend said she likes
<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison">George
Harrison</a> the best of all the Beatles, and I thought that’s weird
because it really was down to Paul and John, I thought – and then I
heard this interview with George asking why he didn’t explain in his
memoir how he worshipped John as a kid, and George took exception,
saying yeah in John’s mind that’s who I am, a kid who worshipped him,
which I never did (says George). So now I have gone back through his
music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others,
and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of
course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980).
And he was never going to be taken seriously by the others, so he had to
get out of there to have the creative life he wanted.
</p>
<p>
About Dylan, the credit goes to my local friend and
<a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/song-173-all-along-the-watchtower-part-one-hes-not-the-messiah/">Andrew
Hickey</a>, who focused my attention on the <i>music</i> of Dylan’s
songs, when I had only been focusing on the lyrics. Silly of me. He only
ever wanted to be seen as a musician, not a leader of anything, and
that’s where the difficulty came from, and why I wasn’t really
interested, even though I had listened to all the Dylan songs many
times, and had a few of his albums growing up. So I just played
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled_Up_in_Blue">Tangled Up in
Blue</a> and realized this has been rolling around in my mind for days,
and I wasn’t even aware of it.
</p>
<p>
Kind of like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower">All
Along the Watchtower</a> (another Dylan song) in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar
Galactica</a>, which I just heard is currently
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE">on
Amazon</a>. I think it’s time for another binge of that. ;-)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, two doors open, and that’s always good. You know this is why you
pick your music when you’re young and stay with it, because it’s the
soundtrack of your life, and it has new relevance at every step of your
evolution. Sure I listen to other music, but – it’s the songs that were
big when I was little that matter most.

Since there are so many New Yorkers, spread out all over the country,
and we’re pretty much all Knicks fans, this can create a demoralizing
effect for the opposition players who assume their hometown crowd will

discovered that most of the attendees were actually in favor of
democracy and abortion rights.</p>

intense, but this one was especially so. So we’re on to the

round</a>, starting Monday, back in NYC, against the Indiana Pacers, an
excellent team this year. And Doc Searls, who is also a Knicks fan, now
lives in Indiana, so he is somewhat justified in believing the world
revolves around him. I’ve always had that sense about Doc.</p>

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
My name is Cory Dransfeldt and I’m located in Camarillo, California (a
suburban town north of Los Angeles and where I grew up). I studied
business in college and minored in economics. At the time I thought it
was a practical choice and I was also terrified of the math involved in
studying computer science. In hindsight, I wish I’d made a different
choice, but don’t necessarily regret the one I made at the time.
</p>
<p>
My first job out of college was working on the website of the local
newspaper (I started as a freelance employee during college and became
full-time after). This role was focused on updating the website with
content the night before the print edition became available and was done
in a utilitarian, but reliable Django-based CMS. I picked up some basic
front end development knowledge working on multimedia projects and
building my own tools to make the job easier.
</p>
<p>
I began to learn JavaScript by writing themes for
<a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoute">Ecoute</a> as part of the
MacThemes forum community. I expanded my web development knowledge by
volunteering to build websites for metal bands I remain a fan of and
friends with like <a href="https://linktr.ee/cyniconline">Cynic</a> and
<a href="https://augurymetal.com/">Augury</a>. I gained a lot of
knowledge and ended up with merch, concert tickets and some really great
experiences out if it all.
</p>
<p>
I’ve built a career out of being a self-taught frontend-focused
developer and have worked at startups, nationally recognized retailers
(I’ve worked on every eCommerce stack short of Shopify) and several
different SaaS providers. The backend developer I worked with at my
first startup told me to learn languages and pickup frameworks as needed
— that advice continues to serve me well.
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, programming and blogging remain my favorite hobbies,
along with searching for and discovering new music (I enjoy everything
from artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits">Tom
Waits</a> to punk acts like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeansno">NoMeansNo</a> and
myriad death metal artists like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_(band)">Carcass</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(band)">Autopsy</a> and
newer groups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Mold">Tomb
Mold</a>). If I’m not at the computer, I’m spending time with my lovely
wife of 9 years, our two children and our 4 rescue dogs (all
terrier/chihuahua mixes). I also mentor via
<a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a> and help
organize the <a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">Eleventy meetup</a>. I’ve
been getting tattooed more over the past few years and am in the process
of completing a sleeve on my right arm but am not sure that qualifies as
a hobby.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I started blogging after I graduated from college in 2010 and have
managed to recover posts dating back to 2013 that I’ve imported into the
current iteration on my site. I was inspired by blogs like Daring
Fireball and MacStories, though I don’t follow them quite as closely as
I once did. I viewed blogging as both a creative outlet and as a way to
continue practicing web development by having my own project to
experiment on and iterate with.
</p>
<p>
I started out on Tumblr, before moving to the first version of Kirby,
then on to Statamic, Jekyll, Next.js,
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>’s weblog service and now,
finally (and quite happily)
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. All of these presented me
with an opportunity to learn new languages, frameworks, tools and
development approaches. I love the simplicity and flexibility of
Eleventy and adore the community around both it and omg.lol. I like the
simplicity of blogging under my own name and settled on a domain name
that reflects both that and the development/technology focus.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My creative process tends to be very informal — I read a lot of articles
via the blogs I follow through RSS and enjoy both audio and written
books. I’m interested in web development, the state of the industry and
music, so my posts typically center around those topics (and,
occasionally, how they connect or overlap). I’ll often write a single
draft, edit it for clarity, brevity and correctness before my confidence
in the post wanes and publish it.
</p>
<p>
I want to grow into doing more research-focused writing to compliment
these briefer pieces and am excited about that approach as an area where
I can grow as a writer.
</p>
<p>
I write posts in markdown using <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> and
then insert Eleventy frontmatter that I store as a snippet in
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I typically write in an office that I share with my wife — I work from
home and have a corner desk with my personal machine (a typically docked
M2 MacBook Air), work machine and a lightly-used TV in between. I
struggle to concentrate in silence and will typically write and program
with death or black metal playing. I find the music helps me focus and
the lack of intelligible lyrics keeps it from distracting me.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My blog is hosted at Netlify and I pay for the pro plan while staying
well under its limits, but this allows me the piece of mind to rebuild
the site regularly to update <a href="https://coryd.dev/now">my now
page</a> and other dynamically populated elements like
<a href="https://coryd.dev/links/">my links page</a>.
</p>
<p>
I moved my domains to DNSimple last year after Gandi was acquired.
</p>
<p>
The code for my site is versioned and
<a href="https://github.com/cdransf/coryd.dev">available to view at
GitHub</a>. I use a GitHub action to trigger hourly rebuilds of my site,
another to post content from a feed that combines my blog posts, shared
links, read books and watched movies to Mastodon, another to add my blog
posts to my README, another to test my site’s performance using a
<a href="https://speedlify.coryd.dev/">Speedlify instance</a> and yet
another to retrieve and cache the chart data for music I’ve listened to
over the last week from
<a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/building-a-scrobbler-using-plex-webhooks-edge-functions-and-blob-storage/">the
charts I derive from Plex</a> (this is then syndicated to Mastodon via
the aforementioned feed and action).
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
If I were to start a blog today, I suppose I’d start from where I’ve
arrived at now, but I don’t think I could’ve arrived here without the
experience and discovery I went through along the way. I’m not a
particularly great designer, so I favor simplicity and performance in
presentation and, from a technical perspective, 11ty really lends itself
to that. I think I’ve found a set of tools and a community that I deeply
enjoy engaging with.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
The expenses to run my site are fairly straightforward: hosting
(Netlify), analytics (Clicky) and feed hosting/analytics (Feedpress). A
quick estimate for a given year would be around $400 which I’m happy
with for something I enjoy so much. There’s also a tiny fee monthly for
a Backblaze B2 bucket I use to cache JSON used to populate my links page
(they’re fetched from the Readwise Reader API which is paginated and
rate-limited — this allows me to persist link data and puts less of a
burden on their service).
</p>
<p>
I’m not opposed to bloggers monetizing their sites, but I appreciate
when, say, content is clearly marked as sponsored. I have a Buy Me a
Coffee link in my site’s navigation, but nothing outside of that — if
someone wants to send something along I appreciate it and, if not,
that’s totally fine too!
</p>
<p>
I support a few larger publications that started on and have since left
Substack. Among my favorites are Paris Marx’s
<a href="https://disconnect.blog/">Disconnect</a> and
<a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I’ll start off by saying I <em>love</em> the resurgence of blogs and
personal sites we’re seeing. I have a
<a href="https://coryd.dev/blogroll">blogroll</a> on my site with some
of my favorites (they’re also bundled into a .opml file that you can
download). <a href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a>’s blog remains
one of my favorites — the design is stellar and he’s constantly
experimenting with and adding new features. I also thoroughly enjoy
<a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/">Adam Newbold</a>’s writing and
seeing what he’s working on for omg.lol. I could go on and on I love
<a href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb">Keenan</a>’s writing,
<a href="https://blog.mayank.co/">Mayank</a> is a gifted developer and
similarly talented writer, <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/">Sara Joy</a>
is exceedingly kind and has created awesome projects like
<a href="https://rs.sjoy.lol/">RS.S JOY.lol dev</a>. The internet’s
changing and seeing everyone writing and building makes me so happy.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
If you want to mentor some great, deserving folks, check out
<a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a>. If you’re
building with Eleventy we’d love to have you
<a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">present at the meetup</a>. The best
book I’ve finished this year has been
<a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/05de5de3-3572-4d50-b70e-651909502ca1"><em>NoMeansNo:
From Obscurity to Oblivion</em></a> — they’re my favorite band so,
naturally, I’m biased, but it’s a fun read and is built around
interviews with the band, their friends, family and other popular
musicians.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any active side projects at the moment (but I’m kicking
around some ideas) — fitting everything in is tough! I’d love to build
something that makes it easier for small bands to quickly build
lightweight websites that they can host anywhere and really bring my
journey full circle — a static site generator as a service with portable
code and easy CMS integration? More robust than LinkTree, with less
overhead than Squarespace and more open than both. I’m more interested
in supporting musicians than I am in monetizing anything I suppose.
</p>
<p>
I’m also excited to see what Robb Knight is cooking up with
<a href="https://echofeed.app/">EchoFeed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for reading! I post a lot on <a href="https://coryd.dev/">my
site</a> and on <a href="https://social.lol/@cory">Mastodon</a> so come
say hi!

You know what really grinds my gears?

<p>
At some point some real jerk-of-a-boss told his team, “I don’t care if
it’s not done. Ship it anyway and we’ll charge the customer to get the
rest,” and it actually worked. And now we get games that require DLCs to
play anything. I hate that we fell for it and that guy probably got
promoted.

<h2 id="lateral-thinking">Lateral Thinking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>For me, lateral thinking is: Solving problems using an indirect and
creative approach. Using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and
involving ideas that might not be obtainable by using traditional
step-by-step logic. One “simple” approach to “think outside the box” is:
Understanding WHAT you want to achieve. Understanding WHY you want to
achieve it. Knowing the rules of the game constraints like environment,
budget, physical limitations, etc. Reframing WHAT you want in a way that
ignores these rules of the game.</p>

<h2 id="simplicity-vs-familiarity">Simplicity vs familiarity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how we interact with technology, and
I’ve come to realize that being familiar with something doesn’t always
mean it’s simple. In fact, it can sometimes make things more
complicated. For example, when I’m working on code or documentation, I
find myself getting too close to the issue. It’s easy to lose sight of
the bigger picture and get caught up in the details. That’s why it’s
important for us to take a step back, look at our work from a different
perspective, and ask for feedback.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>Which architecture should I choose? I don’t think this is the right
question to ask. A better question would be, given the current state of
my service/product, which architecture will provide what I’m looking
for? For example, performance, independent deployments, application
boundaries, etc. For example, many people mention that we should start
with a monolith and while I agree with some of the arguments (simplified
development and deployment, consistent performance), it tends to ignore
the fact that it might be better to prioritize freedom and
experimentation at early stages rather than performance.</p>

<h2 id="my-issue-with-github-actions">My issue with Github Actions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>GitHub actions are a problem because they lock you by the balls and
you cannot reproduce your pipelines. Getting to depend on all those
small Actions saves 5 minutes today, only to make migrations immensely
painful tomorrow. Build, package, and release software should be written
as standalone scripts that in principle could even run in the
developer’s machine. Moving them to CI is just changing the machine that
will run the scripts.</p>

<h2 id="risc-os-open-5.30-arrives-with-raspberry-pi-wi-fi-support">RISC
OS Open 5.30 arrives with Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is, in a way, a mature OS with an ecosystem and an aftermarket.
(Which, we feel we must explicitly spell out, means that quite a few of
those third-party applications and drivers will cost you money.) There
are emulators that will let you run 20th century Acorn apps that you can
find online, but this isn’t an emulated vintage environment like Amiga
Forever. It’s not meant for running games from thirty years ago. This is
a native bare-metal OS, built on 1980s roots but updated for 21st
century hardware. It’s also not an experimental project with little
practical use, like Redox OS or Serenity OS, interesting though those
are. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register I grew up with RISC OS and still run
a RISC OS machine to this day. As Liam Proven explains affectionately in
this article, while as an operating system it’s missing many features we
now take for granted (memory protection, pre-emptive multitasking,
compositing), some of the user interface ideas it implements still
manage to feel advanced compared to modern-day desktops (no need for
menu bars, no clunky file dialogues, elegant mouse button assignments).
The fact it’s found a home on the Raspberry Pi and continues to support
an active community is testament to its enduring appeal and the amazing
work of the RISC OS Open project. Some additional notes from Thom: this
new release supports 7 ARM platforms, most notably the Raspberry Pi
Zero, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (but not the 5), and it even supports WiFi on the 3
and 4, which is an absolutely incredible achievement. The number of
fixed bugs and addressed issues is massive, and there’s even more to
come later during the year, as The Register’s article notes. I was
waiting on this release to spur me on to buy a new Raspberry Pi (my only
other Pi is our Pi-Hole), so I’ll definitely be on the lookout for a
good deal. This release deserves my full attention for OSNews.</p>

<h2 id="the-basic-programming-language-turns-60">The BASIC programming
language turns 60</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at 4 am in the morning, a quiet
revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That’s when
mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the
first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner’s
All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the
college’s General Electric GE-225 mainframe. Little did they know that
their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire
generations of programmers over the next six decades. ↫ Benj Edwards at
Ars Technica Even I have used BASIC in the past, when I was a child and
discovered QBasic (or possibly GW-BASIC, I’m a bit hazy on the details)
and started messing around with it. My experiences with BASIC didn’t
lead to a path of ever more complex programming languages, but for huge
numbers of people, it did – it’s wild just how many people over a
certain age got their programming start with BASIC in the 8 bit home
computer era. I mean, 30 GOTO 10 is such a widespread morsel of
knowledge it made its way into all kinds of popular media, such as a few
Easter egg jokes in Futurama. BASIC has effectively achieved
immortality.</p>

<h2 id="inside-the-snapdragon-855s-igpu">Inside the Snapdragon 855’s
iGPU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Qualcomm’s Adreno 6xx architecture has been superseded Adreno 7xx,
but it’s still used in countless devices, including the current-gen
Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3. Here, I’ll be looking at the Adreno 640 GPU in the
Snapdragon 855. Zarif98 on Reddit kindly provided a OnePlus 7 Pro, and
I’ll be using that to check out Adreno 640. Compared to the older
Snapdragon 821’s Adreno 530, Adreno 640 dramatically increases compute
throughput while still working within a very constrained power and
thermal envelope. Process node improvements help, and TSMC’s 7 nm
process should be far better than the 14 nm Samsung node used in the
Snapdragon 821. But cell phone SoC constraints meant Qualcomm couldn’t
go around copy-pasting basic GPU building blocks and call it a day. ↫

Microsoft, years of security debt come crashing down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Years of accumulated security debt at Microsoft are seemingly
crashing down upon the company in a manner that many critics warned
about, but few ever believed would actually come to light.  Microsoft is
an entrenched enterprise provider, owning nearly one-quarter of the
global cloud infrastructure services market and, as of Q1 last year,
nearly 20% of the worldwide SaaS application market, according to
Synergy Research Group. Though not immune to scandal, in the wake of two
major nation-state breaches of its core enterprise platforms, Microsoft
is facing one of its most serious reputational crises. ↫ David Jones at
Cybersecurity Dive It’s almost like having the entire US government
dependent on a single vendor is a bad idea. Just spitballing here.</p>

Why have bacteria never evolved complex multicellularity? A new

<h2 id="what-became-of-1999.io">What became of 1999.io</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
TL;DR: It’s gone – you can’t get <a href="http://1999.io/">there</a>.
Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two
apps I miss the most.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io">1999
was a rewrite</a> of blogging software from the point of view of both
1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the
art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user
of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was
imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close.
When I realized they weren’t going to do it, I set out to do it myself,
how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn’t
have their source code, so I built it from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn’t use it. I also
couldn’t use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version
of the Mac OS. It’s made me think that maybe in a few years or even
months you might not be able to use
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> or
<a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. Then I thought about how I
can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a
simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you
depend on should go off the air. See the next post, below.

<h2 id="protecting-your-feedland-subscription-lists">Protecting your
FeedLand subscription lists</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First and foremost, you should keep a current backup copy of your
subscription list. It’s very easy to do.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, choose <i>My feed
list</i> in the first menu.
</li>
<li>
Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the
page.
</li>
<li>
That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This
is the format that all feed reading software understands.
</li>
<li>
In your browser, choose the <i>Save Page As</i> command in the File menu
(or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along
with your other backups.
</li>
<li>
You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over
the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the
server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription
list in localStorage.
</li>
<li>
And if the FeedLand server you’re using should happen to disappear, if
you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you’ll
at least have a copy in localStorage.
</li>
<li>
If you want to see it – visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you
have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console,
and enter this line:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<code>console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)</code>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
If you have questions, here’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240">thread</a>.

<p>Whooping seems to be back. Shouting ‘whoo!’ as a way of expressing
your enthusiasm. Either that, or it never went away and I have grown
inured to it. Explain it how you will, but after five whooping
experiences in the last three weeks - one at a concert, one at a play,
two at anniversary parties and one at Passover - I can now say
definitively that I’m hearing it again. Did I say whooping at Passover?

2024-04-22 Gopher, again
</h1>
<p>
Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to
be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept
thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version
of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a
library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully
grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>,
the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the
<a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a>
that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I
figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable
Gopher pages.
</p>
<p>
It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu
matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site
is back as a gopher hole on port 70!
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown
Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.
</p>
<p>
See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched
Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code,
<a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in
this client I’m using.

set myself for the Markdown Gopher server. It really leans into the

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-natural-creativity">IndieWeb Carnival: Natural
creativity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I spend the vast majority of my time doing creative work. I code for a living, sometimes I design for a living. I code as a hobby, sometimes I do design as a hobby. I also write. Being creative ain’t easy. At least not for me. I sit at my desk, staring at the same screen day after day and sometimes it’s hard to find inspiration. But every time I find myself stuck I can get unstuck with one simple trick: I leave.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
My creative environment is when I’m outside, not trying to do anything
creative. And this is especially true when I’m walking in nature. I’m
not the first one to realise that there’s a connection between walking
in nature and creativity. There’s something about moving through space
that makes my brain work differently.
</p>
<p>
Nature is, more often than not, my creative environment. Back in 2019, I
started a very random project called
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/writing-hiking-and-sharing">From the
Summit</a>. It was an attempt to capture this exact phenomenon, the
bursts of creativity born from moving through space. It’s easily my
favourite digital experiment.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day though, the only environment that matters, when it
comes to creativity, is the mental space I’m in. That’s why I find
nature so useful. The cadence of the walk, the sounds, the light, the
smell. All the senses are engaged when I’m outside in nature and as a
result, my brain becomes more creative.
</p>
<p>
The next time you’re creatively stuck, if you can, go for a walk in
nature. You won’t regret it.

Distributed PostgreSQL Introduces Automatic DDL Replication and
Snowflake Sequences for Postgres</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
New capabilities advance state of the art in Postgres logical
replication
</p>
<p>
Alexandria, VA - April 17, 2024 - pgEdge, Inc., the leading company
dedicated to distributed Postgres, today unveiled two major advances in
logical replication for the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL
database. These are automatic DDL (Data Definition Language)
replication, and snowflake sequences, an innovative solution to the
problem of maintaining unique sequence identifiers across a distributed
Postgres cluster. pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL is the first and only
fully distributed PostgreSQL database solution that is open (source
available) and completely based on the PostgreSQL database itself.
</p>
<p>
Automatic Replication of DDL Commands. DDL is used to create and modify
Postgres objects like tables, indexes, views and constraints through
command statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. DML (data manipulation
language) is used to perform operations on the data within those
database objects through command statements such as SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, and DELETE.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, logical replication in Postgres only allowed for the
replication of DML statements and not DDL. Manual efforts were required
on each node to modify table definitions through DDL commands that had
to be executed on every node.
</p>
<p>
With the introduction of automatic DDL replication on pgEdge, developers
can now update the database schema on a single node and have it
automatically propagated to other nodes in the cluster. This feature
makes it far easier to support distributed Postgres applications where
the database schema is frequently updated because of active development
or maintenance.
</p>
<p>
Snowflake Sequence in Postgres Extension: Managing sequences in a
distributed PostgreSQL environment can be complex, especially in
multi-master replication scenarios. A Postgres sequence provides a
unique integer number to use as an ID for the database table and its
records. If you insert new records it will assign the next number in the
sequence without issue.
</p>
<p>
In a distributed application, however, the sequence must be updated
across different regions and if each node updates the sequence
independently you will have conflicts that cannot be resolved. For
example, if a sequence is being used as a primary key, the next value of
the sequence on a node in the US could be selected at the exact same
time the next value of the sequence is selected on a node in Australia,
resulting in a primary key conflict.
</p>
<p>
To address this challenge, pgEdge has integrated snowflake sequences
into a Postgres extension. A snowflake sequence allows for the
utilization of a guaranteed unique sequence within a cluster without the
need for application code or schema modifications. By automatically
installing the Snowflake extension in pgEdge Platform and pgEdge Cloud
databases, users can easily maintain unique sequence numbers across
different regions, eliminating conflicts and enhancing scalability.
</p>
<p>
An exclusive presentation and paper on the Snowflake extension will be
showcased at the Silicon Valley Postgres conference in San Jose this
week.
</p>
<p>
“By offering these cutting-edge capabilities built on open,
standard-based Postgres, we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to making
advanced distributed Postgres capabilities available to the Postgres
community. Our goal is to make it easier and faster to deliver
distributed Postgres applications that are always on, always available
and always responsive,” remarked Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of
pgEdge.
</p>
<p>
Availability Automatic DDL Replication and Snowflake Sequences are
available now within both pgEdge Platform (self hosted) or pgEdge Cloud
(fully managed cloud service).
</p>

Platform, visit www.pgedge.com. To learn how to configure pgEdge’s Auto
DDL, view the documentation at

Tencent-owned Riot Games installs rootkit on every League of Legends
players’ computer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>With 14.9, Vanguard, Riot’s proprietary Anti-Cheat system will be
deployed and active in League of Legends. This means that active
enforcement of Vanguard will be in effect and working hard to make sure
your queues are free from scripters, botters, and cheaters! We recently
released a blog detailing the “why” behind bringing Vanguard to League
that you can check out here. It’s a bit of a long read, but it does have
some pictures. ↫ Lilu Cabreros in the League of Legends patch notes The
basic gist is that Vanguard is a closed-source, kernel-level rootkit for
Windows that runs at all times, with the supposed goal of detecting and
banning cheaters from playing League of Legends. This being a rootkit
designed specifically to inject itself into the Windows kernel, it won’t
work on Linux, and as such, the entire League on Linux community, which
has been playing League for years now and even at times communicated
with Riot employees to keep the game running, is now gone. Interestingly
enough, Riot is not implementing Vanguard on macOS, which League of
Legends also supports – because Apple simply doesn’t allow it. This is
probably the most invasive, disturbing form of anticheat we’ve seen so
far, especially since it involves such a hugely popular game. It’s
doubly spicy because Riot Games is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company,
which means a company owned and controlled by the Chinese government now
has rootkits installed on the roughly 150 million players’ computers all
over the world. While we’re all (rightly, in my opinion) worried about
TikTok, China just slipped 150 million rootkits onto computers all over
the world. One really has to wonder where these increasingly invasive,
anti-privacy and anti-user anticheat measures are going from here. Now
that this rootkit can keep tabs on literally every single thing you do
on your Windows computer, what’s going to be the next step? Anticheat
might have to move towards using webcams to watch you play to prevent
you from cheating, because guess what? The next level of cheating is
already here, and it doesn’t even involve your computer. Earlier this
year, hardware maker MSI showed off a gaming monitor that uses “AI” to
see what’s going on on your monitor, and then injects overlays onto your
monitor to help you cheat. MSI showed off how the monitor will use the
League of Legends minimap to follow enemy champions and other relevant
content, and then show warnings on your screen when enemies approach
from off-screen. All of this happens entirely on the monitor’s hardware,
and never sends any data whatsoever to the computer it’s attached to.
It’s cheating that literally cannot be detected by anything running on
your computer, rootkit or not. So, the only logical next step as such
forms of cheating become more advanced and widespread is to force users
to turn on their webcams, and point them at their displays. I fired up
League of Legends today on my gaming computer – which runs Linux, of
course – and after the League client “installed” the rootkit, it just
got stuck in an endless loop of asking me to restart the client. I’ve
been playing League of Legends for close to 14 years, and while I know
the game – and especially its community – has a deservedly so bad
reputation, I’ve always enjoyed the game with friends, and especially
with my wife, who’s been playing for years and years as well. Speaking
of my wife – even though she runs Windows and could easily install the
rootkit if she wanted to, she has some serious doubts about this. When I
explained what the Vanguard rootkit can do, her mouse pointer slowly
moved away from the “Update” button, saying, “I’m not so sure about
this…”</p>

a Knicks victory</a> last night that would have closed out the first
round of the playoffs. It felt like the Knicks had won the game when
Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the
Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night.
But! I didn’t flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I
think it was because I was able to watch it on
<a href="https://www.msgnetworks.com/">local TV</a> with the familiar
play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport,
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier">Walt Clyde

love about his
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms">narration</a> is that
he uses words incorrectly, kind of like
<a href="https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/">Archie

<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">say</a>
“I do not think it means what you think it means,” but then I realized,
last night, for the first time, it’s freaking poetry! A lot of it even
rhymes. And it’s a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do.
Unfortunately I don’t think the MSG crew is going to be doing the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;">next
game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN.
Maybe it’s because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera
setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same
company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It’s all
totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend
asked, if the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a> of the
Knicks wasn’t a putz. I said of course, he’s the worst but, the Knicks
now are being well managed. So maybe he’s mellowed out a bit?</p>

<p>Anyone who has spent any time recently using non-GNOME GTK desktop
environments, like Cinnamon, MATE, or Xfce, has had to deal with the
unfortunate reality of a lot of GTK applications becoming GNOME
applications instead, using GNOME’s own libadwaita. These applications
are hard to theme, and do not integrate at all with the proper GTK
applications non-GNOME desktop environments ship with. With how popular
GNOME is, this has meant that the number of non-GNOME GTK applications
has been dwindling. Linux Mint, the popular Linux distribution that also
develops the Cinnamon desktop environment, has long made a bundle of GTK
applications called XApps – basically forks of various core GNOME 3.x
applications to ensure they would have access to non-GNOME GTK
applications. With GNOME effectively forking GTK into its own, unique,
GNOME-specific style (like libaidwaita), other GTK environments have
suffered, and XApps were intended to close that gap. That hasn’t really
happened though, as XApps remained mostly a Mint-only thing, managed by
Mint, as part of the Mint/Cinnamon GitHub projects. Other distributions
and GTK desktop environments, such as Xfce, MATE, Budgie, and so on,
didn’t really pick them up. The Linux Mint project intends to change
that, and will ‘spin off’ the XApps into its own, dedicated, independent
project to facilitate cross-distribution and cross-DE collaboration,
decision-making and development, all in an effort to ensure the
long-term viability of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments. They also
intend to fork a lot more of the GNOME 3 applications, for the same
reason I mentioned earlier: GNOME applications are no longer GTK
applications, but GNOME applications – they look and feel horribly out
of place in environments that don’t use the GNOME-specific libadwaita.
As such, Celluloid, GNOME Calculator, Simple Scan, Baobab, System
Monitor, GNOME Calendar, File Roller, and Zenity were recently
downgraded in Linux Mint to their last GTK 3 versions, and will most
likely be forked in the near future. In addition, the Adwaita theme, the
default GNOME/GTK theme, will be removed from the list of available
themes in Cinnamon 6.2. Adwaita, too, has become increasingly
GNOME-only, and thus, increasingly broken on non-GNOME desktop
environments. Flat-our removing Adwaita altogether is not possible,
since it’s a GTK dependency, but hiding it from the theme selector is
not an issue, of course. As project lead Clément Lefèbvre writes:
libAdwaita is for GNOME and GNOME only. We can’t blame GNOME for this,
they’ve been very clear about it from the start. It was made
specifically for GNOME to have more freedom and build its own ecosystem
without impacting GTK. We want to send a strong signal upstream and
towards other projects. We cannot and will not support applications
which do not support our users and environments. We can’t promote
applications to our users which don’t support our users. The software
manager will be vigilant towards that going forward and list compatible
software by default. ↫ Clément Lefèbvre All of this is great news to
hear. I’ve been making extensive use of Xfce on OpenBSD lately, and on
the Fedora Xfce spin in the weeks before that, and the situation has
become almost comical. If you install any GNOME application on Xfce,
theming just breaks down completely, as most themes are either not made
to support the massive headerbars GNOME uses, or they do support it but
still look horribly out of place compared to the more sane titlebar plus
menubar plus toolbar layout of traditional desktop environments like
Xfce. I’ve long been saying that the non-GNOME GTK desktop environments
need to work together to formulate an answer to the onslaught of
libadwaita and the GNOME-ification of GTK, because each of them risks
becoming entirely tied to whatever GNOME and libadwaita decides to do,
for better or worse. It seems the Linux Mint team has finally realised
this as well, and I really hope – and strongly suggest – Xfce, MATE, and
others join them as well. If they don’t, there won’t be an Xfce in a few
years. What’s the point in developing Xfce if you’re at the mercy of
whatever choices GNOME makes?</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another detailed report about the progress made in
Redox, the Rust-based operating system. A major improvements this month
is support for USB HID, allowing USB keyboards and mice to work on
Redox, but the project does note USB hubs are still problematic and
might not work properly. Thanks to these USB improvements, Redox’
desktop environment Orbital now also ran on ARM64 in Qemu for the first
time, which is a great step towards running it on real ARM64 hardware. A
massive documentation pass has also taken place, fixing various errors
and improving and simplifying the writing. More programs have been
ported, of course, and various lower-level improvements and fixes, along
with a number of other fixes and changes across the operating
system.</p>

received responses from around 1000 of the current 8,000 Crossref
members in our lowest membership fee tier ($275 USD). We are now
starting to distill that data and will discuss it on our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/the-shape-of-things-to-come">community

<p>Humans speak countless different languages. Not only are these
languages incompatible, but runtime transpilation is a real pain. Sadly,
every standardisation initiative has failed. At least there is someone
to blame for this state-of-affairs: God. It was him, after-all, who
cursed humanity to speak different languages, in an early dispute over a
controversial property development. However, mankind can only blame
itself for the fact that computers struggle to talk to each other. And
one of the biggest problems is the most simple: computers do not agree
on how to write letters in binary. ↫ Cal Paterson For most users,
character encoding issues are not something they have to deal with.
Programmers and other people who deal with the lower levels of
computing, however, deal with this way more often than they should.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-facts-about-posix">A few facts about POSIX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over 35 years ago, these problems with software portability led to
the emergence of the first POSIX standard in 1988. The acronym was
coined by Richard Stallman, who added “X” to the end of Portable
Operating System Interface. It’s meant to provide a specification of the
interface that different Unix operating systems should have in common,
including programming languages and tools. It’s important to note that
the interface is portable, and not the implementation. ↫ vorakl While
POSIX certainly isn’t perfect, and support for it in various operating
systems claiming to support POSIX even less so, there’s no denying its
success. Even if the dream of 100% source code portability isn’t
possible under POSIX for applications that are a little more complex
than basic CLI tools, there’s enough portability that platforms like
Linux, the various BSDs, macOS, and others, can share quite a bit of
code. One of my favourite things about POSIX is that it shows up in the
most unexpected of places. Windows, for instance, has had various
options for POSIX compatibility, some of which straight from Microsoft
itself, like the currently well-known Windows Subsystem for Linux, but
also mostly forgotten options like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that
shipped with Windows NT until Windows 2000, or the very rudimentary
POSIX compatibility in the Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets
API. OS/2 had POSIX compatibility as well, through EMX (Eberhard Mattes
eXtender). It gave OS/2 – and MS-DOS – a POSIX API, and even provided
access to native OS/2 APIs as well, and could run 32bit applications.
You’d be surprised by how many more operating systems offered forms of
POSIX compatibility, either out of the box or through first or third
party add-ons.</p>

<h2 id="risc-v-support-in-android-just-got-a-big-setback">RISC-V support
in Android just got a big setback</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Although Google has shown significant progress in recent weeks in
improving RISC-V support in Android, it seems that we’re still quite a
bit away from seeing RISC-V hardware running certified builds of
Android. Earlier today, a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google who,
according to their LinkedIn, leads the Android Systems Team and works on
Android’s Linux kernel fork, submitted a series of patches to AOSP that
“remove ACK’s support for riscv64.” The description of these patches
states that “support for risc64 GKI kernels is discontinued.” ↫ Mishaal
Rahman Google provided Android Authority with a statement, claiming that
Android will continue to support RISC-V. What these patches do, however,
is remove support for the architecture from the Generic Kernel Image,
which is the only type of kernel Google certifies for Android, which
means that it is now no longer possible to ship a certified Android
device that uses RISC-V. Any OEM shipping a RISC-V Android device will
have to create and maintain its own kernel fork with the required
patches. This doesn’t seem to align with Google’s statement. So, unless
Google intends to add RISC-V support back into GKI, there won’t be any
officially certified Android devices running on RISC-V. Definitely an
odd chain of events here.</p>

<h2 id="its-different-after-its-gone">It’s different after its gone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>Note: This post is the summary of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a">podcast</a>.
</i>
</p>
<p>
When my mother died in 2018, it didn’t settle in that the context in
which I lived, my whole life, was gone.
</p>
<p>
She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that
house. I hadn’t lived there since I went away to college, but it still
defined who I was, an adult who didn’t live in his childhood home. When
we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was
when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I
can return to.
</p>
<p>
The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American
citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we
change our view of the country we live in. It’s not that it’s about to
change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web – <i>it
has already changed. </i>
</p>
<p>
We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a
bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take
bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what
happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don’t recuse when
deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine
the president is a monarch.
</p>
<p>
We’re already living in the authoritarian state we’re worried about. We
haven’t caught up with that reality yet.
</p>
<p>
Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is
with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that
sink in. If I said you don’t own your own body, what would you think I’m
talking about? Answer: Slavery.
</p>
<p>
If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to
undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but
we’d insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year
terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge
problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this
kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of
prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the
proof we need.
</p>
<p>
And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take
us for granted.

<h2 id="pgvector-0.7.0-released">pgvector 0.7.0 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/">pgvector</a>, an
open-source PostgreSQL extension that provides vector similarity search
capabilities, has released
<a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/releases/tag/v0.7.0">v0.7.0</a>.
This new release includes many new functional and performance features
for supporting vector similarity search workloads in PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p>
This latest version of pgvector adds new vector types, including
<code>halfvec</code> (2-byte floats; indexing up to 4,000 dimensions)
and <code>sparsevec</code> (indexing up to 1,000 nonzero dimensions),
and includes indexing support for binary vectors using the
<code>bit</code> type (indexing up to 64,000 dimensions). Additionally,
this release adds support for quantizing vectors using expression
indexes, including from 4-byte to 2-byte floats and binary quantization
using <code>binary_quantize</code> function. pgvector 0.7.0 also adds
new distance functions, including <code>hamming_distance</code> and
<code>jaccard_distance</code> for <code>bit</code> vectors, and now
supports HNSW indexing for L1 distance operations. pgvector 0.7.0 also
includes additional support for SIMD with CPU dispatching for Linux
x86-64 architectures.

<h2 id="datasentinel-2024.04-released">Datasentinel 2024.04
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
We’re pleased to announce that the latest edition of Datasentinel for
PostgreSQL is now available
</p>
<h4>
Role Based Access Enhancement
</h4>
<p>
Administrators can now assign multiple roles to Datasentinel users
either directly through the UI or programmatically via the API. This
enhancement significantly simplifies user management, especially in
large-scale environments with hundreds of PostgreSQL instances.
</p>
<h4>
Datasentinel 2024 Updates
</h4>
<p>
Datasentinel’s 2024 updates include full compatibility with PostgreSQL
16 and the introduction of <strong>I/O Insights</strong>, a new feature
that uses the pg_stat_io view to provide detailed I/O metrics.
Additionally, we have enhanced our agentless service startup, ensuring
quicker launch times and improved performance. This is particularly
beneficial in large-instance environments during system boots or
post-upgrade reboots. Together, these enhancements further bolster
Datasentinel’s robust PostgreSQL monitoring capabilities

don’t take the bait to make it about anything other than what happens on

goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing will happen. I feel sorry for

<h2 id="front-do-not-install-released">9front “DO NOT INSTALL”
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s a new 9front release! So, what exactly is 9front, you may
ask? Well, after it became clear that Bell Labs wasn’t doing much with
plan9, a group of developers took matters into their own hands and
created 9front, a fork of plan9. Their latest release is called DO NOT
INSTALL, and brings things like more USB audio support, DNS over TLS,
WiFi support for the Raspberry Pi, I2C support, and much more. I’m not
particularly well-versed in the world of plan9, and more often than not
it feels like a form of high-level programming performance art that I’m
just not smart enough to understand. The whole community and its
associated web sites have a very unique feel to it, and I always feel
like I’m just not cool enough to be part of it. That’s not a dig at the
plan9 community – it’s more of an indictment of my lack of coolness.
Which really shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>

<h2 id="run0-a-systemd-based-more-secure-replacement-for-sudo">run0: a
systemd-based, more secure replacement for sudo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Lennart Poettering, main developer of systemd, has announced run0, a
systemd-based replacement for the well-known sudo command that fixes
many of he inherent issues with the widely used tool to gain temporary
elevated privileges. There are various problems with sudo, which
basically come down to that it’s a large SUID binary, meaning it
consists of privileged code that unprivileged users can run from their
own context. This makes sudo a fairly large attack surface, and why
OpenBSD uses doas instead; while doas suffers from the same main
problem, it’s much smaller and reduces the attack surface considerably.
SUID processes are weird concepts: they are invoked by unprivileged code
and inherit the execution context intended and controlled by
unprivileged code. By execution context I mean the myriad of properties
that a process has on Linux these days, from environment variables,
process scheduling properties, cgroup assignments, security contexts,
file descriptors passed, and so on and so on. A few of these settings
the kernel is nice enough to clean up automatically when a SUID binary
is invoked, but much of it has to be cleaned up by the invoked suid
binary. This has to be done very very carefully, and history has shown
that SUID binaries are generally pretty shit at that. ↫ Lennart
Poettering Poettering wants to address this problem, and has come up
with run0, which behaves like sudo, but works entirely differently and
is not SUID. Run0 asks the services manager to create a shell or command
under the target user’s ID, creating a new PTY, sending data back and
forth from the originating TTY and the new PTY. Or in other words: the
target command is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked
off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the client (well,
admittedly, we <em>do</em> propagate $TERM, but that’s an explicit
exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist). One could say, “run0”
is closer to behaviour of “ssh” than to “sudo”, in many ways. Except
that it doesn’t bother with encryption or cryptographic authentication,
key management and stuff, but instead relies on the kernel’s local
identification mechanisms. run0 doesn’t implement a configuration
language of its own btw (i.e. no equivalent of /etc/sudoers). Instead,
it just uses polkit for that, i.e. how we these days usually let unpriv
local clients authenticate against priv servers. ↫ Lennart Poettering
This approach addresses a whole slew of attack vectors on sudo, and it
comes with fun additional features like being able to give your terminal
a different background tint when using it, or displaying a little red
dot in the terminal window title to further indicate you’re using
elevated privileges. It will ship as part of the upcoming release of
systemd 256.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-at-work">Microsoft At Work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this was a wild goose chase of a read. J. B. Crawford dove into
the history of something I’ve never heard of – Microsoft At Work – and
came away with a story that’ while clearer thanks to his research, is
still frustratingly nebulous. I’m still not entirely sure what Microsoft
At Work really was, but I think it had the goal of running Windows on
communications devices like faxes, to make it easier to share and work
on documents across various devices. Crawford did a lot of digging, and
eventually settles on what he thinks might be a description of what MAW
really consisted of. I am being a bit dismissive for effect. MAW was
more ambitious than just installing Windows on a grape. The effort
included a unified communications protocol for the control of office
machines, including printers, for which a whole Microsoft stack was
envisioned. This built on top of the Windows Printing System, a
difficult-to-search-for project that apparently predated MAW by a short
time, enough so that Windows Printing System products were actually on
the market when MAW was announced—MAW products were, we will learn, very
much not. MAW devices like the Ricoh IFS77 ran 16-bit Windows 3.1 with a
new GUI intended to appear more modern while reducing resource
requirements. Some reporters at the time noted that Microsoft was cagey
about the supported architectures, I suspect they were waiting on ports
to be completed. The fax machine was probably x86, though, as there’s
little evidence MAW actually ran on anything else. ↫ J. B. Crawford The
’90s were a wild time, especially as Microsoft, and this MAW project
seems to have ’90s written all over it, but I’d still love to learn a
lot more about this. I hope this article will bring out some former
Microsoft execs or employees who can give us more details, and possibly
even some code. I want to know how this works and what it did.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-cosmotechnics">Thoughts on Cosmotechnics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called
<a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The
negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs
called
<a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From
Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea
called “The
SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>”
which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin
and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s
<em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
–which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve
ever read, so this is relevant for me.
</p>
<p>
Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism
linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called
<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics
and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all
these philosophical (epistemological?)
arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>,
but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for
a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In
Hui’s words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the
unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities,
whether craft-making or art-making.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to
divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a
contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component
and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use,
then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction.
Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed
animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that
stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped
from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item,
I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for
me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…
</p>
<p>
In the words of Dr. King from his sermon
<em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The
Three Evils of Society</a></em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided
missiles and misguided men.”<br /> – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up
question is “Whose morals?”
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in
regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic,
but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest
destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough
seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of
African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology,
a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural
order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less
metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on
cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the
continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor,
and people.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world
order that goes beyond a single
hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve
the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We
need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And
the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient
knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism
brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems
that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away
from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from
the
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>;
the butcher Pao Ding.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to
being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather
in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei
about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good
knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the
Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the
bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter
into the gaps between them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better
understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web
design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of
viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or
preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become
excellent butchers of websites.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year
because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his
knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other
hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen
years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone.
Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and
gropes for the right place to move further.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through
bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a
technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if
we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium,
<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the
grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.
</p>
<p>
The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist
makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the
cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and
there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?
</p>
<p>
Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old
guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my
loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology
from an
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral
company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm.
Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth
of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools
dull, we throw stones at each other.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but
I’ve never thought of the tools I use as a moral choice. Perhaps now I
will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of
<em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for
expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the
large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to
have vocabulary to think about future problems.

One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the

“multipolar world’ philosophy echoed by Vladimir Putin before and I
don’t believe we should cede moral authority over to authoritarian
regimes that slaughter and demonize LGBTQ+ groups and ethnic minorities.
We shouldn’t use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era
superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new. That said, I
sit in a comfortable seat of privilege and systemic power well within
the borders of the American Empire…

id="windows-nt-and-netware-on-pa-risc-and-a-hp-ux-port-to-x86">Windows
NT and NetWare on PA-RISC, and a HP-UX port to x86</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Back when I was working on my article about PA-RISC, HP-UX, and UNIX
workstations in general, I made extensive use of OpenPA, Paul
Weissmann’s invaluable and incredibly detailed resource about HP’s
workstation efforts, HP-UX, and tons of related projects and products.
Weissmann’s been doing some serious digging, and has unearthed details
about a number of essentially forgotten operating system efforts. First,
it turns out HP was porting Windows NT to PA-RISC in the early ’90s.
Several magazine sources and USEnet posts around 1993 point to HP
pursuing a PA-RISC port to NT, modified the PA-RISC architecture for
bi-endianess and even conducted a back-room presention at the ’94 Comdex
conference of a (modified HP 712?) PA-7100LC workstation running Windows
NT. Mentions of NT on PA-RISC continued in 1994 with some customer
interest but ended around 1995. ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA The port
eventually fizzled out due to a lack of interest from both customers and
application developers, and HP realised its time was better spent on the
future of x86, Intel’s Itanium, instead. HP also planned to work
together with Novell to port NetWare to PA-RISC, but the work took
longer than expected and it, too, was cancelled. The most recent
secretive effort was the port of HP-UX to x86, an endeavour that took
place during the final days of the UNIX workstation market. Parts of the
conversation in these documents mention a successful boot of HP-UX on
x86 in December of 2009, with porting efforts projected to cost 100M+
between 2010 and 2016. The plan was for mission-critical x86 systems
(ProLiant DL980 and Superdome with x86) and first releases projected in
2011 (developer) and 2012 (Superdome and Linux ABI). ↫ Paul Weissmann at
OpenPA I’m especially curious about that last one, as porting HP-UX to
x86 seems like a massive effort during a time where it was already
obvious Linux had completely obliterated the traditional UNIX market. It
really feels like the last death saving throws of a platform everybody
already knew wasn’t going to make it.</p>

<p>I’m also blocking people who hype ActivityPub in comments to my posts
about social web stuff that has nothing to do with AP. I’ve been down
this road before. I just want to find people with

whose business is interop, who want to try stuff out. AP is not a good
foundation to build on, at least until they come up with a

for it. Basically it isn’t a standard even though they say it is. If you
want to help your cause: 1. Stop hyping. 2. Get busy with that BDG.</p>

trivia for you: ‘Hook of Holland’ is actually a mistranslation of the
Dutch name Hoek van Holland. ‘Hoek’, in Dutch, means ‘corner’, not
‘hook’. And if you know

days I’m using the moderation tools on the social web more than I did in
the past. If someone I don’t know posts a negative comment on Facebook,
in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have
that feature (other systems don’t, they should). Any lurker who happens
by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don’t know you, I honestly
don’t care what you think, esp if it’s negative and has less than ten
syllables total. It’s hit and run spam for sure. I’m widening my
definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that
actually mean anything, it doesn’t amount to much. Let’s see what the
social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-foundation-in-financial-trouble">GNOME Foundation in
financial trouble</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>As you may be aware, the GNOME Foundation has operated at a deficit
(nonprofit speak for a loss – ie spending more than we’ve been raising
each year) for over three years, essentially running the Foundation on
reserves from some substantial donations received 4-5 years ago. The
Foundation has a reserves policy which specifies a minimum amount of
money we have to keep in our accounts. This is so that if there is a
significant interruption to our usual income, we can preserve our core
operations while we work on new funding sources. We’ve now “hit the
buffers” of this reserves policy, meaning the Board can’t approve any
more deficit budgets – to keep spending at the same level we must
increase our income. ↫ Robert McQueen Learning that the GNOME Foundation
can barely scrape by financially makes me irrationally angry. As much as
I’ve grown to dislike using GNOME and thus switched all my machines over
to KDE, GNOME is still the most popular desktop environment and used
extensively by pretty much all the big corporate Linux distributions.
How is it possible that this hugely popular and important open source
project has to beg individual users for donations like they’re running
an independent tech website or something? Where’s all the financial
support from Red Hat, IBM, Oracle, Canonical, and so on? If not even an
insanely popular project like GNOME can be financially stable, what hope
is there for the countless small, unknown open source projects that form
the basis of our entire computing world?</p>

Linux</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>In February last year I wrote about running a FreeBSD desktop, and
concluded that sometimes you need to give yourself permission to tinker.
Well recently I’ve started tinkering with Alpine Linux! It’s been
recommended to me for years, so I’m finally getting around to checking
it out. There’s a lot to like if you come from BSD, which we’ll dig into
here. ↫ Ruben Schade Just a quick look at this unexpectedly popular
Linux distribution that really has its own identity.</p>
