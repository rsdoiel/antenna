<p>Journalism talks about Trump’s trials, but they are trials for the
Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call">he
is</a>) then if he isn’t punished we no longer have the rule of law. So
don’t miss that we are on trial too. And – when journalism frames the
faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the
United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the
Republicans win. We know that, it’s provable. And anything that’s true
should be built into the stories journalism writes about.</p>

In collaboration with the other major browser engine developers, Mozilla
is thrilled to announce Speedometer 3 today. Like previous versions of
Speedometer, this benchmark measures what we think matters most for
performance online: responsiveness. But today’s release is more open and
more challenging than before, and is the best tool for driving browser
performance improvements that we’ve ever seen.

<h2 id="better-faster-stronger-time-zone-updates-on-android">Better,
faster, stronger time zone updates on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>From the beginning, time zone rules were a component in Mainline,
called Time Zone Data or tzdata module. This integration allowed us to
react more quickly to government-mandated time zone changes than before.
However until 2023 tzdata updates were still bundled with other Mainline
changes, sometimes leading to testing complexities and slower
deployment. In 2023, we made further investments in Mainline’s
infrastructure and decoupled the tzdata module from the other
components. With this isolation, we gained the ability to respond
rapidly to time zone legislation changes — often releasing updates to
Android users outside of the established release cadence. Additionally,
this change means time zone updates can reach a far greater number of
Android devices, ensuring you as Android users always see the correct
time. ↫ Almaz Mingaleev and Masha Khokhlova This is equal parts boring
and equal parts amazing. The amount of work developers have to put into
making sure timezones work is astonishing, and the fact that a large
chunk of it is done by volunteers is even more impressive.</p>

<h2 id="oh-servers">Oh servers!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server
software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging
communities.
</p>
<p>
And then this happened…
</p>
<p>
We’ve been having serious problems on
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> since Friday when I
made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash
when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you’d get an awful error
message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the
server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and
restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some
work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors.
And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they
still haven’t.
</p>
<p>
We’re going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to
the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to
its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we’re going to upgrade
the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That
won’t happen today and probably not tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Most people probably don’t know that feedland.com is a project I’m doing
with Automattic. It’s running in their cloud. This system should be able
to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can’t, where
feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are
many thousands of users, we should be okay. That’s why I did the work to
convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and
nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last
year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but
it had to be done.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on
our main server in the last few days. I can’t promise it won’t happen
again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases
re-learned.
</p>
<p>
It’s even worse than it appears and as they say – still diggin!

<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">
2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?
</h1>
<p>
The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined
audience. It is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It’s more
than writing into a booklet, “Dear Diary, …” – and yet we do it even if
there are no comments. Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think
I’m just as happy getting the occasional email or reply on the
fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the words is terrifying. And
once I got that first comment, once I started linking the blog from my
profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to
read and implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was
something I feared. The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart
beats. The heart bleeds.
</p>
<p>
Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments.
First, there’s a comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk
a look? But then the imagined audience is still there and now it’s
worse. How will I react as I am being watched? Blogging turns into a
performance where I feel like I’m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am
I? All the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really don’t
want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren’t very observant being unable to perceive
their own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.
</p>
<p>
The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously.
Words are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to
weight them carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It
doesn’t matter how long or how short the page, how trivial or how
controversial the topic.
</p>
<p>
And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts
unexamined and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the
judgements. How often have I found myself falling short of my own
measure.
</p>
<p>
To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for
me, for my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I
struggle for virtue and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined
reader and myself. As proof. “I struggled!” I struggle. I keep on
struggling to discover what is right and to do what is right.
</p>
<p>
Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things
that I think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my
mind. I write about the things I know because I did not know them
before. And who cares about those laborious system administration blog
posts where I struggle with this or that ephemeral problem. All these
issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People find their answers on Stack
Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized platform where middlemen
gamify the experience so that we can help each other while on the
thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I
do, when I’m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And
there are so many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved
articles and snippets are more like compost heaps, where layer upon
layer of good stuff gets dropped, never to see the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a
fire, somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that
is fine. The world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one
thought knows not the next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion
of the sleepless mind. Our books, our journals, our blogs, our posts,
they all participate. Perhaps we fall for those waves of outrage and the
galaxy brain has a seizure as we all throw our weight around in unison,
crushing innocent lives, leaving those we hurt behind, forgetting them
as quickly as we forget about the outrage.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one
sparking a fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and
posts on social media has certainly changed me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and
blogging. And this is why I cannot stop blogging. To blog in that
half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and perhaps they are
not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks onto that
great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of
us can talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to
blog.
</p>
<p>
I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to
think long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing.
I keep failing and so I must keep blogging.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about
meetings. The mind reflecting on its own function. … Writing about
writing might not have quite the same potential for nested, generative
dysfunction, but it often produces artifacts just as unintelligible. –
<a href="https://p1k3.com/2020/5/20/">meta meta</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my
posts. The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on
that, too, by the same author:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one. The
ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I’m
sure I’ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost
entirely unsupportable to me now. And yet: Nothing else has quite the
same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of. The
one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of
things.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where
you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away. Not worth
the electrons it was written with! But who’s doing the judging: you, or
that imagined audience I was talking about?
</p>
<p>
I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening
audience. And really, who is going to read my blog? Internet
stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my
parents. (Hi mom!) I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I’m
feeling anxious. Because writing in a paper notebook I don’t feel
judged. Surely there’s a similar place, online. The key is to find that
happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the
Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging
nightmare might be.
</p>
<p>
For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right.
Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit. All these sites
are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden,
Zettelkasten, there’s not enough difference to draw lines. It’s all a
question of intent, of culture, of belonging. The blog spirit is to
write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive. The digital
garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined
or not. The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you
thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to
more thoughts on new notes. And the wiki spirit is to write and edit
online, to hit the Save button and then it’s live. There is no editor,
there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management. I can
see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old
web power. It’s not an app. The software has no idea of process. The
wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save. And
then I read it again, and edit it. And tomorrow, I read it again, and
edit it. And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.
</p>
<p>
I no longer live in the
<a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages
are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add
timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do
disappear into the great compost of thoughts. The archive gobbles them
up. I do go back but I don’t rewrite the pages completely. I’m more
likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this
page.
</p>
<p>
I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don’t like at all. I do leave
some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad
opinions held.
</p>
<p>
What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren’t gems. They
are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not
job applications. And if I don’t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise
it. Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret
something, or I add something. I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I
add new pages. What I don’t do is polish the old posts. There will be
more great posts in the future. The important part is the writing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading
<a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in
the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where
meaning is discussed.
</p>
<p>
Meaning without an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is …
generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking,
or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a
more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a
feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better
about life, or change those feelings somehow.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then with an audience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in
important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were
clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in
so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the
structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I got an email from
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bouncepaw">@bouncepaw</span></a> with a
link to <a href="https://links.bouncepaw.com/1188">a reply</a>. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
This is how it starts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds
something to it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it
again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two
“views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.
</p>
<p>
A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page
lists all the pages in the order of their creation.
</p>
<p>
A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a>
page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).
</p>
<p>
So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed:
<a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki
feed</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed.
But it’s there for you.
</p>

id="house-panel-unanimously-approves-bill-that-could-ban-tiktok">House
panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could
lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices,
renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social
media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a
Chinese government spying risk. The measure that sailed unanimously
through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok
from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly
170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent
company, ByteDance. ↫ Brian Fung at CNN TikTok obviously needs to be
banned. It’s an extension of a genocidal, totalitarian government that
has no place on our our phones. Yes, I understand Facebook, Apple,
Google, Microsoft also collect vast amounts of data, but at least they
are (nominally) beholden to our legal systems, and while there is, of
course, a vast power imbalance between us as individuals and them as
megacorporations, it’s still nowhere even close as to being an arm of a
totalitarian government – they’re just not comparable. China’s state
surveillance tools have no place on our devices.</p>

still haven’t found whatever it is that is causing the tabs not to
respond to clicks sometimes on mobile devices on news.scripting.com and
scripting.com. I’m thinking about all the time that’s going into this
and how much value there is in the tabs. I could also cut through all
the michegas and just redirect from news.scripting.com
<a href="https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner&catname=tech">into
FeedLand</a>. The same data. There <i>are</i> advantages to doing it
that way. For some people that is what news.scripting.com will turn
into. It’s an on ramp to the world of collaborative feed subscriptions.
The open social web, in feeds. Which is why we call it Feed<i>Land.
</i>You know The Land of Feeds. I like “land” names for products and
companies. I started a company called UserLand a long time ago. I was
skiing in Utah in 1989 when I decided on two names: UserLand and
Frontier. I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from
the Mac – where the <i>Finder</i> is the app you spend a lot of time in.
So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and
began with F. I know it’s weird. It’s also why FeedLand feels like a
homey name to me. :-)</p>

<h2 id="the-apple-curl-security-incident-12604">The Apple curl security
incident 12604</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, the version
shipped by Apple, it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store
in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification. A secondary
check that was not asked for, is not documented and plain frankly comes
completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a
trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA
store contains a cert that can verify the server! This is a security
problem because now suddenly certificate checks pass that should not
pass. ↫ Daniel Stenberg Absolutely wild that Apple does not consider
this a security issue.</p>
