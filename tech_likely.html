<p>A bunch of small but important items in recently-breaking AI news:
Tesla settled their lawsuit with the Huang family over Walter Huang’s
death, for an undisclosed amount of money. “Although Huang’s family
acknowledges he was distracted while the car was driving, they argued
Tesla is at fault because it falsely marketed Autopilot as self-driving
software. They alleged Tesla knew that Autopilot was not ready for prime
time and had flaws that could make its use unsafe.” The settlement is
striking in part because Musk had previously said this</p>

Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal the
Secrets of the Aurora</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern
lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not
fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from
instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample
multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these
limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop
instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more
than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about
the amazing physics happening within the aurora.</p>

<h2 id="ten-years-ago-windows-xp-received-its-final-update">Ten years
ago, Windows XP received its final update</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final
security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for
one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at
Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was
using at the time – BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x – Windows XP felt kind of
like a bad joke I wasn’t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn’t seem to
offer anything substantial, and it didn’t take long for major security
incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn’t
until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into
its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better
alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I’m of course talking
about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today
though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP
has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows
XP – the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense – the
sound set, the wallpaper of course – has become iconic, warts and all,
and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as
they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few
service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I
would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and
Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that’s more of a personal thing
and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly
been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will
suddenly get good, either.</p>

launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant
leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app
servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory
caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training
and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of
purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out
offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like
networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and
improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads
storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that
decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically
provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM
processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In
other words, we’ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to
eBay in a few years.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project
originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project’s
still got a long way to go, it’s definitely a serious contender to
become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it’s
starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on
bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine
inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++.
This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for
webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They’re
already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using
Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely
eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill
now.</p>

<h2 id="intels-ambitious-meteor-lake-igpu">Intel’s ambitious Meteor Lake
iGPU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Intel and AMD both tried to ship iGPUs fast enough to compete with
low end discrete cards over the past 10 years with mixed results.
Recently though, powerful iGPUs have been thrown back into the
spotlight. Handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS’s ROG Ally
demonstrated that consumers are willing to accept compromises to play
games on the go. AMD has dominated that market so far. Valve’s Steam
Deck uses AMD’s Van Gogh APU, and the ROG Ally uses the newer Phoenix
APU. Unlike Van Gogh, Phoenix is a general purpose mobile chip with both
a powerful CPU and GPU. Phoenix doesn’t stop at targeting the handheld
segment, and threatens Intel’s laptop market share too. In response,
Meteor Lake brings a powerful iGPU to the party. It has the equivalent
of 128 EUs and clocks up to 2.25 GHz, making it modestly wider and much
faster than Raptor Lake’s 96 EU, 1.5 GHz iGPU. Raptor Lake’s Xe-LP
graphics architecture gets replaced by Xe-LPG, a close relative of the
Xe-HPG architecture used in Intel’s A770 discrete GPU. At the system
level, Meteor Lake moves to a GPU integration scheme that better suits a
chiplet configuration where the iGPU gets significant transistor and
area budget. I’ll be testing Meteor Lake’s iGPU with the Core Ultra 7
155H, as implemented in the ASUS Zenbook 14. I purchased the device
myself in late February. ↫ Chips and Cheese I’m absolutely here for the
resurgence in capable integrated GPUs, both for PC gaming on the go and
for better graphics performance even in thinner, smaller laptops. I
would love to have just a bit more graphics power on my thin and small
laptop so I can do some basic gaming with it.</p>

<h2 id="google-launches-new-find-my-device-network-on-android">Google
launches new Find My Device network on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices
around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new,
crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device
can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items
quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out. ↫ Erik Kay
on the Google blog This old Android feature has basically been updated
to be the same thing as Apple’s Find My, but with more than just one
vendor making the tracking tags. Of course, this means it also comes
with the same problems, from its use by stalkers to controlling
partners, and everything in between. This is a very problematic
technology, one which I think is almost impossible to make safe. Still,
I have a Samsung tracker that I don’t use anymore – because I bought a
Pixel 8 Pro, and don’t want to install any Samsung applications – and I
do plan on getting a new tracker that’s compatible with this new Find My
Device network. With two small kids, it’s easy to lose track of
something like my car keys, and instead of stressing about where they
are when we need to leave on time, I can just ping them using our Google
Home devices instead. Sometimes, these silly smart technologies really
do take just that little bit of stress out of your life – you just have
to be really picky and honest with yourself about what you really
need.</p>

id="microsoft-adds-driver-to-windows-that-prevents-changing-the-default-browser-using-the-registry">Microsoft
adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using
the registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar
defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this
is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft
is not particularly happy with this, as they’ve recently introduced a
new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by
blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of
registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was
discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based
protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd
party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but
in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education
environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver
during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of
executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly
and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph
Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do,
Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an
additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert
the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the
changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU’s DMA, but the
driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it’s all a bit
unclear at the moment.</p>

Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub

tries out new ideas.

ActivityPub you know who’s following you and in RSS you don’t. This may
sound like a negative until you think about it from the user’s
standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn’t
like RSS btw.

It has been
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed
out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can
testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind
of spooky but I guess ok. I can’t recall ever receiving spam as a result
of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I
unsub begging me to come back. So it isn’t a huge problem in a real way
at least for me, yet.
</li>
<li>
I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you
attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You’re
just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don’t abide
that. Have a nice day.

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
ALGOL is one of those topics that’s haunted the show for a while. It
comes up any time we talk about programming languages, and with good
reason. Many of the features and ideas found in modern languages have
their roots in ALGOL. Despite that influence, ALGOL itself remains
somewhat obscure. It never reached the highs of a C or LISP.
</p>
<p>
In this series we are going to look at ALGOL from 1958 all up to 1968,
keeping a careful eye on how the language evolved, how it’s problems
were addressed, and how new problems were introduced.

blocks even more customization apps in Windows 11 version 24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Users recently noticed that third-party apps for customizing the user
interface no longer work in the upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2. Not
only does Microsoft not allow you to run those apps, but it even blocks
you from upgrading to newer builds. StartAllBack, a popular tool for
tweaking the taskbar and Start menu in Windows 11, was among the first
to fail on 24H2. Sadly, it is not the only one. ExplorerPatcher also no
longer works in Windows 11 24H2. ExplorerPatcher from Valinet is quite a
popular app that lets you bring back the old Windows 10 taskbar in
Windows 11, apply additional modifications to make Windows 11 slightly
better, and restore some of its missing features. Windows 11 version
24H2 is now flagging ExplorerPatcher as incompatible due to “security or
performance issues” with the following message. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin
I guess the taskbar and Start menu are incredibly important real estate
for Microsoft, since it’s the absolute prime spot for showing ads. If
users replace their taskbar and Start menu with something from a third
party, that prime real estate is gone. Major conspiracy vibes, yes, and
I know this isn’t the reason, but why else would they be blocking these
applications? I can’t think of anything that makes more sense.</p>

<h2 id="outlook-is-microsofts-new-data-collection-service">Outlook is
Microsoft’s new data collection service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows, it appears
the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance tool for
targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing campaigns
of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate
advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply
an email service; it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 801
external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. ↫
Edward Komenda on the Proton blog Now, note that this is an article
written by Proton, posted on the company blog, so of course they’re not
going to be too kind towards their competitors. That being said, the
article’s not wrong: the new Outlook web application, now the default in
Windows, not only shared your data with around 800 partners, it also
displays ads inside of the application. On macOS, it will even show yo
fake emails that are, in fact, ads. Furthermore, once you add your
accounts to this new Outlook web application, you’ll also be uploading
your username and password to Microsoft, giving them access to your
email accounts for advertising and data collection purposes, a shady
practice a ton of email clients on mobile devices tend to do as well.
Suffice it to say you really shouldn’t be using this new Outlook, and
you should make sure friends and family don’t either. This is yet
another nail in the coffin of Windows, now an advertising and data
collection platform first, and operating system second.</p>

open-source btrfs driver for Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem
Btrfs. A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the
Linux kernel, and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It
is also included as part of the free operating system ReactOS. ↫
WinBtrfs GitHub page If you’re running a distribution that defaults to
Btrfs, or you actively choose to use it on other distributions, and you
also happen to dual-boot Windows because your boss makes you use some
garbage corpo software, this driver will make your setup a bit easier to
manage.</p>

Shakespearean tragedy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>You may have read yesterday’s New York Times report by Cade Metz and
others on how many of the biggest AI companies have been cutting ethical
corners in a race to gather as much data as possible (“OpenAI, Google
and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and
discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to
train their newest artificial intelligence systems”).</p>

Bluesky, Andrew Hickey
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b">explains</a>
how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his
house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my
house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I
had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the
chaos. It wasn’t until the work was over that I was able to start to get
back into my flow.
</p>
<p>
In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a
good five or six hours before it’s time to do the next thing. The first
hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about
where I’m going next. By hour two, I’m not quite at my highest rate but
getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I’m in a good
groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I’m taking short breaks to check
email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my
attention to be available, for a short period.
</p>
<p>
After 5-6 hours of this, I’m wiped out.
</p>
<p>
I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.
</p>
<p>
But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if
I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my
head. It doesn’t take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole
thing, and basically have to start over the next day.
</p>
<p>
Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything
other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I’m sure of it.
Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual
achievement. If you’re doing something that few other people do well,
you’re not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and
a lot of detail, and memory, but you’re sometimes inventing things that
no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other.
And you’re doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you’re
burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they
don’t interfere at all. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won’t edit it until
the evening, when I do lite work that doesn’t require much focus for any
duration.

2024-04-06 Travelling
</h1>
<p>
The last ten years, travels – even holiday travels! – have made me more
and more nervous. I used to be so cool about travel. We lived abroad and
travelled so much. And now I’d prefer to just stay in Switzerland all
the time. But my wife still loves to travel and once I’m there, wherever
it is, I feel OK again.
</p>
<p>
I can’t say what it is. A vague anxiety about everything. From the
smallest thing like it’s spring and I’m going to miss the next two weeks
of flowers, and the bees are all emerging from their reed tubes and I
hope our friend is OK with watering the gazillion plants we have and I
hope we didn’t forget anything and I hope security checks are going to
be OK and foreign dictatorship and secret services are going to stay out
of our lives and out of our phones and I hope we have enough money for
tips and how much does one tip again?
</p>
<p>
Back when I was about thirty I argued that equipped with a credit card
nothing else mattered. I’d just buy whatever I was missing. These days
we start our “packing mound” days beforehand.
