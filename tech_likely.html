<h2 id="technology-history-where-unix-came-from">Technology history:
where Unix came from</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, every Unix-like system can trace their ancestry back to the
original Unix. That includes Linux, which uses the GNU tools – and the
GNU tools are based on the Unix tools. Linux in 2024 is removed from the
original Unix design, and for good reason – Linux supports architectures
and tools not dreamt of during the original Unix era. But the core
command line experience in Linux is still very similar to the Unix
command line of the 1970s. The next time you use ls to list the files in
a directory, remember that you’re using a command line that’s been with
us for more than fifty years. ↫ Jim Hall An excellent overview of some
of the more ancient UNIX commands that are still with us today. One
thing I always appreciate when I dive into an operating system closer to
“real” UNIX, like OpenBSD, or a actual UNIX, like HP-UX, is just how
much more logical sense they make under the hood than a Linux system
does. This is not a dunk on modern Linux – it has to cater to endless
more modern needs than something ancient and dead like HP-UX – but what
I learn while using these systems closer to the UNIX has made me
appreciate proper UNIX more than I used to in the past. In what surely
sounds like utter lunacy to system administrators who actually had to
seriously administer HP-UX systems back in the day, I genuinely love
using HP-UX, setting it up, configuring it, messing around with it,
because it just makes so much more logical sense than the systems we use
today. The knowledge gained from using BSD, HP-UX, and others, while not
always directly applicable to Linux, does aid me in understanding
certain Linux things better than I did before. What I’m trying to say is
– go and load up an old UNIX, or at least a modern BSD. Aside from being
great operating systems in their own right, they’re much easier to grasp
than a modern Linux system, and you’ll learn a lot form the
experience.</p>

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
Hello! My name is Anne Sturdivant, you will often find me online as
“Apple Annie” or using the handle <code>anniegreens</code>. I give a
little background on these names on my weblog:
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/01/origins-of-a-nickname">Origins
of a nickname</a>. I am originally from Washington state in the US but
have lived in Portland, OR, for about 20 years.
</p>
<p>
I moved to Portland to attend college (for the second time) and studied
web design and interactive media, for which I received a BS. I continued
on that course for my career for the last 16 years, working mainly on
the front-end with Drupal, design systems, and structured content. I
recently have been on a hiatus from full-time work due to health (and
other) factors. I am still active in the front-end and web design
spaces, also more recently jumping back into “work” on a personal level.
</p>
<p>
Hobbies are hard to define since so many things I enjoy doing and could
categorize as hobbies are just a core part of me. I am a gardener but
calling that a hobby feels like an understatement. My entire yard is a
garden and I put every single plant in the ground. I post many photos
and write a bit about it more on my
<a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol">microblog</a> than my weblog. I
also travel to gardens in the Pacific Northwest and take photos and
write about it in a newsletter that has been on hold for a while. I do
plan on resuming this newsletter at some point, platform to be
determined.
</p>
<p>
I also watch a fair amount of movies and television, mostly on streaming
services, though I don’t write about that much. I love listening to
podcasts and find myself gravitating towards the weird and unusual,
tech-related and front-end, US political news (though not what you might
think, I really only listen to serious lawyers that don’t get into
hyperbolic punditry), and health-related and local subjects.
</p>
<p>
I read but am not a dedicated book reader, I find myself more drawn to
blogs and the interlinking nature of the web. I do usually start this
path in my RSS reader but very often a trail starts on Mastodon due to a
post someone shares. I enjoy photography and hiking and visiting natural
areas in the Pacific Northwest, also featured in my newsletter, but do
less of that now (except photos of my garden) due to current health
limitations.
</p>
<p>
I suppose you could call tinkering with front-end development a hobby as
well, since nowadays I’m doing that for personal pleasure and growth,
even if I am trained to do that as a career as well. I find this to be a
creative outlet as much as other creative endeavors, including
gardening, and I’ve written in the past about how I find both gardening
and front-end development to share some of the same parts of my brain.
</p>
<p>
Finally, this “hobby” should lead us right into the next question:
blogging!
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I have several blogs, it might be an addiction. I’ve written pretty
extensively about my weblog, which I consider my main blog, and how it
came to be. Part of my hiatus and worsening health issues were due to
work-induced burnout and I spent several years away from the web, unsure
I’d ever return. In 2022 I started to have the desire to once again do
<em>something</em> on the web, though I was unsure what that would look
like. I had a blog in college but long abandoned it, though it still
sits on the same domain my old portfolio site sits on, locked behind a
login.
</p>
<p>
After coming to Mastodon, I discovered an instance that was part of a
paid suite of tools,
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>, and
signed up after finding the Local timeline to be quite enjoyable (it’s
now my main instance). What I didn’t realize was that the rest of the
tools would become just as important to me. I first created a “link
page” that now acts as my global profile, then a /now page, and a
weblog, and a statuslog, and soon had also signed up for Micro.blog. I
now have nine blogs, seven of them active, spread across omg.lol and
Micro.blog.
</p>
<p>
As I said, the <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol">weblog</a> is my
main blog and started as a way to get back into doing front-end
development again and to write about it and the process of customizing
the blog. I really started it for myself, to work my way out of burnout,
as a means of therapy. I now post mostly longer form, often technical,
posts about front-end development and web design, the indieweb,
blogging, the internet, as well as some more personal pieces, and still
the process of working on the blog.
</p>
<p>
I’d then consider my
<a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol">microblog</a> a close second to
the weblog. I post more short form content there, photo-blogging,
bookmarks, gardening, chronic illness, as well as some politics and
technology. I sometimes cross-post to one of my four Mastodon accounts.
</p>
<p>
My other blogs are more projects than traditional blogs. I have a trio
of blogs that serve as one project for
<a href="https://weblog.lol">weblog.lol</a>:
<a href="https://themes.lol">Themes</a>,
<a href="https://styles.themes.lol">Styles</a>, and
<a href="https://custom.themes.lol">Custom</a>, which I use exclusively
for weblog.lol styles and customizations to create themes. This work is
on hold right now as weblog.lol’s backend will be seeing some overhaul
over the next few months and I’ll need to reflect that there.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a> is a fun project that I loved
designing. I’m currently authoring all the messages on the notecards
myself but I would like to open it up to submissions one day. Right now
I’m working on the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days to
Offload</a> challenge on a dedicated blog called
<a href="https://100daysof.blog">100 Days of Blog</a>. Another microblog
I haven’t started yet, other than to obtain a domain and have a
direction for it, will be for testing and modernizing a trove of old
recipes I inherited from my grandmother. It is called Table for One
Cafe. Finally, I have a sixth weblog.lol blog that I’m working to make a
place for front-end experiments that I can include with blog posts on my
main weblog. This is code named Tiny Pages.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
For posts on my weblog, they are usually about something I worked on or
a process/knowledge piece to share. For this type of post I put in a
fair amount of research on a subject, create an outline, prepare assets
or code samples, and citations and footnotes. These very often are about
working on one of my blogs, adding a new feature, updating and improving
something technical, or learning a modern and new piece of functionality
within front-end development.
</p>
<p>
Personal pieces are far more spontaneous and may reflect how I am
feeling or a struggle I am dealing with. Other posts are reactions to
blog posts, articles, podcasts, and movies or television shows. I also
try to post a near-daily featured photo on my microblog. Sometimes these
are curated ahead of time, where I’ll plan out a week of photos, but
often they are a picture that the Apple Photos.app is featuring that
day. I thought about the kinds of blogs posts once and
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/types-of-blog-posts">wrote
something about it</a>, I’m not sure I’ve hit all of them yet!
</p>
<p>
I had many requests from the omg.lol community about what my weblog
workflow was so I published a piece aptly titled
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblog-publishing-workflow"><em>Weblog
Publishing Workflow</em></a>. In it I describe the tools I use,
including <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, which I am
writing these answers in right now. As far as how many drafts I write, I
really can’t tell you. The way Drafts works I never see a “draft”
version, I’m just constantly reading and rewriting or reorganizing
sections. One of the nice part of Drafts is being able to set up preview
templates that look exactly like the front-end of your blog, using all
the same assets, which I have stored on a CDN. When I read a piece for
editing, I read it in that preview as it gives me the best feeling of
how something will be seen once published on my weblog.
</p>
<p>
As for proof reading or asking for help in reviewing what I blog about,
I haven’t yet started to do that, but the idea has been in my mind for a
while. I know I make mistakes and I will often find at least a couple
after publishing, but I am not too worried about that. I’m fine airing
my bumps and bruises. I would, however, appreciate a review on more
technical pieces that I write in the future and may start looking for
someone I trust to do that or that is willing to offer their time.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I usually write in the morning or later at night, often with a cup of
coffee or tea, nestled into my large chair with ottoman in my living
room. I have a proper (and rather nice) office and I worked from home
for many years at my last job, but I’ve since moved away from that
strict feeling space for blogging or creative endeavors, unless I need
an external monitor for something large or complicated that I want to
see in a code editor or graphics program.
</p>
<p>
One thing that definitely influences my ability to write is sound. I
don’t necessarily mean I need to listen to music to be creative or to
write, but if there is sound it cannot be dialogue or lyrics with music.
For this reason I primarily listen to two highly curated Pandora
stations I created many years ago. I also listen to them while working
on design or technical projects, though often I prefer no sound at all.
</p>
<p>
If I’m already in the flow of something, either writing or working on a
site or design, I will often listen to music, but also from one of those
Pandora stations. I’ve been listening to them for so long, they are like
a comfortable friend and may therefore help me feel at ease. I know
creative spaces are important.
</p>
<p>
When I moved to Portland to attend an art college, I lived in a very
inspiring neighborhood near my school and felt like a creative’s dream
every time I stepped onto the sidewalk. Now when I am stuck on something
I find that just stepping out my back door into my garden is enough of
an escape that when I return I can get past that block. In 2019 when I
was at the worst of my burnout I planted a pollinator garden in my
raised vegetable beds and could spend hours out there gazing at the
flowers and wildlife. It was therapeutic, got the creative juices
flowing, and a means to make the day pass.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I assume most people answering these questions may run across the same
thing as myself: I have written about this on my blog before. My weblog
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/colophon">Colophon</a> details
much of this. The weblog is using
<a href="https://weblog.lol">weblog.lol</a>, a small blogging platform
that comes with an
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>
address. There is a lightweight templating system that allows passing of
variables with front-matter and config and authoring in Markdown and
HTML, or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
All static assets are stored on my <a href="https://bunny.net/cdn/">CDN
at Bunny.net</a>, the domain is registered at and DNS is currently
managed by <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> but I may moved to
Bunny.net for DNS as well, which would serve weblog as a static site.
Email for my domain is handled by
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>. I have just recently
added a contact form using
<a href="https://letterbird.co/">Letterbird</a>. Analytics are using
<a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics</a> for the time being,
though I am investigating self-hosting Umami for analytics with
PikaPods.
</p>
<p>
The theme is entirely custom CSS and HTML with limited Javascript for
theme switching and some web components. I mention in my workflow post
that I desired to use a platform and workflow that didn’t require a lot
of maintenance overhead, such as updating modules, dependencies, and
debugging build systems. I wanted the platform to get out of the way so
I could work on the parts I want to work on and write about it. I love
that there are so many diverse ways to blog right now, so many different
options for complexity based on what people want to do or can do. And
opportunities to do more when they want to and move to another platform
as they need more features. There is no wrong way to blog and the best
way is the way that makes it easiest for you.
</p>
<p>
My microblog is hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>
and uses a community contributed theme called Tiny Theme as a base with
custom CSS, some Javascript for web components, and template overrides
to complement the look and feel of my weblog’s theme. My other
projects/blogs are also on one of these platforms: Themes, Styles, and
Custom use weblog.lol; 3x5.pics and Tiny Pages use weblog.lol; and both
100 Days of Blog and Table for One Cafe are on Micro.blog.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
If I started over today, I’d be in a different head space and I like to
think I would have “branched out” more and relied on my web development
experience to build something more custom using 11ty or another static
site generator. I have more experience with PHP so I might have gone in
the direction of a PHP static site generator, but I appreciate and stay
updated with what is happening with 11ty enough that I think I will end
up using that some day.
</p>
<p>
Weblog.lol has some limitations and though I have gotten very far with
truly making it my own, I started the blog in January 2023, I’ve only
just started hitting walls that I am unable to get past due to the
platform’s limitations. The next version of weblog will run on a new
backend called Neato and I am willing to wait until that is ready to try
out before making any moves to another platform.
</p>
<p>
I think it more likely I leave Micro.blog before I leave weblog.lol (or
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>). The
original needs I had when I joined Micro.blog have either ended up being
something I decided I didn’t need (Fediverse integration), or I’ve found
alternatives to some of its functionality (cross-posting), and the
remaining piece I’ve yet to get set up, a newsletter, I already have
options, such as Buttondown or Ghost, that I could use.
</p>
<p>
I am still very pleased with the structure of my weblog. I believe
starting with a Styleguide up front helped me to keep styling consistent
by structuring the content and front-matter properly from fairly early
on. The only structure that I find lacking is, again, due to the
platform’s limitations. Having come from more than a decade of working
on Drupal platforms, I can see gaps in functionality that other
platforms might give me the flexibility to fill.
</p>
<p>
As for the name of my weblog, I’m glad this was brought up in the
suggestions—I <em>love</em> when a blog has a name! I curate a blogroll
by “spinning” it with nine new blogs at a time at no particular
regularity. In the process of doing so I come across the “name” of each
blog by peaking at the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and I am always
delighted to find when someone takes the time or creative effort to put
a little gem in there that you may not otherwise know about. I wrote a
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/give-your-blog-a-name">blog
post</a> about this once and I still think the blog I name in that post
is still my favorite name. As for my blog’s name(s), well, I have so
many of them, I’m getting to scratch that naming itch!
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
Since I have so many blogs I’m going to break this into each platform’s
costs along with additional costs for related services.
</p>
<h3>
Weblog, 3x5.pics, Themes/Styles/Custom, Tiny Pages
</h3>
<p>
All six of these blogs are omg.lol addresses. A one year subscription
for all the tools and goodies
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>
offers is $20USD. Sometimes there are deals (very often, multiple times
a year) and you can also gain banks of time through referrals. So
although, the cost of these would normally be $120USD per year combined,
I don’t actually pay that much right now. I have also bought banks of
time during promotional deals, so that helps as well. Each of these
addresses comes with multiple tools and web presences that are
infinitely configurable, so you gain quite a lot for a fairly low price.
On top of that it is a lovely welcoming community run by a really nice
guy, and I’m not just saying that.
</p>
<h3>
Microblog, 100 Days of Blog, Table for One Cafe
</h3>
<p>
A Micro.blog premium membership gets you up to five blogs plus a whole
other host of goodies, such as podcasting, newsletter functionality,
Fediverse integration, cross-posting, bookmarking, and more. The cost of
the premium memership is $10USD per month. A non-premium membership with
just one blog, plus cross-posting, and a few other goodies, is $5USD per
month.
</p>
<h3>
Related Services
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a> handles all five of my
domains. I got a deal on most of them for the first year. If all five of
them were to renew at the same time at the estimated costs it would be
roughly $115USD for another year.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://tinylytics.app">Tinylytics</a> is currently the
lightweight analytics I use. There is a free tier, a monthly tier, and a
yearly tier. I am currently on the yearly plan and paying $50USD per
year. I am looking into moving to self-hosting Umami through PikaPods
and that would be slightly more.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bunny.net/cdn">Bunny.net CDN</a> is a pay-as-you-go
service, so I don’t have exact figures to give, but I can try to
estimate. I serve all my domain’s static assets, except for the
Micro.blog sites which have their own storage. For March 2023 through
June 2024 I paid $60-70 for the CDN + optimization on one of the storage
zones, so that is less than $10USD per month at my current rate of
traffic, which does vary from month-to-month.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://echofeed.app">EchoFeed</a> Pro (Prami’s Version) is an
ad hoc cross-posting service. There is a free plan that allows for one
feed. The Pro plan gives you unlimited feeds and the “Prami’s Version”
is a small discount for omg.lol members. The creator of this service is
an omg.lol member. I pay $20USD per year.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://letterbird.co">Letterbird</a> Pro is a contact form
with customizations. The free plan has less options and no CSS
customizations. I pay $10USD per month for the Pro plan. I am using it
on two of my sites.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a> Pro is listed here because I do
use Flickr hosted images quite often on my main Microblog due to the
image quality and automatic resizing available, which I use to craft
responsive images in some posts. Flickr Pro is <span
class="math inline">$72.99USD per year with unlimited storage and full
resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of monetization, I don't think I have any issue
with it. I don't enjoy ads, but I don't mind unobtrusive methods of
helping to support independent creators. I have a Buy me a coffee button
on my blog at the bottom of every page. It rarely gets used, though I
wouldn't mind it got used more (obviously 😆) to help support the cost
of my infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if you find value in something someone creates there is
no shame in giving them some money to show appreciation and encourage
them to keep it up. Many people have stressful jobs and the creative
output they get via writing or doing other art and coding on their blogs
may be payment enough, but they still absolutely appreciate when someone
shows support monetarily. I try to give when I can, especially if I find
myself going back to a person over and over for things they create to
give away or for writing that has helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels just as loaded as creating a blogroll! Which I took
a different route in that I cannot and will not just choose a handful of
people, especially since we all tend to get caught up in silos and add
people that look and sound like us. My blogroll is an ever changing list
that I "spin" with nine new blogs at a time when I've collected enough
blogs to round out a diverse selection of bloggers and types of
blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three suggestions come off my blogroll, any of them would
be good candidates for your next interview that I would be very
interested in reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roma Komarov: &lt;a href="https://kizu.dev/"&gt;Articles
&amp;amp; Experiments by Roman Komarov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
href="https://blog.kizu.dev/"&gt;Roma's Unpolished
Posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melanie Kat: &lt;a
href="https://melkat.blog/"&gt;melkat.blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olu Niyi-Awosusi: &lt;a href="https://olu.online/"&gt;Olu
Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is admittedly a smorgasbord of links, but I think
they're all great. How do you choose just a handful of what the web has
to offer? For me, these are things I've thought about and looked at
recently. Three of these items I submitted for a &lt;a
href="https://tinyawards.net/"&gt;Tiny Award&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/"&gt;Igalia
Chats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I really enjoy this podcast. It combines two of my most favorite
front-end topics: CSS and accessibility and is co-hosted by one of the
all-time most influential figures in CSS: Eric Meyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oddbird.net/talks/"&gt;Oddbird past
and upcoming talks &amp;amp; workshops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'm always looking for new front-end content to watch or listen to. I
was recently on a quest to find front-end podcasts and wasn't as
successful as I hoped but I came across other resources. This Oddbird
resource is really great, featuring upcoming and past talks &amp;amp;
workshops by the esteemed team at Oddbird, notably Miriam
Suzanne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://slashpages.net/"&gt;Slash
Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is another fun project by Robb Knight. If you're just building a
blog or looking for ways to add new content that isn't necessarily blog
posts but still represent you and your ideas, "slash pages" are a great
way to do that. I'm still on my way to achieving "slash pages totality"
but I have &lt;a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/slashes"&gt;quite
a selection&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://reply.cards/"&gt;Reply
Cards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A small project by Adam Newbold, creator of omg.lol. Reply cards are
what they sound like: "Answer messages without having to write a
personal response." Choose from the existing library of cards or create
your own for a couple bucks and avoid that uncomfortable response you'd
rather not have to make!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://3x5.pics"&gt;3x5.pics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;
A project I recently completed but still have plans for some updates and
improvements, namely accepting submissions for new entries. &lt;a
href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/creating-3x5-pics"&gt;Read
a little write-up on the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
href="https://buttondown.email/ericwbailey/archive/"&gt;Eric Bailey's
newsletter: SC 2.4.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will find many newsletters to subscribe to but Eric's is one of my
favorites. Somehow curating a diverse list of links to articles and
information that always interest me. Some front-end, some web or tech,
some unusual and bizarre, always relevant to our times, and often
shocking and humbling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the 49th edition of &lt;em&gt;People and

<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: Ayjay blog</p>
<p>Around the rim of the shield Hephaestus made for Achilles is the
Ocean River, the great water that (Homer believed) rings our world —
Middle-earth, it’s sometimes called: the place where we live and, often
enough, fight and kill and die. And, as I have noted, Guadalcanal Island
is ringed by that very ocean. Guadalcanal […]</p>

id="play-store-could-soon-handle-updates-for-sideloaded-applications">Play
Store could soon handle updates for sideloaded applications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Android 14 introduced the ability for application stores to claim
ownership over application updates, to ensure other installation sources
won’t accidentally update applications they shouldn’t. What is still
lacking, however, is for users to easily change the update ownership for
applications. In other words, say you install an application by
downloading an APK from GitHub, and later the application makes its way
to F-Droid, you’ll get warning popups when F-Droid tries to update that
application. That’s about to change, it seems, as Android Authority
discovered that the Play Store application seems to be getting a new
feature where it can take ownership of an application’s updates. A new
flag spotted in the latest Google Play Store release suggests that users
may see the option to install updates for apps downloaded from a
different source. As you can see in the attached screenshots, the Play
Store will show available updates for apps downloaded from different
sources. On the app listing, you’ll also see a new “Update from Play”
button that will switch the update ownership from the original source to
the Play Store. ↫ Pranob Mehrotra at Android Authority Assuming this
functionality is just an API other application stores can also tap into,
this will be a great addition to Android for power users who use
multiple application stores and want to properly manage which store
updates what applications. It’s not something most people will ever
really use or need, but if you’re the kind of person who does need it –
it’ll become indispensable.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-prefer-rst-to-markdown">“Why I prefer rST to
Markdown”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is my second book written with Sphinx, after the new Learn TLA+.
Sphinx uses a peculiar markup called reStructured Text (rST), which has
a steeper learning curve than markdown. I only switched to it after
writing a couple of books in markdown and deciding I needed something
better. So I want to talk about why rst was that something. ↫ Hillel
Wayne I’ve never liked Markdown – I find it quite arbitrary and
unpleasant to look at, and the fact there’s countless variants that all
differ a tiny bit doesn’t help – so even though I don’t actually use
Markdown for anything, I always have a passing interest in possible
alternatives, if only to see what other, different, and unique ideas are
out there when it comes to relatively simple markup languages. Now, I’m
quite sure reStructured Text isn’t for me either, since I feel like it’s
far more powerful than Markdown, and serves a different, more complex
purpose. That being said, I figured I’d highlight it here since it seems
it may be interesting to some of you who work on documentation for your
software projects or similar endeavours.</p>

<h1 id="2024-08-01-where-to-look-online-for-rpg-conversation">
2024-08-01 Where to look online for RPG conversation?
</h1>
<p>
This is a reaction to a post by the same title on the
<a href="https://grumpywizard.home.blog/2024/08/01/where-to-look-online-for-rpg-conversation/">Grumpy
Wizard</a> blog. I know where I get my conversation in any case. But all
the points the Grumpy Wizard makes need to be considered. I don’t care
about D&amp;D and Pathfinder. I don’t even care for the old editions. If
at all, I care about the problems you ran into and your solutions at the
table: techniques, procedures, house rules.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t care for product announcements or read-through reviews. I
also don’t care about the details of session reports. I care about the
in-between: what have you used or made for use at the table, what can
you say about it, did it work, what would do differently.
</p>
<p>
Given these peculiarities, I find my conversation on Discord – on small
servers with a dozen active people, no more, and we mostly care about
the games we play with each other; or on the fediverse with an account
that follows a lot of people from tabletop.social and dice.camp (or
rollenspiel.social and pnpde.social, if you speak German). These sites
are all a bit like early Twitter except you can follow people on
compatible servers, too.
</p>
<p>
There are similar sites that are bit a like Reddit, but you can also
follow people on other servers – but I was never very active on Reddit
and so they don’t appeal much to me.
</p>
<p>
I guess if I were to look for forums, I’d go back to old haunts: EN
World, ODD74, or whatever flavour you preferred back then.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when I post stuff that got started because of something I heard
or somebody I spoke to, I try to link to their social media profiles or
blogs so that you can check them out and maybe follow them, too.
</p>
<p>
I sometimes wish there was more conversation to be found on IRC and
Usenet. But that basically requires people love both role-playing games
and old tech. It’s rare.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s what the Grumpy Wizard also said: So many thi gs have
been discussed for so long, I just don’t care about the conversation
anymore. Ascending or descending armour class? 6 mile hex? I no longer
care.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’m still into blogs. 😄

<h2 id="serpent-os-prealpha0-released">Serpent OS prealpha0
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Serpent OS, a new Linux distribution with a completely custom package
management system written in Rust, has released its very very rough
pre-alpha release. They’ve been working on this for four years, and
they’re making some interesting choices regarding packaging that I
really like, at least on paper. This will of course appear to be a very
rough (crap) prealpha ISO. Underneath the surface it is using the moss
package manager, our very own package management solution written in
Rust. Quite simply, every single transaction in moss generates a new
filesystem tree (/usr) in a staging area as a full, stateless, OS
transaction. When the package installs succeed, any transaction triggers
are run in a private namespace (container) before finally activating the
new /usr tree. Through our enforced stateless design, usr-merge, etc, we
can atomically update the running OS with a single renameat2 call. As a
neat aside, all OS content is deduplicated, meaning your last system
transaction is still available on disk allowing offline rollbacks. ↫
Ikey Doherty Since this is only a very rough pre-alpha release, I don’t
have much more to say at this point, but I do think it’s interesting
enough to let y’all know about it. Even if you’re not the kind of person
to dive into pre-alphas, I think you should keep an eye on Serpent OS,
because I have a feeling they’re on to something valuable here.</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-ai-on-computer-science-education">The impact of AI
on computer science education</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yesterday I highlighted a study that found that AI and ML, and the
expectations around them, are actually causing people to need to work
harder and more, instead of less. Today, I have another study for you,
this time focusing a more long-term issue: when you use something like
ChatGPT to troubleshoot and fix a bug, are you actually learning
anything? A professor at MIT divided a group of students into three, and
gave them a programming task in a language they did not know (FORTRAN).
One group was allowed to use ChatGPT to solve the problem, the second
group was told to use Meta’s Code Llama large language model (LLM), and
the third group could only use Google. The group that used ChatGPT,
predictably, solved the problem quickest, while it took the second group
longer to solve it. It took the group using Google even longer, because
they had to break the task down into components. Then, the students were
tested on how they solved the problem from memory, and the tables
turned. The ChatGPT group “remembered nothing, and they all failed,”
recalled Klopfer, a professor and director of the MIT Scheller Teacher
Education Program and The Education Arcade. Meanwhile, half of the Code
Llama group passed the test. The group that used Google? Every student
passed. ↫ Esther Shein at ACM I find this an interesting result, but at
the same time, not a very surprising one. It reminds me a lot of that
when I went to high school, I was part of the first generation whose
math and algebra courses were built around using a graphic calculator.
Despite being able to solve and graph complex equations with ease thanks
to our TI-83, we were, of course, still told to include our “work”, the
steps taken to get from the question to the answer, instead of only
writing down the answer itself. Since I was quite good “at computers”,
and even managed to do some very limited programming on the TI-83, it
was an absolute breeze for me to hit some buttons and get the right
answers – but since I knew, and know, absolutely nothing about math, I
couldn’t for the life of me explain how I got to the answers. Using
ChatGPT to fix your programming problem feels like a very similar thing.
Sure, ChatGPT can spit out a workable solution for you, but since you
aren’t aware of the steps between problem and solution, you aren’t
actually learning anything. By using ChatGPT, you’re not actually
learning how to program or how to improve your skills – you’re just
hitting the right buttons on a graphing calculator and writing down
what’s on the screen, without understanding why or how. I can totally
see how using ChatGPT for boring boilerplate code you’ve written a
million times over, or to point you in the right direction while still
coming up with your own solution to a problem, can be a good and helpful
thing. I’m just worried about a degradation in skill level and code
quality, and how society will, at some point, pay the price for
that.</p>

I should’ve known I’d be in for a wild conversation when Viv burst into
my room all like, “Did you hear what Canada is doing to the polar
bears?!?”
</p>
<p>
Apparently (I have not seen whatever he saw), some town in Canada is
trying to deter polar bears from entering the town by capturing them,
depriving them of food and subjecting them to “shock therapy” for two
months, before releasing them back into the wild? Like, what kind of
scheme is this. “Oh no no, we can’t <em>kill</em> the polar bears, so
we’re just going to lock them up for two months and torture them, before
dropping them off right back where there’s still no food.” And Viv is
raging, insisting that the mining companies should be required to
deposit truckloads of seals in the area where the polar bears are so
they have something to eat, and I’m like… I don’t think that’s the crux
of the issue here. Anyway, idk, it made me laugh (even though it sucks
for the polar bears). Very Canadian things.

<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events,
and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary
non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists
are taking with the system of government of the United States.
</p>
<p>
In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is
to be very mild about it “weird.” What word would you prefer the
Democrats use? Imagine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William
Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote
that column. (Safire was a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a>
btw.)
</p>
<p>
And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term.
This is where you get to speak out about what they’re doing over there,
and how it’s not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump
on.

who aren’t scared of tech stuff.

<p>People who get their sense of self-esteem from having procreated are
placing a heavy burden on their children. What if the child doesn’t live
up to their expectations? How will they treat the child then! Creating a
new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full
person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that’s</i> an
accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a
functioning reproductive system. It’s not anything to be proud or to
expect to be rewarded or respected for.</p>

<h2 id="ai-causing-burnout-lower-productivity">AI causing burnout, lower
productivity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Is machine learning, also known as “artificial intelligence”, really
aiding workers and increasing productivity? A study by Upwork – which,
as Baldur Bjarnason so helpfully points out, sells AI solutions and
hence did not promote this study on its blog as it does with its other
studies – reveals that this might not actually be the case. Nearly half
(47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the
productivity gains their employers expect. Over three in four (77%) say
AI tools have decreased their productivity and added to their workload
in at least one way. For example, survey respondents reported that
they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content
(39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now
being asked to do more work (21%). Forty percent of employees feel their
company is asking too much of them when it comes to AI. ↫ Upwork
research This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We’re in a massive hype
cycle when it comes to machine learning, and we’re being told it’s going
to revolutionise work and lead to massive productivity gains. In
practice, however, it seems these tools just can’t measure up to the
hyped promises, and in fact is making people do less and work slower.
There’s countless stories of managers being told by upper management to
shove machine learning into everything, from products to employee
workflows, whether it makes any sense to do so or not. I know from
experience as a translator that machine learning can greatly improve my
productivity, but the fact that there are certain types of tasks that
benefit from ML, doesn’t mean every job suddenly thrives with it. I’m
definitely starting to see some cracks in the hype cycle, and this study
highlights a major one. I hope we can all come down to earth again, and
really take a careful look at where ML makes sense and where it does
not, instead of giving every worker a ChatGPT account and blanket
demanding massive productivity gains that in no way match the reality on
the office floor. And of course, despite demanding massive productivity
increases, it’s not like workers are getting an equivalent increase in
salary. We’ve seen massive productivity increases for decades now, while
paychecks have not followed suit at all, and many people can actually
buy less with their salary today than their parents could decades ago.
Demands imposed by managers by introducing AI is only going to make this
discrepancy even worse.</p>

id="logitech-has-an-idea-for-a-forever-mouse-that-requires-a-subscription">Logitech
has an idea for a “forever mouse” that requires a subscription</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber talked about someting called the “forever
mouse”, which would be, as the name implies, a mouse that customers
could use for a very long time. While you may think this would mean an
incredibly well-built mouse, or one that can be easily repaired, which
Logitech already makes somewhat possible through a partnership with
iFixIt, another option the company is thinking about is a subscription
model. Yes. Faber said subscription software updates would mean that
people wouldn’t need to worry about their mouse. The business model is
similar to what Logitech already does with video conferencing services
(Logitech’s B2B business includes Logitech Select, a subscription
service offering things like apps, 24/7 support, and advanced RMA).
Having to pay a regular fee for full use of a peripheral could deter
customers, though. HP is trying a similar idea with rentable printers
that require a monthly fee. The printers differ from the idea of the
forever mouse in that the HP hardware belongs to HP, not the user.
However, concerns around tracking and the addition of ongoing expenses
are similar. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica Now, buying a mouse whose
terrible software requires subscription models would still be a choice
you can avoid, but my main immediately conjured up a far darker
scenario. PC makers have a long history of adding crapware to their
machines in return for payments from the producers of said crapware. I
can totally see what’s going to happen next. You buy a brand new laptop,
unbox it at home, and turn it on. Before you know it, a dialog pops up
right after he crappy Windows out-of-box experience asking you to
subscribe to your laptop’s touchpad software in order to unlock its more
advanced features like gestures. But why stop there? The keyboard of
that new laptop has RGB backlighting, but if you want to change its
settings, you’re going to have to pay for another subscription. Your
laptop’s display has additional features and modes for specific types of
content and more settings sliders, but you’ll have to pay up to unlock
them. And so on. I’m not saying this will happen, but I’m also not
saying it won’t. I’m sorry for birthing this idea into the world.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>As an experiment, I’ve reduced my coffee-intake to a single cup a day
for about a week now. It’s made an enormous difference in sleep, mood
and energy. I get tired at night, fall asleep quickly, and wake up
refreshed. As mentioned previously in the context of morning sunlight
exposure—another thing that’s aided my sleeping habits, but is somewhat
less practical to sustain as it requires fair weather—I’ve always been
slow to get going in the morning, active at night, bad at getting to bed
at sane hours.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.9">pg_ivm
1.9</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.8 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add support for PostgreSQL 17 (Yugo Nagata, Takuma Hoshiai, reshke)
</p>
<p>
This contains the following changes:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Change functions to use a safe search_path during maintenance operations
when used with PostgreSQL 17
</p>
<p>
This prevents maintenance operations (automatic maintenance of IMMVs and
refresh_immv) from performing unsafe access. Functions used by IMMVs
that need to reference non-default schemas must specify a search path
during function creation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
refresh_immv can be executed by users with the MAINTAIN privilege when
used with PostgreSQL 17
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

<h2 id="childless-vs-childful">Childless vs childful</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Notes accumulated during the day – not in any particular order. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the
hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn’t have such a solid
line, and found that I couldn’t have a personal life if I made it
public. But now I want to reveal something. I am “childless” which is a
term I find pretty insulting, as if being child<i>ful</i> is the only
normal state of being.
</p>
<p>
I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family
members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If
childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say –
bring it on. We should have this discussion.
</p>
<p>
I’m often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won’t offer it
unless asked, except this. If you have children, there’s a good chance
one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the
same, and provide models of acceptance while they’re growing up, by
bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is
one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won’t
love them any less if they go down that path. And here’s the hard part,
imho, for people with children – <i>keep that promise. </i>
</p>
<p>
BTW, people say it’s seflish to not have children, but I don’t agree, in
fact I think it’s the opposite. There was a point in human evolution
where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation,
but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where
increasing human population worked against species survival. Our
understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our
civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality.

Since boosting my Pi 5 from the default 2.4 GHz clock to
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-5-can-overclock-314-ghz">3.14

users have topped my Geekbench scores since then :)

<p>
In March, Raspberry Pi introduced new firmware that unlocked frequencies
above 3,000 MHz for overclocking. This summer,

The problem seemed to be power supply—the Pi’s firmware limits the SoC

as translators, interpreters, and intelligence officers, while their

C. McNaughton’s book about them is available as a PDF here.</p>

communities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Kev has written about the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com/blog/politics-and-communities&quot;&gt;politics and communities&lt;/a&gt; on his blog and it was related to his recently announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com/blog/introducing-500-social&quot;&gt;500.social&lt;/a&gt; project. In his post, he mentioned blog posts written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://baty.net&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nice-marmot.net&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in the full discussion go read the various blog posts, they’re all relatively short.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not interested in commenting on the opinions expressed in those blog
posts but I am interested in the source of the discussion, and that was
a bullet list item in the 500.social
<a href="https://about.500.social/#expectations">“Member expectations”
section</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Posts about politics and religion should be avoided, if you strongly
feel the urge to post about these topics, please put them behind a
Content Warning Member expectations
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Years ago, during the COVID era, the 37signals company got into hot
water online because they announced in an internal communication that
they were going to ban “societal and political discussions” on their
internal work chat.
<a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">The
announcement is online</a> if you’re interested in reading it.
</p>
<p>
People online reacted in all sorts of ways to that news and many, many
opinion pieces got published. I remember talking about it with a few
people privately and had some interesting conversations around that
topic. As you can see, years later, positions on topics such as politics
and religion are still controversial in the context of online spaces.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think the issue is not with politics, religion or any
other topic. The problem is a mixture of expectations and the tools we
use. In his post, Dave wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If there is a “public square” anymore, where we ought to be able to try
to hash those things out, it seems to me that it’s in those “small
social networks,” unless they’re intended to be bespoke bubbles where
it’s all just happy talk and we never have difficult conversations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don’t disagree that small communities are the space where those
conversations can happen which is why I think no topic should be banned
or be off limits. At the same time though, I do think that having
conversations means something very different than posting a reactionary
tweet to comment on a piece of news. That’s why people like Kev end up
with rules against politics and religion. Because if you dig deeper,
people don’t want to have a conversation on social media. They want to
vent.
</p>
<p>
I think social media platforms, like Mastodon, are not designed to have
conversations. You can have them on there, sure, but the experience is
going to be sub-par. Social media is designed to be reactionary and
generating reactions is different than having a conversation. What would
Mastodon look like if everyone was forced to post at least 500 words?
What would Mastodon look like if you could only post once an hour? The
reason why some people, like Kev, end up with rules like that is because
social media is an imperfect tool. I don’t have a no politics rule
attached to my email address. People can write to me and talk about
whatever they want. If they write about something I don’t care about I
can simply ignore that topic and don’t engage in conversation which is
exactly what happens in real life.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What prompted me to consider joining 500.social was recalling the
feeling I had when we learned that Biden had dropped out of the race.
That’s the sort of event that evokes an immediate, emotional response
because of its significance to a broad range of people, presumably my
“community.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the perfect example of why I think social media is a flawed
tool. Can you imagine doing the same in the phone era? Can you imagine
reading a piece of news and start calling hundreds, potentially
thousands of people simply to share what you think about some news? And
can you imagine doing that with people who don’t even live in your
country and couldn’t care less about that specific news? Now can you
imagine if everyone was doing the same for the news that evoked a strong
reaction to them? You’d quickly put your phone on airplane mode because
there are only so many random opinions on news you can bear to listen
to. I can have a 3 hours discussion about politics, I can’t listen 3
hours of soundbites.
</p>
<p>
The problem with social media and politics is that way too many people
are interested in sharing what they think on social media but very few
are interested in having actual, real discussions. Because blasting out
a tweet takes 10 seconds while having an actual conversation might take
hours and span days.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to know what you think about this whole situation though. Do
you think some topics should be banned on social platforms? If you have
opinions get in touch or even better write a blog post!

<h2 id="microsofts-crowdstrike-post-mortem">Microsoft’s CrowdStrike
post-mortem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has published a post-mortem of the CrowdStrike incident,
and goes into great depths to describe where, exactly, the error lies,
and how it could lead to such massive problems. I can’t comment anything
insightful on the technical details and code they show to illustrate all
of this – I’ll leave that discussion up to you – but Microsoft also
spends considerable amount of time explaining why security vendors are
choosing to use kernel-mode drivers. Microsoft lists three major reasons
why security vendors opt for using kernel modules, and none of them will
come as a great surprise to OSNews readers: kernel drivers provide more
visibility into the system than a userspace tool would, there are
performance benefits, and they’re more resistant to tampering. The
downsides are legion, too, of course, as any crash or similar issue in
kernel mode has far-reaching consequences. The goal, then, according to
Microsoft, is to balance the need for greater insight, performance, and
tamper resistance with stability. And while the company doesn’t say it
directly, this is clearly where CrowdStrike failed – and failed hard.
While you would want a security tool like CrowdStrike to perform as
little as possible in kernelspace, and conversely as much as possible in
userspace, that’s not what CrowdStrike did. They are running a lot of
stuff in kernelspace that really shouldn’t be there, such as the update
mechanism and related tools. In total, CrowdStrike loads four kernel
drivers, and much of their functionality can be run in userspace
instead. It is possible today for security tools to balance security and
reliability. For example, security vendors can use minimal sensors that
run in kernel mode for data collection and enforcement limiting exposure
to availability issues. The remainder of the key product functionality
includes managing updates, parsing content, and other operations can
occur isolated within user mode where recoverability is possible. This
demonstrates the best practice of minimizing kernel usage while still
maintaining a robust security posture and strong visibility. Windows
provides several user mode protection approaches for anti-tampering,
like Virtualization-based security (VBS) Enclaves and Protected
Processes that vendors can use to protect their key security processes.
Windows also provides ETW events and user-mode interfaces like
Antimalware Scan Interface for event visibility. These robust mechanisms
can be used to reduce the amount of kernel code needed to create a
security solution, which balances security and robustness. ↫ David
Weston, Vice President, Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft In what
is surely an unprecedented event, I agree with the CrowdStrike criticism
bubbling under the surface of this post-mortem by Microsoft. Everything
seems to point towards CrowdStrike stuffing way more things in
kernelspace than is needed, and as such creating a far larger surface
for things to go catastrophically wrong than needed. While Microsoft
obviously isn’t going to openly and publicly throw CrowdStrike under the
bus, it’s very clear what they’re hinting at here, and this is about as
close to a public flogging we’re going to get. Microsoft’s post-portem
further details a ton of work Microsoft has recently done, is doing, and
will soon be doing to further strenghthen Windows’ security, to lessen
the need for kernelspace security drivers even more, including adding
support for Rust to the Windows kernel, which should also aid in
mitigating some common problems present in other, older programming
languages (while not being a silver bullet either, of course).</p>

2024-07-27 Tired of programming
</h1>
<p>
My summer break has begun, and I am tired.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on some sort of editor. I contributed some lines to
Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to
text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much
effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again… I’m experimenting with using
<code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it’s not so bad if you’re
just writing, like writing an email. But really writing, organizing,
moving things around… it really doesn’t work all that well. I had
imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is
your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu
site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of
editor would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point. Then I
dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain. Then I
started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz,
Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per
language), and on and on. It’s too much.
</p>
<p>
But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed? Am I in fact
reinventing vi, badly?
</p>

<p>
I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a
Javascript web application in production. This is a single file, a
stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a
native application that would work without a browser.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or
Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding. Vanilla JS and the
browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for
this Common Lisp app I’m looking at really makes me want to drop it all
for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead. It can’t be that
bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for
free…
</p>
<p>
And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various
states of neglect is draining. Switching from one to the other is tricky
since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other
is lacking. But the first one is lacking a gfx port. Then again, I guess
I can add circle drawing using lines.
</p>
<p>
Everything takes so long. So damn long.

<p>
A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on
browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks
were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was
Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep
<a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It’s great.
</p>
<p>
I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and
when new items get added, a feed is updated. Just a little program… it
doesn’t seem hard. So I gave it try. I like documentation first, these
days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that
perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses. So I needed
to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be? It’s a bit harder than
writing it in Perl. Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too. Or use
SQLite to store data. It keeps getting harder.
</p>
<p>
Well, I spent some time on it and now I’m tired again. This too, takes
too long!
</p>
<p>
I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?
</p>
<p>
I should read a book.

<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I
decided to spice up my shell life…
</p>
<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>
<p>
I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to
set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and
contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you know of other such tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the
bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl:
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>.
🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" />
</p>
<p>
I installed a daily cron job:
</p>
<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>
<p>
The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files…
feed-file</code>. The files it looks at once a day are my
<a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>. The feed it generates is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>. The database it uses is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40
items for the feed.
</p>
<p>
When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the
Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted –
they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the
whole category, which pretty weird.

sea, the fighting, the departure by sea — that any account of the
campaign is bound by. This traversing of emptiness surrounding a tragic
agon.  I think it was Jakob Burckhardt, […]</p>

Microsoft’s tool to create BSoDs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Blue screens of death are not exactly in short supply on Windows
machines lately, but what if you really want to cause your own kernel
panic or complete system crash, just because you love that shade of
crashy blue? Well, there’s a tool for that called NotMyFault, developed
by Mark Russinovich as part of Sysinternals. NotMyFault is a tool that
you can use to crash, hang, and cause kernel memory leaks on your
Windows system. It’s useful for learning how to identify and diagnose
device driver and hardware problems, and you can also use it to generate
blue screen dump files on misbehaving systems. The download file
includes 32-bit and 64-bit versions, as well as a command-line version
that works on Nano Server. Chapter 7 in Windows Internals uses
NotMyFault to demonstrate pool leak troubleshooting and Chapter 14 uses
it for crash analysis examples. ↫ Mark Russinovich Using this tool, you
can select exactly what kind of crash you want to cause, and after
clicking the Crash button, your Windows computer will do exactly as it’s
told and crash with a lovely blue screen of death. It comes in both a
GUI and CLI version, and the latter also works on minimal Windows
installations that don’t have the Windows shell installed. A tool like
this may seem odd, but it can be particularly useful in situations where
you’re trying to troubleshoot an issue, and to learn how to properly
diagnose crashes. Or, you know, you can use it to create a panic at your
workplace.</p>

id="managarm-microkernel-based-os-with-fully-asynchronous-io">Managarm:
microkernel-based OS with fully asynchronous I/O</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ah, another microkernel-based hobby operating system. The more, the
merrier – and I mean this, without a hint of sarcasm. There’s definitely
been a small resurgence in activity lately when it comes to small hobby
and teaching operating systems, some of which are exploring some truly
new ideas, and I’m definitely here for it. Today we have managarm. Some
notable properties of managarm are: (i) managarm is based on a
microkernel while common Desktop operating systems like Linux and
Windows use monolithic kernels, (ii) managarm uses a completely
asynchronous API for I/O and (iii) despite those internal differences,
managarm provides good compatibility with Linux at the user space level.
↫ managarm GitHub page It’s a 64bit operating system with SMP support,
an ACPI implementation, networking, USB3 support, and, as the quoted
blurb details, a lot of support for Linux and POSIX. It can already run
Weston, kmscon, and other things like Bash, the GNU Coreutils, and more.
While not explicitly mentioned, I assume the best platform to run
managarm on are most likely virtualisation tools, and there’s a detailed
handbook to help you along during building and using this new operating
system.</p>

Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from
my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it
isn’t even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing
tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything
like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can’t even reach
it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I
absolutely can’t do this on my own. No time, patience, and it’s not my
job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be
spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This
is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source
thing.</p>
