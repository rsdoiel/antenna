id="fedora-intends-to-fully-embrace-ai-but-doesnt-address-sourcing-or-its-environmental-impact">Fedora
intends to fully embrace “AI”, but doesn’t address sourcing or its
environmental impact</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>All weekend, I’ve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora
Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of
the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of
choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for
desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog
post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of “AI”
was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states – correctly –
that the “AI” space as it stands right now is dominated so much by
hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it’s hard to judge the various
technologies underpinning “AI” on merit alone. He continues that he
believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit,
there’s “something significant, powerful”, and he wants to make “Fedora
Linux the best community platform for AI”. So, what exactly does that
look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and
code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored
tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for
accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open
source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now,
what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and
flexibility of AI-generated speech. ↫ Matthew Miller Some of these are
things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the
Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as “AI” to
improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for
accessibility reasons, that’s universally a great thing. Translation,
too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve
machine translations so that people who, for instance, don’t speak
English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast
libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more
people, that’s all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of
“AI” even further, and wants to start using it in the process of
developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more
red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don’t feel like the
processes and tasks they want to inject “AI” into are the kinds of
processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We
can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could
help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies
in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security
issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users.
For example, package update descriptions aren’t usually very meaningful.
We could automatically generate concise summaries of what’s new in each
system update — not just for each package, but highlighting what’s
important in the whole set, including upstream change information as
well. ↫ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions
of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and
similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they’re supposed to do,
and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple
questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce
nonsense, they’re racist, and so on. I don’t want any of that garbage
near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on
every day. Miller laments how “AI” is currently a closed-source, black
box affair, which obviously doesn’t align with Fedora’s values and
goals. He doesn’t actually explain how Fedora’s use of “AI” is going to
address this. They’re going to have to find ethical, open source models
that are also of high quality, and that’s a lot easier said than done.
Sourcing doesn’t even get a single mention in this blog post, even
though I’m fairly sure that’s one of the two major issues many of us
have with the current crop of “AI” tools. The blog post also completely
neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these “AI” tools.
It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and
with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our
environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when
you’re leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and
malicious at worst. While using “AI” to improve accessibility tools in
Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended
targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that
the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with
“AI”: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to
fully embrace “AI”, it’s going to have to address these two problems
first, because otherwise they’re just trying to latch onto the hype
without really understanding the cost. And that’s not something I want
to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.</p>

id="frameworks-software-and-firmware-have-been-a-mess-but-its-working-on-them">Framework’s
software and firmware have been a mess, but it’s working on them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix
and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the
line when it’s been replaced by something newer. But supporting that
kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term
software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been
falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it
wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice of the PC
industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall,
we’ll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ↫ Andrew
Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I’m disappointed to
learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre –
or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security
vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at
risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster
Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially
since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article
has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework – not that I
have the money for a new laptop, because reasons – and I feel more
people will feel this way after reading this.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and
since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have
been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky
group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here’s a first look
at Radxa’s latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It’s
going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it’s a
very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking
very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as
expected, they’re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you
probably don’t want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in
your new system, right? ↫ Bret Weber Now this – this, my friends, is
exactly what the doctor ordered. I can’t wait for standard, ATX
motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily
available, hopefully standardised better than what we’re used to from
the ARM world. I want my next (non-gaming) machines to be ARM-powered,
and that means we’re going to need more of these ATX ARM boards,
spanning wider performance levels.</p>

<h2 id="apples-mysterious-fisheye-projection">Apple’s mysterious fisheye
projection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you’ve read my first post about Spatial Video, the second
about Encoding Spatial Video, or if you’ve used my command-line tool,
you may recall a mention of Apple’s mysterious “fisheye” projection
format. Mysterious because they’ve documented
a CMProjectionType.fisheye enumeration with no elaboration, they stream
their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they’ve provided no
method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection
type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven’t responded
to an open question on the Apple Discussion Forums asking for more
detail, and they didn’t cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone
who has experience in this area – and a relentless curiosity – I’ve
spent time digging-in to Apple’s fisheye projection format, and this
post shares what I’ve learned. ↫ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool
technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to,
apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems
to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most
ardent Apple supporterts – like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP – have
stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just
months after launch.</p>

How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to
a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer
blog</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.
</li>
<li>
You can specify that all the feeds you’re subscribed to are in your
blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in
the blogroll.
</li>
<li>
The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new
post, it goes to the top of the list.
</li>
<li>
You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the
pubdate to go to the full item on the web.
</li>
<li>
It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the
list, Return to expand/collapse.
</li>
<li>
We’re working on WordPress plugin.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
blogrollUsername – required
</li>
<li>
blogrollServer – optional, if not specified it’s feedland.com
</li>
<li>
blogrollCategory – optional
</li>
<li>
blogrollTitle – optional, but you really should provide a title,
otherwise we invent a silly one for you. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</li>
</ul>

A
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/303">place</a>
to ask questions offer kudos, etc. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
PS: I’m not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I
needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up
and document the WordPress plugin.

external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC,
I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously
I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even
though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re
still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But
if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far
better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s
Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a
compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If
you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you’re looking for an external drive
– this is some good advice to follow.</p>

occurred to me watching a Martin Scorcese
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison:_Living_in_the_Material_World">documentary</a>
about the life of George Harrison, how much people in music seek out
opportunities to create with other musicians. In technology, it doesn’t
happen, we don’t even look at each others software. After waiting a
whole lifetime for a culture of collaboration, we have had it for short
periods, but it’s most of the time it’s been people trying to
deconstruct and reinvent other people’s work, not build on it. I’m still
open to this changing. I hope to be a catalyst for it, one more

don’t like how betting has invaded sports broadcasting. I don’t like
that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole
lives, as I have with the Knicks and the Mets. I think of people who
love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don’t) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won’t be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can’t win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they’re feeding an addiction.</p>

like an older Tadzio from Death in Venice, clad in striped
concentration-camp pyjamas, conscious of his beauty. He answered my
question with a question. ‘You’ve heard of liposuction?’</p>

Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the

6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization
primitives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Going through my usual scanning of all the “-next” Git subsystem
branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel
merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up… Linux 6.10 is
set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT
synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better
performance with Valve’s Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games
and other apps on Linux. ↫ Michael Larabel The improvements to
performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are
legitimately insane. We’re looking at a game-changing addition to the
Linux kernel here, and it’s no surprise, then, to see this effort being
spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Kate, KDE’s programming-focused text editor, is, of course, a Qt
application, and is also available on a variety of other platforms.
Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short
blog post with screenshots of Kate running on the three biggest
platforms – Linux/BSD, Windows, and macOS. Sadly, while Haiku gets a
mention, there’s no screenshot of the Haiku version of Kate. Still, it’s
interesting to see the family resemblance.</p>
