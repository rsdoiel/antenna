I think I have mentioned it before but I absolutely love her site
because it’s precisely everything mine isn’t. My site is this super
clean, super calm place, with no JS, no weirdness going on, and almost
no images. Her site is a proper experience and you’ll understand what I
mean when you click that link. And even though the containers are
incredibly different we share an appreciation for a certain type of
living the web which is why I’m very grateful to have her as a guest on
this series.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I was born and raised in the southern United States. I think I got a
reasonably decent public education in an era just before the education
system, both higher and lower, started becoming extremist
indoctrination. You’ll find countless Gen Xers online these days
reminiscing about the things we used to do as kids. There’s not much I
can add to that as far as everyday life goes.
</p>
<p>
I became an avid fan of science fiction at an early age, and developed a
fascination with history, science, electronics, and computers. The two
latter were the same hobby back then, actually. You had to understand
electronics to mess around with computers.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
The funny thing is that I don’t really call my website a “blog” or
consider myself to be a “blogger” per se. I didn’t really have a plan or
goal for what I wanted to do with my personal website when I started it.
I only knew that the social media paradigm wasn’t working for me, and I
needed to do something else.
</p>
<p>
My stock in trade has long been shitposting on “free speech” forums and
social media. I have a habit of getting banned from social media sites
because the normies don’t get my sense of humor. I’m not interested in
making my opinions “advertiser-friendly,” nor in virtue-signaling to
censorious, self-righteous ideologues. It’s popular amongst the
simple-minded these days to label people as bigots on the basis of
colorful remarks. In so doing, the self-appointed thought police often
completely miss the point the writer was trying to make. As a feral Gen
Xer, I don’t have the patience to walk on eggshells around thin-skinned
people. If I can’t be honest and authentic, then why bother?
</p>
<p>
An essential aspect of my modus operandi is to always return to a “last
known good” state when current conditions aren’t yielding favorable
results. I’ve been on the World Wide Web since 1994, and have owned
personal websites before. I mean that’s what everybody did when the
Internet was first opened to the public. The ever-growing litany of
creative constraints imposed by social media over the years more or less
forced my return to the “real” Internet.
</p>
<p>
The name “Devastatia” was a nickname I made up for a cat I used to have.
Audrey and her big brother Elvis liked to tear things up, as cats do, so
I gave them the nicknames Dr. Destructo and his lovely assistant,
Devastatia. It had a gothy ring to it, and since I’m a goth, I thought
it’d make a catchy screen name.
</p>
<p>
I thought it would be funny to spoof social media “influencers” —
low-talent midwits with swollen egos — so I built a sort of role-playing
character around that idea. That’s how Devastatia was born.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
You’ve heard the expression, “The jokes write themselves,” right? Well,
the Internet is basically one big lolcow for those of us who can see the
humor in almost anything. Most of my social commentary and shitposting
is in response to things I see online.
</p>
<p>
Nearly everything I write is my own opinion and shouldn’t be taken as
fact. “Fact-checking” has acquired an unsavory connotation for me due to
the way it’s ham-handedly rammed down our throats, sans nuance or
context, by ideologues in the mainstream media and on social media. When
I do research something, it’s usually just a quick Web search in which I
choose a few links that have intriguing titles or summaries, not
necessarily the “most relevant” results as decided by the search
engines. Some of those links lead to fact-checking articles, but they’re
not typically the agenda-driven kind.
</p>
<p>
I re-read and edit the crap out of an article after I publish it,
usually for hours, and sometimes for days. I’m careful not to make
spelling or grammatical errors, but some occasionally slip through. I
catch most of them the same day by re-reading though. Most of my editing
is done to improve the flow of a passage, to add content I forgot to
include in the first draft, or to express something in a more
picturesque way. Sometimes I’ll come up with a relevant joke hours
later, and throw it in retroactively to liven the piece up.
</p>
<p>
I think the most glaring error I’ve made was a continuity error in one
of my erotic short stories. A reader brought it to my attention months
after the piece was published. A peripheral character, coincidentally
named Manuel, was identified as the brother of a main character in one
episode, but as his cousin in the following episode.
</p>
<p>
I write a lot about Web development because that’s what interests me. I
decorate my pages with irrelevant naughty pictures because I like
looking at them, and my readers tell me they do too. I aim to be nerdy,
funny, and sexy at the same time. I think I mostly succeed at that.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I just need for it to be reasonably quiet and dark. When I started
messing with computers, everything was green or amber text in a
fixed-width font on a black background — which, incidentally, is why my
website resembles an old school terminal. I use a dark mode browser
plugin on every site I visit. Staring at a page with a white background
is like staring into a flashlight. Why would anybody do such a thing?
</p>
<p>
I usually don’t notice my physical surroundings at all once I get into
the groove. I keep the temperature at around 77° Fahrenheit and wear as
few clothes as possible, so I don’t even feel the air, really.
</p>
<p>
I’m also blind in my right eye and nearsighted in the left, so I sit
pretty close to the monitor. Most of the items on my desk have dark
colors, so I don’t really notice anything in my peripheral vision when
there are no lights on nearby.
</p>
<p>
I use a 75% mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches, again because
that’s what I’m used to from the early days of home computing. I detest
touch screens and keyboards with short-travel switches.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My basic tools are <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, a coding
text editor for Linux similar to UltraEdit or Notepad++ for Windows;
FileZilla, an FTP client that’s ubiquitous on Windows, Mac, and Linux
PCs; and Firefox. If I happen to be in the terminal and need to take a
quick look at something, I’ll open it in vim. I haven’t used Github that
much since I left the corporate world. The tools I use now are the same
ones I used when I first started making personal websites years ago.
</p>
<p>
All of my sites are hosted on
<a href="https://siteground.com/">SiteGround</a>. Page loads are very
fast, their tech support is prompt and effective, and their “grow big”
plan gives me everything I need. I don’t remember where I registered my
domain name. It’s registered either through SiteGround or DreamHost.
</p>
<p>
I absolutely hate reading other people’s code. When I worked as a
professional developer, I became disenchanted with the emphasis on
integrating third-party software over writing custom code. I’m not an
integrator, and I’m definitely not a “coder.” I’m a programmer. That’s
what I got into this racket to do, and now that I have full creative
control, that’s what I do.
</p>
<p>
With the exception of a couple of PHP packages and some code snippets
borrowed from Stack Overflow and elsewhere, everything on my site is
hand-coded by me. I don’t use third-party frameworks or general-purpose
libraries period, let alone a third-party CMS. Everything is written
either specifically for its task or as a component that I can reuse for
multiple similar tasks.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I think the question presumes I have a purpose or goal in mind when I
start something, which isn’t necessarily the case. I’ll oftentimes start
working on something because I find the technology interesting, and the
use case will present itself later.
</p>
<p>
That said, my current website is showing its limitations, and I’m slowly
developing the next version. This is only my second single-page
application (SPA), and the first in which I got everything working as
expected. I’ve constantly added features over the past seven or eight
months, and it’s reached the point where it’d be easier to rewrite most
of it from scratch than to keep adding onto the existing platform.
</p>
<p>
I won’t change my domain name or the name of my site because it’s the
name I’m known by. One doesn’t change a trademark that has achieved
brand recognition without a good reason. Companies only do so when they
get a bad reputation due to scandal. Well, I’m not overly concerned
about my reputation. I mean I have a slutty online persona and write
naughty stories, both by choice. Those things are fun for me, and I
don’t believe that’ll ever change.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
It’d be difficult to separate the cost of running my personal site from
the cost of running my other sites because they’re all on a single
hosting plan. Moreover, the plan includes capabilities that aren’t
available with the typical “basic” plan because, as somebody who
compulsively tinkers with technology, I know I’ll use them. I also
prefer traditional .com, .net, or .org domain names when available,
which tend to cost a little more than some of the newer “personal
website” top-level domains.
</p>
<p>
I have three sites at the moment, and will probably build others. As of
now, simple division of the total cost by the number of sites yields an
average cost of about 156 USD per year. That’s about what I’d pay for
three domain names and individual hosting plans from the same company,
and the per-site cost will decrease as I add more sites.
</p>
<p>
I don’t try to monetize my site, nor make any effort to promote it in
the major search engines. This is a personal project that I work on for
the fun of it. The Personal Web as a community has plenty of grassroots
ways to help a website gain attention — webrings, listing sites, blog
carnivals, etc. — from those who are interested in personal websites.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have anything against other people monetizing their blogs if
they choose to do so, but it’s not for me. Again, this is all for fun
and “at will.” I don’t want to be held to other people’s expectations
regarding deadlines, messaging, or the type or quality of content I
produce.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
One of the most fascinating people I know on the Personal Web isn’t a
blogger at all. Magill, or
<a href="https://bohemiansultriness.nekoweb.org/">Fritzi</a> as she’s
known on the Personal Web, is a well-read 60s pop culture aficionado
who, in addition to making charming little brochure sites, publishes
<a href="https://theliverpudlianbardot.neocities.org/">erotic Beatles
fan fiction</a> on <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of Our
Own</a> (AO3). Fritzi isn’t a professional Web designer, but you’d never
guess it because she’s exceptionally talented.
</p>
<p>
And you’ll definitely want to interview
<a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/">Sara Jaksa</a>. Sara is a brilliant
woman whose correspondence I enjoy immensely. I’d love to hear from her
more frequently, but I understand that her work keeps her very busy.
What I like most about Sara is that she doesn’t give shallow answers,
but considers things deeply before forming an opinion. It’d be
interesting to read her answers to some of your questions.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a blurter. Anything I want to share will most likely appear on my
website the moment it wanders into my mind. I use my site the same way
I’d use Twitter if I weren’t banned from there. I’m always throwing
things at the wall to see what’ll stick.
</p>
<p>
As for projects, I’m working on a free RSS feed reader for personal
website feeds called <a href="https://www.geeklyreader.com/">The Geekly
Reader</a>. Commercial readers making money from blogs that the authors
themselves haven’t monetized just doesn’t sit well with me. In my view,
they’re the same as low-effort YouTubers whose videos are nothing but a
text-to-speech program reading a Reddit thread. The days of corporations
profiting from other people’s free content need to end.
</p>
<p>
When I heard that 123Guestbook is shutting down in July, I started a
project at <a href="https://personal-web.org/">Personal-Web.org</a> to
provide a replacement for static website owners who use 123Guestbook.
Depending on how much utilization that service gets, I may provide other
hosted widgets later.

I’m so sick of these frigid overnight lows we’ve been having every day.
Our whole flat drops down to about 10° overnight and stays there all day
except for the rooms we run heaters in. It’s so constraining, feeling
like only one room at a time is even hospitable to human life…

Not sure whether Gidget is also sick of the frigid temperatures, or
whether she’s relishing the opportunity to insist on hours and hours of
cuddles. Because she’s definitely been doing that. Hard to get housework
done or whatever when it’s <em>so</em> cold out there and I could sit
still, under covers, with a cat on my lap instead.

<h2 id="is-2024-the-year-of-windows-on-the-desktop">Is 2024 the year of
Windows on the desktop?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>It should be no secret to anyone reading OSNews that I’m not exactly
a fan of Windows. While I grew up using MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, and Windows
9x, the move to Windows XP was a sour one for me, and ever since I’ve
vastly preferred first BeOS, and then Linux. When, thanks to the
tireless efforts of the Wine community and Valve gaming on Linux became
a boring, it-just-works affair, I said goodbye to my final gaming-only
Windows installation about four or so years ago. However, I also
strongly believe that in order to be able to fairly criticise or dislike
something, you should at least have experience with it. As such, I
decided it was time for what I expected was going to be some serious
technology BDSM, and I installed Windows 11 on my workstation and force
myself to use it for a few weeks to see if Microsoft’s latest operating
system truly was as bad as I make it out to be in my head. Installing
Windows 11 Technically speaking, my workstation is not supported by
Windows 11. Despite packing two Intel Xeon E5 V4 2640 CPUs for a total
of 20 cores and 40 threads, 32 GB of ECC RAM, an AMD Radeon Pro w5700,
and the usual stuff like an M.2 SSD, this machine apparently did not
meet the minimum specifications for Windows 11 since it has no TPM 2.0
security chip, and the processors were deemed too old. Luckily, these
limitations are entirely artificial and meaningless, and using Ventoy,
which by default disables these silly restrictions, I was able to
install Windows 11 just fine. During installation, you run into the
first problem if you’re coming from a different operating system – even
after all these years, Windows still does not give a single hootin’ toot
about any existing operating systems or bootloaders on your machine.
This wasn’t an issue for me since I was going to allow Windows to take
over the entire machine, but for those of used to have control over what
happens when we install our operating systems, be advised that your
other operating systems will most likely be rendered unbootable. The
tools you have access to during installation for things like disk
partitioning are also incredibly limited, and there’s nothing like the
live environments you’re used to from the Linux world – all you get is
an installer. In addition, since Windows only really supports FAT and
NTFS file systems, your existing ext4, btrfs, UFS, or ZFS partitions
used by your Linux or BSD installs will not work at all in Windows.
Again – be advised that Windows is a very limited operating system
compared to Linux or BSD. Once the actual installation part is done,
you’re treated to a lengthy – and I truly mean lengthy – out of box
experience. This is where you first get a glimpse of just how much data
Microsoft wants to collect from its Windows users, and it stands in
stark contrast to what I’m used to as a Linux user. On my Linux
distribution of choice, Fedora KDE, there’s really only KDE’s opt-in,
voluntary User Feedback option, which only collects basic system
information in an entirely anonymous way. Windows, meanwhile, seems to
want to collect pretty much everything you do on your machine, and while
there’s some prompts to reduce the amount of data it collects, even with
everything set to minimum it’s still quite a lot. Once you’re past the
out of box experience, you can finally start using your new Windows
installation – but actually not really. Unlike a Linux distribution,
where all your hardware is detected automatically and will use the
latest drivers, on Windows, you will most likely have to do some manual
driver hunting, searching the web for PCI and vendor IDs to hopefully
locate the correct drivers, which isn’t always easy. To make matters
worse, even if Windows Update installs the correct drivers for you,
those are often outdated, and you’re better off downloading the latest
versions straight from the vendors’ websites. This is especially
problematic for motherboard drivers – motherboard vendor websites often
list horribly outdated drivers. Updating Windows 11 Once you have all
the drivers installed and updated, which often requires several reboots,
you might notice that your system seems to be awfully busy, even when
you’re not actually doing anything with it. Most likely, this means
Windows Update is running in the background, sucking up a lot of system
resources. If you’re used to Linux or BSD, where updating is a quick and
centralised process, updating things on Windows is a complete and utter
mess. Instead of just updating everything all at once, Windows Update
will often require several different rounds of updates, marked by
reboots. You’ll also discover that Windows Update is not only incredibly
slow both when it comes to downloading and installing, but that it’s
also incredibly buggy. Updates will randomly fail to install for no
apparent reason, and there’s a whole cottage industry of useless ML and
SEO content on the internet trying to “help” you fix these issues. On my
system, without doing anything, Windows Update managed to break itself
in less than 24 hours – it listed 79 (!) driver updates related to the
two Xeon processors (I assume it listed certain drivers for every single
of the 40 threads), but every single one of them, save for one or two,
would fail to install with a useless generic error code. Every time I
tried to install them, one or two more would install, with everything
else failing, until eventually the update process just hung the entire
system. A few days later, the listed updated just disappeared entirely
from Windows Update. The updates had no KB numbers, so it was impossible
to find any information on them, and to this day, I have no idea what
was going on here. Even after battling your way through Windows Update,
you’re not done actually updating your system. Unlike,</p>

<p>Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent
<a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a>? That’s the kind of
bullshit Google does. We don’t do that in the open formats and protocols
world. What really pains me is they claim to follow
<a href="https://this.how/standards/">my</a> Rules for Standards-makers.
Imho they do not. Two rules apply.
<a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000">Rule #1</a> says the
only reason we do this is interop. It’s called Rule #1 for a reason. And
the <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way</a> rule
a little further down the page. I’ve seen this happen twice where people
say they abide by the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">RFSM</a> but
then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this
better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the
name you’ve chosen. We’ve been down this path. The only way it ends is
in

<p>Now that I’m publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in
commercial podcast clients, I’m learning for the first time how they
work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they
discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So
when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that
would have worked if I hadn’t made a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601">mistake</a> in
GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up
first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This
so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say “Hey readers
dump your cache now, let’s start over, because I fcuked up.” It wouldn’t
have mattered anyway, I’m sure none of them would listen, right?</p>

I’ve got something for you. Lately I’ve been getting a lot of joy from
life’s small moments; like texting an old friend, seeing a cool bug, or
a watching the cardinals zip through my backyard. To nudge my brain
towards absorbing more of these mundane pleasures, I built a little
game.
</p>
<p>
Mundango is a game about finding life’s normal things. Each day you get
a new game of moments to capture and enjoy. It’s up to you how you play.
You can play it like Pokémon Go and try to catch ’em all or you can
visit the board at the end of the day for a bit of reflection. Me? I
plunk on it when I’ve got a few spare minutes throughout the day.

I’ve got a couple feature requests on deck but it’s at a point where I’d
love more feedback.

activities were crowdsourced on Mastodon</a> so if you have some more
suggestions of small simple moments that bring you joy, I’d love to hear
them. Or if you have general ideas about what would this more

I started to write the code to hook up my linkblogger to Threads, but it
led me to the same website with all my broken Facebook apps, the ones
that stopped working when they shut down the API after the 2016
election. A reminder that this is still Facebook. And while I don’t
blame them for shutting down the APIs, the whole experience left a
really bad feeling.

<p>
So I backed out of the project to give it some more thought. Do I really
want to go down this road?

A cute little kitten is sitting at a desk with a laptop, preparing to
write an app. The laptop screen shows code for the Threads API from
Meta. The kitten has a surprised and concerned expression as she looks
at the developer site on another screen, which shows a Facebook logo and
reminds her of the events of 2016. In the background, a calendar shows
the year 2024. The scene is set in a cozy room with soft lighting and a
few toys scattered around, giving it a homely feel.

So I think my Plex Media Server is basically kaput. The computer got
unplugged somehow, and when I tried rebooting it, the unattended
upgrades have broken the Linux install to the point that not even
“recovery mode” works any more. I thought Linux Mint was supposed to be
kind of idiot-proof but clearly not, lol. Next time I think I’ll try
Debian Stable… because clearly what I need is something
<strong>stable</strong>! Geez.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I cancelled my Spotify subscription a few months ago so I guess
I’m resorting to YouTube Music now. The experience of using this instead
of Plexamp will surely boot my arse into gear to re-setup the Plex
server sooner rather than later 😐

<h2 id="the-exectos-operating-system">The ExectOS operating system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>ExectOS is a preemptive, reentrant multitasking operating system that
implements the XT architecture which derives from NT architecture. It is
modular, and consists of two main layers: microkernel and user modes.
Its’ kernel mode has full access to the hardware and system resources
and runs code in a protected memory area. It consists of executive
services, which is itself made up on many modules that do specific
tasks, a kernel and drivers. Unlike the NT, system does not feature a
separate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) between the physical hardware
and the rest of the OS. Instead, XT architecture integrates a hardware
specific code with the kernel. The user mode is made up of subsystems
and it has been designed to run applications written for many different
types of operating systems. This allows us to implement any environment
subsystem to support applications that are strictly written to the
corresponding standard (eg. DOS, or POSIX). Thanks to that ExectOS will
allow to run existing software, including Win32 applications. ↫ ExectOS
website What ExectOS seems to be is an implementation very close to what
Windows NT originally was – implementing the theory of Windows NT, not
the reality. It’s clearly still in very early development, but in
theory, I really like the idea of what they’re trying to achieve here.
Windows NT is, after all, in and of itself not a bad concept – it’s just
been tarred and feathered by decades of mismanagement from Microsoft.
Implementing something that closely resembles the original, minimalist
theories behind NT could lead to an interesting operating system for
sure. ExectOS is open source, contains its own boot loader, only runs on
EFI, and installation on real hardware, while technically possible, is
discouraged.</p>

<h2 id="the-x-windowing-system-turns-40-today">The X Windowing System
turns 40 today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today just so happens to be the 40th birthday of X, the venerable
windowing system that’s on its way out, at least in the Linux world.
From the original announcement by Robert W. Scheifler: I’ve spent the
last couple weeks writing a window system for the VS100. I stole a fair
amount of code from W, surrounded it with an asynchronous rather than a
synchronous interface, and called it X. Overall performance appears to
be about twice that of W. The code seems fairly solid at this point,
although there are still some deficiencies to be fixed up. We at LCS
have stopped using W, and are now actively building applications on X.
Anyone else using W should seriously consider switching. This is not the
ultimate window system, but I believe it is a good starting point for
experimentation. Right at the moment there is a CLU (and an Argus)
interface to X; a C interface is in the works. The three existing
applications are a text editor (TED), an Argus I/O interface, and a
primitive window manager. There is no documentation yet; anyone crazy
enough to volunteer? I may get around to it eventually. ↫ Robert W.
Scheifler Reading this announcement email made me wonder if way back
then, in 1984, the year of my birth, there were also people poo-pooing
this new thing called “X” for not having all the features W had. There
must’ve people posting angry messages on various BBS servers about how X
is dumb and useless since it doesn’t have their feature in W that allows
them to use an acoustic modem to send a signal over their internal
telephone system by slapping their terminal in just the right spot to
activate their Betamax that’s hotwired into the telephone system. I
mean, W was only about a year old at the time, so probably not, but
there must’ve been a lot of complaining and whining about this
newfangled X thing, and now, 40 years later, long after it has outgrown
its usefulness, we’re again dealing with people so hell-bent on keeping
an outdated system running but hoping – nay, demanding – others to do
the actual work of maintaining it. X served its purpose. It took way too
long, but we’ve moved on. Virtually every new Linux user since roughly
12-24 months ago will most likely never use X, and never even know what
it was. They’re using a more modern, more stable, more performant, more
secure, and better maintained system, leading to a better user
experience, and that’s something we should all agree on is a good
thing.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or
journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the
music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that
the music industry had concocted. They didn’t give a shit about the
users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection
between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users.
We supposedly didn’t have any.
</p>
<p>
I’m like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman">Emmett
Chapman</a>, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick">musicial
instrument</a> for himself and others to use. That’s what I do with
software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the
music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would
have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there’s been plenty of
time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had
was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love
was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the
skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">technology</a>
existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out.
For that he would say Every day is Father’s Day. That may be my greatest
accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought
(and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our
uncle Ken, on my mother’s side, and said he would have shit his pants
over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager
reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine.
The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I’m absolutely
sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my
great uncle
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">Arno</a> who was a
pioneer of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettlekasten</a>
would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a
shorter name). People’s first reaction is that by creating art with
ChatGPT I’m stealing. Bollocks. I’m creating. I’m not even going to
validate that with a rebuttal. I am proving it with the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patriotic+Kitten%22">Patriotic

<h2 id="the-feedland-stack">The FeedLand stack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is
that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over
at any level, you can, and today I’m doing exactly that. But first
here’s the stack:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
At the lowest level is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple">reallysimple
package</a>, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript
object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the
differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the
source <a href="https://source.scripting.com/">namespace</a> are
included, where they are present.
</li>
<li>
Above that level is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase">feedlanddatabase
package</a>, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL
database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds,
subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a
river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I’m
going to start building today.
</li>
<li>
Next level up is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland">feedland package</a>,
which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff
that the FeedLand client needs.
</li>
<li>
And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the
browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the
rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST
interface happens here.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In an
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207">application</a>
I’m working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and
I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that’s already there. The
advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage
the data structures. So that’s what I’m doing. Wish me luck.

announces third-party RISC-V mainboard for the Framework 13 laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework, the company making modular, upgradeable, and repairable
laptops, and DeepComputing, the same company that’s making the DC ROMA
II RISC-V laptop we talked about last week, have announced something
incredibly cool: a brand new RISC-V mainboard that fits right into
existing Framework 13 laptops. Sporting a RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC,
this groundbreaking Mainboard was independently designed and developed
by DeepComputing. It’s the main component of the very first RISC-V
laptop to run Canonical’s Ubuntu Desktop and Server, and the Fedora
Desktop OS and represents the first independently developed Mainboard
for a Framework Laptop. ↫ The DeepComputing website For a company that
was predicted to fail by a popular Apple spokesperson, it seems
Framework is doing remarkably well. This new mainboard is the first one
not made by Framework itself, and is the clearest validation yet of the
concept put into the market by the Framework team. I can’t recall the
last time you could buy a laptop powered by one architecture, and then
upgrade to an entirely different architecture down the line, just by
replacing the mainboard. The news of this RISC-V mainboard has made me
dream of other possibilities – like someone crazy enough to design, I
don’t know, a POWER10 or POWER11 mainboard? Entirely impossible and
unlikely due to heat constraints, but one may dream, right?</p>

id="update-on-newton-the-wayland-native-accessibility-project">Update on
Newton, the Wayland-native accessibility project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s incredibly good news for people who use accessibility tools
on Linux, but who were facing serious, gamebreaking problems when trying
to use Wayland. Matt Campbell, of the GNOME accessibility team, has been
hard at work on an entirely new accessibility architecture for modern
free desktops, and he’s got some impressive results to show for it
already. I’ve now implemented enough of the new architecture that Orca
is basically usable on Wayland with some real GTK 4 apps, including
Nautilus, Text Editor, Podcasts, and the Fractal client for Matrix. Orca
keyboard commands and keyboard learn mode work, with either Caps Lock or
Insert as the Orca modifier. Mouse review also works more or less. Flat
review is also working. The Orca command to left-click the current flat
review item works for standard GTK 4 widgets. ↫ Matt Campbell One of the
major goals of the project was to enable such accessibility support for
Flatpak applications without having to pass an exception for the AT-SPI
bus. what this means is that the new accessibility architecture can run
as part of a Flatpak application without having to break out of their
sandbox, which is obviously a hugely important feature to implement.
There’s still a lot of work to be done, though. Something like the GNOME
shell doesn’t yet support Newton, of course, so that’s still using the
older, much slower AT-SPI bus. Wayland also doesn’t support mouse
synthesizing yet, things like font, size, style, and colour aren’t
exposed yet, and there’s a many more limitations due to this being such
a new project. The project also isn’t trying to be GNOME-specific;
Campbell wants to work with the other desktops to eventually end up with
an accessibility architecture that is truly cross-desktop. The blog post
further goes into great detail about implementation details, current and
possible future shortcomings, and a lot more.</p>

<p>I’m highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a
quick look indicates that it’s a fairly large project. All I want to do
is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong
time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a
thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There’s
no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I’m going to
have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6.1-released">KDE Plasma 6.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>After the very successful release of KDE Plasma 6.0, which moved the
entire desktop environment and most of its applications over to Qt 6,
fixed a whole slow of bugs, and streamlined the entire KDE desktop and
its applications, it’s now time for KDE Plasma 6.1, where we’re going to
see a much stronger focus on new features. While it’s merely a point
release, it’s still a big one. The tentpole new feature of Plasma 6.1 is
access to remote Plasma desktops. You can go into Settings and log into
any Plasma desktop, which is built entirely and directly into KDE’s own
Wayland compositor, avoiding the use of third party applications of
hacky extensions to X.org. Having such remote access built right into
the desktop environment and its compositor itself is a much cleaner
implementation than in the before time with X. Another feature that
worked just fine under X but was still missing from KDE Plasma on
Wayland is something they now call “persistent applications” –
basically, KDE will now remember which windows you had open when you
closed KDE or shut down your computer, and open them back up right where
you left off when you log back in. It’s one of those things that got
lost in the transition to Wayland, and having it back is really, really
welcome. Speaking of Wayland, KDE Plasma 6.1 also introduces two major
new rendering features. Explicit sync removes flickering and glitches
most commonly seen on NVIDIA hardware, while triple buffering provides
smoother animations and screen rendering. There’s more here, too, such
as a completely reworked edit desktop view, support for controlling
keyboard LED backlighting traditionally found in gaming laptops, and
more. KDE Plasma 6.1 will find its way to your distribution of choice
soon enough, but of course, you can compile and install it yourself,
too.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-of-dr-dos">The history of DR-DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve always found the world of DOS versions and variants to be
confusing, since most of it took place when I was very young (I’m from
1984) so I wasn’t paying much attention to computing quite yet, other
than playing DOS games. One of the variants of DOS I never quite
understood where it was from until much, much later, was DR-DOS. To this
day, I pronounce this as “Doctor DOS”. If you’re also a little unclear
on what, exactly, DR-DOS was, Bradford Morgan White has an excellent
article detailing the origins and history of DR-DOS, making it very easy
to get up to speed and expand your knowledge on DOS, which is surely a
very marketable skill in the days of Electron and Electron for
Developers. DR DOS was a great product. It was superior to other DOS
versions in many ways, and it is certainly possible that it could have
been more successful were it not for Microsoft Windows having been so
wildly successful. Starting with Windows 95, the majority of computer
users simply didn’t much care about which DOS loaded Windows so long as
it worked. There’s quite a bit of lore regarding legal battles and
copyrights surrounding CP/M and DOS involving Microsoft and Digital
Research. This has been covered in previous articles to some extent, but
I am not really certain how much would have changed had Microsoft and
Digital Research got on. Gates and Kildall had been quite friendly at
one point, and we know that the two mutually chose not to work together
due to differences in business practices and beliefs. Kildall chose to
be quite a bit more friendly and less competitive while Gates very much
chose to be competitive and at times a bit ruthless. Additionally,
Kildall sold DRI rather than continue the fight, and DRI had never
really attempted to combine DR DOS with GEM as a cohesive product to
fight Windows before Windows became the ultimate ruler of the OS market
following Windows 3.1’s release. Still, it was an absolutely brilliant
product and part of me will always feel that it ought to have won. ↫
Bradford Morgan White I can definitely imagine an alternative timeline
in which Digital Research managed to combine DR-DOS with GEM in a more
attractive way, stealing Microsoft’s thunder before Gates’ balls got
rolling properly with Windows 3.x. It’s one of the many, many what-ifs
in this sector, but not one you often hear or read about.</p>

id="adobes-hidden-cancellation-fee-is-unlawful-ftc-suit-says">Adobe’s
hidden cancellation fee is unlawful, FTC suit says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>To lock subscribers into recurring monthly payments, Adobe would
typically pre-select by default its most popular “annual paid monthly”
plan, the FTC alleged. That subscription option locked users into an
annual plan despite paying month to month. If they canceled after a
two-week period, they’d owe Adobe an early termination fee (ETF) that
costs 50 percent of their remaining annual subscription. The “material
terms” of this fee are hidden during enrollment, the FTC claimed, only
appearing in “disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that
most consumers never see.” ↫ Ashley Belanger at Ars Technica There’s a
sucker for every corporation, but I highly doubt there’s anyone out
there who would consider this a fair business practice. This is so
obviously designed to hide costs during sign-up, and then unveil them
when the user considers quitting. If this is deemed legal or allowed,
you can expect everyone to jump on this bandwagon to scam users out of
their money. It goes further than this, though. According to the FTC,
Adobe knew this practice was shady, but continued it anyway because
altering it would negatively affect the bottom line. The FTC is actually
targeting two Adobe executives directly, which is always nice to hear –
it’s usually management that pushes such illegal practices through,
leaving the lower ranks little choice but to comply or lose their job.
Stuff like this is exactly why confidence in the major technology
companies is at an all-time low.</p>

<h2 id="cinnamon-6.2-released">Cinnamon 6.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cinnamon, the popular GTK desktop environment developed by the Linux
Mint project, pushed out Cinnamon 6.2 today, which will serve as the
default desktop for Linux Mint 22. It’s a relatively minor release, but
it does contain a major new feature which is actually quite welcome: a
new GTK frontend for GNOME Online Accounts, part of the XApp project.
This makes it possible to use the excellent GNOME Online Accounts
framework, without having to resort to a GNOME application – and will
come in very handy on other GTK desktops, too, like Xfce. The remainder
of the changes consist of a slew of bugfixes, small new features, and
nips and tucks here and there. Wayland support is still an in-progress
effort for Cinnamon, so you’ll be stuck with X for now.</p>

<p>Less than a month after 3.5.0, IceWM is already shipping version
3.6.0. Once again not a major, earth-shattering release, it does contain
at least one really cool feature that I think it pretty nifty: if you
double-click on a window border, it will maximise just that side of the
window. Pretty neat. For the rest, it’s small changes and bug fixes for
this venerable window manager.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems that if you want to steer clear from having Facebook use
your Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. data for machine learning
training, you might want to consider moving to the European Union. Meta
has apparently paused plans to process mounds of user data to bring new
AI experiences to Europe. The decision comes after data regulators
rebuffed the tech giant’s claims that it had “legitimate interests” in
processing European Union- and European Economic Area (EEA)-based
Facebook and Instagram users’ data—including personal posts and
pictures—to train future AI tools. ↫ Ashley Belanger These are just the
opening salvos of the legal war that’s brewing here, so who knows how
it’s going to turn out. For now, though, European Union Facebook users
are safe from Facebook’s machine learning training.</p>

<p>Way, way back in the cold and bleak days of 2021, I mentioned Vinix
on OSNews, an operating system written in the V programming language. A
few days ago, over on Mastodon, the official account for the V
programming language sent out a screenshot showing Solitaite running on
Vinix, showing off what the experimental operating system can do. The
project doesn’t seem to really publish any changelogs or release notes,
so it’s difficult to figure out what, exactly, is going on at the
moment. The roadmap indicates they’ve already got a solid base going to
work from, such as mlibc, bash, GCC/G++, X and an X window manager, and
more – with things like Wayland, networking, and more on the
roadmap.</p>

id="microsoft-starts-beating-the-windows-11-pr-drum-in-face-of-reluctant-windows-10-users">Microsoft
starts beating the Windows 11 PR drum in face of reluctant Windows 10
users</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>I have a feeling Microsoft is really starting to feel some pressure
about its plans to abandon Windows 10 next year. Data shows that 70% of
Windows users are still using Windows 10, and this percentage has proven
to be remarkably resilient, making it very likely that hundreds of
millions of Windows users will be out of regular, mainstream support and
security patches next year. It seems Microsoft is, therefore, turning up
the PR campaign, this time by publishing a blog post about myths and
misconceptions about Windows 11. The kind of supposed myths and
misconceptions Microsoft details are exactly the kind of stuff
corporations with large deployments worry about at night. For instance,
Microsoft repeatedly bangs the drum on application compatibility,
stating that despite the change in number – 10 to 11 – Windows 11 is
built on the same base as its predecessor, and as such, touts 99.7%
application compatibility. Furthermore, Microsoft adds that if
businesses to suffer from an incompatibility, they can use something
call App Assure – which I will intentionally mispronounce until the day
I die because I’m apparently a child – to fix any issues. Apparently,
the visual changes to the user interface in Windows 11 are also a cause
of concern for businesses, as Microsoft dedicated an entire entry to
this, citing a study that the visual changes do not negatively impact
productivity. The blog post then goes on to explain how the changes are
actually really great and enhance productivity – you know, the usual PR
speak. There’s more in the blog post, and I have a feeling we’ll be
seeing more and more of this kind of PR offensive as the cut-off date
for Windows 10 support nears. Windows 10 users will probably also see
more and more Windows 11 ads when using their computers, too, urging
them to upgrade even when they very well cannot because of missing TPMs
or unsupported processors. I don’t think any of these things will work
to bring that 70% number down much over the next 12 months, and that’s a
big problem for Microsoft. I’m not going to make any predictions, but I
wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft will simply be forced by, well,
reality to extend the official support for Windows 10 well beyond 2025.
Especially with all the recent investigations into Microsoft’s shoddy
internal security culture, there’s just no way they can cut 70% of their
users off from security updates and patches.</p>

id="mobile-comms-via-satellite-for-backcountry-and-maritime-safety">Mobile
comms via satellite for backcountry and maritime safety</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Stranded on a desert island; lost in the forest; stuck in the snow;
injured and unable to get back to civilization. Human beings have used
their ingenuity for millennia to try to signal for rescue. there’s been
a progression of technological innovations: smoke signals, mirrors, a
loud whistle, a portable radio, a mobile phone. With each invention,
it’s been possible to venture a little farther from populated areas and
still have peace of mind about being able to call for help. But once you
get past the range of a terrestrial radio tower, whether it’s into the
wilderness or out at sea, it starts to get more complicated and
expensive to be able to call for rescue. In the next year or so, it’s
going to become a lot simpler and less expensive. Probably enough to
become ubiquitous. Hardware infrastructure is already in place, and the
relevant software and service support is rolling out now. It’s been
possible for decades for adventurers to keep in contact via satellite.
The first commercial maritime satellite communications was launched in
1976. Globalstar and Iridium launched in the late 90s and drove down the
device size and service cost of satellite phones. However, the service
was a lot more expensive than cellular phone service, and not enough
people were willing to pay for remote comms to be able to overcome the
massive infrastructure costs, and both companies went bankrupt. Their
investors lost their money, but the satellites still worked, so once the
bankruptcies were hashed out they fulfilled their promise, as least
technologically. On a parallel track, in the late 1980s International
Cospas-Sarsat Programme was set up to develop a system for satellite
aided search and rescue system that detects and locates emergency
beacons activated by aircraft, ships and people engaged in recreational
activities in remote areas, and then sends these distress alerts to
search-and-rescue (SAR) authorities. Many types of beacons are
available, and nowadays they send exact GPS coordinates along with the
call for rescue. In the 2010s, the Satellite Emergency Notification
Device or SEND device was brought to market. These are portable beacons
that connect to the Globalstar and Iridium networks and allow people in
remote areas not only to call for help in emergencies, but also to
communicate via text messaging. Currently the two most popular SEND
devices are the Garmin inReach Mini 2 and the Spot X. These devices cost
$400 and $250 USD respectively, and require monthly service fees of
$12-40. For someone undertaking a long and dangerous expedition into the
backcountry, these are very reasonable costs, especially for someone who
does it often. But for most people, it’s just not practical to pay for
and carry a device like that “just in case.” In 2022, the iPhone 14
included a feature that was the first step in taking satellite-based
communication into the mainstream. It allows iPhone users to share their
location via Find My feature with new radio hardware that connects to
the Globalstar service. So if you’re out adventuring, your friends can
keep track of where you are. And if there’s an emergency, you can make
an emergency SOS. It’s not just a generic Mayday: you can text specific
details about your emergency and it will be transmitted to the local
authorities. You can also choose to notify your personal emergency
contacts. Last week, at WWDC, Apple announced the next stage: in iOS 18,
iMessage users will be able to send text messages over satellite, using
the same Globalstar network as its SOS features. Initially at least,
this feature is expected to be free. With this expansion, iPhone users
will have the basic functionality of a SPOT or inReach device, without
special hardware or a monthly fee. SpaceX’s Starlink, which first
offered service in 2021, has much higher bandwidth and lower latency
than the Globalstar and Iridium networks. Starlink’s current offering
requires a dinner plate sized antenna and conventional networking
hardware to enable high bandwidth mobile internet. It’s great for a
vehicle, but impractical for a backpacker. However, SpaceX has announced
2nd generation satellites that can connect to 1900MHz spectrum mobile
phone radios, and T-Mobile has announced that it will be enabling the
service for its customers in late 2024, and Apple, Google, and Samsung
devices are confirmed to be supported. Initially, like Apple’s service,
this will be restricted to text messaging and other low-bandwidth
applications. Phone calls and higher bandwidth internet connectivity are
promised in 2025. The other two big US carriers, AT&amp;T and Verizon,
have announced they will be partnering with a competing service, AST
SpaceMobile, but it’s unlikely those plans will come to fruition very
soon. Mobile phone users outside the US will also need to wait. Apple’s
Message via satellite is only announced for US users, as is T-Mobile’s
offering. So if you’re in the US, and have an iPhone, or are a T-Mobile
subscriber with an Apple, Samsung, or Google device, you’ll soon be able
to point your phone at the sky, even in remote areas, to call for help,
give your friends an update on your expedition, or just stay in touch.
Pretty soon, Tom Hanks won’t have to make friends with a volleyball when
he crash lands on a deserted island, at least not until his battery
dies.</p>

<h2 id="twenty-years-ago-today">Twenty years ago today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of
podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio
post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a
little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing
a blog post.
</p>
<p>
That was
<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM">June 11,
2004</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then it hit me, it’s June <i>2024</i> now, it’s been <i>twenty freaking
years</i>.
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a
dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here
we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and
it’s still as open as it was back in June 2004.
</p>
<p>
<b>Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast</b>. That was the goal. You
don’t need anyone’s permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior
to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less
real and less interesting, imho.
</p>
<p>
My partner in this at the time was
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry">Adam
Curry</a>. Sometime in that period he started
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code">The Daily
Source Code</a>, and then we did a podcast together for a few months
called <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a>. My own
podcast was called <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning
Coffee Notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months,
with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows.
I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the
same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew,
Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine
won’t.)
</p>
<p>
So here’s the URL for the podcast.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml</a>
</p>
<p>
I’m sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck.
I’ll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I’ll
register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts.
</p>
<p>
I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting
bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types
like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying
out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that’s
still thriving twenty years later.
</p>
<p>
It should be quite a story! :-)
</p>
<p>
Here’s a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004.
And that’s the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in
Seattle at the time.

<h1 id="2024-06-15-old-tech-uucp">
2024-06-15 Old tech: UUCP
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a> and I have
been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.
</p>
<h2 id="uucp">
UUCP
</h2>
<p>
The latest effort has been in connecting our servers using <em>Unix to
Unix copy</em> (UUCP). The benefit is that once you have that, you can
also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using
<code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<p>
lkh has a “travelling laptop” that is mostly offline, but sometimes it’s
online. That’s when he wants to exchange stuff with us. The laptop is
called Dwalin.
</p>
<p>
My server is Campaign Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available
via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">
/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys
</h3>
<p>
This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">
/etc/uucp/passwd
</h3>
<p>
This is where Dwalin’s password is stored. This is important because
there’s no actual Dwalin user on my system.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-sys">
/etc/sys
</h3>
<p>
I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">
/etc/uucp/config
</h3>
<p>
This is where I set my own node name.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me some spool related entries. I’m not sure whether I needed
them.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
In our case, lkh’s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi’s Erebor system and
here’s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I’m not connected
to Erebor directly):
</p>
<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="news">
News
</h2>
<p>
Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.
</p>
<p>
Look at the requisites:
</p>
<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">
/etc/news/send-uucp.cf
</h3>
<p>
This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big
the batches should be.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">
/etc/news/newsfeeds
</h3>
<p>
Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">
/var/lib/news/active
</h3>
<p>
Add the new newsgroups. We don’t do control messages.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.
</p>
<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">
/var/lib/news/newsgroups
</h3>
<p>
Give the new newsgroups a tag line.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">
/etc/news/readers.conf
</h3>
<p>
Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.
</p>
<p>
Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the “readonly” section.
</p>
<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
}

access &quot;authenticatedpeople&quot; {
    users: &quot;*&quot;
    newsgroups: &quot;*,!junk,!control,!control.*&quot;
}

access &quot;readonly&quot; {
    users: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
    read: &quot;local.*,campaignwiki.*,casa.*,cosmic.*,erebor.*,rec.*,de.*,alt.*&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-1">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where a news article is put into the
queue and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls and the enqueued article is
sent:
</p>
<pre><code>uux dwalin news (2024-06-15 10:22:01.34 3832004) Queuing rnews (D.000R)

</code></pre>
<h2 id="e-mail">
E-Mail
</h2>
<p>
Oh yes, we do.
</p>
<p>
Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl’s “taint” mechanism wherein
user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted
by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like “alex” is
tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes
untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you
run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be
looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system,
is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">
/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
</h3>
<p>
This is the file generated by <code>update-exim4.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
The result of me answering the questions:
</p>
<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'

dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that the MX records for my domains point to Migadu because that’s
where SMTP mail should go.
</p>
<p>
UUCP is what lkh, kyonshi and I use.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>. If it comes after the primary,
then it won’t work because the primary router ends with
<code>no_more</code> and as the comment at the end of the file says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for
domains in the local_domains list
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new
file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;

    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-uucp">
/etc/exim4/uucp

<p>
This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to
UUCP names.
</p>
<p>
It only works for Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as
such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP
system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).
</p>
<p>
The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code>
(see above).
</p>

This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the
<code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used
<code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third
argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error
messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim
sends me a en error message):

<p>
I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions
that didn’t do taint checking.
</p>
<p>
The code I’m using means that I’m looking up the sender local part
(“alex” or “root”) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found,
the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password
list).
</p>
<p>
You can test these expressions on the command-line:
</p>
<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'

As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send
mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.

<p>
Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.

<p>
As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:
</p>

Hi,<br/> The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the
&lt;delete&gt; key doesn't delete, &lt;F1&gt; doesn't set the star and
&lt;F2&gt; doesn't clear marks. HotKeys has preempted the familiar
Oberon key functionalities?
</p>

I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys. In
10272 &lt;F12&gt; gives a report in the log that a SystemTools command
doesn't exist.

SystemTools was omitted inadvertently?

<p>
I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent
exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb
Knight posted
<a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/">“Perplexity

motivation I needed to join the fun.

<p>
I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a
shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of
mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402">402</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the
<a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents
list</a> and set up an NGINX redirect based on those UA. Gonna be
interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a
follow-up.
</p>
<p>
I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is
great and if you’re using RSS in 2024 you’re an awesome person BUT I
might have inadvertently broken some RSS feed out there with this move.
If you notice something not working properly let me know and I’ll fix
it.

<h2 id="streamos-source-code-republished-15-years-later">StreamOS source
code republished 15 years later</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating
system called StreamOS – version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that
day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal
using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out
that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered
the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It’s not a
complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together
with git. I didn’t do source code management much back in the days, and
there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup
drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed
(along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and
see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫
Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the
SNES, but it’s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope
Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because
you may never know – someone might be interested in picking up this 15
year old baton.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves">A brief history of
Mac enclaves and exclaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves
on the Mac, and when he touches upon “exclaves”, a new concept that
doesn’t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While
an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of
another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists
separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a
term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel
extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in
iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel
that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes
compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of
refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected
exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I’m
not going to add too much here since I’m not well-versed enough in the
world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it’s an
interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more
knowledge about this topic than I do.</p>

<h2 id="imagine-rss-as-a-cover-story">Imagine RSS as a cover story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been
on the cover of a magazine, so you can’t say ChatGPT is stealing this
from anyone. In fact I’m offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press
has chosen to focus on the idea that it’s plagiarizing journalists. The
ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they’re doing
their jobs, they’re reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote
a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper
that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>.
I don’t owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I
read the news on their site. The news doesn’t belong to them.
</p>
<p>
The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn’t so
far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no
billionaires involved, so they didn’t consider it newsworthy I guess.
Some day we’re going to have to accept that we have to make our own
news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker’s famous line – “If you don’t like
the news go out and make some of your own.” So here we go. I asked
ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story.

Imagine RSS as the cover story.

PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read
printed magazines?

written a crawler for the network of blogrolls via
<a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">connective links</a> in HTML
and/or RSS feeds. When I started the project, I had no idea what I’d
find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don’t know the extent
of it, but there’s a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I’m
thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the
blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I’m beginning to see the
utility of <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> as a feed
operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It’s not just a feed
reader. It’s able to do things most feed readers don’t do, maybe none
do. We don’t have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either.
I will of course share the results when they are shareable.</p>

<p>Three movies I’ve watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The
Matrix. 3. The Devil’s Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they
go together. And they’re all about the same thing, about choosing to
live in a dream, or to live the life you’re actually living. All three
are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to
end, which is really unusual for me these days.</p>

<h2 id="cloudnativepg-1.23.2-1.22.4-and-1.21.6-released">CloudNativePG
1.23.2, 1.22.4 and 1.21.6 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to announce a
new update for the <strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now
available for the supported versions 1.23, 1.22, and 1.21.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to comprehensive refactoring and enhancement activities, we’ve
significantly improved the reliability of our automated End-to-End (E2E)
tests. With contributions from
<a href="https://enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>, we’ve tested the operator on
all major cloud providers, identified several defects, and resolved them
in these new releases, ensuring a more stable and resilient software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Versions 1.23.2, 1.22.4, and 1.21.6</strong> are patch releases
that contain crucial bug fixes, addressing issues such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unnecessary reloads and shutdowns of PostgreSQL
</li>
<li>
Excessive CPU usage on fenced instances, due to busy waiting loop
</li>
<li>
The primary instance manager hanging indefinitely after a stop and
subsequent failure
</li>
<li>
Autovacuum not working correctly due to an issue between
<code>hot_standby_feedback</code> and our managed cluster-level
replication slots implementation
</li>
<li>
<code>pgaudit.log_rows</code> not functioning as intended
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With this update, version 1.21 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version
1.21.6 marks the final release for the 1.21 minor version.
</p>
<p>
We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience
to benefit from these improvements and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>
For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the release notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/release_notes/v1.23/">Release
notes for 1.23.2</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/release_notes/v1.22/">Release
notes for 1.22.4</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">Release
notes for 1.21.6</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, we are pleased to announce that macOS users can now
install the <code>cnpg</code> plugin for <code>kubectl</code> via
Homebrew with the command: <code>brew install kubectl-cnpg</code>.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your continued support. We look forward to your seamless
experience with the updated CloudNativePG Operator. If you are using it
in production, please consider
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md">adding
your organization as an adopter of the project</a>.
</p>
<p>
Your support helps us grow and improve!

<h2>
About CloudNativePG
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> stands as a
groundbreaking open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for
PostgreSQL workloads. Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of
a PostgreSQL cluster, CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and
configuration to ensuring high availability, connection routing, and
comprehensive backup and disaster recovery mechanisms. Leveraging
PostgreSQL’s native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard
Kubernetes patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a
Kubernetes-native manner, with the operator autonomously and safely
reconfiguring replication as needed. Originally conceived and supported
by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>, CloudNativePG
represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads within
Kubernetes environments.
