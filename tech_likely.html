like YouTube TV to let me block Fox News. It shows up on their home
screen as the default channel and it starts playing automatically. For
some reason they’ve decided I want or need to watch Fox News. Please
stop doing that. Not just for me, for everyone. If there has to be a
default make it something easy like Seinfeld perhaps. Or Law &amp;
Order. I haven’t switched from Spectrum, I’m trying YouTube TV while I
think about switching. This is a small thing, but might be a
deal-stopper. I don’t want my nose rubbed in how evil they are. I know.
I want to turn on TV to escape. A Julie Andrews movie perhaps.</p>

<p>Matt Terenzio, who has been a friend for many years,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@librenews/112615016271629839">threw a
fat pitch</a> about people like me who think the NY Times has a lot of
explaining to do. I don’t think anyone is listening, but my issue with
the Times is when they embrace and promote conspiracy theories that
damage our political system. Matt says we have many truths, and I think
that’s where we differ, there has to be one truth when it comes to
accusations of the kind that the Repubs throw at Democratic candidates
and minorities. When they take a side against the people, that’s when I
have a problem.</p>

If I’m not mistaken I discovered Jess thanks to her

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
Hi, I’m Jessica. Jess really. I live in Wellington, New Zealand. I’ve
lived in New Zealand on and off since 1990, when my family moved here
from the States. My mother is a kiwi and Dad’s american. They met when
my dad came out to NZ as a ski instructor in the 60s.
</p>
<p>
I had a “very American” childhood and briefly went to Junior High School
before moving. One of my favourite stories from that time is that
everyone at my new school wanted to know if my old school was “like
Beverly Hills 90210.” I had to break it to them that no, my junior high
in Vancover, Washington wasn’t exactly the same, though we did have
lockers and foosball tables and fake-cheese nachos for lunch, haha.
</p>
<p>
I went to university in NZ - a place called Otago University in Dunedin.
It’s a university town waaaaay down in the South Island. It’s an awesome
city, a bit wild–it even has an albatross colony. I started off as
pre-med, because I always enjoyed science and maths at school, but then
veered off when I failed Chemistry. I studied music, archaeology,
geology, history, english. At one point I was going to do my degree in
geology but then at the end I wound up doing English literature. Later
on when I was working in IT and bored, I finished my honours degree,
part-time. Somehow I studied the Old Norse language (we translated
excerpts from the Eddas, as well as some amazing prose stuff) and also
wrote my thesis on Literature and Technology. I think I’ve always been
all over the place.
</p>
<p>
I still work in IT, and it’s still boring, even though I am just part
time these days (my husband and I have an eleven-year-old daughter and I
do all the runaround stuff with her too). But maybe that lets me focus
on everything else I do. I have a lot of hobbies, but I’ve probably run
out of room to talk about them here. But a few that could be worth
mentioning are my writing of course, as well as some assistant editorial
stuff I do for Utopia Science Fiction magazine. I like taking photos and
develop film as well. I play piano and do karate. I knit socks. I was a
video game reviewer for ten years too.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I actually have a few blogs. I think you found me through my writing
one? I was wanting to self-publish some books and thought I needed a
blog with my name on it to do it properly. That one has all of my books
on it, but I guess my “real” blog is the one at discombobulated.co.nz,
though that’s had a few iterations over the years.
</p>
<p>
It started out in 2000, when I was doing my “OE” (or Overseas
Experience, what kiwis call the migration of most NZ young people
overseas for an indefinite period of time) in Dublin. I lived and worked
there for about three years. I had another boring IT job and decided
when I was sitting around waiting for releases (I was working as a
localisation engineer at Microsoft) I might as well do something online.
I found a service called Diary-x that some of your readers might
remember. My domain in those days was herself.diary-x.com, but the blog
itself was named “Discombobulated in Dublin.” A sort of Sleepless in
Seattle reference, I guess, but I really was discombobulated in those
days so it seemed to fit.
</p>
<p>
That all fell over, and the owner confessed that he hadn’t made any
backups, or the backups had failed, or something. It was my first
introduction to the concept of resiliency and I guess it was a good
lesson, because I still adhere to the concept of
<a href="https://www.veritas.com/information-center/3-2-1-backup-rule">3-2-1</a>
with most of my stuff. Later I moved to Wordpress like everyone else,
and I think it was then that I first bought my domain
(discombobulated.co.nz). I like having a ‘co.nz’ domain. I think it’s
cute. I’m in the process of trying to bring over all of my old wordpress
posts but that may take some time.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My blog is a completely personal one, so I don’t tend to write multiple
drafts or get proofreading done. I figure any typos or weirdness is just
part of the experience, which is less about a professional image and
more of a slice-of-life moment.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always struggled with the way blogging changed so much and became
just another way for people to market things or sell you stuff. I really
did enjoy how it was back in the early days, where you would follow
people and get a sense of their internal monologues, what it was like
for them to live in certain places. I’ve always loved having little
windows into other people’s lives.
</p>
<p>
So basically my process is, I go, “hm, it’s been a while, I should
probably do a blog post.” And sometimes I start with the weather, or I
have some news I want to write about. Or I look back through some recent
photographs and find one I want to write about. Sometimes I note down
quotes I like from books I’m reading, or the post might turn into a
longer piece about an actual topic. But most of the time they are just
stream-of-consciousness brain dumps. (Sorry.)
</p>
<p>
I guess it is pretty self-absorbed, really, writing like this and making
it public. But I just think back on those blogs that I really loved in
the past, and how it made me feel when I read them. And I sort of want
to re-create that, I guess. So those are my touchstones, in a way. A
vague guiding principle.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I’m not too concerned about where I write, although I really don’t like
the feeling that someone might be behind me, looking over my shoulder. I
used to work in an open office, back in my office IT days, and I could
never get used to the feeling.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I write at my desk in my study–I have a mac mini and a
nice big screen. (I also work from home, but that’s on a windows
machine, so everything is pretty separate.) I’m also quite happy typing
in bed on my laptop too; for some reason generally I find writing in bed
works really well for me. On the weekends I really like opening the door
to the balcony by the bed and sitting there to write.
</p>
<p>
I keep quite a few notebooks and I journal in those, but composing a
blog post in a notebook feels a little strange. Recently I’ve set up a
chair outside the study, under some punga ferns that hang over the fence
there, and I have found that sitting there with a notebook, and brain.fm
on my headphones has been pretty wild in terms of getting into the zone.
</p>
<p>
Probably like most people I’m drawn to beautiful photos of desks in
minimal offices, or a spot at a beautiful cafe, but to be honest by the
time I’m in the flow of writing I hardly even notice my surroundings.
I’m in that in-between space, somewhere between the text on the screen
and my brain.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to work other places apart from home, but the libraries in New
Zealand are pretty much public spaces these days, and because most of
them are small and suburban (our big one in Wellington is currently out
of action due to earthquake strengthening) there aren’t many places to
just find a quiet desk. There’s also a bit of a mood among cafes where
they don’t seem to like you “bludging” a seat for too long. Of course
there are coworking spaces–I even signed up for one a while ago, but
they are pretty expensive and it’s just a bit hard to justify.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
Sure! My writing blog is one of those Jekyll templates hosted on GitHub
pages, though I am looking at simplifying that. (It also got a really
bad score on the websitecarbon.com website, which is another reason I’m
considering moving.) What I do really like about it is that I have the
site mirrored locally, and I can edit the html and css in Zed
(<a href="https://zed.dev">https://zed.dev</a>) (currently my code
editor of choice, though I sometimes go back to Vim). I like writing a
post in a text file and then pushing a copy out to where it’s hosted. It
feels more like writing that way.
</p>
<p>
My personal blog is similar, though I use Blot.im for that. All the
files sit on Dropbox, and everything just syncs and updates as I edit
them. I have the templates and structure sitting there and it’s very
easy to make changes.
</p>
<p>
I recently implemented a weird sort of flow though, involving Obsidian
and an automator folder monitoring workflow. I have, in Obsidian, a Blog
folder, with drafts and posts subfolders. I create a draft blog post
based on a template I’ve created with the right YAML front matter, write
it in Obsidian, and then when I’m ready, I drag it over to the posts
folder. Once it arrives there, automator kicks in and makes a copy to my
Blot folder.
</p>
<p>
I like writing blog posts in markdown in Obsidian; everything syncs to
GitHub pretty easily. The only faff is with implementing photos, which I
usually resize by hand and copy to an assets folder within the Blot
structure. But it’s easy enough to implement without too much flicking
around.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if this seems really weird or not. But I’ve come to realise
that I really dislike writing anything in a web browser; everything just
feels very slow and mouse-oriented. My next challenge is to try and find
a newsletter option that I can use in a similar way. If anyone has any
suggestions I’d love to hear them!
</p>
<p>
Both my domains are registered through 1stdomains.nz. I couldn’t even
tell you why I first signed up with them. The site is a bit clunky but I
like that they are a kiwi company.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
Going way back, I think despite everything that happened with the
diary-x fiasco, it was a really great place to hang out and meet other
people online. (I even reconnected with someone on micro.blog who I had
been friends with back in those days; it was very surreal!) I think all
I would do differently really is make sure I kept even some basic text
copies of what I’d written–even the wayback machine hasn’t been able to
find everything.
</p>
<p>
I do think that using Wordpress was a bit of a lesson in how hard it can
be to get everything out of a hulking CMS. Yes there are some good
scripts that can do it, but I still have over three hundred posts that I
have to now go back through and sort the links for images. It’s just
turned into a complete chore.
</p>
<p>
More recently, I think I wish I’d just used the shortened version of my
name for the author blog. Jess Nickelsen rather than Jessica Nickelsen.
It seems like a small thing, but Jess feels more like me. Maybe I’ll
just do it, heh!
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
The domain names are around $30 NZ a year, each. Blot is about $20 USD a
year, because I got in on early pricing quite a few years ago. I think
it’s around $60 a year now.
</p>
<p>
(I also have mini blogs with omg.lol; those are $20 USD a year but I
think I subscribed when they were having a sale. I also pay for
micro.blog because I really like what they are doing there and it’s a
lovely community. That’s <span class="math inline">$5 USD a
month.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have anything against people monetising their blogs at
all, but don't you think that a monetised blog has a different feel?
They become more...performative? Less of a window and more of a
presentation? I guess in my mind I separate those sort of blogs out into
the same realm as recipe blogs or youtube channels. It becomes more
about a business and less about openness. And while I completely
understand that for some people this is their main form of income, I
almost wish there was another name for "this sort of thing," other than
"blog."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really still just working out my thoughts on the whole
thing. Maybe my stumbling block is that I'm a Gen-Xer who remembers when
all of this was just a giant playground, and now it's all become quite
serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohh, this is hard. There are so many interesting blogs out
there, and I love that this is a problem. It was awesome to see you
interviewing some bloggers who I genuinely love reading (like Adrianna
Tan, Derek Sivers and Winnie Lim). Here are a few other blogs that I
really like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
href="https://arnoldhoogerwerf.nl"&gt;arnoldhoogerwerf.nl&lt;/a&gt; - he
does all sorts of interesting field recordings in nature and sometimes
makes films to accompany them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
href="https://wonderpens.ca/blogs/uncategorized"&gt;wonderpens.ca&lt;/a&gt;
- though they are a stationery shop, this is a commercial blog I
genuinely enjoy; sincere and well-written, with lovely
photography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://saigonboy.me"&gt;saigonboy.me&lt;/a&gt; I
discovered this blog while I was investigating Montaigne.io (which still
looks pretty cool; a blog created via apple notes?) This is a snippety
sort of travel blog, with illustrations rather than photographs. I
really like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://danwang.co"&gt;danwang.co&lt;/a&gt; - Dan
Wang pretty much does just one post a year, but I've been reading them
for a few years now and always feel smarter and more human after reading
them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://muan.co"&gt;muan.co&lt;/a&gt; - I like
Mu-An Chiou's blog (it's dreamy) but she's also got a nice mix of
personal and professional there too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
href="https://www.robertvanvliet.com"&gt;robertvanvliet.com&lt;/a&gt; -
Robert Van Vliet's blog is a nice example of how I'd like to bring my
two blogs together. He also seems quite dreamy and artsy as well as
being techy, which is a nice combination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
href="https://brainbaking.com"&gt;brainbaking.com&lt;/a&gt; - I think
Winnie Lim also recommended this blog. It's another one of my favourites
as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to mental floss I was able to track down the very first
web page I think I ever visited on the internet: &lt;a
href="http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/"&gt;Strawberry Pop-Tart
Blow-Torches&lt;/a&gt;. It gave me such genuine delight to know this
page still exists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also check out Anthony Alvarado's &lt;em&gt;DIY
Magic&lt;/em&gt;. It's such a great book on creativity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the 42nd edition of &lt;em&gt;People and
Blogs&lt;/em&gt;. Hope you enjoyed this interview with Jess. Make sure

<h2 id="morality-justice-and-the-law">2024-06-14 Morality, justice and
the law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-14-morality-justice-and-the-law">
2024-06-14 Morality, justice and the law
</h1>
<p>
Some actions are legal and still reprehensible. People won’t get
punished by the state or the police but that doesn’t protect them from
scorn, disdain, harsh comments and insults. Actions have consequences.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps some people need to see it spelled out. I think when I was young
I also needed somebody to tell me because when I grew up, I thought that
the state is great, the law is great, and we’re all good people. But
morality, justice and the law are not the same. The law only concerns
the things were the state will come and impose fines and punishment.
Justice is the thing we aspire to (but which the state often cannot
deliver). And the moral good goes further than that.
</p>
<p>
To be morally good or bad is different from being just or unjust and
that is different from something being legal or illegal.
</p>
<p>
So please, when people say that something is reprehensible they usually
don’t care whether it was legal or not because they aren’t going to call
the cops. It’s an occasion to be happy for just being called names, for
only getting demeaned and ridiculed, for just getting inundated with
mails and complaints. It’s a learning opportunity because when the cops
show up and take your stuff, when you get invitations to show up in
court, when the bills start coming in, then it’s worse. Much worse.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen this a few times on fedi, now. Somebody thinks it’s OK to
index all the status messages for their search engine, ingest all the
status messages for their sentiment analysis or for their training data,
and then they’re surprised when people get angry. A discussion ensues,
and some people will say, hey, it was not illegal now, was it? Therefore
there’s no point in getting angry or acting surprised.
</p>
<p>
This misunderstands how humans manage to live together. When I was young
and learned about hackers breaking into computer systems cheered for
them because I didn’t like the corporations. And if it wasn’t illegal it
was good or something like that. I was confused. But now, as I look
around, I see defence in depth all around me. The garden fence has a
gate that is trivial to jump over and to open, but to do so invites
trouble. Whether jumping the fence is legal or illegal doesn’t matter at
first. Perhaps somebody runs away from bullies or creeps and they’re
welcome to jump that fence and escape. Things are negotiable. In a
civilized world, many things need to happen before the state needs to
get involved, and this is how it is supposed to be. Differences can be
resolved.
</p>
<p>
A recent example of what I’m talking about:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A recent investigation by Liaizon Wakest revealed that Maven, a new
social network founded by former OpenAI Team Lead Ken Stanley, has been
importing a vast amount of statuses from Mastodon without anyone’s
consent. –

Imported 1.12 Million Fediverse Posts</a>, by
<a href="https://deadsuperhero.com/">Sean Tilley</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
People react harshly:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can’t emphasize enough how much I would love if all the data centers
containing the code running these things, across every network, just
suddenly exploded. Take it all back to zero, and then put up a digital
wall, like in Cyberpunk 2077 when they built a whole new internet that
isn’t infested with garbage. –

It’s Maven! Who’s Maven?</a>, by

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“Move fast and break things” is shit advice.
</p>
<p>
“Act now and ask for forgiveness later” is shit advice.
</p>
<p>
It breaks all the good will accumulated so far and it’ll take a lifetime
to rebuild.
</p>
<p>
The advice that has been true for generations is: “Ask politely and
respect the answers given”.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So there’s a difference in opinion in the fediverse on whether it’s
important to get consent to use somebody’s public posts for a purpose
they didn’t originally intend it for: adding them to a search engine,
using them as part of algorithmic recommendation systems, “bridging”
them to another social networks, using it to train artificial
intelligence systems, and so on. Some think this is just fine, or that
it’s enough to assume consent and give people the ability to “opt out”
and withdraw consent. Others think that these uses should require
informed, affirmative, “opt in” consent. –

and DeepComputing announce new RISC-V laptop shipping with Ubuntu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of PCs that don’t use x86 chips, Canonical and DeepComputing
today announced a new RISC-V laptop running Ubuntu, available for
pre-order in a few days. It’s the successor to the DC-ROMA, which
shipped last year. Adding to a long list of firsts, the new DC-ROMA
laptop II is the first to feature SpacemiT’s SoC K1 – with its 8-cores
RISC-V CPU running at up to 2.0GHz with 16GB of memory. This
significantly doubled its overall performance and energy efficiency over
the previous generation’s 4-cores SoC running at 1.5GHz. Moreover,
SpacemiT’s SoC K1 is also the world’s first SoC to support RISC-V high
performance computing RVA 22 Profile RVV 1.0 with 256 bit width, and to
have powerful AI capabilities with its customised matrix operation
instruction based on IME Group design principle!  This second-generation
DC-ROMA RISC-V laptop also features an all-metal casing making it more
durable, as well as improving heat dissipation and more on its premium
class look and feel compared to previous generation. ↫ Canonical’s blog
The DC-ROMA II is clearly aimed at developers, as it has what is
essentially a GeekPort on the side of the laptop, to aid in porting and
debugging software. Aside from that and the RISC-V processor, it’s a
rather mid-range kind of device, and no pricing has been published yet
so I’m not sure if this is something I could afford for an OSNews
review. Once the preorders go live in a few days, we’ll know more. If
you’d like to see this RISC-V laptop make an appearance on OSNews, let
me know, and I’ll see what I can do.</p>

id="the-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-architecture-deep-dive-getting-to-know-oryon-and-adreno-x1">The
Qualcomm Snapdragon X architecture deep dive: getting to know Oryon and
Adreno X1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>In the last 8 months Qualcomm has made a lot of interesting claims
for their high-performance Windows-on-Arm SoC – many of which will be
put to the test in the coming weeks. But beyond all the performance
claims and bluster amidst what is shaping up to be a highly competitive
environment for PC CPUs, there’s an even more fundamental question about
the Snapdragon X that we’ve been dying to get to: how does it work?
Ahead of next week’s launch, then, we’re finally getting the answer to
that, as today Qualcomm is releasing their long-awaited architectural
disclosure on the Snapdragon X SoC. This includes not only their new,
custom Arm v8 “Oryon” CPU core, but also technical disclosures on their
Adreno GPU, and the Hexagon NPU that backs their heavily-promoted AI
capabilities. The company has made it clear in the past that the
Snapdragon X is a serious, top-priority effort for the company – that
they’re not just slapping together a Windows SoC from their existing IP
blocks and calling it a day – so there’s a great deal of novel
technology within the SoC. ↫ Ryan Smith at AnandTech I cannot wait until
AnandTech can move beyond diving into information provided by Qualcomm,
and can start doing their own incredibly in-depth benchmarks and
research. Assuming the effort succeeds, the Snapdragon X line will most
likely form the backbone of ARM PCs for years – if not decades – to
come, meaning that when you and I go shopping for a new laptop, this
chip will be the one heavily promoted by stores and outlets. How closely
independent benchmarks line up with Qualcomm’s eight months of promises
and cherry-picked benchmarks will also tell us a lot about how
trustworthy the company will be about the performance of its chips going
forward. In smartphones – where we mostly see Qualcomm today –
performance simply doesn’t matter as much, but when you’re dealing with
laptops, and in the future possibly even desktops, performance suddenly
matters a lot more, and Qualcomm’s claims will be facing a level of
scrutiny and detail I don’t think they’ve ever really had to deal with
before. PC enthusiasts don’t mess around. If the Linux support turns out
to be as solid as Qualcomm claims, and if the performance figures
they’ve been putting out are verified by quality independent reviewers
like the people at AnandTech, I honestly don’t think my next laptop will
be using x86. I just hope weird companies like Chuwi will release a
version of their MiniBook X with one a Qualcomm chip, because I’ll be

id="exclusive-mozilla-reverses-course-re-lists-extensions-it-removed-in-russia">Exclusive:
Mozilla reverses course, re-lists extensions it removed in Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Two days ago, I broke the news that Mozilla removed several Firefox
extensions from the add-on store in Russia, after pressure from Russian
censors. Mozilla provided me with an official statement, which seemed to
highlight that the decision was not final, and it seems I was right –
today, probably helped by the outcry our story caused, Mozilla has
announced it’s reversing the decision. In a statement sent to me via
email, an unnamed Mozilla spokesperson says: In alignment with our
commitment to an open and accessible internet, Mozilla will reinstate
previously restricted listings in Russia. Our initial decision to
temporarily restrict these listings was made while we considered the
regulatory environment in Russia and the potential risk to our community
and staff. As outlined in our Manifesto, Mozilla’s core principles
emphasise the importance of an internet that is a global public
resource, open and accessible to all. Users should be free to customise
and enhance their online experience through add-ons without undue
restrictions. By reinstating these add-ons, we reaffirm our dedication
to: – Openness: Promoting a free and open internet where users can shape
their online experience.– Accessibility: Ensuring that the internet
remains a public resource accessible to everyone, regardless of
geographical location. We remain committed to supporting our users in
Russia and worldwide and will continue to advocate for an open and
accessible internet for all. ↫ Mozilla spokesperson via email I’m glad
Mozilla reversed its decision, because giving in to a dictatorship never
ends well – it starts with a few extensions today, but ends up with the
kind of promotional tours for China that Tim Cook goes on regularly.
Firefox is a browser that lives or dies by its community, and if that
community is unhappy with the course of Mozilla or the decisions it
makes, especially ones that touch on core values and human rights, it’s
not going to end well for them. That being said, this does make me
wonder what would’ve happened if the forum thread that started all this
died in obscurity and never made its way to the media. Would Mozilla
have made the same reversal?</p>

multiple cursors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-13-anvil-editor-and-multiple-cursors">
2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors
</h1>
<p>
I like how the author of the <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil
Editor</a> (an <a href="http://acme.cat-v.org/">Acme</a>-like editor)
explains how to use it and provides a small number of super-short videos
to show it. Here’s a good way to use video in documentation! This is
important because an “ACME-like editor” is pretty alien for people these
days. It relies on three buttons your mouse. The menus are small,
editable windows where you select a word with the mouse and the middle
mouse button to execute it. You can create your own menus by simply
writing them.
</p>
<p>
This is great, but alien.
</p>
<p>
I kept wondering how feasible it would be to add a few key bindings to
allow one to use it without a mouse. Window switching, selection
growing, executing, I keep thinking that it should be possible. That
mandatory three button mouse has kept me away from ACME-like editors.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been experimenting a bit with adding more keyboard bindings. Since
it doesn’t seem to have a git repository, I made
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/anvil.git">my own</a> so I can
keep track of the patches.
</p>
<p>
I plan to force-push with abandon.
</p>
<p>
I try to do a tiny snippet of programming in the mornings or evenings.
Currently I’m looking at my “extending the selection” code and how it
interacts (badly) with multiple cursors. I guess I don’t understand the
attraction of multiple cursors compared to “record a keyboard macro once
and then replay it for the rest of the file, for a fixed number of
times, or as long as I keep pressing a key” (the way standard Emacs
allows me to) compared to alt-clicking a number of times at just the
right spot (I guess my mousing is terrible) to place the cursors and
then do the necessary edits. Whenever something like this comes, I’m
editing data files or something like that so I would have to place
hundreds or thousands of cursors… Only one of these approaches scales. I
must be missing something about multiple cursors.
</p>
<p>
When I asked about it on fedi, people recommended I give
<code>multiple-cursors</code> for Emacs a try. I looked at the
<a href="https://emacsrocks.com/e13.html">Emacs Rocks video for mc</a>
and liked it. Again, this is video documentation well done, essentially
a <em>demo</em>, not a manual.
</p>
<p>
I started using for small things (a handful of lines) where it was
indeed easier to use than keyboard macros or regular expressions because
of the immediate feedback and the ability to undo any damage done and
still continue the operation. Nice!
</p>
<p>
I still ♥️ Emacs!

I did a search on my site for NakedJen.
</p>
<p>
Google thinks I meant “Naked Men.”
</p>
<p>
This is why Google should know I have a blog and it has it indexed, and
if it just looks it would know that question shows how <b>dumb</b> it
is.
</p>
<p>
When I type my mother’s name in, searching on my own blog (again) it
tries to correct the spelling of her name. My own mother’s name.
</p>
<p>
Google started out so smart then they must have lost all the smart
people. Or they got stupid? I don’t know. But there’s so much they could
do to improve their product, it would be sensible to, while they’re
shooting for the fences, do the small things that would give users an
idea that there’s <i>some</i> humanity to the product.

working on a server app to read blogroll source in OPML, and build a
database of other blogrolls that are linked to feeds in the original
blogroll, accessed via the <a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">feed
or html source</a>. It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for
<a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">subscription
lists</a> back in the 00s that it included the <i>htmlUrl</i> attribute,
it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element
in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I’m using a SQL
database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I
thought “no big deal” it’s a variant of a SQL table I’ve now done a
dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I’ve yet to come up with a
way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the
kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity
and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and
JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling
from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if
you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at
runtime. That’s how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then
you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine
how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be
factored. This probably doesn’t make sense to too many people, maybe it
won’t even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I’ve
moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the
time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I’m sure it’s
possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there
are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of
them, which is why I’m taking my break from <i>The Next Product</i> to
do this.</p>

OS switching to the Android Linux kernel and related Android
subsystems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Surprisingly quietly, in the middle of Apple’s WWDC, Google’s
ChromeOS team has made a rather massive announcement that seems to be
staying a bit under the radar. Google is announcing today that it is
replacing many of ChromeOS’ current relatively standard Linux-based
subsystems with the comparable subsystems from Android. To continue
rolling out new Google AI features to users at a faster and even larger
scale, we’ll be embracing portions of the Android stack, like the
Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation
of ChromeOS. We already have a strong history of collaboration,
with Android apps available on ChromeOS and the start of unifying
our Bluetooth stacks as of ChromeOS 122. ↫ Prajakta Gudadhe and
Alexander Kuscher on the Chromium blog The benefits to Google here are
obvious: instead of developing and maintaining two variants of the Linux
kernel and various related subsystems, they now only have to focus on
one, saving money and time. It will also make it easier for both
platforms to benefit from new features and bugfixes, which should
benefit users of both platforms quite a bit. As mentioned in the
snippet, the first major subsystem in ChromeOS to be replaced by its
Android counterpart is Bluetooth. ChromeOS was using the BlueZ Bluetooth
stack, the same one used by most (all?) Linux distributions today, which
was initially developed by Qualcomm, but has now switched over to using
Fluoride, the one from Android. According to Google, Fluoride has a
number of benefits over BlueZ. It runs almost entirely in userspace, as
opposed to BlueZ, where more than 50% of the code resides in the kernel.
In addition, Fluoride is written in Rust, and Google claims it has a
simpler architecture, making it easier to perform testing. Google also
highlights that Fluoride has a far larger userbase – i.e., all Android
users – which also presents a number of benefits. Google performed
internal tests to measure the improvements as a result from switching
ChromeOS from BlueZ to Fluoride, and the test results speak for
themselves – pairing is faster, pairing fails less often, and
reconnecting an already paired device fails less often. With Bluetooth
being a rather problematic technology to use, any improvements to the
user experience are welcome. At the end of Google’s detailed blog post
about the switch to Fluoride, the company notes that it intends for the
project as whole – which is called Project Floss – to be a standalone
open source project, capable of running on any Linux distribution. ↫
Russ Lindsay, Abhishek Pandit-Subedi, Alain Michaud, and Loic Wei Yu
Neng on the chromeOS dev website We aspire to position Project Floss as
a standalone open source project that can reach beyond the walls of
Google’s own operating system in a way where we can maximize the overall
value and agility of the larger Bluetooth ecosystem. We also intend to
support the Linux community as a whole with the goal that Floss can
easily run on most Linux distributions. If Fluoride can indeed deliver
tangible, measurable benefits in Bluetooth performance on Linux
desktops, I have no doubt quite a few distributions will be more than
willing to switch over. Bluetooth is used a lot, and if Fedora, Ubuntu,
Arch, and so on, can improve the Bluetooth experience by switching over,
I’m pretty sure they will, or at least consider doing so.</p>

Qualcomm legal battle seen disrupting AI-powered PC wave</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>The new Windows on ARM Copilot+ PC thing, running on Qualcomm’s
Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips, isn’t even out the door yet, and we’re
already dealing with legal proceedings. But the main conversation among
conference attendees was over how a contract dispute between Arm
Holdings and Qualcomm, which work together to make the chips powering
these new laptops, could abruptly halt the shipment of new PCs that
industry leaders expect will make Microsoft and its partners billions of
dollars. ↫ Max A. Cherney at Reuters The basic gist of the story is as
follows. Qualcomm acquired a company named Nuvia, founded by former
Apple processor engineers, in order to gain new technology to build its
Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips. Nuvia was planning on developing ARM
chips for servers, but after the acquisition, Qualcomm changed their
plans and repurposed their technology for use in laptops – the new X
chips. ARM claims that Nuvia was only granted a license for server use,
and not laptop use. Qualcomm, meanwhile, argued that it has a broad
license to use ARM for pretty much anything, and as such, that any
possible restrictions Nuvia had are irrelevant. While this all sounds
like very rich corporations having a silly legal slapfight, it could
have real consequences. If the legal case goes very, very wrong for
Qualcomm, it could halt the sale of devices powered by the Snapdragon X
chips well before they’re even shipping. I doubt it’ll get that far – it
rarely does, and there’s some big names and big reputations at play here
– but it does highlight the absurdity of how the ARM ecosystem works.
Speaking of the ARM ecosystem, Qualcomm isn’t the only ARM chip makers
dying to break into the PC market. Qualcomm currently has a weird
exclusivity agreement with Microsoft where it’s the only ARM chip
supplier for PCs, but that agreement is running out soon. Another player
that’s ready to storm this market once that happens is MediaTek, who is
also developing a chip geared towards Microsoft’s Copilot+
specifications, with a release target of 2025. Let’s hope MediaTek will
be as forthcoming with Linux support as Qualcomm surprisingly has been,
but I have my sincerest doubt.</p>

Torvalds: extensible scheduler “sched_ext” in Linux 6.11</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>The extensible scheduler “sched_ext” code has proven quite versatile
for opening up better Linux gaming performance, more quickly prototyping
new scheduler changes, Ubuntu/Canonical has been evaluating it for
pursuing a more micro-kernel like design, and many other interesting
approaches with it. Yet it’s remained out of tree but that is now
changing with the upcoming Linux 6.11 cycle. Linus Torvalds as the
benevolent dictator for life “BDFL” of the Linux kernel announced he
intends to merge the sched_ext patches for Linux 6.11 even though there
has been some objections by other kernel developers. Torvalds feels the
sched_ext code is ready enough and provides real value to the mainline
Linux kernel. It’s not worth dragging out sched_ext continuing to be
out-of-tree. ↫ Michael Larabel at Phoronix I haven’t felt the need to
mess around with the Linux scheduler in a long, long time – I have some
vague memories of perhaps well over a decade ago where opting for a
different scheduler could lead to better desktop-focused performance
characteristics, but the details in my brain are so fuzzy that it may
just be a fabricated or confabulated memory.</p>

<p>Microsoft recently announced some big changes to the Recall feature

contained Recall entirely. It’s likely not a coincidence that Microsoft
also quietly pulled the build of the Windows 11 24H2 update that it had
been testing in its Release Preview channel for Windows Insiders. It’s
not unheard of for Microsoft to stop distributing a beta build of
Windows after releasing it, but the Release Preview channel is typically
the last stop for a Windows update before a wider release. ↫ Andrew
Cunningham at Ars Technica The company doesn’t actually mention why the
release was pulled, but the reason is pretty obvious if you connect the
dots. I’m at least glad Microsoft is taking the complaints seriously,
and while I don’t personally think Recall is a good idea, if a user
gives their consent and uses it knowingly and willingly, I don’t see any
problems with it.</p>

<h2 id="celebrating-failure">Celebrating failure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Biographies of great people, interviews with successful entrepreneurs, and podcast episodes with famous creators. The world doesn’t lack celebrations of greatness. It should be inspiring to hear from someone successful, it should motivate you to do more, to work harder, and to strive for greatness. But like many other good things in life, too much of it can be detrimental. You can ingest only so many success stories before starting to feel bad for not being one of them. It’s partly why social media mostly sucks. It’s performative. Everyone is showing the best parts of their lives while the shitty moments are kept private, away from public eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Failure should be shared. Trying and failing at something should be
celebrated. Not because of the failure itself but because that’s the
only way to achieve something worthwhile. Failing is inevitable.
Everyone has to go through it and confront it one way or another. It’s
part of the process and it’s something we should be more upfront and
open about it. And again, it should be celebrated.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone make a podcast with interviews with people who didn’t have
success? To people who tried hard but ultimately failed? I’d love to
listen to those stories.

Rather than try to figure out what they mean, I paste the message into

it for me. I copy the result, paste it into MySQL and I’m back on the

<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
HighGo Software is pleased to announce the first GitHub community
release of wal2mongo v1.0.7, which can be used to replicate PostgreSQL
database changes to an output format that can be directly fed into the
mongo client tool to achieve logical replication between PostgreSQl and
MongoDB. Wal2mongo plugin is useful for a case where PostgreSQL is used
as the main raw data source to collect data from outside world but
MongoDB is used internally for data analytics purposes. Manual data
migration between PostgreSQL and MongoDB poses a lot of potential
problem and having a logical decoding plugin like wal2mongo can help
reduce the data migration complexity between the two databases.

About wal2mongo
</h2>
<p>
wal2mongo is a PostgreSQL logical decoding output plugin designed to
simplify logical replication from PostgreSQL to MongoDB by formatting
the output into a JSON-like format accepted by MongoDB. For detailed
information on how to use it, you can find it
<a href="https://github.com/HighgoSoftware/wal2mongo">here</a>
</p>
<p>
The logical replication application project that can be used with
wal2mongo to achieve a fully automatic logical replication setup with
enhanced control, security and performance in mind. We will continue to
improve the logical decoding performance and enhance wal2mongo
functionalities based on community feedback.

SwiftNavigation
</h1>
<p>
To celebrate that
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10103">RealityKit’s is
coming to MacOS, iOS and iPadOS</a> and is no longer limited to
VisionOS, I am releasing
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a>
for RealityKit.
</p>
<p>
Last year, as I was building a game for VisionPro, I wanted the 3D
characters I placed in the world to navigate the world, go from one
point to another, avoid obstacles and have those 3D characters avoid
each other.
</p>
<p>
Almost every game engine in the world uses the C++ library
<a href="http://recastnav.com">RecastNavigation</a> library to do this -
Unity, Unreal and Godot all use it.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a>
was born: Both a Swift wrapper to the underlying C++ library which
leverages extensively Swift’s C++ interoperability capabilities and it
directly integrates into the RealityKit entity system.
</p>
<p>
This library is magical, you create a
<a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/buildingmesh">navigation
mesh</a> from the world that you capture and then you can
<a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmeshquery">query
it</a> for paths to navigate from one point to another or you can create
a
<a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmesh/makecrowd(maxagents:agentradius:)">crowd
controller</a> that will automatically move your objects.
</p>
<p>
Until I have the time to write full tutorials, your best bet is to look
at the
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigationDemo">example
project</a> that uses it.

id="under-pressure-from-russian-censors-mozilla-removes-anti-censorship-extensions">Under
pressure from Russian censors, Mozilla removes anti-censorship
extensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was pointed to a post on the Mozilla forums, in
which developers of Firefox extensions designed to circumvent Russian
censorship were surprised to find that their extensions were suddenly no
longer available within Russia. The extension developers and other users
in the thread were obviously not amused, and since they had received no
warning or any other form of communication from Mozilla, they were left
in the dark as to what was going on. I did a journalism and contacted
Mozilla directly, and inquired about the situation. Within less than 24
hours Mozilla got back to me with an official statement, attributed to
an unnamed Mozilla spokesperson: Following recent regulatory changes in
Russia, we received persistent requests from Roskomnadzor demanding that
five add-ons be removed from the Mozilla add-on store. After careful
consideration, we’ve temporarily restricted their availability within
Russia. Recognizing the implications of these actions, we are closely
evaluating our next steps while keeping in mind our local community. ↫
Mozilla spokesperson via email I and most people I talked to already
suspected this was the case, and considering Russia is a totalitarian
dictatorship, it’s not particularly surprising it would go after browser
extensions that allow people to circumvent state censorship. Other
totalitarian dictatorships like China employ similar, often far more
sophisticated methods of state control and censorship, too, so it’s
right in line with expectations. I would say that I’m surprised Mozilla
gave in, but at the same time, it’s highly likely resisting would lead
to massive fines and possible arrests of any Mozilla employees or
contributors living in Russia, if any such people exist, and I can
understand a non-profit like Mozilla not having the means to effectively
stand up against the Russian government. That being said, Mozilla’s
official statement seems to imply they’re still in the middle of their
full decision-making process regarding this issue, so other options may
still be on the table, and I think it’s prudent to give Mozilla some
more time to deal with this situation. Regardless, this decision is
affecting real people inside Russia, and I’m sure if you’re using tools
like these inside a totalitarian dictatorship, you’re probably not too
fond of said dictatorship. Losing access to these Firefox extensions
through the official add-store will be a blow to their human rights, so
let’s hope the source code and ‘sideloaded’ versions of these extensions
remain available for them to use instead.</p>

<h2 id="apple-wwdc-2024-the-13-biggest-announcements">Apple WWDC 2024:
the 13 biggest announcements</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote has come to a close —
and the company had a whole lot to share. We got our first look at the
AI features coming to Apple’s devices and some major updates across the
company’s operating systems. If you missed out on watching the keynote
live, we’ve gathered all the biggest announcements that you can check
out below. ↫ Emma Roth at The Verge Most of the stuff Apple announced
aren’t particularly interesting – a lot of catch-up stuff that has
become emblematic of companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft when it
comes to their operating systems. The one thing that did stand out is
Apple’s approach to offloading machine learning requests to the cloud
when they are too difficult to handle on device. They’ve developed a new
way of doing this, using servers with Apple’s own M chips, which is
pretty cool and harkens back the days of the Xserve. In short, these
server are using the same kind of techniques to encrypt and secure data
on iPhones, but now to encrypt and secure the data coming in for
offloaded machine learning requests. The root of trust for Private Cloud
Compute is our compute node: custom-built server hardware that brings
the power and security of Apple silicon to the data center, with the
same hardware security technologies used in iPhone, including the Secure
Enclave and Secure Boot. We paired this hardware with a new operating
system: a hardened subset of the foundations of iOS and macOS tailored
to support Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads while
presenting an extremely narrow attack surface. This allows us to take
advantage of iOS security technologies such as Code
Signing and sandboxing. ↫ Apple’s security research blog Apple also
provided some insight into where its training data is coming from, and
it claims it’s only using licensed data and “publicly available data
collected by our web-crawler”. The words “licensed” and “publicly
available” are doing a lot of heavy lifting here, and I’m not entirely
sure what definitions of those terms Apple is using. There are enough
people out there who feel every piece of data – whether under copyright,
available under an open source license, or whatever – is fair, legal
game for ML training, so who knows what Apple is using based on these
statements alone. From Apple’s presentations yesterday, as well as any
later statements, it’s also not clear when machine learning requests get
offloaded in the first place. Apple states they try to run as much as
possible on-device, and will offload when needed, but the conditions
under which such offloading happens are nebulous and unclear, making it
hard for users to know what’s going to happen when they use Apple’s new
machine learning features.</p>

watching Stan Krute doing all these weird and often beautifully bizarre
ChatGPT images, and realizing they are only being seen by people on
Facebook when there’s this huge world of creative people that don’t or
won’t use FB.
</p>
<p>
Then it occurred to me, I have the perfect place for these images,
outside the facebookiverse, that would showcase them, and be easy to
produce (I don’t want to take on responsibility for big production
overhead myself).
</p>
<p>
I have images I put in the right margin of blog posts on
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Small little bits of
creative color, that may or may not be connected to the story they are
next to. And sometimes connected in non-obvious ways, intended to make
you think.

<p>
Then NakedJen sent me a recent picture of herself that’s perfect for the
right margin. Seen in the right margin of this post.

No promises about when or if they’d be used. You can post them here, as

Repubs are coming uncloaked. Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It’s
the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything.
They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage
on. They don’t know how else to do it. It doesn’t have much to do with
inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It’s deeper than that. We’re
all living a lie, that if we had money we’d be happy. The sad truth is
no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don’t
believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all
that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling
proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the
previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew
who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the
aftermath, and it wasn’t pretty. “All of this has happened before, and
it will all happen again.” We’re at the beginning of the “happen again”
moment. My grandfather told me what to do, but I won’t do it, pretty
sure of that.</p>

Apple trained their models to work with the AppIntents schema (this
powers shortcuts and existing Siri commands), a great way of surfacing
the existing capabilities of apps and extend their reach.
</p>
<p>
While Microsoft could have done this, their equivalent frameworks are
just not widely used - a phenomenon caused in part by slow upgrading
windows users and in part by a void in evangelism for their Windows
platform.

appreciate just how vast the not-developer app ecosystem is.

<h2 id="the-money-conundrum">The money conundrum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I wrote about my dislike of money before on this site. Money and everything related to it is by far the part I enjoy the least about my job. And it’s a non-negligible part of it considering I worked solo my entire life. What’s hard for me is this idea of attaching a monetary value to what I do. I was struggling doing it 13 years ago, when I started my career, I’m struggling with it today and I’m sure it won’t change anytime soon. That’s because work, for me, is not a matter of trading money for a service. It’s a human interaction. And adding money to a human interaction makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I get why it does make sense in a practical sense.
I’m not an idiot. I just don’t understand it at a more deeply personal
level. What drives me is the desire to help people. This is either
directly, with my job or indirectly, with the other things I do online.
And when you’re driven by this desire to help others, money becomes a
painful obstacle. Because I just can’t spend my time helping others and
not earn a living. It’s just not an option. So I have to compromise.
</p>
<p>
I discussed this topic in the past with various people and one of the
feedback I got is to treat work just as a way of earning enough to free
more time that I can then use to help others. That’s a reasonable
suggestion but I just can’t apply it to my life. I don’t know why, I
can’t get into that type of mindset. I’m sure part of this is the good
old impostor syndrome which I’ll have to confront at some point but part
is just the nature of who I am as a person.
</p>
<p>
This is also why I struggle with the idea of monetising my side
projects. It’s why I love the “Pay What You Want” model because it
eliminates the burden of having to put a price on what I do.
</p>
<p>
This constant tension between money on one side and the desire to help
others on the other is also why I live on the edge of constant burnout.
Saying no to people is hard when you know you have the skills necessary
to help them. And it’s why I always end up with way too many projects
going on at the same time and find myself waking up in the middle of the
night thinking about all the things that I have to do and I won’t have
time to do. And it sucks. I know it’s not a healthy way of living but I
have not yet learned how to do things differently.
</p>
<p>
Money sucks. It sucks that we constantly have to keep it in mind. It
sucks that we can’t just ignore it and focus on the things that matter.
Money is also weird. You’d think that the same amount of money would
make the same type of impact in my life but it clearly doesn’t. Every
time someone signs up for my “one a month” membership I’m super happy.
And it’s just 1<span
class="math inline">.<em>A</em><em>c</em><em>t</em><em>u</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>y</em>, <em>i</em><em>t</em>’<em>s</em><em>n</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>n</em>1</span>
because after the various fees I’m left with roughly 70 cents. But those
70 cents have meaning. But 70 extra cents on a client invoice is a
rounding error. I don’t even care. Hell, earning 2000$ doesn’t have the
same effect from a personal standpoint as getting one extra subscriber
for 1$ a month. Human psychology is fascinating.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Speaking of one-a-month members, I recently tweaked my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">supporters page</a>
because I hated the idea of not having a place to acknowledge those
people who were kind enough to support what I do at some point but are
no longer active subscribers. Just removing them from the list didn’t
feel right so I added an extra section for past members.
</p>
<p>
The internet would really benefit from having a native way to let people
support each other. It’s great that services like
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> exist but also part
of me would love to have all these functionalities integrated at the
browser level somehow. I’m sure someone is reading this and screaming
“Crypto! Blockchain!” but I doubt that’s a solution.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I’m curious to know if you have thoughts on this whole money
thing so if you do, please get in touch.

id="tuxedo-showcases-prototype-linux-laptop-with-snapdragon-x-elite">Tuxedo
showcases prototype Linux laptop with Snapdragon X Elite</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve long been waiting for a powerful ARM laptop that can run Linux
comfortably, and it seems that with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite
SoC, that’s finally going to happen. We talked earlier about how for
once, Qualcomm is taking Linux support for their new laptop-focused
processors very seriously, and that promise and associated effort is
paying dividend. Tuxedo, a popular Linux OEM from Germany, has announced
it’s working on a laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, and they
showed off a working prototype at Computex in Taiwan. We have been
working with a first prototype for some time, which will soon be
replaced by a second one. The development is still in the alpha stage,
as some drivers are still missing, which will hopefully be available
with the next two kernel versions. It is quite conceivable that an ARM
notebook from TUXEDO will be under your Christmas tree in 2024. However,
there are still too many pieces of the hardware, software and delivery
capability puzzle missing to even begin to set a release date. TUXEDO
for ARM will come, but we don’t yet know exactly when. ↫ Tuxedo’s
website Their timeline of more Qualcomm drivers making it into the next
two kernel versions lines up with Qualcomm’s own timeline, so it seems
we’re mostly just waiting for them to finish their Linux drivers and add
them to the kernel. This is quite exciting, and a much better option for
Linux users than buying a Windows version of an X Elite or Pro laptop
and hoping for the best.</p>

id="netbsd-10-with-disk-encryption-on-uefi-and-netbsd-10-on-the-pinebook-pro">NetBSD
10 with disk encryption on UEFI, and NetBSD 10 on the Pinebook Pro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetBSD 10 was released recently, so a lot of people are experimenting
with it and writing down their thoughts. I’ve got two of those for you
today, to help you in case you, too, want to install NetBSD 10 and play
around with, or just use, it. First, what if you want to install NetBSD
10 on a UEFI system, but with full disk encryption in case your device
gets stolen? It turns out there are countless guides for installing with
full-disk encryption on MBR-based systems, but once you use UEFI – as
you should be – things get a lot more complicated. The NetBSD installer
is apparently rather basic, and a better solution is to drop to a shell
and install NetBSD that way instead, and even then, full disk encryption
with UEFI is actually not possible, as it seems the root file system –
where the operating system itself resides – cannot be encrypted. The
restriction is in the root file-system. It needs to be in plain-text and
in a regular partition. It seems to me that rootfs in CGD or LVM is not
well supported. ↫ vsis.online This seems like something the NetBSD team
may need to take a look at, since full disk encryption should be an easy
option to choose, even, or especially in 2024, on UEFI systems. Such
encryption is easily achieved on Linux or Windows systems, and it seems
odd to me that NetBSD is lagging behind a bit here. In the meantime, the
linked guide will be a good jumping-off point for those of you
interested in going a similar route. The second article I want to
highlight concerns NetBSD 10 on the Pinebook Pro, the inexpensive ARM
laptop that normally ships with Linux. It turns out there’s a NetBSD 10
image for this device, so installation is quite a bit more
straightforward than the more exotic setup I mentioned earlier. It seems
most of the hardware works quite well out of the box, with the inly
exception being the on-board Wi-Fi, which the author addressed with a
USB W-Fi dongle. Other than that, NetBSD is running well on the Pinebook
Pro for the author, which is great to read since that makes this cheap
device a great starting point for people interested in running
NetBSD.</p>

<h2 id="void-linux-on-zfs">Void Linux on ZFS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last night, I ran through the ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for
Void and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD
plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea
of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box,
so the Void Handbook itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation
before its own (a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a
ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we’ll be
following throughout this post. ↫ Juno Takano There’s a ton of good
stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers
Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy
style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily
underappreciated – it gets a lot of mentions in the right places – but I
do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a
perfect fit but who don’t yet know about it. So, time for a very short
introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very
user-friendly package manager that’s an absolute joy to use. Unlike many
other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are
vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you’ll be hard-pressed
to be asking for some piece of software that isn’t packaged. Void
eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no
issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line
with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void
also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the “real” Void Linux is
the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu.
The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it’s a
self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux
kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be
launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier,
especially for systems that don’t over ZFS as an option during
installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that’s what the linked
post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation.
It’s a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.</p>

MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it
is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and
dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without
running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching
how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode
compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned
through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a
specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for
“filling in the blanks” when executing code to understand what the code
should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64
assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly
in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to
launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach
a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing.
Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process
as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the
virtualization firmware. ↫ Nicholas Starke This is an old post – from
late 2022 – but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS
doesn’t change very much from year to year, it’s still mostly
relevant.</p>

Had another crap night’s sleep BUT as I was lying there at 4:30am with

something running along the underside of the surface. Not the first time
I’ve thought I felt something, but the first time I’m sure I did. It was
wild the emotional reaction I had, too – just suddenly filled with love

<h2 id="ldap2pg-6.1-postgres-16-unprivileged-hooks-and-more">ldap2pg
6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em>
</p>
<p>
Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France
since 2005.
</p>
<p>
Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers
the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for
PostgreSQL. Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in
<code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure
roles from your enterprise directory.
</p>
<p>
Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1. This version
brings support for PostgreSQL 16 and its new unprivileged administration
or roles. Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make
this a practical and stable version. Follow the
<a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation
to install</a> this new version.
</p>
<h3>
Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16
</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to
delegating the administration of roles to an unprivileged user. This
change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security and was not consistent with the SQL
standard. Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de
facto grant himself rights he does not have.
</p>
<p>
Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL
up to version 15. ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code>
option on PostgreSQL 16, without superuser privileges.
</p>
<h3>
Configurability
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities. You can now write the
environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file or in the ldap2pg working directory.
</p>
<p>
In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working
directory of the command. This parameter determines the search for the
<code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.
</p>
<p>
Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument: the connection
string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised. This connection
string can be in URL format or in key=value format.
</p>
<h3>
Compatibility
</h3>
<p>
ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after
connection to the LDAP directory. This operation is an extension of the
LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere. Removing this command
removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.
</p>
<p>
The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by
a space. If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this
client-side HA implementation.
</p>
<p>
LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol, only for ASCII characters. ldap2pg
6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.
</p>
<h3>
Execution hooks
</h3>
<p>
A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg : the
definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after
the creation of a role. For example, to create a schema specific to a
new user. The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code>
and <code>after_create</code> parameters. These requests can receive
dynamic values from the LDAP search.
</p>
<h3>
Continue on error
</h3>
<p>
Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing. For
example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving
up.
</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn’t
shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel,
then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling
and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0,
because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There’s a
slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me
for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what
PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ↫ David Anderson What a
great read. Just great.</p>

terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI
training</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that
they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some
frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming
rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the
apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the
apps, without agreeing to the terms. ↫ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course
users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language,
locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms
is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers
certainly aren’t going to be particularly happy about. I’ve never worked
an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I’m assuming
employees aren’t allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe
or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash,
Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim
ownership over anyone’s work, and that it’s not going to train its ML
models on customers’ work either. The company states that to train its
Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it,
as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth,
it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which
is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI
or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly
licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from
rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that’s exactly
what they’re doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just
how – rightfully – weary people are of machine learning, and how their
works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.</p>

<h2 id="wikipedia-vs-chatgpt">Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I started replying to a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post
by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character
limit, so I moved my act over here. </i>
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It often only represents a story from one point of view.
</p>
<p>
So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.
</p>
<p>
Same with the story of RSS. I’m sure you know the story they tell, but
there’s a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got
together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and Motley Fool, and eventually
brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard
supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media
and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the
tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do
that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you’d get the idea that the
bigco’s heroically fought back against what exactly it’s not clear.
</p>
<p>
I can’t contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so
your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well
it’s not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it
on my blog (as I’m doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and
fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is.
(Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)
</p>
<p>
Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things
other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name
for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT
made a mistake like that people would be howling. I’m sure Wikipedia is
filled with junk like that. Why wouldn’t it be.
</p>
<p>
And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all
other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while
other sources don’t.
</p>
<p>
But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in
advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the
open web. I don’t know why it’s better at finding stuff, and also
understanding my queries even though they’re not rigorously specified,
my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way
I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a
weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able
to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.
</p>
<p>
It’s also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would
work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out
prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which
of course they are being.
</p>
<p>
Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that’s a big difference
between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very
impatient with them and move on.
</p>
<p>
Also, I’m not here to debate. I don’t like online debates. <span

have a Mac Mini that keeps running out of space on its internal drive.
It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me
find the big stuff. I don’t know when this app came to be, but it’s very
helpful. In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for
all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device
that’s ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems).
I’m sure there’s a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on
the 16TB external drive, but I sure don’t know how to do it nor do I
want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript,
CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a
lot longer than this Mac’s has. I desperately want to move my act to
Linux and reclaim all the memory I’m using to store stuff about the Mac,
which isn’t really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a
Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that’s my revenge,
and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with
what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would
make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a>
money, so I hedged. I figured at least they’d make me rich while
completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My
inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen
Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running
and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as
usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

sharpest pens in technical writing, I set aside some time to read
through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little

<p>I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who

This morning I had to cook my French toast in canola oil instead of
butter because I forgot we were out of the latter until I was already
too far in to back out. It actually came out better than I expected but
I’m still disappointed 😢

<h2 id="lca-software-exit-the-matrix">LCA software: exit the matrix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life
cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a
product’s life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each
stage on the environment (LCIA). There are a few pieces of LCA software
to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and
Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they’re expensive. But
there’s a free and open source alternative: Brightway.</p>
