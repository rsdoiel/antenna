Imho they do not. Two rules apply.

the <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way</a> is
better rule a little further down the page. I’ve seen this happen twice
where people say they abide by the RFSM but then do exactly the opposite
of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also
come up with something more humble than the name you’ve chosen. We’ve
been down this path too. The only way it ends is in tears. Meanwhile

<p>Now that I’m publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in
commercial podcast clients, I’m learning for the first time how they
work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they
discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So
when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that
would have worked if I hadn’t made a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601">mistake</a> in
GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up
first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This
so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say “Hey readers
dump your cache now, let’s start over, because I fcuked up.” It wouldn’t
have mattered anyway, I’m sure none of them would listen, right?</p>

I’ve got something for you. Lately I’ve been getting a lot of joy from
life’s small moments; like texting an old friend, seeing a cool bug, or
a watching the cardinals zip through my backyard. To nudge my brain
towards absorbing more of these mundane pleasures, I built a little

Mundango is a game about finding life’s normal things. Each day you get
a new game of moments to capture and enjoy. It’s up to you how you play.
You can play it like Pokémon Go and try to catch ’em all or you can
visit the board at the end of the day for a bit of reflection. Me? I
plunk on it when I’ve got a few spare minutes throughout the day.

I started to write the code to hook up my linkblogger to Threads, but it
led me to the same website with all my broken Facebook apps, the ones
that stopped working when they shut down the API after the 2016
election. A reminder that this is still Facebook. And while I don’t
blame them for shutting down the APIs, the whole experience left a
really bad feeling.
</p>
<p>
So I backed out of the project to give it some more thought. Do I really
want to go down this road?

And of course I had the cute little kitten illustrate.

A cute little kitten is sitting at a desk with a laptop, preparing to
write an app. The laptop screen shows code for the Threads API from
Meta. The kitten has a surprised and concerned expression as she looks
at the developer site on another screen, which shows a Facebook logo and
reminds her of the events of 2016. In the background, a calendar shows
the year 2024. The scene is set in a cozy room with soft lighting and a
few toys scattered around, giving it a homely feel.

So I think my Plex Media Server is basically kaput. The computer got
unplugged somehow, and when I tried rebooting it, the unattended
upgrades have broken the Linux install to the point that not even
“recovery mode” works any more. I thought Linux Mint was supposed to be
kind of idiot-proof but clearly not, lol. Next time I think I’ll try
Debian Stable… because clearly what I need is something
<strong>stable</strong>! Geez.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I cancelled my Spotify subscription a few months ago so I guess
I’m resorting to YouTube Music now. The experience of using this instead
of Plexamp will surely boot my arse into gear to re-setup the Plex
server sooner rather than later 😐

<h2 id="the-exectos-operating-system">The ExectOS operating system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>ExectOS is a preemptive, reentrant multitasking operating system that
implements the XT architecture which derives from NT architecture. It is
modular, and consists of two main layers: microkernel and user modes.
Its’ kernel mode has full access to the hardware and system resources
and runs code in a protected memory area. It consists of executive
services, which is itself made up on many modules that do specific
tasks, a kernel and drivers. Unlike the NT, system does not feature a
separate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) between the physical hardware
and the rest of the OS. Instead, XT architecture integrates a hardware
specific code with the kernel. The user mode is made up of subsystems
and it has been designed to run applications written for many different
types of operating systems. This allows us to implement any environment
subsystem to support applications that are strictly written to the
corresponding standard (eg. DOS, or POSIX). Thanks to that ExectOS will
allow to run existing software, including Win32 applications. ↫ ExectOS
website What ExectOS seems to be is an implementation very close to what
Windows NT originally was – implementing the theory of Windows NT, not
the reality. It’s clearly still in very early development, but in
theory, I really like the idea of what they’re trying to achieve here.
Windows NT is, after all, in and of itself not a bad concept – it’s just
been tarred and feathered by decades of mismanagement from Microsoft.
Implementing something that closely resembles the original, minimalist
theories behind NT could lead to an interesting operating system for
sure. ExectOS is open source, contains its own boot loader, only runs on
EFI, and installation on real hardware, while technically possible, is
discouraged.</p>

<h2 id="the-x-windowing-system-turns-40-today">The X Windowing System
turns 40 today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today just so happens to be the 40th birthday of X, the venerable
windowing system that’s on its way out, at least in the Linux world.
From the original announcement by Robert W. Scheifler: I’ve spent the
last couple weeks writing a window system for the VS100. I stole a fair
amount of code from W, surrounded it with an asynchronous rather than a
synchronous interface, and called it X. Overall performance appears to
be about twice that of W. The code seems fairly solid at this point,
although there are still some deficiencies to be fixed up. We at LCS
have stopped using W, and are now actively building applications on X.
Anyone else using W should seriously consider switching. This is not the
ultimate window system, but I believe it is a good starting point for
experimentation. Right at the moment there is a CLU (and an Argus)
interface to X; a C interface is in the works. The three existing
applications are a text editor (TED), an Argus I/O interface, and a
primitive window manager. There is no documentation yet; anyone crazy
enough to volunteer? I may get around to it eventually. ↫ Robert W.
Scheifler Reading this announcement email made me wonder if way back
then, in 1984, the year of my birth, there were also people poo-pooing
this new thing called “X” for not having all the features W had. There
must’ve people posting angry messages on various BBS servers about how X
is dumb and useless since it doesn’t have their feature in W that allows
them to use an acoustic modem to send a signal over their internal
telephone system by slapping their terminal in just the right spot to
activate their Betamax that’s hotwired into the telephone system. I
mean, W was only about a year old at the time, so probably not, but
there must’ve been a lot of complaining and whining about this
newfangled X thing, and now, 40 years later, long after it has outgrown
its usefulness, we’re again dealing with people so hell-bent on keeping
an outdated system running but hoping – nay, demanding – others to do
the actual work of maintaining it. X served its purpose. It took way too
long, but we’ve moved on. Virtually every new Linux user since roughly
12-24 months ago will most likely never use X, and never even know what
it was. They’re using a more modern, more stable, more performant, more
secure, and better maintained system, leading to a better user
experience, and that’s something we should all agree on is a good
thing.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I finished listening to the audio version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sandel&quot;&gt;Michael Sandel&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/publications/what-money-cant-buy-moral-limits-markets&quot;&gt;What Money Can’t Buy&lt;/a&gt;” a few days ago. Great book, I hated every second of it. The topic is very interesting but most of the concepts and examples were infuriating. The book touches on pretty much everything I hate about the current state of the world when it comes to its relationship with money and advertising. Still, was good company on a few long road trips and I love when the audiobooks are narrated by the author. Thanks for suggesting the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnjago.com&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;

<p>Technical note. I made a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/datesoff.png">mistake</a>
in converting local time to GMT in the code that builds the feed. My
times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of
three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are
now six. I bet all the
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298">other</a>
systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the
creation date of the item, and they changed. Oh well. At least the
<a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">RSS version</a> only has
three items. I think I should change how the guid works.</p>

Good news, I did, it was fun, the result is awesome, and it was quick.

Bad news, the immediate consequence of this was “well there are a lot of

<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or
journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the
music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that
the music industry had concocted. They didn’t give a shit about the
users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection
between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users.
We supposedly didn’t have any.
</p>
<p>
I’m like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman">Emmett
Chapman</a>, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick">musicial
instrument</a> for himself and others to use. That’s what I do with
software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the
music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would
have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there’s been plenty of
time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had
was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love
was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the
skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">technology</a>
existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out.
For that he would say Every day is Father’s Day. That may be my greatest
accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought
(and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our
uncle Ken, on my mother’s side, and said he would have shit his pants
over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager
reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine.
The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I’m absolutely
sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my
great uncle
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">Arno</a> who was a
pioneer of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettlekasten</a>
would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a
shorter name). People’s first reaction is that by creating art with
ChatGPT I’m stealing. Bollocks. I’m creating. I’m not even going to
validate that with a rebuttal. I am proving it with the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patriotic+Kitten%22">Patriotic
Kitten</a> thread, the next of which I will now entertain you with.

<h2 id="the-feedland-stack">The FeedLand stack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is
that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over
at any level, you can, and today I’m doing exactly that. But first
here’s the stack:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
At the lowest level is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple">reallysimple
package</a>, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript
object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the
differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the
source <a href="https://source.scripting.com/">namespace</a> are
included, where they are present.
</li>
<li>
Above that level is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase">feedlanddatabase
package</a>, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL
database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds,
subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a
river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I’m
going to start building today.
</li>
<li>
Next level up is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland">feedland package</a>,
which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff
that the FeedLand client needs.
</li>
<li>
And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the
browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the
rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST
interface happens here.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In an
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207">application</a>
I’m working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and
I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that’s already there. The
advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage
the data structures. So that’s what I’m doing. Wish me luck.

announces third-party RISC-V mainboard for the Framework 13 laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework, the company making modular, upgradeable, and repairable
laptops, and DeepComputing, the same company that’s making the DC ROMA
II RISC-V laptop we talked about last week, have announced something
incredibly cool: a brand new RISC-V mainboard that fits right into
existing Framework 13 laptops. Sporting a RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC,
this groundbreaking Mainboard was independently designed and developed
by DeepComputing. It’s the main component of the very first RISC-V
laptop to run Canonical’s Ubuntu Desktop and Server, and the Fedora
Desktop OS and represents the first independently developed Mainboard
for a Framework Laptop. ↫ The DeepComputing website For a company that
was predicted to fail by a popular Apple spokesperson, it seems
Framework is doing remarkably well. This new mainboard is the first one
not made by Framework itself, and is the clearest validation yet of the
concept put into the market by the Framework team. I can’t recall the
last time you could buy a laptop powered by one architecture, and then
upgrade to an entirely different architecture down the line, just by
replacing the mainboard. The news of this RISC-V mainboard has made me
dream of other possibilities – like someone crazy enough to design, I
don’t know, a POWER10 or POWER11 mainboard? Entirely impossible and
unlikely due to heat constraints, but one may dream, right?</p>

id="update-on-newton-the-wayland-native-accessibility-project">Update on
Newton, the Wayland-native accessibility project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s incredibly good news for people who use accessibility tools
on Linux, but who were facing serious, gamebreaking problems when trying
to use Wayland. Matt Campbell, of the GNOME accessibility team, has been
hard at work on an entirely new accessibility architecture for modern
free desktops, and he’s got some impressive results to show for it
already. I’ve now implemented enough of the new architecture that Orca
is basically usable on Wayland with some real GTK 4 apps, including
Nautilus, Text Editor, Podcasts, and the Fractal client for Matrix. Orca
keyboard commands and keyboard learn mode work, with either Caps Lock or
Insert as the Orca modifier. Mouse review also works more or less. Flat
review is also working. The Orca command to left-click the current flat
review item works for standard GTK 4 widgets. ↫ Matt Campbell One of the
major goals of the project was to enable such accessibility support for
Flatpak applications without having to pass an exception for the AT-SPI
bus. what this means is that the new accessibility architecture can run
as part of a Flatpak application without having to break out of their
sandbox, which is obviously a hugely important feature to implement.
There’s still a lot of work to be done, though. Something like the GNOME
shell doesn’t yet support Newton, of course, so that’s still using the
older, much slower AT-SPI bus. Wayland also doesn’t support mouse
synthesizing yet, things like font, size, style, and colour aren’t
exposed yet, and there’s a many more limitations due to this being such
a new project. The project also isn’t trying to be GNOME-specific;
Campbell wants to work with the other desktops to eventually end up with
an accessibility architecture that is truly cross-desktop. The blog post
further goes into great detail about implementation details, current and
possible future shortcomings, and a lot more.</p>

<p>I’m highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a
quick look indicates that it’s a fairly large project. All I want to do
is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong
time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a
thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There’s
no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I’m going to
have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple
Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. <span

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6.1-released">KDE Plasma 6.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>After the very successful release of KDE Plasma 6.0, which moved the
entire desktop environment and most of its applications over to Qt 6,
fixed a whole slow of bugs, and streamlined the entire KDE desktop and
its applications, it’s now time for KDE Plasma 6.1, where we’re going to
see a much stronger focus on new features. While it’s merely a point
release, it’s still a big one. The tentpole new feature of Plasma 6.1 is
access to remote Plasma desktops. You can go into Settings and log into
any Plasma desktop, which is built entirely and directly into KDE’s own
Wayland compositor, avoiding the use of third party applications of
hacky extensions to X.org. Having such remote access built right into
the desktop environment and its compositor itself is a much cleaner
implementation than in the before time with X. Another feature that
worked just fine under X but was still missing from KDE Plasma on
Wayland is something they now call “persistent applications” –
basically, KDE will now remember which windows you had open when you
closed KDE or shut down your computer, and open them back up right where
you left off when you log back in. It’s one of those things that got
lost in the transition to Wayland, and having it back is really, really
welcome. Speaking of Wayland, KDE Plasma 6.1 also introduces two major
new rendering features. Explicit sync removes flickering and glitches
most commonly seen on NVIDIA hardware, while triple buffering provides
smoother animations and screen rendering. There’s more here, too, such
as a completely reworked edit desktop view, support for controlling
keyboard LED backlighting traditionally found in gaming laptops, and
more. KDE Plasma 6.1 will find its way to your distribution of choice
soon enough, but of course, you can compile and install it yourself,
too.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-of-dr-dos">The history of DR-DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve always found the world of DOS versions and variants to be
confusing, since most of it took place when I was very young (I’m from
1984) so I wasn’t paying much attention to computing quite yet, other
than playing DOS games. One of the variants of DOS I never quite
understood where it was from until much, much later, was DR-DOS. To this
day, I pronounce this as “Doctor DOS”. If you’re also a little unclear
on what, exactly, DR-DOS was, Bradford Morgan White has an excellent
article detailing the origins and history of DR-DOS, making it very easy
to get up to speed and expand your knowledge on DOS, which is surely a
very marketable skill in the days of Electron and Electron for
Developers. DR DOS was a great product. It was superior to other DOS
versions in many ways, and it is certainly possible that it could have
been more successful were it not for Microsoft Windows having been so
wildly successful. Starting with Windows 95, the majority of computer
users simply didn’t much care about which DOS loaded Windows so long as
it worked. There’s quite a bit of lore regarding legal battles and
copyrights surrounding CP/M and DOS involving Microsoft and Digital
Research. This has been covered in previous articles to some extent, but
I am not really certain how much would have changed had Microsoft and
Digital Research got on. Gates and Kildall had been quite friendly at
one point, and we know that the two mutually chose not to work together
due to differences in business practices and beliefs. Kildall chose to
be quite a bit more friendly and less competitive while Gates very much
chose to be competitive and at times a bit ruthless. Additionally,
Kildall sold DRI rather than continue the fight, and DRI had never
really attempted to combine DR DOS with GEM as a cohesive product to
fight Windows before Windows became the ultimate ruler of the OS market
following Windows 3.1’s release. Still, it was an absolutely brilliant
product and part of me will always feel that it ought to have won. ↫
Bradford Morgan White I can definitely imagine an alternative timeline
in which Digital Research managed to combine DR-DOS with GEM in a more
attractive way, stealing Microsoft’s thunder before Gates’ balls got
rolling properly with Windows 3.x. It’s one of the many, many what-ifs
in this sector, but not one you often hear or read about.</p>

id="adobes-hidden-cancellation-fee-is-unlawful-ftc-suit-says">Adobe’s
hidden cancellation fee is unlawful, FTC suit says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>To lock subscribers into recurring monthly payments, Adobe would
typically pre-select by default its most popular “annual paid monthly”
plan, the FTC alleged. That subscription option locked users into an
annual plan despite paying month to month. If they canceled after a
two-week period, they’d owe Adobe an early termination fee (ETF) that
costs 50 percent of their remaining annual subscription. The “material
terms” of this fee are hidden during enrollment, the FTC claimed, only
appearing in “disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that
most consumers never see.” ↫ Ashley Belanger at Ars Technica There’s a
sucker for every corporation, but I highly doubt there’s anyone out
there who would consider this a fair business practice. This is so
obviously designed to hide costs during sign-up, and then unveil them
when the user considers quitting. If this is deemed legal or allowed,
you can expect everyone to jump on this bandwagon to scam users out of
their money. It goes further than this, though. According to the FTC,
Adobe knew this practice was shady, but continued it anyway because
altering it would negatively affect the bottom line. The FTC is actually
targeting two Adobe executives directly, which is always nice to hear –
it’s usually management that pushes such illegal practices through,
leaving the lower ranks little choice but to comply or lose their job.
Stuff like this is exactly why confidence in the major technology
companies is at an all-time low.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>The crew aboard the International Space Station captured this image
of Galveston, Texas, the birthplace of Juneteenth, as the station
orbited 224 miles above on Nov. 23, 2011. In the early 1800s, slavers
periodically used Galveston Island as an outpost for operations. By
1860, about one-third of Galveston’s population lived under the
oppression of chattel slavery. Even […]</p>

<h2 id="cinnamon-6.2-released">Cinnamon 6.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cinnamon, the popular GTK desktop environment developed by the Linux
Mint project, pushed out Cinnamon 6.2 today, which will serve as the
default desktop for Linux Mint 22. It’s a relatively minor release, but
it does contain a major new feature which is actually quite welcome: a
new GTK frontend for GNOME Online Accounts, part of the XApp project.
This makes it possible to use the excellent GNOME Online Accounts
framework, without having to resort to a GNOME application – and will
come in very handy on other GTK desktops, too, like Xfce. The remainder
of the changes consist of a slew of bugfixes, small new features, and
nips and tucks here and there. Wayland support is still an in-progress
effort for Cinnamon, so you’ll be stuck with X for now.</p>

<p>Less than a month after 3.5.0, IceWM is already shipping version
3.6.0. Once again not a major, earth-shattering release, it does contain
at least one really cool feature that I think it pretty nifty: if you
double-click on a window border, it will maximise just that side of the
window. Pretty neat. For the rest, it’s small changes and bug fixes for
this venerable window manager.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems that if you want to steer clear from having Facebook use
your Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. data for machine learning
training, you might want to consider moving to the European Union. Meta
has apparently paused plans to process mounds of user data to bring new
AI experiences to Europe. The decision comes after data regulators
rebuffed the tech giant’s claims that it had “legitimate interests” in
processing European Union- and European Economic Area (EEA)-based
Facebook and Instagram users’ data—including personal posts and
pictures—to train future AI tools. ↫ Ashley Belanger These are just the
opening salvos of the legal war that’s brewing here, so who knows how
it’s going to turn out. For now, though, European Union Facebook users
are safe from Facebook’s machine learning training.</p>

project doesn’t seem to really publish any changelogs or release notes,
so it’s difficult to figure out what, exactly, is going on at the
moment. The roadmap indicates they’ve already got a solid base going to
work from, such as mlibc, bash, GCC/G++, X and an X window manager, and
more – with things like Wayland, networking, and more on the
roadmap.</p>

id="microsoft-starts-beating-the-windows-11-pr-drum-in-face-of-reluctant-windows-10-users">Microsoft
starts beating the Windows 11 PR drum in face of reluctant Windows 10
users</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>I have a feeling Microsoft is really starting to feel some pressure
about its plans to abandon Windows 10 next year. Data shows that 70% of
Windows users are still using Windows 10, and this percentage has proven
to be remarkably resilient, making it very likely that hundreds of
millions of Windows users will be out of regular, mainstream support and
security patches next year. It seems Microsoft is, therefore, turning up
the PR campaign, this time by publishing a blog post about myths and
misconceptions about Windows 11. The kind of supposed myths and
misconceptions Microsoft details are exactly the kind of stuff
corporations with large deployments worry about at night. For instance,
Microsoft repeatedly bangs the drum on application compatibility,
stating that despite the change in number – 10 to 11 – Windows 11 is
built on the same base as its predecessor, and as such, touts 99.7%
application compatibility. Furthermore, Microsoft adds that if
businesses to suffer from an incompatibility, they can use something
call App Assure – which I will intentionally mispronounce until the day
I die because I’m apparently a child – to fix any issues. Apparently,
the visual changes to the user interface in Windows 11 are also a cause
of concern for businesses, as Microsoft dedicated an entire entry to
this, citing a study that the visual changes do not negatively impact
productivity. The blog post then goes on to explain how the changes are
actually really great and enhance productivity – you know, the usual PR
speak. There’s more in the blog post, and I have a feeling we’ll be
seeing more and more of this kind of PR offensive as the cut-off date
for Windows 10 support nears. Windows 10 users will probably also see
more and more Windows 11 ads when using their computers, too, urging
them to upgrade even when they very well cannot because of missing TPMs
or unsupported processors. I don’t think any of these things will work
to bring that 70% number down much over the next 12 months, and that’s a
big problem for Microsoft. I’m not going to make any predictions, but I
wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft will simply be forced by, well,
reality to extend the official support for Windows 10 well beyond 2025.
Especially with all the recent investigations into Microsoft’s shoddy
internal security culture, there’s just no way they can cut 70% of their
users off from security updates and patches.</p>

id="mobile-comms-via-satellite-for-backcountry-and-maritime-safety">Mobile
comms via satellite for backcountry and maritime safety</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Stranded on a desert island; lost in the forest; stuck in the snow;
injured and unable to get back to civilization. Human beings have used
their ingenuity for millennia to try to signal for rescue. there’s been
a progression of technological innovations: smoke signals, mirrors, a
loud whistle, a portable radio, a mobile phone. With each invention,
it’s been possible to venture a little farther from populated areas and
still have peace of mind about being able to call for help. But once you
get past the range of a terrestrial radio tower, whether it’s into the
wilderness or out at sea, it starts to get more complicated and
expensive to be able to call for rescue. In the next year or so, it’s
going to become a lot simpler and less expensive. Probably enough to
become ubiquitous. Hardware infrastructure is already in place, and the
relevant software and service support is rolling out now. It’s been
possible for decades for adventurers to keep in contact via satellite.
The first commercial maritime satellite communications was launched in
1976. Globalstar and Iridium launched in the late 90s and drove down the
device size and service cost of satellite phones. However, the service
was a lot more expensive than cellular phone service, and not enough
people were willing to pay for remote comms to be able to overcome the
massive infrastructure costs, and both companies went bankrupt. Their
investors lost their money, but the satellites still worked, so once the
bankruptcies were hashed out they fulfilled their promise, as least
technologically. On a parallel track, in the late 1980s International
Cospas-Sarsat Programme was set up to develop a system for satellite
aided search and rescue system that detects and locates emergency
beacons activated by aircraft, ships and people engaged in recreational
activities in remote areas, and then sends these distress alerts to
search-and-rescue (SAR) authorities. Many types of beacons are
available, and nowadays they send exact GPS coordinates along with the
call for rescue. In the 2010s, the Satellite Emergency Notification
Device or SEND device was brought to market. These are portable beacons
that connect to the Globalstar and Iridium networks and allow people in
remote areas not only to call for help in emergencies, but also to
communicate via text messaging. Currently the two most popular SEND
devices are the Garmin inReach Mini 2 and the Spot X. These devices cost
$400 and $250 USD respectively, and require monthly service fees of
$12-40. For someone undertaking a long and dangerous expedition into the
backcountry, these are very reasonable costs, especially for someone who
does it often. But for most people, it’s just not practical to pay for
and carry a device like that “just in case.” In 2022, the iPhone 14
included a feature that was the first step in taking satellite-based
communication into the mainstream. It allows iPhone users to share their
location via Find My feature with new radio hardware that connects to
the Globalstar service. So if you’re out adventuring, your friends can
keep track of where you are. And if there’s an emergency, you can make
an emergency SOS. It’s not just a generic Mayday: you can text specific
details about your emergency and it will be transmitted to the local
authorities. You can also choose to notify your personal emergency
contacts. Last week, at WWDC, Apple announced the next stage: in iOS 18,
iMessage users will be able to send text messages over satellite, using
the same Globalstar network as its SOS features. Initially at least,
this feature is expected to be free. With this expansion, iPhone users
will have the basic functionality of a SPOT or inReach device, without
special hardware or a monthly fee. SpaceX’s Starlink, which first
offered service in 2021, has much higher bandwidth and lower latency
than the Globalstar and Iridium networks. Starlink’s current offering
requires a dinner plate sized antenna and conventional networking
hardware to enable high bandwidth mobile internet. It’s great for a
vehicle, but impractical for a backpacker. However, SpaceX has announced
2nd generation satellites that can connect to 1900MHz spectrum mobile
phone radios, and T-Mobile has announced that it will be enabling the
service for its customers in late 2024, and Apple, Google, and Samsung
devices are confirmed to be supported. Initially, like Apple’s service,
this will be restricted to text messaging and other low-bandwidth
applications. Phone calls and higher bandwidth internet connectivity are
promised in 2025. The other two big US carriers, AT&amp;T and Verizon,
have announced they will be partnering with a competing service, AST
SpaceMobile, but it’s unlikely those plans will come to fruition very
soon. Mobile phone users outside the US will also need to wait. Apple’s
Message via satellite is only announced for US users, as is T-Mobile’s
offering. So if you’re in the US, and have an iPhone, or are a T-Mobile
subscriber with an Apple, Samsung, or Google device, you’ll soon be able
to point your phone at the sky, even in remote areas, to call for help,
give your friends an update on your expedition, or just stay in touch.
Pretty soon, Tom Hanks won’t have to make friends with a volleyball when
he crash lands on a deserted island, at least not until his battery
dies.</p>

<h2 id="twenty-years-ago-today">Twenty years ago today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of
podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio
post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a
little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing
a blog post.
</p>
<p>
That was
<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM">June 11,
2004</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then it hit me, it’s June <i>2024</i> now, it’s been <i>twenty freaking
years</i>.
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a
dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here
we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and
it’s still as open as it was back in June 2004.
</p>
<p>
<b>Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast</b>. That was the goal. You
don’t need anyone’s permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior
to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less
real and less interesting, imho.
</p>
<p>
My partner in this at the time was
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry">Adam
Curry</a>. Sometime in that period he started
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code">The Daily
Source Code</a>, and then we did a podcast together for a few months
called <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a>. My own
podcast was called <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning
Coffee Notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months,
with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows.
I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the
same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew,
Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine
won’t.)
</p>
<p>
So here’s the URL for the podcast.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml</a>
</p>
<p>
I’m sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck.
I’ll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I’ll
register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts.
</p>
<p>
I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting
bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types
like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying
out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that’s
still thriving twenty years later.
</p>
<p>
It should be quite a story! :-)
</p>
<p>
Here’s a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004.
And that’s the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in
Seattle at the time.

Making ice requires more than subzero temperatures. The unpredictable

<h1 id="2024-06-15-old-tech-uucp">
2024-06-15 Old tech: UUCP
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a> and I have
been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.
</p>
<h2 id="uucp">
UUCP
</h2>
<p>
The latest effort has been in connecting our servers using <em>Unix to
Unix copy</em> (UUCP). The benefit is that once you have that, you can
also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using
<code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<p>
lkh has a “travelling laptop” that is mostly offline, but sometimes it’s
online. That’s when he wants to exchange stuff with us. The laptop is
called Dwalin.
</p>
<p>
My server is Campaign Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available
via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">
/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys
</h3>
<p>
This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">
/etc/uucp/passwd
</h3>
<p>
This is where Dwalin’s password is stored. This is important because
there’s no actual Dwalin user on my system.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-sys">
/etc/sys
</h3>
<p>
I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">
/etc/uucp/config
</h3>
<p>
This is where I set my own node name.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me some spool related entries. I’m not sure whether I needed
them.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
In our case, lkh’s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi’s Erebor system and
here’s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I’m not connected
to Erebor directly):
</p>
<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="news">
News
</h2>
<p>
Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.
</p>
<p>
Look at the requisites:
</p>
<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">
/etc/news/send-uucp.cf
</h3>
<p>
This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big
the batches should be.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">
/etc/news/newsfeeds
</h3>
<p>
Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">
/var/lib/news/active
</h3>
<p>
Add the new newsgroups. We don’t do control messages.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.
</p>
<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">
/var/lib/news/newsgroups
</h3>
<p>
Give the new newsgroups a tag line.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">
/etc/news/readers.conf
</h3>
<p>
Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.
</p>
<p>
Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the “readonly” section.
</p>
<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
}

access &quot;authenticatedpeople&quot; {
    users: &quot;*&quot;
    newsgroups: &quot;*,!junk,!control,!control.*&quot;
}

access &quot;readonly&quot; {
    users: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
    read: &quot;local.*,campaignwiki.*,casa.*,cosmic.*,erebor.*,rec.*,de.*,alt.*&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-1">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where a news article is put into the
queue and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls and the enqueued article is
sent:
</p>
<pre><code>uux dwalin news (2024-06-15 10:22:01.34 3832004) Queuing rnews (D.000R)

</code></pre>
<h2 id="e-mail">
E-Mail
</h2>
<p>
Oh yes, we do.
</p>
<p>
Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl’s “taint” mechanism wherein
user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted
by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like “alex” is
tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes
untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you
run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be
looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system,
is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">
/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
</h3>
<p>
This is the file generated by <code>update-exim4.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
The result of me answering the questions:
</p>
<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'
dc_other_hostnames='alexschroeder.ch;campaignwiki.org;communitywiki.org;transjovian.org'
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1 ; ::1'

dc_use_split_config='true'
dc_hide_mailname=''
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that the MX records for my domains point to Migadu because that’s
where SMTP mail should go.
</p>
<p>
UUCP is what lkh, kyonshi and I use.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>. If it comes after the primary,
then it won’t work because the primary router ends with
<code>no_more</code> and as the comment at the end of the file says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for
domains in the local_domains list
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new
file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-uucp">
/etc/exim4/uucp
</h3>
<p>
This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to
UUCP names.
</p>
<p>
It only works for Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as
such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP
system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).
</p>
<p>
The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code>
(see above).
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
The route above says that the transport to use is <code>rsmtp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define this using a new transport config file:
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>
<p>
This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the
<code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used
<code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third
argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error
messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim
sends me a en error message):
</p>
<pre><code>2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=461

2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBh-2Q Completed
</code></pre>
<p>
I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions
that didn’t do taint checking.
</p>
<p>
The code I’m using means that I’m looking up the sender local part
(“alex” or “root”) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found,
the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password
list).
</p>
<p>
You can test these expressions on the command-line:
</p>
<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-2">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send
mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.
</p>
<p>
Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.
</p>
<p>
As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s a mail being enqueued successfully:
</p>
<pre><code>2024-06-15 14:08:42 1sISD4-00GIbQ-1a &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=513

<p>
Note the <code>uucp_router</code> and the <code>rsmtp</code> transport
being used.
</p>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where four mails are put into the queue
and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls the enqueued messages are sent:

I just finished this bookmarklet to dynamically insert a table of
contents for pages that don’t have one. Mostly for my own blog, to be
honest.

<p dir="auto">
Hi,<br/> The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the
&lt;delete&gt; key doesn't delete, &lt;F1&gt; doesn't set the star and
&lt;F2&gt; doesn't clear marks. HotKeys has preempted the familiar
Oberon key functionalities?
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys. In
10272 &lt;F12&gt; gives a report in the log that a SystemTools command
doesn't exist.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
SystemTools was omitted inadvertently?

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was emailing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/&quot;&gt;Matthew “Starbreaker” Graybosch&lt;/a&gt; about his recent post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/robots-txt-nuclear-option/index.html&quot;&gt;“robots.txt: the Nuclear Option”&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a regular reader of this site you know I love this kind of stuff and I especially love nuclear options when it comes to fighting silly tech.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent
exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb
Knight posted
<a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/">“Perplexity
AI Is Lying about Their User Agent”</a> and that was all the extra
motivation I needed to join the fun.
</p>
<p>
I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a
shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of
mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402">402</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the
<a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents
list</a> and set up an NGINX redirect based on those UA. Gonna be
interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a
follow-up.
</p>
<p>
I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is
great and if you’re using RSS in 2024 you’re an awesome person BUT I
might have inadvertently broken some RSS feed out there with this move.
If you notice something not working properly let me know and I’ll fix
it.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;hr&gt;

<h2 id="streamos-source-code-republished-15-years-later">StreamOS source
code republished 15 years later</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating
system called StreamOS – version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that
day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal
using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out
that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered
the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It’s not a
complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together
with git. I didn’t do source code management much back in the days, and
there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup
drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed
(along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and
see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫
Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the
SNES, but it’s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope
Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because
you may never know – someone might be interested in picking up this 15
year old baton.</p>

<p>The complete source code for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System
(SNES) version of Doom has been released on archive.org. Although some
of the code was partially released a few years ago, this is the first
time the full source code has been made publicly available. ↫ Shaun
James at GBAtemp The code was very close to being lost forever, down to
a corrupted disk that had to be fixed. It’s crazy how much valuable,
historically relevant code we’re just letting rot away for no
reason.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves">A brief history of
Mac enclaves and exclaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves
on the Mac, and when he touches upon “exclaves”, a new concept that
doesn’t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While
an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of
another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists
separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a
term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel
extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in
iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel
that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes
compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of
refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected
exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I’m
not going to add too much here since I’m not well-versed enough in the
world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it’s an
interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more
knowledge about this topic than I do.</p>

<h2 id="imagine-rss-as-a-cover-story">Imagine RSS as a cover story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been
on the cover of a magazine, so you can’t say ChatGPT is stealing this
from anyone. In fact I’m offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press
has chosen to focus on the idea that it’s plagiarizing journalists. The
ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they’re doing
their jobs, they’re reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote
a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper
that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>.
I don’t owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I
read the news on their site. The news doesn’t belong to them.
</p>
<p>
The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn’t so
far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no
billionaires involved, so they didn’t consider it newsworthy I guess.
Some day we’re going to have to accept that we have to make our own
news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker’s famous line – “If you don’t like
the news go out and make some of your own.” So here we go. I asked
ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story.

find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don’t know the extent
of it, but there’s a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I’m
thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the

utility of <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> as a feed
operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It’s not just a feed
reader. It’s able to do things most feed readers don’t do, maybe none
do. We don’t have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either.

live in a dream, or to live the life you’re actually living. All three

1.23.2, 1.22.4 and 1.21.6 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to announce a
new update for the <strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now
available for the supported versions 1.23, 1.22, and 1.21.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to comprehensive refactoring and enhancement activities, we’ve
significantly improved the reliability of our automated End-to-End (E2E)
tests. With contributions from
<a href="https://enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>, we’ve tested the operator on
all major cloud providers, identified several defects, and resolved them
in these new releases, ensuring a more stable and resilient software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Versions 1.23.2, 1.22.4, and 1.21.6</strong> are patch releases
that contain crucial bug fixes, addressing issues such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unnecessary reloads and shutdowns of PostgreSQL
</li>
<li>
Excessive CPU usage on fenced instances, due to busy waiting loop
</li>
<li>
The primary instance manager hanging indefinitely after a stop and
subsequent failure
</li>
<li>
Autovacuum not working correctly due to an issue between
<code>hot_standby_feedback</code> and our managed cluster-level
replication slots implementation
</li>
<li>
<code>pgaudit.log_rows</code> not functioning as intended
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With this update, version 1.21 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version
1.21.6 marks the final release for the 1.21 minor version.
</p>
<p>
We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience
to benefit from these improvements and bug fixes.

<h2>
About CloudNativePG
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> stands as a
groundbreaking open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for
PostgreSQL workloads. Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of
a PostgreSQL cluster, CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and
configuration to ensuring high availability, connection routing, and
comprehensive backup and disaster recovery mechanisms. Leveraging
PostgreSQL’s native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard
Kubernetes patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a
Kubernetes-native manner, with the operator autonomously and safely
reconfiguring replication as needed. Originally conceived and supported
by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>, CloudNativePG
represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads within
Kubernetes environments.
