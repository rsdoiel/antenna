<h1 id="2024-07-16-what-s-the-minimal-nncp-setup-to-get-started">
2024-07-16 What’s the minimal NNCP setup to get started?
</h1>
<p>
This page is for you if you are curious about NNCP and you don’t know
how to get started. It contains instructions on how to set up your
laptop such that it can exchange files with my laptop (melanobombus) via
my server (sibirocobombus).
</p>
<p>
Before testing it, you need to send me an email with some info but we’ll
get to that.
</p>
<p>
First, switch to the root user. Everything will be easier that way.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo su
</code></pre>
<p>
The instructions are going to assume a Debian system.
</p>
<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package.
</p>
<pre><code>apt install nncp
</code></pre>
<p>
Generate a new <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file and secure it:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to add my server to your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file, in
the <code>neigh</code> section.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       CCAIPFSAZWYICBQ5BIURX4UMEJIXVSZFIING7HRUFTDOFV5XISVQ
      exchpub:  NGEIDPDVZ2I6CTRKCBT734VV4W2YFVTV6YFBU5UGB6IHBA3QDJUQ
      signpub:  VXBMWXS74IGAYQCLJY4UPAXXQXPT3K53QI5XCFHOAKL4I2FQNLKQ
      noisepub: MGGBAOHRHEWEC6CGT47GA2DOQXQFZUAKJ66PD734Y5WNWP364UXQ
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;@daily&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my server via the <code>.addrs.internet</code>
key – you need this, but you can specify <code>campaignwiki.org</code>
instead, if your prefer
</li>
<li>
you connect to my server every now and then via the
<code>calls[0].cron</code> entry – this is not necessary if you don’t
mind using <code>nncp-call</code> every now and then
</li>
</ol>
<p>
My laptop can only be reached via my server. You need to add it as well.
</p>
<p>
As far as the <code>melanobombus.incoming</code> key goes, pick a
suitable directory that your regular account has access to.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       R23WEIHB52TMA4EKGJPKUDBFSYP2HG4HHW2HGJ3RJATCCRLYDUZQ
      exchpub:  EGP2MMLQJQUKWTHI22JTIRMR2UV3BA2ATE3AYLVOFODMTNRGAMEA
      signpub:  YO6SZXVEIU77OQQRKMAUFUT4V3NJER4U7LQE5JI7JORJXKXY5FBA
      noisepub: 6ECO4WXJNDED6WHJ6SM2HGRQMUO75X65ALT2YRKZ3YGGBDXRNV4A
      via:      [&quot;sibirocobombus&quot;]
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        rsmtp:  [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my laptop via my server using the
<code>.via[0]</code> key – you need this and the name needs to match the
name you used for my server
</li>
<li>
you allow my laptop to save incoming files in a directory via the
<code>.incoming</code> key – you only need this if you want to receive
files (the directory must exist and the <code>nncp</code> group must be
allowed to write to it)
</li>
<li>
you allow my laptop to send mail to local users via the
<code>.exec.rsmtp</code> key – this is not necessary if you don’t want
to receive mail
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You would create the directory as follows. I’m assuming that
<code>$SUDO_USER</code> is your actual username so I’ll use that instead
of “alex”.
</p>
<pre><code>dir=&quot;/home/$SUDO_USER/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
mkdir --parents &quot;$dir&quot;
chown $SUDO_USER:nncp &quot;$dir&quot;
chmod g+w &quot;$dir&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to send me your system’s public keys from the
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file so that I can set up similar entries
on my laptop and my server.
</p>
<p>
Once I’ve added your public keys to my server, we can test it.
</p>
<p>
My server will not call you, since it doesn’t know your Internet
address. It waits for you to call it both when you want to send or when
you want to receive something. You would do this as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Otherwise, the <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="daily">@daily</span></code> entry in the
<code>sibirocobombus.cron[0]</code> entry of your
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file will call my server once a day, at
midnight.
</p>
<p>
To send me a README file, you’d run:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-file README melanobombus:
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z Tx README 486 B/486 B 100% (73 KiB/sec)
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z File README (282 B) is sent to melanobombus:README
</code></pre>
<p>
At this point, the file is in the queue.
</p>
<p>
You need to to call my server using <code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call
sibirocobombus</code> to actually send the files or you’ll have to wait
for the cron job. My server will receive the packets encrypted and
addressed to my laptop and enqueue them again. The next time my laptop
calls my server, it’ll get them.
</p>
<p>
You probably want to let me know about the channel via another channel,
be it IRC, regular mail!

<h2 id="the-dark-net">2024-07-16 The Dark Net</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-16-the-dark-net">
2024-07-16 The Dark Net
</h1>
<p>
I haven’t read The Dark Forest but I read a few blog posts about it.
What really got me interested, however, was
<a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/">The
Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a> by Yancey Strickler in 2019:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other
predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the
internet, and away from the mainstream. – Yancey Strickler
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I often think of where the world is headed, politically. I’m a doomer at
heart.
</p>
<p>
As part of that, I think about the Internet in a few decades. In the
worst case, the public Internet is gone. An alternative that is slightly
less bad is that governments will have discovered that blocking at the
level of the national Domain Name System (DNS) won’t work because it’s
easy to circumvent using alternative name servers. And so, slowly at
first but then ever faster, from the top down, people will think that
perhaps the Great Firewall is cool: for the children, against porn,
against spam, against vandalism, to fight tax evasion, to fight
terrorism, you know the deal. And yes, even to fight fascism. So many
people are telling me that we should ban Telegram, for example.
</p>
<p>
I’m honestly not sure what to recommend. Is the free press our problem?
I don’t think so. It’s the incentives and the power imbalances that are
a problem. Rich people pay other people to create companies, to buy
companies, to sponsor some programs and to cancel others, and slowly the
landscape changes. Big corporations buy small ones. Rich people buy
failing ones. The prime example here in Switzerland is how the Weltwoche
was bought by billionaires and handed to somebody who supports a flat
tax, who supports the ban on minarets, who supports supports tax evasion
abroad, who supports anti-refugee policies… all of it legal, of course,
but these laws are nauseating. The same pattern can be seen in how the
state tries to support media diversity and still the big publishers
manage to profit the most. The same pattern can be seen in how the right
wing parties fight against state radio and state TV.
</p>
<p>
So what I recommend is to not go dark. Have friends. Have social media.
But be aware that our time might be short. We might have to build the
infrastructure while we can. Those of us who can should build for the
rest of us who have other things on their mind. We should build this to
be as easy to use as possible. We should build this so that we can
detach from the public Internet and it will still work.
</p>
<p>
The sneaker-net will be back. They will call it the dark net but to me,
it will forever be friends meeting in a place, with mass storage in our
backpacks (at the time) or in our pockets, exchanging stuff. And even if
this future is not great at all, we need that alternative. How else will
our future selves and our children organize? And even if it turns out to
be unnecessary because we keep riding that wild horse of freedom,
forever teetering at the brink of fascism, alternative needs to be there
to keep the next level of services in line. I still believe that the
availability and ubiquity of bit-torrent is what keeps the prices of
streaming services down. It’s the threat of piracy that keeps the
official channels honest. Because we can always go back. The
infrastructure is still around. The software is still around.
</p>
<p>
This is why I’m interested in
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@jgoerzen" title="@jgoerzen@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jgoerzen">@jgoerzen</span></a>’s
<a href="https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10231-recovering-our-lost-free-will-online-tools-and-techniques-that-are-available-now">Recovering
Our Lost Free Will Online: Tools and Techniques That Are Available
Now</a>. In my case, the thing I’m most interested in is NNCP.
</p>
<p>
NNCP allows us to connect all services that can be made to work with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward">store and
forward</a> architecture. The simplest and oldest protocols in this
respect are mail and file copying, and services built on top of that,
such as net news. These services grew big with UUCP, the precursor to
NNCP. Store-and-forward precludes the kind of interactive applications
many of us are used to. Instead, it’s a bit like a library or a book
store: you order a book and at some point you get the book. There is a
delay. The postal system works the same way: write a letter and send it
off, wait for some days, maybe get a reply back. Basically, anything
that can be imagined as requesting something and getting back a reply
after some time can be implemented using store-and-forward architecture.
</p>
<p>
If you think of the web as serving static documents, it can be made to
work. Imagine reading Wikipedia via email: you send the URL via email to
a service, and some time later you get back an email with the response.
Soon we would be thinking of extensions to this. What if the response
returned an archive of the page requested, all the images it includes,
and the same for all the Wikipedia content pages it links to? Fewer
visits to the library, so to say! It would be much harder to do the same
thing using traditional social media because the web sites are more like
web apps. There are a gazillion ways to view things: in a time line (or
multiple time lines!), on a profile (so many profiles!), in threads, in
search results, and so on. If every click on a button requires a trip
that can take many days, it’s doesn’t work. Instead, such social media
sites must be restructured to work a bit like net news: new posts
satisfying some filters are sent in regular updates and your local
client rearranges the, filters them, searches them.
</p>
<p>
All of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking">delay-tolerant
networking</a> is possible with Unix to Unix Copy
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a>). What Node to
Node Copy (<a href="http://www.nncpgo.org/">NNCP</a>) adds is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end
encryption</a> (in a multi-hop setup the packets remain encrypted so the
carrier cannot read them) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">onion routing</a>
(in a multi-hop setup the carrier doesn’t know where the packet is
originally from or where the packet is going to end up). And with that,
the sneaker-net is back. You can imagine a low-tech future where most of
the last miles are burned, the copper stolen and repurposed, the optical
fibre no longer functional, and a service springs up where the post or
some other courier is used to send USB sticks and SD cards from
community to community in order to exchange letters, reports, movies,
pictures, music, and so on. Or if the government is monitoring the
airwaves and declaring mesh networks illegal or taking over the mesh
networks (like Cuba’s Street Network,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba#SNET">SNET</a>),
we’ll have to rely on USB sticks and SD cards, too.
</p>
<p>
This is where we’re getting back to the Dark Forest. I don’t have an
answer to that. It’s a bit like members-only bit-torrent sites. Do you
trust them? Do they trust you? How are you going to learn about the
trustworthy ones?
</p>
<p>
In order to learn more, to be prepared, to think things through, I want
to experiment with the technology. I want to see what can be done, run
into the issues, pick the low hanging fruits. Play with the technology
before we really need it.
</p>
<p>
I remember audio cassettes being sent back and forth as a kid when we
were living in South-West Africa (back before they finally got their
freedom and renamed the country to Namibia) and my grandparents were
living in Austria. Phone calls were very expensive. So the family sat
around a tape recorder, each of us speaking in turn, saying something,
and weeks later, all of us gathering again, listening to the replies.
</p>
<p>
Using images like these virtual, delay-tolerant family gatherings worked
long before I knew anything at all about computers.

problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance">JD
Vance</a> is that he has no principles, he’ll be whatever he needs to be
to get more power, and he’s young. He’s as empty as Trump, and much
younger, so we can’t hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem,
because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump’s sons probably aren’t
happy about this, had he picked
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Little Marco</a>, no
one would mistake him as an heir, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum">Doug Burgum</a> who

<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845">yesterday</a>,
the biggest most important thing is that we <b>organize ourselves.</b>
That’s the best defense all around. Every attempt to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)">corral</a> the
insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate.
Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he
was getting there, but now he’s back, and probably a bigger threat than
ever. I don’t think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need
leadership. Not wait to be led. We’ve waited too long. People who appear
ready to step up – AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn’t put Obama
on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme
Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being
nice, unfortunately. We’re also not going to prevail by each of us
taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work
together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.</p>

<p>
Today, on the <strong>tenth anniversary</strong> of
<a href="https://marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast">Overcast 1.0</a>, I’m
happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app,
built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Like podcasts better than blog posts?
<a href="https://atp.fm/596">Listen to ATP #596</a> for more!</strong>
</p>
<h3>
What’s new
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Much faster,</strong> more responsive, more reliable, and more
accessible.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Modern design,</strong> optimized for easily-reached controls on
today’s phone sizes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Improvements</strong> throughout, such as undoing large seeks,
new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What’s not
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Most features.</strong> Overcast is still Overcast!
</li>
<li>
<strong>The audio engine.</strong> It’s the best part of Overcast, and
still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume
normalization. (More soon!)
</li>
<li>
<strong>The business.</strong> I’m still a one-person operation, with no
funding or external ownership, serving <em>only</em> my customers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>My principles.</strong> I always want to make the best podcast
app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What’s gone
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Streaming.</strong> Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad
insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming
playback.<sup id="fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs"><a href="#fn:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is
<em>much</em> more reliable.
</p>
<p>
Tapping a non-downloading episode will now open the playback screen,
download it, <em>then</em> start playback. It works similarly to the way
streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes,
not after a portion of it is buffered.
</p>
<p>
On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds.
</p>
<p>
And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control
over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience
for people who don’t automatically download every episode.
</p>
<h3>
What’s next
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts
support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will
return soon.
</li>
<li>
More options for downloading and deleting episodes.
</li>
<li>
Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch
app is currently unchanged from the previous one.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested
features over the last decade.
</p>
<p>
Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for
your patience as I work through this list!
</p>
<h3>
Why?
</h3>
<p>
Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome
or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS
functionality, or add new features, especially as one person.
</p>
<p>
That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years.
</p>
<p>
You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as
I wanted.
</p>
<p>
For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its
second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app
with Swift, SwiftUI,
<a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/Blackbird">Blackbird</a>, and
modern Swift concurrency.
</p>
<p>
Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating
more quickly, and ultimately making the app <em>much</em> better.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to the next one.

Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two
downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So,
for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the
download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request,
the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing
or repeating
content. <a href="#fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rev="footnote">↩︎</a>

2024-07-15 One Page Dungeon Contest
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
“We are excited to invite you to the 2024 One Page Dungeon Contest. We
are accepting submissions starting now and to the end of July. The
contest challenge is to create an intriguing and fun dungeon to play… on
only one page. We would love to see you get involved.” –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I submitted an entry for the One Page Dungeon Contest. Since I would
like the dungeons to be close to the prep I do for my own games so that
I feel like I belong to a community of referees that spends a similar
amount of time for their adventures I took some of my (German) prep
notes, cleaned them up and added some text boxes using Inskape and
decided against spending time on polishing it up.
</p>
<p>
At the time, my players had a hard time getting past the gate.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-08-22_Hammond_verfolgt_den_Orkzug">2023-08-22

Result:

<li>
<a href="/pdfs/Orc_Halls_by_Alex_Schroeder_2.pdf">Orc Halls by Alex
Schroeder</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the time I had a second 10-headed hydra, too…
</p>
<p>
The boss orcs had 3, 5 and 7 hit dice.
</p>
<p>
And later, when the players had killed all the orcs, a bunch of goblins
led by one Eye Poker resettled the halls.
</p>
<p>
These are the stats I would use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>orcs</strong> HD 1 AC 6 1d6 F1 MV 12 ML 8 XP 100</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Grishg</strong> HD 3 AC 6 1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 8 XP 300; with
<em>gauntlets of max strength</em> granting +3; under the influence of
the demon
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shagdog</strong> HD 5 AC 6 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 8 XP 500; lightning
bolt 1×/day for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; very loyal to Maufimbul
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ashuak</strong> HD 5 AC 3 1d6 F5 MV 6 ML 9 XP 500; willing to
buy freedom and leave
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maufimbul</strong> HD 7 AC 3 1d6 F7 MV 6 ML 9 XP 700; wielding
<em>Fur Hunter</em> +1/+3 vs. mammals; traditionalist spear dancer
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>boars</strong> HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 300
</li>
<li>
<strong>hell hounds</strong> HD 5 AC 4 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; fire
2/6 for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; see invisible (that pack of hell
hounds is also the random encounter)
</li>
<li>
<strong>small pyrohydra</strong> HD 5 (40hp, 8hp per head) AC 5 1d10 per
head F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; regrowing heads (unless cauterized with fire
or ice, up to 7 more heads may grow, one per round, each with 8 hp);
fire breath 3×/day: deal as much damage as it has hit-points left, save
vs. breath for half; poisonous blood: when cutting off a head in melee,
save vs. poison or die; immune to fire and poison
</li>
<li>
<strong>fire demon</strong> HD 9+1 AC 4 1d6/2d6 F20 MV 12 ML 11; flying;
aura of fire 1d6 (everybody within 10 ft); when the first attack with
the flaming whip hits, the second attack with the flaming sword is at
+4; only harmed by magic and magical weapons; immune to fire (the
flaming whip and the flaming sword are two magic items that can be taken
from the demon)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clearly, the pyrohydra is the worst if you fight it without multiple
lightning bolts or the like.
</p>
<p>
As for intelligent monsters, I figured that it would be possible to
somehow sneak in and overhear orcs talk about the four bosses. If
somebody wanted to, the power dynamic could be exploited. As it turned
out, though, my players tried to force the front gate with sleep spells,
alerted the guards, which brought on the fire demon and all the hell
hounds. The enemies were destroyed but the party had to retreat. Next
time, the party found the outlook, sent up a ranger with dark vision and
a magic item that could charm humanoids. He killed the four orc guards,
climbed down the netting into the cavern, found the way to the shooting
gallery, started killing all the orcs and that was the signal the others
needed to begin the race down the the long stairs. At the bottom, the
orcs had cajoled a ten-headed pyrohydra into the Merchant Hall but it
died in the first round after being hit by lightning bolts and other
spells.
</p>
<p>
The treasure map to the Cistern of Sulphur does not contain any new
monsters or traps; it’s not a new lair or dungeon. It’s part of the
treasure gained here so all it takes is a one day trip up the mountains
to that sulphur cavern. The only risk involved is random encounters.

id="i-told-you-so-mozilla-working-with-facebook-to-weaken-firefox-privacy-and-anti-tracking-features">I
told you so: Mozilla working with Facebook to weaken Firefox’ privacy
and anti-tracking features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve long been warning about the dangers of relying on just one
browser as the bullwark against the onslaught of Chrome, Chrome skins,
and Safari. With Firefox’ user numbers rapidly declining, now stuck at a
mere 2% or so – and even less on mobile – and regulatory pressure
possibly ending the Google-Mozilla deal with makes up roughly 80% of
Mozilla’s income, I’ve been warning that Mozilla will most likely have
to start making Firefox worse to gain more temporary revenue. As the
situation possibly grows even more dire, Firefox for Linux would be the
first on the chopping block. I’ve received quite a bit of backlash over
expressing these worries, but over the course of the last year or so
we’ve been seeing my fears slowly become reality before our very eyes,
culminating in Mozilla recently acquiring an online advertising
analytics company. Over the last few days, things have become even
worse: with the release of Firefox 128, the enshitification of Firefox
has now well and truly begun. Less than a month after acquiring the
AdTech company Anonym, Mozilla has added special software co-authored by
Meta and built for the advertising industry directly to the latest
release of Firefox, in an experimental trial you have to opt out of
manually. This “Privacy-Preserving Attribution” (PPA) API adds another
tool to the arsenal of tracking features that advertisers can use, which
is thwarted by traditional content blocking extensions. ↫ Jonah Aragon
If you have already upgraded to Firefox 128, you have automatically been
opted into using this new API, and for now, you can still opt-out by
going to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Website Advertising
Preferences, and remove the checkmark “Allow websites to perform
privacy-preserving ad measurement”. You were opted in without your
consent, without any widespread announcement, and if it wasn’t for so
many Firefox users being on edge about Mozilla’s recent behaviour, it
might not have been snuffed out this quickly. Over on GitHub, there’s a
more in-depth description of this new API, and the first few words are
something you never want to hear from an organisation that claims to
fight tracking and protect your privacy: “Mozilla is working with Meta”.
I’m not surprised by this at all – like I, perhaps gleefully, pointed
out, I’ve been warning about this eventuality for a long time – but I’ve
noted that on the wider internet, a lot of people were very much
unpleasently surprised, feeling almost betrayed by this, the latest in a
series of dubious moves by Mozilla. It’s not even just the fact they’re
“working with Meta”, which is entirely disqualifying in and of itself,
but also the fact there’s zero transparency or accountability about this
new API towards Firefox’ users. Sure, we’re all technologically inclined
and follow technology news closely, but the vast majority of people
don’t, and there’s bound to be countless people who perhaps only
recently moved to Firefox from Chrome for privacy reasons, only to be
stabbed in the back by Mozilla partnering up with Facebook, of all
companies, if they even find out about this at all. It’s right out of
Facebook’s playbook to secretly experiment on users. This is what I
wrote a year ago: I’m genuinely worried about the state of browsers on
Linux, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I think it’s
highly irresponsible of the various prominent players in the desktop
Linux community, from GNOME to KDE, from Ubuntu to Fedora, to seemingly
have absolutely zero contingency plans for when Firefox enshittifies or
dies, despite everything we know about the current state of the browser
market, the state of Mozilla’s finances, and the future prospects of
both. Desktop Linux has a Firefox problem, but nobody seems willing to
acknowledge it. ↫ Thom Holwerda It seems my warnings are turning into
reality one by one, and if, at this point, you’re still not worried
about where you’re going to go after Firefox starts integrating even
more Facebook technologies or Firefox for Linux gets ever more resources
pulled away from it until it eventually gets cancelled, you’re
blind.</p>

AMD Zen 5 microarchitecture: powering Ryzen AI 300 series for mobile and
Ryzen 9000 for desktop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built around the new Zen 5 CPU microarchitecture with some
fundamental improvements to both graphics and AI performance, the Ryzen
AI 300 series, code-named Strix Point, is set to deliver improvements in
several areas. The Ryzen AI 300 series looks set to add another footnote
in the march towards the AI PC with its mobile SoC featuring a new XDNA
2 NPU, from which AMD promises 50 TOPS of performance. AMD has also
upgraded the integrated graphics with the RDNA 3.5, which is designed to
replace the last generation of RDNA 3 mobile graphics, for better
performance in games than we’ve seen before. Further to this, during
AMD’s recent Tech Day last week, AMD disclosed some of the technical
details regarding Zen 5, which also covers a number of key elements
under the hood on both the Ryzen AI 300 and the Ryzen 9000 series. On
paper, the Zen 5 architecture looks quite a big step up compared to Zen
4, with the key component driving Zen 5 forward through higher
instructions per cycle than its predecessor, which is something AMD has
managed to do consistently from Zen to Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4, and now Zen
5. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech Not the review and deep analysis quite

Focus our attention on each product (ie climate change, social security,

organizing. None of this pissing in the wind we do on twitter-like
systems. Form buddy groups of people we organize with, based on locality
or common interests. Organize the people as well as the billionaires are
organized. This is what political parties should be in 2024 for crying
out loud. We’re missing the point of the mess in our politics. It’s all

<h2 id="fusion-os-writing-an-os-in-nim">Fusion OS: writing an OS in
Nim</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I decided to document my journey of writing an OS in Nim. Why Nim?
It’s one of the few languages that allow low-level systems programming
with deterministic memory management (garbage collector is optional)
with destructors and move semantics. It’s also statically typed, which
provides greater type safety. It also supports inline assembly, which is
a must for OS development. Other options include C, C++, Rust, and Zig.
They’re great languages, but I chose Nim for its simplicity, elegance,
and performance. ↫ Fusion OS documentation website I love it when a
hobby operating system project not only uses a less common programming
language, but the author also details the entire development process in
great detail. It’s not a UNIX-like, and the goals are a single 64 bit
address space, capability-based security model, and a lot more. It’s
targeting UEFI machines, and the code is, of course, open source and
available on GitHub.</p>

We should hire an intern at some J-school to keep track of all of my

Then we feed those rules to an AI.

Then we flow in the news stories of the day from various sites through

<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> recently wrote
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>,
arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody
else, including spam and binaries. I agree with all the points made. The
idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying
all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall
of Usenet.
</p>
<p>
Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other
servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just
want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a
different net.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UUCP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to
have a username and password.
</li>
<li>
NNTP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on
IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.
</li>
<li>
Servers don’t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in
what they accept and in what they pass on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spam problem arises when two systems “trust” each other and peer
messages but one of the systems doesn’t act on abuse and moderation
reports. Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system
administrators so they stopped following up on those reports. Perhaps
some servers had become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances seem
too big to defederate from.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up on
an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post
shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users
that I don’t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me. I
can block them all individually or block the large instance including my
small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet. It was the lack of moderation that
killed Usenet. It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able
to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant. In the end, to all these
people federation was not as important as moderation.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with
people that needed moderation. This is a problem on all platforms with
groups, e.g. Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their
niches. At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again. IRC,
Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and
self-moderation was viable.
</p>
<p>
This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of
federation are the most important quality of a platform.
</p>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.

its entirety below.

<p>
Ah, that’s not a super new post, it’s from September 2023. I dug it out
again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome. It
uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand things
correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not quite the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s a bad thing that I’ve being hesitant to defederate from m.soc
even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I’ve been getting
from email fro the past several years.
</p>
<p>
But I’m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don’t work the way people think.)
</p>
<p>
On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to mirror
the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what would be
necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring the entirety
of all the non-banned servers), I’d have to deal with thousands of
messages. My server would croak.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because on
there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I had
to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I’m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren’t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn’t work like that I’m not sure it even would be federated.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

my small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban
since every instance was expected to carry everything.
</p>
<p>
Individual blocks is one way around it. That’s why I, a small instance
op, while I’ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to ban
the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li’l lower
since I don’t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize “safe space”
instances would ban m.soc for example.
</p>
<p>
Also I “silence” every instance since I don’t have a “whole known
network” tab.
</p>
<p>
Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there was
<em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.
</p>
<p>
More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I’m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li’l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)
</p>
<p>
That problem, summarized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled over,
through following or commenting
</li>
<li>
So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of those
posts
</li>
<li>
Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like “I wanna
see all of Marie’s <code>#tidying</code> posts” or “I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends
<code>#mosstodon</code> posts” or even for filtering out stuff. I.e.
it’s OK as a tool for <em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em>
</li>
<li>
It’s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for “emulating
channels” which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked
there since those are centralized
</li>
<li>
For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would have
to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.
</li>
<li>
There was an effort in that direction early on, with the “relay” system.
</li>
<li>
But small servers would croak. <strong>That’s</strong> the problem. It’d
be an environmental waste heap.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that’s absolutely a protocol level problem!
</p>
<p>
A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I’ve got to add that not literally
<em>every</em> server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some
didn’t carry Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code>
hierarchy. But that’s the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" />
</p>
<p>
So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the “only send the relevant posts” nature of mailing lists,
and the “we’re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it once
in the SQL” nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy server is
subscribed to <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="garderning">@garderning</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="foo.bar">@foo.bar</span></code>, like an email user might be
subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy of that
group since it’s getting those messages anyway. It’s not perfect and
we’re still paying a hefty “decentralization tax”, but it’s more robust
than mail and news.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet
irrelevant.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the cost
(and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was the
nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.
</p>
<p>
Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed
although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)
</p>
<p>
But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn’t be nearly enough to fix that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Email can’t moderate their users since email isn’t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban someone
who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance banning is
very common on email.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Last time I talked about this I got the world’s most stubborn reply guy
on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use hashtags to
find at least some amount of interesting posts and was resistant to
change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my server would
croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about “scalability is only for
capitalists”.
</p>
<p>
Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they’re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.
</p>
<p>
My criticism of Usenet’s protocol here has nothing to do with capitalist
scaling, which is about “throwing computers at it”. Sure, that’d be one
solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other communities),
and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small overlapping villages
instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral channel.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that’s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).
</p>
<p>
Here are three network layouts:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" />
</p>
<p>
First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient way
to organize an “everyone-must-see-everything” protocol, but vulnerable
to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions, billionaire
takeovers, or earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it’s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why since
there’s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything for
everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is
super efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.
</p>
<p>
Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of “nearby”
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That’s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that’s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed, and
that’s what would be “needed” for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery to
“work”.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community need
to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy
and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo company
would never in a million years set up a system like this because it’s
too wasteful ever for them, while we’re liable to do so since each
instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for the
network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization because for
them, the power consolidation in the first two network types is a
positive, while for us it’s a huge negative so we’re drawn to the third
type, so we need to be really careful and really responsible here.
</p>
<p>
But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it’s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see
everything. It’s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are sent
to my instance, I don’t mirror the entire server. It’s actually pretty
awesome! It’s good for moderation too because I only need to moderate my
“neighborhood”. Yeah, a “neighborhood” is the perfect analogy for this;
neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still small and managed. A
system set up like that can remain smol and cozy even as it invites
everyone on Earth. It’s great. ActivityPub is awesome.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-08</strong>. I got a reply from
<a href="https://koldfront.dk/">Adam Sjøgren</a> regarding Sandra’s
comment on hashtag use in
<a href="https://illuminant.asjo.org/">Illuminant</a>.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
⁂
</div>
<p>
ActivityPub hashtags are translated to Keywords: and vice versa in
Illuminant. So far I haven’t had the need to use hashtags/keywords for
more than showing/writing them in Keywords: - I did have a plan to have
groups like fediverse.keyword.music, fediverse.keyword.askfedi etc. etc.
but I haven’t implemented it.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry to say that I do not know what FEP-1b12 is, so I don’t think
Illuminant implements any of the group support defined in that.
</p>
<p>
Since Illuminant is very much driven by what I personally want and feel
like implementing/have the energy to implement, it has a kind of skewed
subset of what I guess is expected from a fediverse server/user
interface by most…
</p>
<p>
While it is fun for me to hear somebody call Illuminant awesome, I must
say that I’m pretty sure there is only one person in the universe who
actually runs it. Being proven wrong would be awesome, though.

can totally explain why Chromium browsers quietly tell only its websites
about your CPU, GPU usage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s time for Google being Google, this time by using an undocumented
APIs to track resource usage when using Chrome. When visiting a
*.google.com domain, the Google site can use the API to query the
real-time CPU, GPU, and memory usage of your browser, as well as info
about the processor you’re using, so that whatever service is being
provided – such as video-conferencing with Google Meet – could, for
instance, be optimized and tweaked so that it doesn’t overly tax your
computer. The functionality is implemented as an API provided by an
extension baked into Chromium – the browser brains primarily developed
by Google and used in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. ↫ Brandon
Vigliarolo at The Register The original goal of the API was to give
Google’s various video chat services – I’ve lost count – the ability to
optimise themselves based on the available system resources. Crucially,
though, this API is only available to Google’s domains, and other,
competing services cannot make use of it. This is in clear violation of
the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, and with Chrome being by far
the most popular browser in the world, and thus a clear gatekeeper, the
European Commission really should have something to say about this. For
its part, Google told The Register it claims to comply with the DMA, so
we might see a change to this API soon. Aside from optimising video chat
performance, the API, which is baked into a non-removable extension,
also tracks performance issues and crashes and reports these back to
Google. This second use, too, is at its core not a bad thing –
especially if users are given the option to opt out of such crash
analytics. Still, it seems odd to use an undocumented API for something
like this, but I’m not a developer so what do I know. Mind you, other
Chromium-based browsers also report this data back to Google, which is
wild when you think about it. Normally I would suggest people switch to
Firefox, but I’ve got some choice words for Firefox and Mozilla, too,
later today.</p>

pictures, bootable floppy disks, and the first Canon Cat demo?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a month ago, Cameron Kaiser first introduced us to the Canon
Cat, a computer designed by Jeff Raskin, but abandoned within six months
by Canon, who had no idea what to do with it. In his second article on
the Cat, Kaiser dives much deeper into the software and operating system
of the Cat, even going so far as to become the first person to write
software for it. One of the most surprising aspects of the Cat is that
it’s collaborative; other users can call into your Cat using a landline
and edit the same document you’re working on remotely. Selecting text
has other functions too. When I say everything goes in the workspace, I
do mean everything. The Cat is designed to be collabourative: you can
hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least you could when landlines
were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in and literally type into
your document remotely. If you dialed up a service, you would type into
the document and mark and send text to the remote system, and the remote
system’s response would also become part of your document. (That goes
for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In fact, we’ll deliberately
exploit this capability for the projects in this article.) ↫ Cameron
Kaiser You can also do calculations right into the text, going so far as
allowing the user to define variables and reuse those variables
throughout the text to perform various equations and other mathematic
operations. If you go back and change the value of a variable, all other
equations using those variables are updated as well. That’s quite nifty,
especially considering the age of the Cat, and since the Cat is fixed
width, you can effectively create spreadsheets this way, too. There’s
really far too much to cover here, and I strongly suggest you head on
over and read the entire thing.</p>

I bought Baldurs Gate 3 and started it this weekend. It’s pretty fun so
far and I’m impressed by the amount of content. Voice work for so much!
I was not expecting the nudity question, nor the option to choose
between so many genital options. I’ve not gone down any romantic
pathways yet but I’ll admit I’m curious.

<p>
What about you, internet? Have you checked this part of the game out? Is
it worth exploring?

quietly updates official lightweight Windows 11 Validation OS ISOs for
24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has again quietly updated its Validation OS ISOs. In case
you are not familiar with it, Validation OS is an official lightweight
variant of Windows and it is designed for hardware vendors to test,
validate and repair hardware defects. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin I had no
idea this variant of Windows existed, but it kind of makes sense when
you think about it. OEMs or other companies making devices that run or
work with Windows may need to test, reboot, test, reboot, and so on,
endlessly, and having a lightweight and fast version of Windows that
doesn’t load any junk you don’t need – or just loads straight into your
company’s hardware testing application – is incredibly valuable.
According to Microsoft, the Windows Validation OS boots to a command
line that allows you to run Win32 applications. This has made me wonder
if I can use it for the one thing I am forced to use Windows for:
playing League of Legends (I cobbled together a spare parts machine
solely for this purpose). My guess is that either the Validation OS will
lack certain components or frameworks League of Legends requires, or is
so different from regular Windows that it will trip Riot Games’ rootkit,
or both. Still, I’m curious. I might load this up on a spare hard drive
and what’s possible.</p>

<h2 id="github-is-starting-to-feel-like-legacy-software">GitHub is
starting to feel like legacy software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The corporate branding, the new “AI-powered developer platform”
slogan, makes it clear that what I think of as “GitHub”—the traditional
website, what are to me the core features—simply isn’t Microsoft’s
priority at this point in time. I know many talented people at GitHub
who care, but the company’s priorities just don’t seem to value what I
value about the service. This isn’t an anti-AI statement so much as a
recognition that the tool I still need to use every day is past its
prime. Copilot isn’t navigating the website for me, replacing my need to
the website as it exists today. I’ve had tools hit this phase of decline
and turn it around, but I’m not optimistic. It’s still plenty usable
now, and probably will be for some years to come, but I’ll want to know
what other options I have now rather than when things get worse than
this. ↫ Misty De Meo Apparently, GitHub is in the middle of a long,
drawn-out process where it’s rewriting its frontend using React. De Meo
was trying to use a particular feature of GitHub – the blame view, which
also works through the command line but is apparently much harder to
parse there – and realised the browser search feature just couldn’t find
the line of code they absolutely knew for sure was there. After
scrolling for a while, the browser search feature suddenly found the
line of code. I’d heard rumblings that GitHub’s in the middle of
shipping a frontend rewrite in React, and I realized this must be it.
The problem wasn’t that the line I wanted wasn’t on the page—it’s that
the whole document wasn’t being rendered at once, so my browser’s
builtin search bar just couldn’t find it. On a hunch, I tried disabling
JavaScript entirely in the browser, and suddenly it started working
again. GitHub is able to send a fully server-side rendered version of
the page, which actually works like it should, but doesn’t do so unless
JavaScript is completely unavailable. ↫ Misty De Meo Seem like a classic
case of people being told to develop something in too little time, with
the wrong tools, while management is breathing down their necks and
pulling engineers away to work on buzzwords like “AI”.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;It’s the number of people who have taken a few minutes out of their busy lives to write something on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook&quot;&gt;guestbook&lt;/a&gt;. One hundred doesn’t seem a lot in the grand scheme of things, especially on the web. If you have one hundred followers you might as well have zero. One hundred views on a YouTube video? That’s nothing. You need at least one hundred thousand to be part of the conversation. And yet, I find one hundred signatures in a guestbook to be a lot. Can you imagine having one hundred people in front of you, all saying something to you, one after the other? It would feel overwhelming. The internet has messed up many things, including the sense of scale. But this more humane scale is why I love the personal web. You can still recognise the names of the people who interact with you, you can still remember details about them. I’m grateful for every single one of those one hundred signatures. If yours is one of them, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;

2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux
</h1>
<p>
On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting
on the train immediately. We took the train to Yvonand and turned
towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest. This is
<a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route
129</a>.
</p>
<p>
When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the
autobahn arches high above. If only it were a fantastic train and not a
triumph for car culture.

<p>

</p>
<p>
Once you leave the forest, you’re on the plateau above. We ate lunch at
the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.

And here’s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in
front of the castle is bathed in blue light at night, as if a train
station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.

<p>
Somewhat creepy.

BTW, I’m intermittently locked out of my
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a>
account.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They
say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don’t explain. I don’t
have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried
changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network,
it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no
energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don’t see me over
there, this is why.
</p>
<p>
How I found out about Trump’s assassination. By accident, I was watching
CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few
minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to
season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of
Duty</a>, which isn’t very great. I couldn’t focus on the show. I got my
iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting
that <i>he</i> hadn’t been killed, and somehow I knew that “he” was
Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump
asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his
fist, looking right into the camera. He’s 100 percent television actor.
Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn’t
cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed
killing him. He’s thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my
first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies
about being a victim, really is a victim, and we’ll never hear the end
of it. And it didn’t take long before a random Republican asshole was
saying this was Biden’s fault for saying Trump would end democracy,
which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do
it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the
temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides.
It didn’t take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate.
This was Biden’s fault they all agree. Occam’s Razor says this is over.
We aren’t going to vote in November. The deal is done because the
journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I’ve
yet to hear another explanation from them.
</p>
<p>
If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph,
they’d nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That’s how our
journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the
dictator. This is what it’s like after that happened. People inside big
companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize.
Now their malaise becomes ours.
</p>
<p>
BTW, if Biden steps aside don’t expect the Repubs won’t sue saying it’s
illegal, so guess what – not only don’t you get Biden, you don’t even
get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with
just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for
appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the
arguments already written.

My opinion about yesterday’s assassination as a political tool is that
using F-16s to kill 100 Palestinians was unjustifiable.
</p>
<p>
The Lancet now puts the death toll in Gaza at about 10% of the
population.
</p>
<p>
And Gaza having the most children amputees in the world in nine months
is depraved.
