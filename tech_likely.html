<h2 id="serving-oddµ-via-a-socket">Serving Oddµ via a socket</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Serving Oddµ via a socket
</h1>
<p>
Recently, <a href="http://the-brannons.com/">Chris Brannon</a> sent me a
patch for <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> that allowed it to listen at a
Unix-domain socket instead of a host and port.
</p>
<p>
I decided to investigate since I don’t know anything about sockets. If
you see something that can be improved, let me know.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to use systemd, but for my user.
</p>
<p>
I have two files, one for the socket and one for the service. These are
not the same files as the ones provided with the Oddµ sources. Those are
intended to be used together with a web server that acts as a reverse
proxy. These files are for me testing the installation using netcat and
curl.
</p>
<h2>
Socket
</h2>
<p>
Make sure the directory for the socket exists:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/run/oddmu
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the file “oddmu-unix-domain.socket”:
</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu server socket
[Socket]
ListenStream=/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
Accept=no
[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
</code></pre>
<p>
Enable and start it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.socket
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.socket
</code></pre>
<h2>
Service
</h2>
<p>
Make sure the directory for the wiki exists and copy the template files:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
cp *.html /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the file “oddmu-unix-domain.service”:
</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu
After=network.target
Requires=oddmu-unix-domain.socket
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
ExecStart=/home/alex/src/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1&quot;
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This doesn’t limit a lot of capabilities, but I guess I trust my own
code.
</p>
<p>
Install it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.service
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.service
</code></pre>
<h2>
Test
</h2>
<p>
Check the journal:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --user --follow --unit oddmu-unix-domain
</code></pre>
<p>
Do some requests using netcat:
</p>
<pre><code>echo -e &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /view/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /edit/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
</code></pre>
<p>
Using curl:
</p>
<pre><code>curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/edit/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  --form body=&quot;Hello!&quot; http://localhost/save/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/view/index
</code></pre>
<h2>
What now?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t think I’m going to change my web server setup. But using sockets
and <code>systemctl –user</code> has been interesting.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, Chris Brannon, for sending that patch!

<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hi! I’m from New Jersey and I live in Brooklyn now. I studied Computer
Science in college a lot time ago, and that led to a series of jobs at
early-stage startups: I’ve worked on CAD software extensions,
visualization tools, geospatial software, and programming tools. It can
be a little hectic, the urgency to get these companies from point A to
B, but I like it.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always had a lot of hobbies, and have kept most of them. Guitar,
banjo, running, art, writing, gardening, hardware projects: having a few
things to do is pretty important to me. The creative energy from one
project can spill over to another, and you can get a fresh perspective
by taking a break from some long-running task.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
When I started writing online in 2010, there were a lot of people
leading the way. I remember
<a href="http://simplebits.com/blog/">SimpleBits</a> and
<a href="https://kottke.org/">kottke</a>,
<a href="http://artypapers.com/">Rebekah Cox</a> and David Heinemeier
Hansson. <a href="https://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a> had a perfect
look for his blog that heavily influenced mine. One of my earliest jobs,
working at a company called
<a href="https://developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, encouraged
us all to write. Bonnie Bogle, one of the founders, had worked
professionally as a writer and helped a lot with editing and taught us
all how to write for the web.
</p>
<p>
I write to think, so I do it all the time and not just for the blog. I
keep paper journals. I like that quote on the back of all my
<a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> notebooks: “I’m
not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to
remember it now.”
</p>
<p>
For the current blog, I’m kind of proud of how little it’s changed. It’s
so easy to just chase the latest blog software or design, but with my
current blog I’ve been able to really restrain myself. I like the design
and the technology just works. The content has definitely changed as
what I’ve worked on shifted. There’s usually some writing that’s
work-related, some that’s about what I’m interested in now. I’ve added
sections for photos and book reviews.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I don’t have a process for getting inspired or finding topics to write
about. I just write about what I’m interested in and what I think is fun
to share. So sometimes months go by without finishing anything, and
sometimes it’s four posts in a month.
</p>
<p>
It’s scary when the inspiration doesn’t come. Right now is one of those
times: it’s been three months since I wrote a standalone blog post. But
I write one a month, always called “Recently,” which is there to keep a
cadence. The Recently posts have a consistent structure and are less of
a commitment to write - I think they’ve helped me keep the habit through
all these years.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have anyone proofread my drafts. I make grammar and spelling
mistakes all the time, and would probably benefit from an editor, but
it’s a solo operation, for better or worse.
</p>
<p>
I don’t write outlines. Sometimes I’ll write multiple drafts when I
can’t figure out which part of the topic is really interesting. I’ll
write long blog posts just to find the 25% that’s actually good, and
I’ll keep just that part.

<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m either incredibly neat in my own space, with everything on the table
arranged at right angles, or writing on a laptop at a chaotic cafe. If
I’m listening to anything when I’m writing, it’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Sure! It’s simple. The blog is generated by
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, stored on
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and hosted on
<a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I recently switched to using
Cloudflare as my domain registrar – really happy with them so far. I
also used Cloudflare to store photos, with their R2 service. I also have
my own email address on the site, using Fastmail, which is fantastic.
</p>
<p>
And that’s really it – it’s a static site. I’ve made small changes to
the tech stack like switching from GitHub Pages to Netlify and from
Gandi to Cloudflare. But overall, I’ve used simple tools to make
something simple and it has been unproblematic.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Not really: I like how I have it set up. Maybe I’d use Hugo or Eleventy
instead of Jekyll, just because it’s annoying to set up Ruby on new
computers. But Jekyll has been great otherwise.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to overcomplicate these things.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The domain costs about $20 a year. Hosting images on Cloudflare R2 costs
a few cents a month. Fastmail costs $5 a month.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Brooklyn rents, these numbers are relatively insignificant to
me.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried a few things to monetize it: affiliate links, hooking up the
Brave Browser’s advertising system, and a ko-fi.com link for donations.
</p>
<p>
I also sell the blog’s theme for $100, because people kept asking for
it. But, I try to make it clear that if you just want to recreate it on
your own or rip off design elements, be my guest, don’t pay me!
</p>
<p>
I shut down the Brave advertising setup, which paid me in BAT tokens,
because the annoyance of accounting for “crypto income” outweighed the
income itself. I don’t use affiliate links anymore – they were always a
paltry income.
</p>
<p>
For me, I’ve had a relatively comfortable career in the tech industry.
The most value that my blog has provided me is job flexibility and
exposure. I feel awkward about the prospect of monetizing my audience
and I have the luxury not to do so.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not a universal experience at all, and I think it’s totally
cool and fair for anyone to monetize their blog. Some people have done
really well that way!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I read enough tech stuff at work, so I don’t really need programming
blogs. I have a few RSS subscriptions that I still treasure:
<a href="https://www.cycfi.com/">Cycfi Research</a> is from a company
that is building wild MIDI-compatible guitars out of carbon fiber.
<a href="https://zeptobars.com/en/">Zeptobars</a> is a very focused blog
that posts die shots - images of chips after the coating has been etched
away. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault’s blog</a> is
software engineering feats of strength and some very strong opinions.
<a href="https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/">Light Blue Touchpaper</a>
always has some post about a mind-blowing security vulnerability.
<a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">Language Log</a> has
wild language-crossover examples. And of course there’s
<a href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100 Rabbits</a> posting about
their art, programming, music, and boat adventures.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Right now I’m spending a lot of time on
<a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a>, so check that out!

<h2 id="hans-reiser-on-reiserfs-deprecation-from-the-linux-kernel">Hans
Reiser on ReiserFS deprecation from the Linux kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>What follows is a letter from Hans Reiser to myself, which he wrote
some two months back, and has asked me to publish, with his thoughts on
the deprecation of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel. I have transcribed it
to the best of my ability. Plaintext email may not be the best way to
read it, as such, I have also made available PDF and HTML versions of
the letter. ↫ Fredrick R. Brennan Hans Reiser is the creator of the
ReiserFS file system, which used to be a serious contender for the Linux
file system you’d use in the early 2000s. In 2006, Hans Reiser murdered
his wife, and is currently serving a prison sentence for this crime.
Hopefully, after he completes his prison sentence, he can become a
contributing member of society once again, if the professionals and
specialists involved in such matters deem him capable of doing so. The
long letter mentioned here was actually quite a fascinating read, and
details his abrasive behaviour in the Linux world, the design of
ReiserFS and its place in the ecosystem at the time, and his thoughts on
the removal of ReiserFS from the Linux kernel.</p>

is killing off 56 products amid “tectonic” infrastructure shift</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Broadcom’s brutal assault on VMware’s product suite continues, with
the company’s new owner this week confirming that it is sunsetting a
massive 56 VMware products and platforms – as investors said this week
that they anticipated a “tectonic shift” in the infrastructure market as
a result.  In a January 15 advisory VMware confirmed tersely that it was
taking a sweeping range of products to “End of Availability” and that
“these products are no longer available for purchase” – although most
remain advertised enthusiastically, for now, on slick corporate website
pages. ↫ Ed Targett The list of products is a thing to behold, for sure.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many enterprise products together in
one list, and I once spent weeks scouring and dealing with HPE.</p>

<h2 id="where-have-all-the-flowers-gone">Where have all the flowers
gone?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A post from Jason Velazquez called
“<a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">Where
have all the websites gone?</a>” crossed my socials. It’s a good lament
about the dearth of interesting content on the internet and how we’re
stuck in the same boring content silos.
</p>
<p>
The question reminded me of a song by Pete Seeger called “<em>Where have
all the flowers gone?</em>” In the song Pete wonders aloud about the
flowers now missing from the field…
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 1]
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time ago
Where have all the flowers gone?
The girls have picked them, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
We find out that the girls have picked all the flowers. All of them.
That’s a bit excessive. Why? The second verse explores the young girls’
situation…
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 2]
Where have all the young girls gone?

Where have all the young girls gone?
They've taken husbands, every one
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The girls got married, good for them! That’s a natural part of growing
up. But what of the husbands and how are they connected to the missing
flowers? Did they use all the flowers for their weddings? The third
verse answers this question.
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">[Verse 3]
Where have all the young men gone?
Long time passing
Where have all the young men gone?

Where have all the young men gone?
They're all in uniform
Oh, when will you ever learn?
Oh, when will you ever learn?
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The young men, dressed in uniform, went off to war. The flowers were,
presumably, for their funerals. Pete sure knew how to tell a story.
</p>
<p>
So where have all the websites gone? Well, the people who make them have
all gone to war for the capitalist machine. They grew up and got jobs. A
natural part of growing up. Silos came and plucked their voices.
Invasive memes and short form content grew in their place. Hustle
overtook leisure. Harassment overtook openness. Influence overtook
creativity. An economy of interestingness replaced by one of followers,
likes, and engagement metrics.
</p>
<p>
One important thing to note; websites aren’t extinct. In fact, you’re on
one now! Uploading your own words is ancient technology but still works.
</p>
<p>
I loved Jason’s point about the curators and it illuminated something I
don’t think I fully understood before. Curators and aggregators are
integral to the ecosystem. If we all create, steal, and regurgitate the
same content then we only reinforce our own echo chamber. Aggregators
bridge subcultures in a world of content bubbles and subreddits. They
share curios from the web you may have missed, subverting the FOMO-based
dopamine addiction machine using RSS. They find beauty in the mundane
and surface wisdom from obscure writings. That is valuable, worth more
than gold.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/">We
are poems, not software</a> and in need of a reforestation of our
curators. To paraphrase Mr. Rogers in these dire times, “Look for the
aggregators…”

and want to participate, <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send
me an email</a> and I’ll let you know the topic so you can start working
on your post in advance.

did you notice how
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc909LOR4Q">BMW’s ads</a> say
their product is much better than Tesla’s, without mentioning Tesla,
they just say they’re better, because they are just better, because
they’re BMW, and they know you know that. It’s much more powerful esp
with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as
a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to
charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla.
Putting down the competition isn’t what marketing is about, you have to
think about the people whose minds you’re trying to change, and know
you’re in it for the long haul. An example of their ad copy: “With
electric driving comes exciting possibilities. That’s why BMW approaches
this new era in mobility just like any other; where engineering,
innovation and aesthetics come together seamlessly to inspire joy in
every journey.” These people understand their product and how their fans
see them.</p>

released because they invested billions in it, had no idea what it’s
used for, and were overlooking the ability of the human body to actually
<i>use</i> such a thing, and couldn’t consider writing it off because so
much had been made of this, esp since the current management has been
coasting on innovation done by

hadn’t released anything that wasn’t completely predictable since his

in 2011</a>. Their lack of confidence in their own product overwhelms
any positive reviews coming out from the privileged press, who we know
in advance to discount, these are the press people Apple can count on to
not say a negative word, to preserve their access at least, if not
because they are complete fans. It reeks of a loser product. I write
these things partially so I can be proven ridiculously wrong when I get

<p>I always liked small laptops and phones – but for some reason they
fell out of favor of manufacturers (“bigger is more better”). Now if one
wanted to get tiny laptop – one of the few opportunities would have been
to fight for old Sony UMPC’s on ebay which are somewhat expensive even
today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear –
especially clockwork products are neat, but they are not foldable like a
laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced Lichee Console 4A based
on RISC-V SoC – I preordered it immediately and in early January I
finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues
are below. ↫ Mikhail Svarichevsky I want one of these.</p>

write more insecure code with AI assistants?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the
software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity.
Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure
code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage
in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users
interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related
tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI
assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access
to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also
more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such
tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their
code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we
release our user-study apparatus and anonymized data to researchers
seeking to build on our work at this link. ↫ Neil Perry, Megha
Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, and Dan Boneh I’m surprised somewhat randomly
copying other people’s code into your program – violating their
licenses, to boot – leads to crappier code. Who knew!</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since the last article on the text-based IDEs of old, I’ve been
meaning to write about the GCC port to DOS, namely DJGPP. As I worked on
the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to
cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory
management out and wrote this separate post. This article is a deep dive
on how DOS had to pull out tricks maximize the use of the very limited 1
MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the
features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were
just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the
real improvements provided by protected mode. ↫ Julio Merino The DOS
memory story is a string of hacks upon hacks that somehow managed to
work – and that still work today.</p>

Olbermann</a> is worth a listen, esp the first part where he talks about
political reporters vs sports reporters. Politics is a lot simpler than
most sports, and they repeat themselves for years even decades, yet the
sports reporters manage. Not all of them, there are plenty of
empty-headed sports reporters. But there are also some very insightful
ones. It makes all the the difference. In New York basketball we’re
blessed with two of the best.

<h2 id="google-introduces-google-takeout-api">Google introduces Google
Takeout API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google has detailed more of the changes it’s implementing to comply
with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act. We already covered the
changes to linked services, but Google is also changing how results
related to shopping and booking results are displayed. We will introduce
dedicated units that include a group of links to comparison sites from
across the web, and query shortcuts at the top of the search page to
help people refine their search, including by focusing results just on
comparison sites. For categories like hotels, we will also start testing
a dedicated space for comparison sites and direct suppliers to show more
detailed individual results including images, star ratings and more.
These changes will result in the removal of some features from the
search page, such as the Google Flights unit. ↫ Oliver Bethell Google is
also releasing its promised Google Takeout API, allowing developers to
programmatically deal with users wanting to take their data out of
Google to another service. This one in particular I’m interested in,
since I’m curious if, say, a competing email service will make it easier
and automatic to move away from Gmail.</p>

<h2 id="corporations-are-not-to-be-loved">Corporations Are Not To Be
Loved</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
I started using Apple computers — and writing code for them, starting
with BASIC — 43 years ago, before the Macintosh, even, and I’ve made
this my career. I’ve had all these decades to really, thoroughly delight
in these incredible machines and software, and to give a little back
with my own apps.
</p>
<p>
Apple’s positive effect on my life should not be underestimated. My Mom
once (lovingly, teasingly) said to me that my alternate career, had all
this never happened, was “criminal genius.” Which might have been fun
too, but possibly more stressful than I might have liked. At any rate,
Apple has saved me from a life of crime, and I should love Apple for
that.
</p>
<p>
But I need to remember, now and again, that Apple is a corporation, and
corporations aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t
love GE or Exxon or Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an
exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.
</p>
<p>
Apple doesn’t care about you personally in the least tiny bit, and if
you were in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might —
effectively infinite compared to your own — enables them to deal with
you.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the
sixth finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple’s policies for
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">Distributing
apps in the U.S. that provide an external purchase link</a> are
startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that
Apple is not a real person and not worthy of your love.

<p>ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out
on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they’re always there, and not
too busy to help out. They know everything you don’t know and need to
know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a
human btw). It’s remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human
programming partner. It’s the kind of helper I aspire to be.</p>

<h2 id="dos-revisited">86-DOS revisited</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, the oldest known versions of DOS were uploaded to the
internet, and Michal Necasek dove into the floppy images. Even after
more than 40 years(!), old software releases and pre-releases can still
surface. In the case of 86-DOS 0.11 and 0.34 it’s practically a miracle,
since there were probably never very many copies in existence. For the
first time since the early 1980s, FAT formatted floppies with the
primordial 16-byte directory entry format have come to light. The old
16-byte directory entries were gone by 86-DOS 1.0 in April 1981 and of
course never appeared in any public PC DOS release. These prehistoric
versions of 86-DOS allow us to fill in further missing pieces in the
puzzle of DOS origins. It is fascinating to follow how DOS developed
from almost nothing to a multi-million dollar business in the course of
just a few years. ↫ Michal Necasek It started out so humbly. Yet, here
we are, in 2024, and variants of DOS still have their uses in certain
niches. An incredible legacy, for sure.</p>

id="a-shocking-amount-of-the-web-is-machine-translated-insights-from-multi-way-parallelism">A
shocking amount of the web is machine translated: insights from
multi-way parallelism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>We show that content on the web is often translated into many
languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates
they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way
parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations
in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the
total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a
selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many
languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated
en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises
serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large
language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the
web. ↫ Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias
Domhan, Marcello Federico As a translator myself, this is entirely
unsurprising. Translating is a craft, a skill, and much like with any
other craft, you get what you pay for. If you pay your translator(s) a
good rate, you get a good translation. If you pay your translator(s) a
shit rate, you get a shit translation. If you pay nothing, you get
nothing. I’m definitely seeing more and more people in my industry
integrate machine translations, but so far, it’s not been an actual
issue – I have no qualms about accepting a job where I take a
machine-translated text and whip it into shape and turn it into a
human-readable, quality translation… As long as people pay me a
reasonable rate for it. Working from a machine translation is often
quicker and easier, so the going rate obviously reflects that. The
quality of machine translations is absolutely atrocious, however, and
the idea of relying on it for texts other people – customers, clients,
employees, etc. – are actually supposed to read and work from is
terrifying. Google Translate is an effective tool for personal use, but
throwing, I don’t know, your product’s manual at it and dumping the
unedited result onto your customers is borderline criminal. Pay nothing,
get nothing.</p>

<h2 id="wobblybox-a-web-component-for-wobbly-boxes">WobblyBox, a web
component for wobbly boxes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
For years the latest articles list on my homepage had a neat little CSS
trick where each post had wobbly “rough boxes” around them. To create
the effect I used a script from
<a href="http://css-houdini.rocks">css-houdini.rocks</a> aptly named
<a href="https://css-houdini.rocks/rough-boxes/">Rough Boxes</a>. One
minor problem, CSS Houdini paintlets aren’t – <em>and probably never
will be</em> – cross-browser.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326062701/http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">Do
websites have to look the same in every browser? No.</a> But after half
a decade of not seeing those wobbly boxes on iOS, I decided to abandon
Houdini and draw my own quirky boxes… so I made a web component that you
can use today called <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code>!
</p>
<p>
<a class="button" href="https://github.com/davatron5000/wobbly-box">View

</p>
<h2>
Introducing WobblyBox
</h2>
<p>
WobblyBox is a web component for drawing wobbly boxes around your
content. Copy or
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wobbly-box">install</a> the file
into your project then wrap any element you want WobblyBox around with
the <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> Custom Element.
</p>
<wobbly-box>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"module"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"wobbly-box.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</span>
    Any content goes here
<span class="nt">&lt;/wobbly-box&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</wobbly-box>
<h2>
Making a WobblyBox with SVG and Border-Image
</h2>
<p>
I wanted something as simple as the Houdini script so I started looking
at porting the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-based paintlet script but
couldn’t get over the feeling that SVG might be the best fit.
</p>
<p>
Inside every SVG path there are some little commands in the path string.
Some you may already know like <code>M</code> is for “move”,
<code>Z</code> is for “terminate”, <code>L</code> is for “line”. One I
didn’t know about was <code>Q</code> which creates a point on the path
and bends the path towards that point in a bit of an arc.
</p>
<p>
<code>Q</code> was a major unlocking for the effect because drawing a
box in SVG is relatively easy. Here’s a 100x100 box inset 5px from the
edge to account for wobble.
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 95,5 95,95 5,95 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The next step was adding in <code>Q</code> points on the path in between
the points that make my box wobble…
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 Q50,0 95,5 Q100,50 95,95 Q50,100 5,95 Q0,50 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
I wanted a bit of randomization in the borders, just like the original
so I used JavaScript to generate random <code>Q</code> values within a
few pixels positive or negative. I made some artistic choices to make it
not completely random and have the top and bottom sides have the same
bend while the inline sides of the box mirror each other.
</p>
<p>
The final step was to get this box I made to surround the content. I had
an <em>image</em> that I wanted to use as a <em>border</em>… so I
thought the not-often-used <code>border-image</code> property might be
appropriate.
</p>
<wobbly-box>
<p>
<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-border-image-property/"><code>border-image</code>
is a complex but awesome property</a>. To be honest, I avoid
<code>border-image</code> in my day-to-day because of its complexity,
but it seemed well-suited here. It creates a 9-slice border box around
an element. With a single image and some magic numbers you the images
crops and repeats the image appropriately to surround the element. Back
in the wild west days of the internet this was a popular technique but
required a lot of extra divs. I think <code>border-radius</code> and the
death of skeuomorphism ultimately depopularized the technique.
</p>
</wobbly-box>
<p>
Then I wrapped it all up in a web component because that seemed like the
easiest delivery vehicle. I’m happy with the final effect and it’s close
to what I had before except that it avoids redrawing the entire border
on resize, so that’s a plus.
</p>
<h2>
Not a big roadmap
</h2>
<p>
I could have – maybe should have – used a pre-existing solution like
<a href="https://wiredjs.com/">WiredJS components</a>. I like how
WiredJS looks, especially for rough prototyping, but it’s probably
overkill for my little boxes. I like how simple
<code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> is; more cartoony and a lot more dumb.
</p>
<p>
If I were to make some improvements, there’s three big ticket items I’m
considering…
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It’d be cool to control <code>–wobble</code>, <code>–thickness</code>,
as well as <code>–border-color</code>
</li>
<li>
Get rid of magic numbers
</li>
<li>
Sometimes there’s a little “tuck” in the corners due to how CSS’s
9-slice borders works, I’ve tried to nudge those but it’s imperfect.
It’s kind of cute, so potentially worth keeping.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But those improvements are not for today! I just needed this to work on
Safari and Firefox.

<h2 id="if-a-human-does-it">If a human does it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Let’s just state the obvious here: AIs are not human. Should be obvious
but apparently it’s not. I say it’s not because the amount of people who
justify all sorts of shitty behavior coming from people working on AI
models is astounding.
</p>
<p>
And the reasoning it’s always the same: it’s ok for an AI model to do X
because if a human were to also do X the results would be the same.
Which is a completely idiotic way of reasoning. And it’s idiotic for a
few reasons.
</p>
<p>
First, if a human were to spend their time learning how to draw and
paint in the style of 4000 different artists you’d be dead before
getting halfway through that list. The same is true for any other stupid
example.
</p>
<p>
And second, if a human were to do that we’d all condemn it pretty
quickly because it goes against everything we find valuable. When a big
company rips off a smaller artist everyone yells and screams. But now
that AIs are doing the same that’s fine because they’re clearly not
ripping off anyone, they’re just taking inspiration, like humans would
do.
</p>
<p>
Except that if fucking Disney were to “just take inspiration” and steal
designs from smaller artists we’d all be enraged, and for good reasons.
</p>
<p>
So please, cut the bullshit. Train your goddamn AI on whatever you want,
<a href="https://nitter.net/JonLamArt/status/1741545927435784424" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">steal
all the content</a>, but at least be honest and feel some shame.

<h2 id="challenges-players-face">Challenges players face</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Challenges players face
</h1>
<p>
I’m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less than
2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them regulars.
Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages. There are many
entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it is a
megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty level
they want to go for. Conversely, if there’s a new player with a level 1
character, they can all agree to stick to lower level characters in
order to make an adventure party that promises an entertaining evening
for all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I’ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn’t thought of.
</p>
<p>
If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults “work” but at the same time the session
only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting killing
many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat
boring and sap away time. Even if the characters aren’t hurt, time is
lost.
</p>
<p>
This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.
</p>
<p>
You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly related
to character death. The result forces the player to do things they
dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to spend
the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.
</p>
<p>
In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless the
players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar attack
upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them or
hold them off some other way.
</p>
<p>
But there is more!
</p>
<p>
Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys, and
artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it’s important
to note who has what, and where it was found. I don’t want there to be a
virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is always with the
group currently adventuring because even though everybody likes it now I
dread the first total party kill where I announce that all the plot
items are now lost. That’ll be the end of the campaign for sure.
</p>
<p>
I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of the
character who’s the owner of a particular item.
</p>
<p>
But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up and
the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items they
hold, effectively disappear from the game.
</p>
<p>
So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational
skills. Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?
</p>
<p>
Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the hundreds
of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But if nobody
collects and studies them, the information is effectively lost. If one
player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs, that information
is effectively lost to the others.
</p>
<p>
I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great organiser
of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space for
improvement!
</p>
<p>
So this is another player challenge: how to best share information. Can
they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps them distribute
information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?
</p>
<p>
The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also they
left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players don’t
remember where they’ve been and they don’t remember whether an area was
fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.
</p>
<p>
All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.

think it’s fair to say that the new FeedLand, at
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>, and running in
Automattic’s cloud, is stable, and performing nicely. So if you have an
account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the
original system, which is still running of course, you could now
reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML
subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import
the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be
fully updated, but you’ll be rewarded by a higher performance user
experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for
giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven’t gotten
used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as
it seems it can.</p>

2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a
kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it
online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them
off on family members’ and friends’ computers. This is likely how I got
the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape
Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as “page” and
“hyperlink”. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since
then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what
its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a
2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try
and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the
application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website
has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be
completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ↫ Pier-Luc Brault What a

is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working
to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet
another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart
home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good
is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia
project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia
was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the
intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the
Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a
different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a
Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month
declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫
Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication
was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from “workstation” builds to
porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and
lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely
at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices.
We’re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The
workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit
harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port
has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a
dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency
to kill this before it released it.</p>

OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop
screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal
setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video
on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available.
Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to
record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is
tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in
this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also
included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and
effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So,
let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on
OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of
guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer
to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent
of Linux users who aren’t happy with the spread of things like systemd
and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as
focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That’s not a dig at
BSD developers – BSD focuses on different things – but it does mean that
people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more
assistance.</p>

<h2 id="not-a-collector-but">Not a collector, but…</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf
and think “This guy is a collector!” Or you might look a the bass
guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back
resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my
office and think, “Hey, this guy is a collector!” Or you might look at
all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, “This guy
knows how to collect!”
</p>
<p>
But you would be wrong.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a collector, I’m a serial project starter.
</p>
<p>
Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don’t look
at a knitter’s socks and blankets and say “Wow, look at this yarn
collector!” The same with the instruments; it’s not a collection of
world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about
objects that produce sound. The records? Well… most of those are from my
step-father who –beyond tools he used for home improvement projects–
wasn’t a collector either.
</p>
<p>
I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector
and his house is pretty much the town’s museum stuffed with old WW2
memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train
depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize,
catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.
</p>
<p>
Me? I suppose I have some inadvertent collections of similar objects,
but I don’t fancy myself a collector. I don’t need more possessions in
my life. But if there’s a project… well, don’t mind if I do.

<h2 id="on-enjoying-the-process">On enjoying the process</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of
journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey
itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working
through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with
my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the
process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable.
Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable
part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes,
experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what
makes the journey enjoyable.

<h2 id="howto-change-your-behavior">HOWTO: Change your behavior</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog</p>
<p>
In theory, behavior change should be easy.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.
</p>
<p>
So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn’t your behavior change
as instantly as your desire to change it?
</p>
<p>
In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.
</p>
<p>
In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were
studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.
</p>
<p>
Their
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical
model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in
six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3)
preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.
</p>
<p><img src="images/dall-e-escher-ttm.png" class="abstract-image" /></p>
<center>
<em>DALL-E’s depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical
model.</em>
</center>
<p>
In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable
to many habitual human behaviors.
</p>
<p>
The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior
change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change
you’re in.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this
model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively
change your behavior in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have
struggled with behavior change in the past.

scientific literature and my own lived experience. I am not a mental
health professional, and if you are struggling with behavior change or

</p>
<p>
At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry
Pi’s CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040’s successor,
the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates
of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers—Raspberry Pi’s bread and butter.
</p>
<p>
The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi
5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.
</p>
<p>
That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units
<em>every month</em>.

mystique of Substack in retreat, now – if we had a proper identity
system with storage, we could make it easy for people to hook their
world up to email, ie newsletters, and preserve choice, and be able to
build editors that were more than
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/14/tinyLittleTextBox.png">tiny
little textboxes</a>. I was part of the PC wave in the 80s when writing
tools advanced incredibly quickly. So many directions – from
line-oriented editors on Unix and early Apples, to
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/0cfe7783-d6aa-4350-9d32-f9a81efc8e4b">screen
editors</a>, then with the Mac we got
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">wizzy</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress">page</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker">layout</a>, and
outliners for thinking and presentations. In the same time period
programming changed from something requiring a million dollar investment
in hardware and infrastructure, to something most students could afford.
Just ten years. Since then our world has been reduced to copying and
pasting into tiny text boxes. The question is bigger than if we need
journalism, the question is do we need writers?</p>

This is a repost of
<a href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit/1117534198618423710">a
thread</a> by
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green"><span

some additinal quotes from the sources linked. Peter du Toit has been
posting climate related posts on fedi for quite a while. This is a
recommendation to follow his account.

<p>
We are firmly on a path to chaos. We continue to pour greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop in
emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels.
CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes were
the main contributors to the overall increase, accounting for about two
thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases), which have higher global
warming potentials and account for about one quarter of current GHG
emissions, are increasing rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5
per cent, followed by CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. –

<p>
As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at
+1.45°C above the preindustrial average, based on the six international
climate datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The annual average global temperature approached 1.5° Celsius above
pre-industrial levels – symbolic because the Paris Agreement on climate
change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase (averaged over
decades rather than an individual year like 2023) to no more than 1.5°
Celsius above pre-industrial levels. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have
currently heated by about +1.29ºC above the preindustrial average using
four of the above datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This number shows an up-to-the-second assessment of human-induced global
warming since the second half of the 19th century. –

<p>
The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3ºC has become very
clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the extreme
events of 2023.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of global extreme weather events has seen a “staggering rise”
in the past 30 years, said the United Nations, and experts warn climate
change is “supercharging” the problem, per The Associated Press. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With the emission trajectory for both CO₂ and Methane still increasing,
the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation with the
physics of this.

<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-3.png" alt="Global atmospheric concentration of methane going from below 1760 to over 1900 ppb" />
</p>
<p>
With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track to
pass the 1.5°C threshold in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will
become the earth’s permanent background baseline temperature.
</p>
<p>
Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5°C by November 2033" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Global warming reached an estimated 1.26°C in December 2023. If the
30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming would
reach 1.5°C by November 2033. –

temperature trend monitor</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these
estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this threshold
much sooner as they illustrate below.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7°C" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due to
the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month
running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7°C relative to
1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ± 0.1°C during the following La Nina.
Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be clear that
the world is passing through the 1.5°C ceiling, and is headed much
higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth’s energy imbalance. –

Warming Acceleration: Causes and Consequences</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in
reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the
1.5°C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.
</p>
<p>
The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3°C of heating will seem mild
as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid research
that shows crossing 1.5°C permanently, will set in motion tipping points
that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result of their cascading
effects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system
susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond
which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly.
Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate
system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far
sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The goal
of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate system
tipping points. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the emissions
freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current policies put us on
track for a +2.7°C world. Talk about an overshoot!
</p>
<p>
The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2°C pathway in 2030,
the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024, reaching 8.7
per cent per year on average for the 1.5°C pathway. To compare, the fall
in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020 due to the COVID-19
pandemic was 4.7 per cent. –

(again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to
approach this with the same urgency and determination which was
displayed during the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Look around, it’s all business as usual.
</p>
<p>
As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, “on a highway
to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”
</p>
<p>
Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.
</p>
<p>
We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.

<h2 id="stitch-images-together-with-stitchy">Stitch images together with
Stitchy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a
horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole
design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that
for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.
</p>
<h2>
How to use Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches
images together.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust and
Cargo</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Install <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stitchy">Stitchy</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">cargo <span class="nb">install </span>stitchy
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Use Stitchy
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--order</span><span class="o">=</span>alphabetical 
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
By default Stitchy grabs the <code>n</code> latest images in the
directory, but you can set the <code>–order</code> flag to
<code>alphabetical</code>. I typically put them in a temporary
<code>stitch/</code> directory on my Desktop to stitch images up.
</p>
<h2>
Stitchy for responsive images
</h2>
<p>
By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid.
Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might
show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here’s an example of a responsive image treatment I did on
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe
Check</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The desktop version of the last four books I’ve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the
wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I
used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read-mobile.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a staggered grid" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The mobile version of the last four books I’ve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
No one noticed I did this, no one said “thanks”, but these types of
small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.
</p>
<h2>
Other things Stitchy can do
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>–maxw</code> or
<code>–maxh</code> if that’s part of the effect. You can also set the
output format to <code>–jpg</code> or <code>–png</code> if needed as
well as control the <code>–quality</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Enjoy Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
And that’s Stitchy! It’s pretty handy if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there’s not much
documentation beyond the <code>–help</code> command, so I wanted to have
this to remember how to use it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<em>Edit</em>: A previous version of this post said you could do
<code>stitchy image1.png image2.png</code> but that was a mistake.
