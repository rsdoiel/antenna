<p>The Wayland ecosystem had a phenomenal year from much better NVIDIA
proprietary driver support, Firefox ending out the year shipping with
Wayland support enabled by default, KDE Plasma 6.0 will default to
Wayland following many improvements on the KDE side, the Wine Wayland
driver upstreamed in its initial form, XWayland continuing to be
enhanced, and a lot of other software from desktop environments to apps
continuing to embrace Wayland. ↫ Michael Larabel at Phoronix This train

11 is relaxing Microsoft account auto-sign in apps, but only in
Europe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows is changing the way apps can access your Microsoft account.
Currently, when you sign in to Windows 11 or 10 with your Microsoft
account, most apps automatically use that Microsoft account for in-app
sign-in. The tech giant plans to change this behaviour by allowing you
to decline access to Microsoft accounts in installed apps. ↫ Mayank
Parmar at Windows Latest This change, like so many others that are
making Windows ever so slightly less of a trashfire, is EU-only.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-retrospective-on-sparc-register-windows">A brief
retrospective on SPARC register windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>As I work on moss and research modern processor design patterns and
techniques, I am also looking for patterns and techniques from the past
that, for one reason or another, have not persisted into our modern
machines. While on a run this week, I was listening to an old Oxide and
Friends episode where Bryan, Adam, and crew were reminiscing on the
SPARC instruction set architecture (ISA). SPARC is a reduced instruction
set computer (RISC) architecture originally developed by Sun
Microsystems, with the first machine, the SPARCstation1 (a.k.a. Sun
4/60, a.k.a Campus), being delivered in 1987. It was heavily influenced
by the early RISC designs from David Patterson and team at Berkeley in
the 1970s and 1980s, which is the same lineage from which RISC-V has
evolved. Given the decision to base moss on the RISC-V RV64I ISA, I was
interested to learn more about the history and finer details of SPARC. ↫
Daniel Mangum The sad thing is that SPARC is pretty close to dead at
this point, with the two major players in the high-end – Oracle and
Fujitsu – throwing in the towel half a decade ago. There’s some
lower-end work, such as the LEON chips, but those efforts, too, seem to
be going nowhere at the moment. Definitely sad, since I’ve always been
oddly obsessed with the architecture, and hope to still somehow get my
hands on the last UltraSPARC workstation ever built (the Sun Ultra 45,
which is, sadly, incredibly expensive on the used market). There’s also
a whole boatload of servers on the used market with fancier, newer SPARC
processors, but as far as I know, none of those support any form of even
barely usable graphics, making them useless for weird people like me who
want to run a desktop on them.</p>

They left out almost all of the interesting stuff relating to the way it
was adopted by the publishing and blogging worlds. The format isn’t all
that important, see the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">rules for
standards-makers</a>, what matters is the interop it delivers. The RSS
0.91 to 2.0 thread was what the market built around, because it was
promoted to the market and held steady for it. The other thread got
bogged down in an academic theory of how the web should evolve. Content
syndication was a real application. That’s the story, imho. There was no
mention of the NYT in the piece, or Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley

<li>
You can fit full 4’ x 8’ plywood sheets in the back (assuming you fold

You can seat 7 or even <em>8</em> people inside, somewhat comfortably,

<h2 id="answers-to-my-analytics-inquiry">Answers to my analytics
inquiry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I’m aware it’s not Saturday but I realised I didn’t need to collect a
full week worth of data to get
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/analytics-inquiry">an answer to my
question</a> and so I decided that three full days were enough. I have
data for December 30th and 31st and January 1st. That’s more that
enough. So let’s do some digging shall we.
</p>
<h2>
A quick acknowledgement
</h2>
<p>
Before I cruch the numbers I want to highlight two people who got in
touch mentioning their similar experiments:
<a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim
Nielsen</a>—who’s also a
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-jim-nielsen">P&amp;B guest</a>—and
<a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/analytics-for-sites-with-tech-savvy-audiences/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris
Krycho</a>.
</p>
<h2>
The metrics
</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to first establish what these tools are
measuring. I’m interested in one single data point: how many people have
accessed my content. Should be simple enough in theory. That information
is often referred to as Unique user or Unique visitor. But how are these
tools determining what counts as unique?
</p>
<p>
Plausible doesn’t use cookies and to track unique visitors they do the
following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the
server so that’s what we use. We generate a daily changing identifier
using the visitor’s IP address and User-Agent. To anonymize these
datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run
them through a hash function with a rotating salt.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So a combination of IP and User Agent. So if someone if browsing from
different devices they’d probably be counted multiple times.
<a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">More info are available on
the Plausible website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Simple Analytics tracks a slightly different metric called “unique
visits” which is based, according to their docs, on the referrer.
<a href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/explained/unique-visits">More
info at this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fathom tracks “Visitors” defined as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A visitor is a unique person who’s visited your site.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not very helpful. I tried to poke around the docs but I couldn’t find
how they track it so I’ll move on to the final platform, Pirsch. They do
something similar to what Plausible is doing
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pirsch generates a unique number for each visitor calculated from the
visitor’s IP address, the User-Agent, and a random string that is set
for each website.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Finally, we have Goaccess, the tool I’m going to use to analyse my
server logs. Goaccess defines a Unique Visitor as
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same user
agent are considered a unique visitor. By default, it includes web
crawlers/spiders.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have our definitions, it’s time to get to some numbers.
</p>
<h2>
The numbers
</h2>
<p>
These are the (Unique) Visitors reported by the four online services and
my server logs
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plausible <code>358</code>
</li>
<li>
Fathom <code>403</code>
</li>
<li>
Pirsch <code>273</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple Analytics <code>728</code>
</li>
<li>
Server Logs <code>3894</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Already, the difference between logs and client analytics is HUGE. But
we need to dig a bit deeper into the logs because the situation there is
messy. To start, there’s the issue of bots, spiders and crawlers.
Goaccess has an optional flag I turned on to ignore a huge number of
those. That <code>3894</code> is already ignoring a good % of non-human
traffic. But I am sure something is still slipping through. Another
thing that is present in my server logs that is obviously not present in
the other four tools is RSS traffic because the JS necessary to keep
track of the traffic is not included in the RSS feed. If I remove all
the entries in my logs mentioning either <code>rss</code> or
<code>feed</code> the Unique Visitors go from <code>3894</code> to
<code>2111</code>. Lower but still way higher than the client side data
that was averaging around <code>440</code>.
</p>
<p>
Clearly more work is needed on these logs because they’re incredibly
noisy. I removed all 404s, manually removed all the entries mentioning
any type of bot, I also grabbed only entries matching this regex
<code>(Gecko|Chrome|Firefox|AppleWebKit|Mac OS|Windows
NT|Android)</code>. And that leaves us with <code>1821</code> unique
visitors, according to my logs.
</p>
<p>
That number is still a lot higher than what I’m seeing in the online
dashboard so what gives? Well, I think something obvious is happening
here. I am a web developer with an indie blog that is followed by a lot
of people who are also passionate about the web and are tech savvy. So
I’d bet the % of people running one or multiple ad blockers between my
readers is quite high. An article from the
<a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-adblockers-missing-data">Plausible
blog</a> reports that a huge % of people is blocking google analytics
for example but I’m sure modern ad blockers are also preventing these
tools to work properly. Hell I had to disable mine just to access those
dashboards. My visits to my site were not counted. Estimating the number
of people running ad blockers is impossible and a quick online search
tells me the numbers are anything between 30% to 65%.
</p>
<p>
If I were to adjust the numbers coming out of the four tools I used
based on the 65% which is probably reasonable considering my type of
audience we’d get
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plausible <code>967</code>
</li>
<li>
Fathom <code>1089</code>
</li>
<li>
Pirsch <code>737</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple Analytics <code>1967</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot closer to the <code>1821</code> coming out of my server logs. We
can probably safely assume that some of those <code>1821</code> are bots
cleverly disguised as genuine traffic and the true number has to be
somewhere in the <code>~1200</code> range.
</p>
<p>
So, do I finally have an answer? Is <code>~1200</code> the answer I was
looking for? Well, not quite. We excluded RSS earlier because it was not
part of the data gathered by the four client side tools but RSS traffic
is still traffic worth counting. Especially in 2024! Figuring out actual
RSS traffic is close to impossible. Goaccess tells me there were
<code>1973</code> unique IPs pinging the various feeds on my site. I’m
going to follow
<a href="https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-subscriber-count/">Darek</a> lead
here and simply count exposed subscribers. According to my logs we have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
12 different Feedbin feeds with unique <code>feed-id</code> for a total
of <code>439</code> subscribers;
</li>
<li>
3 instances of Inoreader with very distinct subscribers number for a
total of <code>126</code>
</li>
<li>
4 Feedly instances with very distinct subscribers number for a total of
<code>391</code>
</li>
<li>
NewsBlur, BazQux Reader, and The Old Reader are the other services
exposing subscribers number and combined are other <code>70</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the total, according to these services is <code>1026</code>
subscribers, if my math is correct. Only thing missing to this weird
roundup is the <code>110</code> people who are getting my posts directly
in their inbox.
</p>
<h2>
The conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Is there even a lesson to be learn here? Don’t trust numbers blindly
perhaps? Server logs are messy and can be over inflated while client
based analytics can greatly under report your numbers if you have a very
tech savvy audience. Also RSS is still doing fine and you should
definitely have an RSS feed if you have a personal blog. And if you
don’t have a personal blog I don’t know what you’re waiting for. Ditch
social media and start blogging. You can thank me later. And if you
don’t know where to start hit me up and I’ll be happy to help.

<h2 id="how-i-forked-steamos-for-my-living-room-pc">How I forked SteamOS
for my living room PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>SteamOS 3 (“Holo”) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the
Steam Deck, Valve Software’s portable PC gaming device. It’s a very
interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it
updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new
read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into
that partition. But consumers can also run steamos-devmode to unlock the
root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them
a working Linux distro with a normal package manager. This A/B atomic
updates system is pretty standard for OSes these days, but there’s a lot
going on in SteamOS that makes them work even with heavy customization
by the end-user. I wanted to explore that while still being able to make
changes to the root filesystem images. steamos-devmode is the easy way
out; I wanted to make a proper fork. Here’s how I did it. ↫ iliana
etaoin This article has sparked my interest to build a living room PC
for Steam gaming for my wife and I, so we can play couch coop Steam
games on an actual couch instead of behind our PC desk. Very detailed
and in-depth, this article also teaches a lot about how SteamOS works
under the hood.</p>

is the best game to watch because you get to know the players. Only five
players on the court at once, they play both offense and defense, and
they aren’t wearing armor like football players, you see their faces,
whether they’re cool or hot, emotional or stoic, up or down. So when
your team trades two of its best-known players for three players you’ve
never heard of, to a team that’s rebuilding, first you feel sad, and
then you wonder what the new teams will be like. One of the traded
players,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley">Immanuel
Quickley</a>, is a young, happy warrior with a deadly offense, but he
was a Knicks bench player because they already had an All-Star quality
player at his position, point guard, the quarterback of a basketball
team. He led the second unit, and probably had a lot to do with the
Knicks’ success last year. I watched the Raptors game last night, and
while the joy seemed to be gone from his demeanor, he was their starting
point guard, and now he gets a chance to prove himself. The Knicks got
something they needed, desperately, now that their defensive leader,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson">Mitchell

never became the producer we hoped he would. The new Knicks starting
five are a much better team than they were before the trade, or so it
seems after one game. I admit, I had gotten bored with Knicks this
season, but yesterday’s game was interesting and exciting, and even
better

Catholic Modernity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Ayjay blog</p>
<p>In 1996 the philosopher Charles Taylor delivered a lecture – later to
be published with several responses – called “A Catholic Modernity?” But
do you know what the truly essential value of a Catholic modernity is?
It was a Catholic modernity that defeated Dracula. The Catholic elements
of the story are memorable. Most readers will […]</p>

<h2 id="create-more.-consume-less.">Create more. Consume less.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of time online. One could argue it’s too much time. And in
that time, I consume content. Mountains of content. Huge mountains of
content. Maybe insurmountable mountains of content. No matter how much I
try, there will always be another interesting blog post, YouTube video,
or podcast episode. I consume a lot more than I create. I suspect I’m
not alone in this. And I think there’s a good balance to be found here.
Right now I feel the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of the
consumption and I have to bring it back towards the middle.
</p>
<p>
I feel that is something I need to do for myself, for the sake of my
mental sanity but I also think that’s something the internet as a whole
would benefit from. Consuming content online is, for the most part, a
mindless act. But creating content forces you to reflect, to introspect,
to look at yourself and the world around you in different ways.
</p>
<p>
More people <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/01/birthday-gift">should follow
Matt’s advice</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Publish a post. About anything! It can be long or short, a photo or a
video, maybe a quote or a link to something you found interesting. Don’t
sweat it. Just blog. Share something you created, or amplify something
you enjoyed. It doesn’t take much. The act of publishing will be a gift
for you and me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is going to be my 2024 mantra: <em>Create more. Consume
less.</em>

<h2 id="twenty-twenty-three">Twenty Twenty-Three</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
2023 has been a memorable year and –at times– downright existential.
Looking at the scorecard, it’s pretty clear there’s been more downs than
ups. Despite everything, I maintain a positive outlook and am
forward-looking.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy to report that I failed at all
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/12/twenty-twenty-two/">my SMART
goals from 2022</a>. Every. Single. One. Zero KPIs were harmed during
the course of the last year. Running a quick postmortem, I think setting
goals like this is stupid now. That said, I love data. So as I wrap up
this year, I’ll start with the quantifiable outcomes and move into the
less quantifiable aspects of 2023…
</p>
<h2>
Fell short in the books department
</h2>
<p>
I read or listened to 39 books this year which means I officially fell
out of the “Book-A-Week” club and I’m glad about that outcome. Rather
than powering through an endless backlog, I took a more one-in/one-out
approach with the library. I feel like I got more enjoyment out of the
books I picked up this year by taking it slower.
</p>
<p>
I had a goal of reading four Japanese language manga but failed at that.
I started two (<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> and <em>Mobile Suit Gundam:
Cucuruz Doan’s Island</em>) but got hung up on cooking and military
vocabulary. Japanese has always been like that for me, it takes a lot to
load the “domain” into my Brain RAM. With some effort this may be
something I can re-pick up in 2024.
</p>
<p>
I planned to read less in 2023, so I guess I succeeded there. I had
another goal of watching more TV, but that didn’t happen. I watched some
anime (Gundam) so perhaps I qualified but I didn’t keep track. I also
switched from audiobooks to catching up on podcasts. No regrets.
</p>
<h2>
The year of the personal website
</h2>
<p>
I wrote ~70 blog posts this year between my blog and the Luro blog.
That’s not a good year… that’s my best year yet! And I have 39 drafts in
the hopper. My short term goal is to push publish on half of them. But
let’s look back at some of the greatest hits from this year.

And it’s not just a good year of blogging for me, I can feel the
resurgence of blogging in my bones.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/07/one-friend-a-day/">I cleared out
over 2000 items in my RSS queue</a> and there’s 500 more unreads in
there again. If I were running a clandestine XML-based social network,
then I bet the number of people in that club would have tripled this
year. More people blogging on their personal sites makes the web feel
small and
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">weird
again</a>, like walking through a friendly neighborhood as opposed to
being under the florescent lights of a giant shopping mall.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see what happens with websites in 2024 and
beyond. We’re at a weird tipping point for the web where ChatGPT makes
it trivial to flood the internet with disingenuous, cheaply generated
content spam. What’s the point of writing if a machine can bullshit
faster than I can? Why would I put effort into reading that which you
didn’t put effort into writing? Did you hear that story about the male
conference organizer who was also a fake dev influencer e-girl? Big
yikes.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if the “personal” part of personal websites is the difference
maker going forward. I’m more apt to share something written by someone
I know than some AI content farm.
</p>
<h2>
A year of emergencies, loss, maladies, and stress
</h2>
<p>
We hit the deductible on our health insurance this year and I think
that’s a perfect metaphor for 2023. A brief chronological recounting of
this year’s trauma…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
(Feb) <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/vibe-check-25/">Austin
froze again</a> - 125 hours without power. Thankful for friends who
housed us and helped us chainsaw branches.
</li>
<li>
(Apr) <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/04/goodbye-rudy/">Goodbye,
Rudy</a> - Our sweet dog crossed the rainbow bridge.
</li>
<li>
(Apr) An emergency appendectomy - As family boarded a plane to visit us,
an appendix decided to leave town. Thanks to Mark, our friend, who
performed the surgery.
</li>
<li>
(May) Back-to-back-to-back-to-back cases of strep - Thank you, public
school system.
</li>
<li>
(May) Stress attack - Ack! Began
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/the-plan-and-the-plateau/">dieting</a>
and trying to relax.
</li>
<li>
(Sept) Root canal to kill a jaw-eating bacteria in tooth - No more
purple tooth!
</li>
<li>
(Sept) Diagnosing a mysterious foot fungus - Not fungus, Disney rash.
</li>
<li>
(Oct) Physical therapy and an MRI for a herniated L4 - Back pain is the
dumbest pain
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Managing stress and losing weight was my big personal focus this year.
It feels good to lose 30 pounds, but it feels even better to lower my
resting heart rate 10+ BPM. Being on a “no fun” diet for 7+ months is
good for me but contributes to a feeling of a boring year. I’ll take
that trade I guess or sell a kidney so I can afford Ozempic.
</p>
<h2>
The Good Parts
</h2>
<p>
2023 wasn’t all bad vibes! Some notable and good events happened this
year…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My wife and I celebrated 15 years of marriage.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/vibe-check-28/">Vacationed in
San Diego</a> with friends and family.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/07/my-dad-recliner/">I got a
recliner</a> that I use often, like a true dad.
</li>
<li>
Went to Figma’s Config as an “influencer”
<ul>
<li>
Played dice for drinks in a bar in Chinatown, will never forget this
night
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/09/luro-is-out-of-beta/">Got Luro
out of Beta</a>
❤️ <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/09/feedback-small-teams/">Thanks
to everyone who has given feedback</a>.
</li>
<li>
Web components are having a moment and I like web components.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/596/">ShopTalk wrapped our 12th
year</a> and we’ll hit Episode 600 in a few weeks.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What made this year were the small moments that don’t make the “Year in
Review” lists. Like watching my son play baseball, or my daughter master
new cheer skills, the jokes and tickles, playing Christmas songs on the
piano, building the occasional plastic model, or playing games with the
family. Those are the moments that make up the majority of my days.
</p>
<h2>
🔮 What’s in store for 2024…
</h2>
<p>
2024 is gearing up to be a year of big changes, hopefully with less
medical surprises… but it’s New Year’s Day and I already know that’s not
the case. Ughck. Nevertheless, we persist. For me it’s a season of
reassessing, reprioritizing, and rethinking my personal goals. What do I
want for ol’ Dave Rupert and how do I get there? Not an easy question to
ask myself, but worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
Since I failed at quantifiable goals, I’m not doing those again. Here’s
what I have on my brain that would make for a successful 2024.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Activate an active lifestyle</strong> - I addressed a lot of
stress and weight loss this past year, I’d like to layer in sustainable
activity as well.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write more shitty sci-fi</strong> - I have about six stories on
deck and I’d love to complete them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw more</strong> - I’d love to be someone who doodles all the
time. I could be that guy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write for other publications</strong> - I’m comfortable with
self-publishing on my blog and I’d like to up the editorial challenge
this year by writing for other sites or zines.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Survive the 2024 US Election</strong> - This will occupy enough
mental bandwidth that I am reserving space for it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Make a video game?</strong> - Always chasing this dream.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That seems like a year’s worth of ambition right there and a good place
to end this retrospective. Tired, weak, and worn; I hope this year is
better for you than the last and that those around you are happy and
healthy.

<p>NetSurf, the small and efficient browser for RISC OS, Haiku, AmigaOS
4, and obscure platforms you’ve probably never heard of like “Linux” and
“macOS” has seen a new release – version 3.11. NetSurf is written in C
and has its own browser engine – it’s not based on Google’s browser
engines, Chromium and Firefox’ Gecko/Quantum. NetSurf 3.11 features
improved page layout with CSS flex support. It also features many other
optimisations and enhancements. ↫ NetSurf’s official website It’s an
obvious upgrade for everyone who uses NetSurf, since if you’re using
NetSurf, odds are the platform you’re using it on doesn’t really offer
many alternatives.</p>

<p>BTW, I wrote a wizzy writing tool for WordPress. Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/01/blogbrowserscreenshot.png">screen
shot</a>. I wanted something simpler for posting to feedland.blog. I
think it could work even more smoothly, it was a first effort. One thing
I don’t understand is why aren’t there a dozen such writing tools for
WordPress. It has a great API, really easy to work with. It’s a very
versatile product, yet people seem to stick with the built-in writing
interface. Curious.</p>

for. There’s no reason an independent developer such as myself should
have to implement an identity system, and no reason a user should want
me to. Yet there is no service that provides storage for users that is
accessible to apps that the user chooses. There are a bunch of companies
that have all the pieces. There would be so many benefits of this, it
would help drive open standards, and make it possible for multiple apps
to work on the same data. I don’t know why this product doesn’t exist.

<h2 id="yet-another-year-of-living-without">Yet another year of living
without</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Years ago, inspired by Leo Babauta, I did a
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/without">year of living without</a>.
Each month I tried to live without something to see if it was actually
something I needed in my life. It’s a fun experiment, one I personally
recommend to anyone.
</p>
<p>
This year, I’m gonna do it again but with the same twist I tried—very
unsucessfully—last year. Instead of doing twelve one-month long
experiments, I’m just going to do two but for the entire year. The two
things I’m going to live without are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Coffee
</li>
<li>
YouTube
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Coffee is something I don’t think I need in my life and I can replace it
with tea or with something else. I went months here and there without
coffee but never an entire year so it’s going to be interesting to see
if that has any effect on my body.
</p>
<p>
YouTube, I just think it does more harm than good to my mind and so I’m
gonna try to the entire year without consuming content on the platform.
Two exceptions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If someone is showing me a video on their device I’m going to watch it
</li>
<li>
If it’s a video embedded somewhere related to some actually important
news that are relevant to me.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Those are the two exceptions, everything else is banned in 2024. I’ll
replace YouTube with more books and podcasts. And speaking of books…
</p>
<h2>
Resolutions
</h2>
<p>
Read more books is one of my new year resolutions. I might write about
what I’m reading during the year. Will also try to keep my
<a href="https://literal.club/manuelmoreale" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Literal</a>
profile up to date. The other resolutions are to drink more water, no
screens in the bedroom, and take more care of my body. I have plans for
how to tackle all those items and I’ll blog about in the upcoming weeks.
</p>
<p>
Have a great new year everyone!

<h2 id="the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago-and-we-lost">The IDEs we had 30
years ago… And we lost</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>I grew up learning to program in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Back
then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I
used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had.
Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun
to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with
our current state of affairs. This time around, I want to look at the
pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the
PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy
from the IDEs of today—yet it feels as if we went through a dark era
where we lost most of those features for years and they are only
resurfacing now. If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and
a little rant on “bloat”. But, more importantly, read on to gain
perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future
feature launches more critically. ↫ Julio Merino Fast forward to today,
and the most popular text editor among programmers is a website running
in Chrome in a window. No wonder most popular applications are Electron
trashfires now. Times sure have changed.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-apple-silicon-vms-so-different">Why are Apple silicon
VMs so different?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Running macOS virtual machines (VMs) on Apple silicon Macs may not
seem popular, but it has long been one of Apple’s important goals. Yet,
if you do use a virtualiser on an M-series Mac, you’ll know how
different it is from those that virtualise macOS and other operating
systems on Intel Macs. This article explains why virtualisation is so
important, and how it has become so different. ↫ Howard Oakley Excellent
read, as always from Howard Oakley.</p>

<h2 id="rust9x-update-rust-1.76.0-beta">Rust9x update: Rust
1.76.0-beta</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>20 months since the initial release, Rust9x is back, whether you like
it or not! I’ve spent the last couple of days migrating the changes from
Rust 1.61-beta to Rust 1.76-beta, and filling some of the holes in API
support on the way. ↫ Dennis Duda Yes, this is Rust ported to Windows
9x, and this new releases comes with a lot of the benefits in 1.76, but
also adds backtrace support, thread parking support, and initial work on
adding 64bit support for 64bit Windows XP and newer.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-31, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog</p>
<p>A while back, my gastroenterologist insisted that I get accustomed to
eating high-fiber cereal in the morning. And so I have. It does work. He
recommended Fiber One. I didn’t like it, but I put up with it until I
found Trader Joe’s version, which tasted much better. Since Bloomington
is more than an hour […]</p>

<h2 id="podcasts-i-still-listen-to">Podcasts I still listen to</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Podcasts I still listen to
</h1>
<p>
It’s been <a href="2021-07-27_Podcasts_I_listen_to">a while</a>. Time
for an update!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
3d6 Down The Line, with Jon and friends. There’s an RPG podcast back in
the list! Mostly because they play in Arden Vul and I am running the
same megadungeon. I claim that listening to the podcast counts as prep!
😁
</li>
<li>
Into the Megadungeon, with Benjamin Laurence. Another RPG podcast. What
is happening‽
</li>
<li>
Daydreaming about Dragons, by Judd Karlmann. I guess I do listen to RPG
podcasts after all.
</li>
<li>
Zock Bock Radio, by
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a>.
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@hasran" title="@hasran@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="hasran">@hasran</span></a>, and others,
mostly German, some English interviews.
</li>
<li>
99% Invisible, with Roman Mars. I still love it. Design, architecture,
urban planning…
</li>
<li>
What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law, with Professor Elizabeth Joh.
Still the only way I can bear hearing about Trump.
</li>
<li>
Articles of Interest, by Avery Trufelman. Love hearing about fashion and
history.
</li>
<li>
In Our Time. History, Science, Philosophy, with Melvin Bragg. The best
topics, clearly.
</li>
<li>
Thinking Allowed, with Laurie Taylor. Social science, an old classic.
</li>
<li>
Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History. These episodes are long. But they’re
good.
</li>
<li>
Am Wegrand. A botanist explaining flowers to a journalist. In Swiss
German.
</li>
<li>
Farm to Taber, with Sarah Taber. Agriculture! I didn’t even know that I
cared, but I guess I do.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Podcasts still in the list but it’s been a while:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Zoo Zürich Backstage. Still some episodes left unplayed.
</li>
<li>
Denkangebot Podcast. Political stuff, in German, by Katharina Nocun.
</li>
<li>
Hörkombinat: Politik, in German, by Elvira Isenring and Dominik Dusek.
</li>
<li>
Historisch. Schweizer Geschichte, in German, by Dr. Nicole Billeter.
</li>
<li>
History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps, by Peter Adamson.
</li>
<li>
History of Indian Philosophy, by Jonardon Ganeri and Peter Adamson.
</li>
<li>
History of Africana Philosophy, by Chike Jeffers and Peter Adamson.
</li>
<li>
History of Byzantium, by Robin Pierson.
</li>
<li>
History of the Crusades, by Sharyn Eastaugh.
</li>
<li>
The British History Podcast, by Jamie Jeffers.
</li>
<li>
Ten Very Big Books. I was reading through the Malazan Books of the
Fallen again, and that podcast seemed perfect for the occasional
summary. But the book has been lying on the coffee table for a while,
now…
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Done, but great:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
History of Rome, by Mike Duncan.
</li>
<li>
Revolutions, by Mike Duncan.
</li>
<li>
The Anthropocene Reviewed, by John Green.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Heard about but not added:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The German History Podcast.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And there are a gazillion of podcasts in unsubscribed state, or in
subscribed-but-no-downloads state. Yikes.
</p>
<p>
I guess I don’t have to buy audiobooks.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, I listen to far less podcasts now that I work from home instead
of walking to the office and back every day.

<h2 id="good-old-suse-kde3-on-todays-opensuse">Good old SUSE: KDE3 on
today’s openSUSE</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Until some time, SUSE shipped with a default desktop environment
called KDE3, and even today, openSUSE is the only distribution, for
which KDE3 packages are still available. In contrast to the
fork TDE (Trinity Desktop Environment), these are the original KDE3
packages, which have also been used in earlier versions of SUSE Linux,
and they were merely adapted to run under modern Linux systems. In the
following tutorial, you are going to learn how to set up a current
openSUSE system, with the look and feel of the original SUSE versions. ↫
Lioh Möller at SpaceFun An absolutely great idea, as it makes it much
easier to see what the main desktop environments were like many moons
ago. I hope similar tutorials spring up for GNOME and other desktop
environments.</p>

<p>
Wiktopher was released on paperback! Our small collection of
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/inventory/wik_bdn.jpg" target="_blank">self-published
books</a> is growing.
</p>
<p>
We finished the upholstery in the saloon, Pino feels like a new boat. We
also published an article on this past summer’s

Last September Devine and a group of people went on a 3-day train ride
from Seattle to St Louis for the last edition of

As mentionned in November’s update,
<a href="https://tinyletter.com/hundredrabbits" target="_blank">Tinyletter</a>,
the service we use to send out our monthly newsletter, is <b>shutting
down</b> in February 2024. We will now be using Sourcehut to send our
monthly updates. With this new system our emails will be leaner than
ever, using plain text(no html). We cannot transfer accounts to this new
list ourselves, so <b>if you want to keep receiving updates by email
please
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~rabbits/newsletter" target="_blank">sign
up again here</a></b>. Clicking on the subscribe button will open your
email client, you can leave the body and subject of the email blank. We
will keep sending newsletters with TinyLetter until the end of January
2024, so as to give people time to make the switch. If you sign up to
this new list, unsuscribe from the old newsletter to avoid getting two
emails with the same content for December and January. We hope you
continue to follow our updates.
</p>
<p>
Note that since it’s our first time sending updates with the new
newsletter format, it may look a little wonky. We’ll improve on it next
month.
</p>
<p>
2023 was kind to us, we look forward to seeing what 2024 brings! We hope
the coming year treats you all well.
