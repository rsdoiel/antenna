Cells Defend Their DNA From Damage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
How do immature egg cells maintain genetic quality for decades before
they mature? Scientists find unusual safeguards in this quiescent cell
that may inform research into fertility.

feel like crap today, the Knicks were blown out by the Indiana team, the
series is tied 2-2 but it feels much worse. The headline in the

water in Game 4, tie series 2-2.” Yeah. I don’t know how we recover from
this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. “It’s
been a great season, but we’re tired. We’re headed to the beach, we’ll
see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support.” I would nod my
head and say “Yeah that makes sense.” Whatever. I may spend today
sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for
sure, and I will watch.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Typeclasses Haskell Blog</p>
<p>Lately I’ve started using streaming library by default instead of the
utilities in Data.List. The standard manipulation functions for list are
part of the Haskell Report and are a staple of every introductory
Haskell tutorial, but I’m over it. I don’t think they’re very useful for
everyday programming, and I don’t even think they’re great as an
introductory topic either.</p>

unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos&quot;&gt;migrate my photo library from Apple&#39;s now-defunct Aperture to Photos&lt;/a&gt;, so I could take advantage of Apple&#39;s iCloud Photo Library (don&#39;t worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple&#39;s iCloud originals).&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models,
their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like
Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work
with the new camera models.
</p>
<p>
I don’t envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple’s official
successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits
as a semi-decent library organizer), they’ve <em>generally</em> done
well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS
17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.

Vision Pro has the same effective resolution as Quest 3… Sometimes?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s
Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &amp; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest
3, prompted by RoadToVR’s Quest 3 Has Higher Effective Resolution, So
Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I
suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good
intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric
shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make
mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two
parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames
(including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a
testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision
Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult
than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if
you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an
article that isn’t just over my head, but also over most of your heads.

<h2 id="the-emacs-window-management-almanac">The Emacs window management
almanac</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Window management in Emacs gets a bad rap. Some of this is deserved,
but mostly this is a consequence of combining a very flexible and
granular layout system with rather coarse controls. This leaves the door
open to creating and using tools for handling windows that employ and
provide better metaphors and affordances. As someone who’s spent an
unnecessary amount of time trying different approaches to window
management in Emacs over the decades, I decided to summarize them here.
Almanac might be overstating it a bit – this is a primer to and a
collection of window management resources and tips. ↫ Karthik
Chikmagalur I honestly had no idea Emacs was this… Advanced, complex,
and feature-laden. I mean, I thought Emacs’ complexity was just a meme,
but reading this article it seems the memes don’t do it justice.</p>

I just put one idea on my blog for a day and leave it at that because I
think the idea is important enough on its own, and that any explanation
would dilute it. Yesterday’s one sentence
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was
based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their
executive editor in a recent
<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>,
who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not
reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion
leaders, to determine what they cover, that’s marketing, not journalism.
Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over
another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is
not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my
readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept
this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their
responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the
tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the
climate?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I’m never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It’s real, it’s
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by “green” I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we’re not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn’t help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here’s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there’s no “thinking it through” when things are
so complex unless you’re a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don’t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.
</p>

The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there’s an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don’t know what to do. But also: there’s your answer if
you’re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
This is why a public “chain of trust” needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don’t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)

<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>People usually say that I’m a pleasure to work with and that I’ve a
highly collaborative spirit. The fact that I’m good at teamwork doesn’t
mean that it comes naturally to me. Quite on the contrary, being a good
teammate is a skill that I constantly need to train and refine. The
following are things I remind myself on a daily basis, à la Dune’s inner
monologues, to be a better teammate at work.</p>

<h2 id="apple-ii-desktop-currently-testing-1.4-alpha-releases">Apple II
DeskTop currently testing 1.4 alpha releases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Disassembly and enhancements for Apple II DeskTop (a.k.a. Mouse
Desk), a “Finder”-like GUI application for 8-bit Apples and clones with
128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics (560×192),
an optional mouse, and the ProDOS 8 operating system. ↫ Apple II DeskTop
GitHub page The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer Apple II
DeskTop, and fix bugs and enhance it in the process. I didn’t actually
know that the Apple IIgs initially shipped with this instead of the 16
bit GS/OS, which is the operating system I personally associate with the
IIgs. Apple II DeskTop was largely 8 bit, and built on top of ProDOS 16,
and didn’t really take full advantage of the IIgs hardware. It wasn’t
until version 4.0 of the system software that the IIgs switched over to
GS/OS. The latest release is v1.4-alpha9, released a few days ago. Apple
II DeskTop is still entirely compatible with Apple II machines and
clones from before the IIgs, as well, and it runs in emulators, too. We
actually already covered this project a few years ago, but a reminder
that this exists never hurt anyone.</p>

<h2 id="hello-world-on-ssd1306-using-arduino">Hello World on SSD1306
using Arduino</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Lloyd Rochester Blog</p>
<p>Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino After looking through numerous
libraries and examples to control the SSD1306 with Arduino, I’ve found
nothing simple. There are some really powerful libraries with lots of
support. In this post I’ll post the simplest possible “Hello World”
example on an SSD1306 using an Arduino Due. Note, if you need to draw
shapes, lines, movement you’ll have to extend this example. Code Used in
Arduino IDE.</p>
