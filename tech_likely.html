<p>If we want to see even a modest reboot of blogging, as a community
thing, we’re going to have to start with something like blogrolls. I
wrote a bit yesterday about how blogrolls came about, and weblogs.com
and how that led to RSS and feed readers. This time, we don’t have to
wait for feeds to show up, they’re already there. It should happen more
quickly.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-know-about-dois">What do we know about DOIs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Crossref holds metadata for approximately 150 million scholarly
artifacts. These range from peer reviewed journal articles through to
scholarly books through to scientific blog posts. In fact, amid such
heterogeneity, the only singular factor that unites such items is that
they have been assigned a document object identifier (DOI); a unique
identification string that can be used to resolve to a resource
pertaining to said metadata (often, but not always, a copy of the work
identified by the metadata).
</p>
<p>
What, though, do we actually know about the state of persistence of
these links? How many DOIs resolve correctly? How many landing pages, at
the other end of the DOI resolution, contain the information that is
supposed to be there, including the title and the DOI itself? How can we
find out?
</p>
<p>
The first and seemingly most obvious way that we can obtain some of
these data is by working through the most recent sample of DOIs and
attempting to fetch metadata from each of them using a standard python
script. This involves using the httpx library to attempt to resolve each
of the DOIs to a resource, visiting that resource and seeing what the
landing page yields.
</p>
<p>
Even this is not straightforward. Landing pages can be HTML resources or
they can be PDF files, among other things. In the case of PDF files, to
detect a run of text is not simple as a single line break can be enough
to foil our search. Nonetheless, when using this strategy we find the
following statistics:
</p>
<p>
Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br> Number of HTTP 200 response:
3301*<br> Percentage of HTTP 200 responses: 66.02%<br> Number of titles

<li>an HTTP 200 response means that the web page loaded correctly
</p>
<p>
While these numbers look quite low, the problem here is that a large
number of scholarly publishers use Digital Rights Management techniques
on their sites that block a crawl of this type. We can use systems like
Playwright to remote control browsers to do the crawling, so that the
request looks as much like a genuine user as possible and to evade such
detection systems. However, lots of these sites detect headless browsers
(where the browser is invisible and running on a server) and block them
with a 403 Permission Denied error.
</p>
<p>
There’s
<a href="https://github.com/infosimples/detect-headless" target="_blank">a
great Github javascript suite</a> that aims to help evade headless
detection. The tests it uses are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
User Agent: in a browser running with puppeteer in headless mode, user
agent includes Headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
App Version: same as User Agent above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plugins: headless browsers don’t have any plugins. So we can say that if
it has plugin it’s headful, but not otherwise since some browsers, like
Firefox, don’t have default plugins.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plugins Prototype: check if the Plugin and PluginsArray prototype are
correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mime Type: similar to Plugins test, where headless browsers don’t have
any mime type
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mime Type Prototype: check if the MimeType and MimeTypeArrayprototype
are correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Languages: all headful browser has at least one language. So we can say
that if it has no language it’s headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Webdriver: this property is true when running in a headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Time elapse: it pops an alert() on page and if it’s closed too fast,
means that it’s headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Chrome element: it’s specific for chrome browser that has an element
window.chrome.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Permission: in headless mode Notification.permission and
navigator.permissions.query report contradictory values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Devtool: puppeteer works on devtools protocol, this test checks if
devtool is present or not.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Broken Image: all browser has a default nonzero broken image size, and
this may not happen on a headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Outer Dimension: the attributes outerHeight and outerWidth have value 0
on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Connection Rtt: The attribute navigator.connection.rtt,if present, has
value 0 on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mouse Move: The attributes movementX and movementY on every MouseEvent
have value 0 on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the stealth plugin for Playwright also allows us to evade most of
these checks. This just leaves Mouse Move and Broken Image detection,
which I thought would not outweigh all the other factors. We can also
jitter the connection with arbitrary delays so that it should appear to
be coming at random intervals, rather than a robotic crawl.
</p>
<p>
Yet the basic fact is that we are still blocked from crawling many
sites. This does not happen when we put the browser into headful mode,
so current detection techniques have clearly evolved in the past half
decade (since Detect Headless) was designed.
</p>
<p>
If, however, we run the browser in a headful mode, the results are
somewhat stunningly different:
</p>
<p>
Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br> Number of HTTP 200 response:
4852<br> Percent of HTTP 200 responses: 97.04%<br> Number of titles
found on landing page: 2547<br> Percentage of titles found on landing
page: 50.94%<br> Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 2424<br> Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 48.48%<br> Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page:
1574<br> Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 31.48%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 2085<br> Percentage of PDFs found
on landing page: 41.70%<br> Percentage of PDFs found on landing pages
that loaded: 42.97%
</p>
<p>
Let’s talk about the resolution statistics. Other studies, looking at
general links on the web, have found a link-rot rate of about 60%-70%
over a ten-year period
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jyT6HY" target="_blank">(Lessig,
Zittrain, and Albert 2014; Stox 2022)</a>. The DOI resolution rate that
we have, with 97% of links resolving (or a 3% link-rot rate), is far
better and more robust than a web link in general.
</p>
<p>
Is 3% a good or a bad number? It’s more robust than the web in general,
but it still means that for every 100 DOIs, just under 3 will fail to
resolve. We also cannot tell whether these DOIs are resolving to the
correct target, except by using the metadata detection metrics (are the
title and DOI on the landing page, which we could only detect at a far
lower rate). It is entirely possible for a website to resolve with an
HTTP 200 (OK) response, but for the page in question to be something
very different to what the user expected, a phenomenon dubbed content
drift. A good example is domain hijacking, where a domain name expires
and spam companies buy them up. These still resolve to a web page, but
instead of an article on RNA, for a hypothetical example, the user gets
adverts for rubber welding hose. That said, other studies are also prone
to this and there is no guarantee that content drift doesn’t affect a
huge proportion of supposedly good links in the other studies, too.
</p>
<p>
Of course, one of the most frustrating elements of this exercise is
having to work around publisher blocks on content when visiting using a
server-only robot script. It’s important for us periodically to monitor
the uptime rate of the DOI system. We also recognise, though, that
publishers want to block malicious traffic. However, we can’t perform
our monitoring in an easy, automatic way if headless scripts are blocked
from resolving DOIs and visiting their respective landing pages. This is
not even a call for open access; it’s just saying that current anti-bot
techniques, sometimes implemented for legitimate reasons, stifle our
ability to know the landscape. Even if the bot resolved a DOI to just a
paywall, it would be easier for us to monitor this than it is now.
Similarly, CAPTCHA systems such as Cloudflare that would seem to offer
an easy way to distinguish between humans (good) and robots (bad) can
make life very difficult at the monitoring end. We would certainly be
grateful for any proposed solution that could help us to work around
these mechanisms.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
The context in which I wanted to know this information was so that we
can take a snapshot of a page and then, at a later stage, determine
whether it is down or has changed substantially. To do this, we are
developing
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/shelob/" target="_blank">Shelob</a>,
an experimental content drift spider system; that’s what we’ve used so
far to conduct this analysis. Over time, Shelob will evolve, we hope, to
give us a way to detect when content has drifted or gone offline. If,
however, we can’t detect whether an endpoint is good in the first place,
then we likewise cannot detect when things have gone wrong. On the other
hand, if, when we first visit, we find the DOI and title on the landing
page, but at some future point this degrades, we might be able to say
with some confidence that the original has died. I, personally, would
encourage publishers not to block automated crawlers, because it’s good
when we can determine these types of figures.

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6-released">KDE Plasma 6 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>KDE Plasma 6 has been released – and this is an important release
with two massive low-level stack upgrades. With Plasma 6, our technology
stack has undergone two major upgrades: a transition to the latest
version of our application framework, Qt, and a migration to the modern
Linux graphics platform, Wayland. We have done our best to ensure that
these changes are as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible,
so when you install this update, you will see the same familiar desktop
environment that you know and love. But these under-the-hood upgrades
benefit Plasma’s security, efficiency, and performance, and improve
support for modern hardware. Thus Plasma delivers an overall more
reliable user experience, while paving the way for many more
improvements in the future. Aside from this, there’s so much in this
release it’s hard to know where to begin. My favourite is the overhaul
of KDE’s default Breeze theme, which now uses far, far fewer frames,
meaning there’s fewer borders-on-borders. Spacing has also been made
more consistent within Breeze. Both of these efforts make KDE
applications and UI elements look a bit less cluttered and busy, which,
while easily missed if you don’t look for it, certainly cleans things up
nicely. Another important improvements is the addition of support for
HDR displays and colour management. Plasma on Wayland now has partial
support for High Dynamic Range (HDR). On supported monitors and
software, this will provide you with richer and deeper colors for your
games, videos, and visual creations. Set an ICC profile for each screen
individually and Plasma will adjust the colors accordingly. Applications
are still limited to the sRGB color space, but we are working on
increasing the number of supported color spaces soon. To improve
Plasma’s accessibility, we added support for color blindness correction
filters. This helps with protanopia, deuteranopia or tritanopia. Of
course, this release is accompanied by updates to a large number of KDE
applications, and several default settings in KDE have been changed as
well to better suit what most users would expect. Plasma Search has been
overhauled as well, making it faster and less resource-intensive, and
giving users the ability to better control how search results are
displayed. There’s a lot more here, so be sure to dive into the release
announcement, KDE Plasma 6 will find its way to your distribution or
operating system of choice over the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-28 Use of a calendar
</h1>
<p>
In the last millennium, I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs
Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs
Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line
utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I
wanted an online calendar.
</p>
<p>
The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:
</p>
<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>
<p>
Back then, Google didn’t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I. I switched to
<a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.
</p>
<p>
Today,
<a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="tadzik">@tadzik</span></a> posted a link to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event
description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload
it to a CalDAV server.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice!
</p>
<p>
Example usage, from the README:
</p>
<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>
<p>
My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the
correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL
is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs
failed silently, some of them created new collections with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename
as the collection name… and I didn’t get an warnings or error messages.
I mean, it makes sense. It’s like a filesystem, you can save whatever
you want. But it’s not what the calendar apps expect.
</p>
<p>
So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like
<code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into
Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them
is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of
<code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That’s the one!

<p>
Now I’m finally ready to go back to <code>caleb</code> and create the
config file, <code>~/.config/caleb.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[caldav]
url = &quot;https://example.org/radicale/alex/cae8e041-61d9-b51a-57db-294b07e8dc1e&quot;

<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Wear OS smartwatches have a dual-chipset architecture inclusive of a
powerful application processor (AP) and ultra low-power co-processor
microcontroller unit (MCU). The architecture has a powerful AP capable
of handling complex operations en-masse, and is seamlessly coupled with
a low power MCU. The Wear OS hybrid interface enables intelligent
switching between the MCU or the AP, allowing the AP to be suspended
when not needed to preserve battery life. It helps, for instance,
achieve more power-efficient experiences, like sensor data processing on
the MCU while the AP is asleep. At the same time, the hybrid interface
provides a seamless transition between these states, keeping a rich and
premium user experience without jarring transitions between power modes.
↫ Kseniia Shumelchyk on the Android Developers Blog The new OnePlus
Watch 2 is the first to use this new architecture, and the most
interesting part is that it runs not one, but two operating systems:
Wear OS, which is Android, running on the “AP”, and a smaller RTOS that
runs on the “MCU”. In the case of the OnePlus Watch 2, the “AP” is a
Snapdragon W5, while the “MCU” is a BES 2700, an ultra low power
microcontroller. I can’t seem to find any information on this “RTOS”,
but I’d really love to know what it’s based on.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of collecting data, here’s another major content player
signing a deal to sell your content to “AI” companies. The owner of
Tumblr and WordPress.com is in talks with AI companies Midjourney and
OpenAI to provide training data scraped from users’ posts, a report from
404 Media alleges. The report, based on an anonymous source inside the
company, says that deals between Automattic and the two AI companies are
“imminent.” It follows nebulous rumors that have spread on Tumblr over
the past week, suggesting a deal with Midjourney could provide a new
revenue stream for the site. ↫ Adi Robertson at The Verge We use

<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Meta will soon begin “collecting anonymized data” from users of its
Quest headsets, a move that could see the company aggregating
information about hand, body, and eye tracking; camera information;
“information about your physical environment”; and information about
“the virtual reality events you attend.” In an email sent to Quest users
Monday, Meta notes that it currently collects “the data required for
your Meta Quest to work properly.” Starting with the next software
update, though, the company will begin collecting and aggregating
“anonymized data about… device usage” from Quest users. That anonymized
data will be used “for things like building better experiences and
improving Meta Quest products for everyone,” the company writes. ↫ Kyle
Orland at Ars Technica Is it just me, or is the idea of Facebook
collecting this type of data in particular just exceptionally creepy? I
mean, browsing history or whatever is one thing – already bad enough –
but hand, body, and eye movements, and camera information? Of course,
this was the only expected course for Quest owners, but now that the
time is here, it still feels just as creepy as when we first imagined it
when Facebook bought Oculus.</p>

why shake up this tiny little corner of the system? What’s the possible
benefit. Or maybe this is just a bug and they’ll fix it? This is the

the voters express themselves, esp when I’m pretty sure he agrees. Biden
is a Democrat, and Netanyahu is a MAGA. Remember that. They are not
friends, and Biden has dropped very explicit hints that he’s thinking
that way. So give him an excuse to kick Netanyahu in the ass, and he’ll
be happy to do it. But he can’t openly threaten Israel now, not with
Trump over there saying he’d cut NATO, and thanks to him we’re ditching
Ukraine, even though Trump isn’t in office. All of our alliances are
fragile now, and getting worse every time Trump says or does something
awful. Biden has to take it steady. I listened to the interviews with
advocates for uncommitted, and no one even remotely suggested they’ll

are a lot of blogging communities out there in 2024, but we don’t think
of them that way. But they totally behave like a blogging community. I
remember when I was starting
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000621103057/http://www.weblogs.com/">weblogs.com</a>,
I wanted to get an idea of when sites were updating, so I didn’t have to
go hunting through a blogroll, clicking on links to find out if there
was anything new. So I wrote a script that worked off a list of blogs,
read each one in turn, and compared it with the last version we read,
and if there was a change, it would move it to the top of the list. I
didn’t just make it for myself, I shared it with everyone. There was a
mail list where people were freaking out about this. The server that
would read their blog every so often was called
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+subhonker">subhonker</a>.
This was something new and they were scared. I couldn’t show them the
benefit until the script had been running for a while. Everyone got
upset. I remember being confused and scared, but I guess from their
point of view it looked scary. I don’t know. In the end weblogs.com
became really popular, it became the central place to find out what’s
new with blogs, and then
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010123225500/http://weblogs.com/stories/">evolved</a>
to use <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> so we
could find changes in even more detail. I guess the thing is people
should see the benefit before they see the price? And as an innovator,
we have to be aware of this, people may not see the benefit until they
can <i>use</i> it.</p>

(and found it was pre-opted out, apparently because I’d already opted
out of being indexed by search engines). This prompted me to, once
again, do the old mental dance of “Ugh, I haven’t even used this account
in years, should I just delete it?” followed by “But I’d want a backup
first…” culminating in the power move of “omg how many thousands of
photos and gifsets did I reblog on this account? The backup’s going to
be like 100GB!” (OK, I guess that’s not a power move? The “dancing”
metaphor got away from me a bit.) I really don’t even care about 99% of
this; I just want the political theory stuff I had so meticulously
tagged. I requested an export anyway, but if what it produces doesn’t
let me browse posts by tag (as I suspect it won’t) it won’t be very
useful to me.

Oh and, I also found that my crazy online hater who’s been sending me
the odd hateful screed since I was literally 16 years old sent another
couple just last month. Sounds like they’ve embraced full-on Nazism now,
which makes a change from when they were just obsessed with Michael
Jackson. (Basically, this person hates me because my teenage self made a
really sensitive and nuanced blog post, as 16-year-olds do, that I
didn’t care about ol’ <abbr title="Michael Jackson">MJ</abbr> dying
because he was probably a pedo. Little did I know I was creating a
nemesis who would dog me until the end of time…)

Smith’s blog</strong> (date: 2024-02-28, from: Jessica Smith’s blog)</p>
<p>
Last night I was cooking a chicken stew, and I had to double-check my
recipe to remember which herbs I put in it (rosemary, thyme, basil, sage
and a bay leaf). As I was grabbing the little jars out of the cupboard,
it occurred to me that this list is pretty similar to that famous lyric
– <q>parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</q> – and wondered, “Hmm, why is
it I never put parsley in this? Or, actually, into anything?” So I
pulled out my little jar of parsley, gave the contents a sniff (parsley
really doesn’t have a very appealing smell, hey) and read the
description on the jar’s side:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A popular herb used to garnish or add a touch of colour to your
favourite meal. Great with sauces and egg dishes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“Oh yeah!” I remembered. “Parsley is so crap that even the parsley jar
can only suggest adding it to anything for cosmetic reasons. That’s why
I never use it.”
</p>
<p>
Clearly, it’s time we change the line in that song to “basil, sage,
rosemary and thyme”. And a bay leaf.

<p>In the 80s there was a tech press that reviewed software, and
explained OSes and hardware, so you really had a good idea what was
going on. They just don’t do that anymore. Haven’t for many years. But
along comes ChatGPT and I can get a

review</a> of hosting services that compete with Digital Ocean, just by
asking for it. I wanted to get an idea of how easy it would be to create
an open source app so it could be easily deployed, on any of them and
what the pros and cons were. I asked for a comparison between Digital
Ocean (where I host my servers now) and Amazon, Microsoft, Google and I
threw in <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>, just to anchor the
whole thing simplicity-wise. Even InfoWorld wouldn’t have done such an
in-depth review. This is a

<h2 id="on-posse">On POSSE</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
<strong>P</strong>ublish (on your) <strong>O</strong>wn
<strong>S</strong>ite, <strong>S</strong>yndicate
<strong>E</strong>lsewhere. It’s one of the principles of the
<a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">IndieWeb</a>. It’s the idea that
your content should live on your site, on a domain name you own and you
should then distribute that content in as many places as possible.
Overall it’s a nice idea but one I never felt compelled to make mine.
</p>
<p>
My content lives here, on my site. Everything in here is under my
control and it’s then distributed through three distribution channels.
</p>
<p>
The first—and most obvious—is the web itself. My content is distributed
to you via the Internet. You can ask your browser to get this page
you’re reading right now and get access to my content.
</p>
<p>
The second is RSS. You can tell your RSS reader to fetch the content
available on my website and you can then consume my content inside your
app of choice.
</p>
<p>
The final one is email. I send my posts via email because some people
prefer to stay up to date that way and who am I to prevent that from
happening?
</p>
<p>
But these three methods only take care of distribution and distribution
of content is only part of the equation. You then have interaction. The
point of putting content out there is to connect, to interact with
others, to exchange ideas, and to grow. And interactions, in my world,
happen via email. 95% of the interactions I have happen via email with
the occasional message on iMessage. Both of those communication methods
are always monitored because they live on my Mac and my phone.
</p>
<p>
Now, what if I were to follow the POSSE mantra? I’d probably sign up for
a bunch of different services and scatter my content everywhere there
are people. But those people might then comment and try to get in touch
with me on those platforms. Platforms I’d then have to monitor. And I
don’t know about you, but I don’t have time for that. And if I don’t
check them, those are lost connections, missed opportunities to interact
with other human beings.
</p>
<p>
That to me is a terrible outcome and it’s why don’t want to distribute
my content outside of those three channels. But maybe I’m wrong so if
you have a different opinion please reach out.

<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Of the approximately 5,500 exoplanets discovered to date, many have
been found to orbit very close to their parent stars. These close-in
planets provide a unique opportunity to observe in detail the phenomena
critical to the development and evolution of our own solar system,
including atmospheric mass loss and interactions with the host star.

<h2 id="apple-killed-music-on-the-move-for-me">2024-02-07 Apple killed
music on the move, for me</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me
</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about joining the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a>
crowdfunding. It’s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open.
Yay!
</p>
<p>
But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music
such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire
phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are
great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is)
where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool
until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC
formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me
from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.
</p>
<p>
In a fit of hate I decided I was going to
<a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of
iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did.
And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were
allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when
the iPod classic I had with
<a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed
<a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>,
all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And so now I don’t even know whether I want to listen to music any more
while I’m on the move.
</p>
<p>
Apple killed music on the move, for me.
</p>
<p>
At home it’s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable
music player.
</p>
<p>
I wish Tangara the best of luck.

<strong>2024-02-27</strong>. I joined the Kickstarter. Not because I
have a terribly good feeling about it but because I remember wanting a
portable audio player and I recently found, once again, that I really
hate the Apple Music app.

appears to be that it’s the personalities that matter, not what the

history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or
maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in
terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Windows users hate about Windows, it’s Windows
updates interrupting your workflow or gaming session with a popup asking
you to restart your PC finish installing the latest security update. It
happens at least once a month, because that’s how often Microsoft rolls
out security updates to Windows PCs. This may soon be a thing of the
past, as the company is now testing an update method called “hot
patching” for Windows 11 PCs. Hot patching is already in use on some
Windows Server editions, as well as Xbox, and now it appears the company
is preparing to bring it to devices running Windows 11. ↫ Zac Bowden at
Windows Central A welcome, good improvement every Windows user is going
to benefit from. This is the kind of improvements Microsoft should
really be focusing on, instead of adding more ads or useless “AI”
features.</p>

<h2 id="a-history-of-the-tty">A history of the tty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern
technology. From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in
appliances, there must be uncountable devices that think they are
connected to a TTY. I will omit the many interesting details of the
Linux terminal infrastructure here, as it could easily fill its own
article. But most Linux users are at least peripherally aware that the
kernel tends to identify both serial devices and terminals as TTYs,
assigning them filesystem names in the form of /dev/tty*. Probably a lot
of those people remember that this stands for teletype or perhaps
teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter is more
common. ↫ J. B. Crawford I remember first using Linux in like 2000 or
2001, and running into the abbreviation tty, and not having a single
clue what that meant since I came from a DOS and Windows background.
Over time I gained a lot more understanding of the structure of modern
UNIX-like systems, but it’s still great to read such a detailed history
of the concept.</p>

<h2 id="fast-poetry-and-pre-commit-with-github-actions">Fast Poetry and
pre-commit with GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>This is a short post to share a GitHub Actions pattern I use to setup
Poetry and pre-commit. These two tools cover most of my Python
development needs. I use Poetry to manage dependencies and pre-commit to
run code checks and formatting. The setup is fast because it caches the
virtual environment and the .local directory. I like to use custom
actions for this type of stuff. These are base actions that can be
re-used in multiple workflows.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-26, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
A series of advances seemed to promise the impossible: the existence of
quantum states that would never, ever fall into disarray. But physicists
are now discovering that the pull of disorder may not be so easily
overcome.

<h2 id="scopetrex">Scopetrex</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog</p>
<p>
Since I started hacking on computer hard- and software in the 1980s,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809" title="Motorola 6809">Motorola’s
6809 processor</a> is one of my favorite 8-bit CPUs. The 6809 is the
last generation of Motorola’s 8-bit CPU family, which started with the
6800 in 1974 and also was used in a number of microcontrollers of the
6805, HC11 and 9S12 families. The latter are still used in automotive
applications today. If you know the 6502, the 6809 feels quite familiar,
since it has an identical bus interface and very similar assembler
programming model without some of the constraints of the 6502 such as an
8-bit stack pointer or a lack of 16-bit address registers. This is not
really surprising, since a number of Motorola 6800 engineers left the
company to develop the 6502 and then joined MOS.
</p>
<p>
However, the 6809 only came to the market in 1978 - only a year before
the 68000 - and thus was quite late (and also rather expensive compared
to the 6502 and Z80). Only a few home computers used the processor,
e.g. the Dragon 32 and 64, the Tandy Color Computer and Thompson’s MO5
and TO7.
</p>
<p>
Another system which used the 6809 was a quite special game console, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex" title="Vectrex">Vectrex</a>.
Instead of a standard raster-based screen, the Vectrex used its CRT as a
vector display by controlling the X and Y deflection as well as the
intensity of the CRT’s electron beam directly. This is done by
generating analog voltages for the X and Y position using an 8-bit
digital-to-analog converter (DAC0808). Since DACs were quite expensive
back then, the single DAC analog output is multiplexed using a CD4052
analog multiplexer to the various connectors. The rest of the Vectrex
hardware is rather simple. A 6522 VIA connects to the DAC and some
control functions and a AY3-8912 chip generates sound and provides
another 8-bit port to interface to the Vectrex controllers. The
remaining chips are an 8 kB ROM, 1 kB of SRAM (32 kB in the Scopetrex),
some 74-series glue logic and a number of op-amps and other analog chips
to generate the analog signal outputs.
</p>
<p>
Vectrexes were only built for about two years and unfortunately have
become highly sought after (read: expensive) collector’s items. Luckily,
since the Vectrex uses only standard components, it is rather simple to
build a clone. The software situation is also quite nice, since Jay
Smith, then head of Smith Engineering (the designer of the Vectrex),
allowed new hard/software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis
and has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a
not-for-profit basis.
</p>
<p>
Such a Vectrex clone is available in form of the
<a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex
by TubeTime</a>. This is not a 100% replica since it uses a different
PCB form factor and a 32 kB SRAM instead of the original 1 kB, but is
perfectly compatible with all original software. It’s a good project to
get started with a more complex hardware build if you have some
soldering experience and most of the parts are still available new from
vendors such as Digikey or Mouser. The 6809 CPU (you will need at least
the 1.5 MHz version 68A09, a 68B09 will also work fine - both the
versions with internal clock generator and the one without that has the
“E” suffix can be used) and the sound chip (a AY3-8910 or YM2149 can
also be used) can be easily found on aliexpress.
</p>
<p>
My Vectrex build worked out of the box, now I only need to find a
suitable vector display. You can use an oscilloscope in X-Y mode, but
most modern scopes no longer feature a Z (intensity) input, so the
display is disturbed by vectors which should not be drawn (intensity =
0). If you have an old analog Hameg 203, this will work nicely… A
picture of the successful bringup is shown below.
</p>

<h2 id="i-have-a-new-website">I have a new* website</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-25, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Well, kinda. It’s not really new as you can see. The typeface
is—probably—still the same, the layout is mostly the same but lots of
things have changed. Let me go through them
</p>
<h2>
Typefaces
</h2>
<p>
This site is now—potentially—using web fonts. I’m saying potentially
because if you’re reading this on a Mac or on something running iOS
you’re probably seeing a system font. My old site was designed around
the Iowan typeface but that’s only available on iOS and Mac so most
people were seeing a different version using one of the other available
serif typefaces. That choice was because I went through a phase where I
was trying to push my site toward extreme minimalism. And if you ask me,
I had quite the success in that regard. My site was just 1 single HTTP
request, the CSS was stupidly optimized and everything was stupid fast
and stupid lightweight. But the designer in me was bothered by this and
I decided to bring back a web font. If you’re on Windows or Android
you’re now getting served Iowan as a web font. I’m also now using a
sans-serif font for a couple of small details. I have no idea what
you’re seeing because I’m defaulting on a system font.
</p>
<p>
I also messed with the typography a little bit and changed a few things
here and there but the site should still feel mostly the same. I’m not
done fine-tuning all this and I’m sure I’ll keep changing little things
here and there for months but I had enough and I decided to push it
live.
</p>
<h2>
New “Where do you go from here?” section
</h2>
<p>
Back when I designed my site, that section between the content of the
post and the archive was meant to be a place to store my contact info
and not much else. But it ended up being a place to dump all sorts of
stuff and there were just too many links and I didn’t want to add more
to make things worse.
</p>
<p>
That’s why I decided to rethink that section entirely and it’s now a lot
more organised but still quite minimal. All the old links are still
there but now there’s direct access to two new things.
</p>
<h2>
Guestbook
</h2>
<p>
The first of those two new things is a
<a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a>. I thought about making one months
ago but back then I didn’t want to mess with my site. But now it’s here
and I can’t wait to see what you people out there are going to write on
it.
</p>
<h2>
Supporters
</h2>
<p>
The second is the <a href="/supporters">supporters</a> page. I don’t
want kindness to go unnoticed and I plan to make that page a lot more
useful and structured. I want to provide as much value as possible to
those who are kind enough to support what I do and that’s going to be
just one of the places where I plan to do it.
</p>
<h2>
Closing thoughts
</h2>
<p>
I’m quite happy with this subtle refresh. My site’s been the same for
almost 7 years at this point but I still think it works quite well so I
don’t want to completely redesign it. At least not yet. Maybe in another
7 years.

<h2 id="lisp-in-small-processors">Lisp in Small Processors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog</p>
<p>
While AI is all the rage again, the previous AI wave was focusing on
languages like Lisp and Prolog and even built hardware with special
processors optimized to execute Lisp code, made by companies such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics" title="Symbolics">Symbolics</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines" title="Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI)">Lisp
Machines, Inc.</a>, and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_Explorer" title="TI Explorer">Explorer
Series by Texas Instruments</a>. The machines used OSes written in Lisp
and provided the user with large, bitmapped screens to operate a
mouse-based GUI and networking.
</p>
<p>
Lisp machines originated at
<a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu" title="MIT's AI Lab">MIT’s AI
Lab</a> and were influential for a number of reasons. A certain Richard
Stallman was a graduate student at the AI Lab and unhappy with the
commercialization of the Lisp technology by LMI and Symbolics, started
to develop Free Software such as Emacs and the gcc compiler and started
the Free Software Foundation. The LMI LAMBDA machine was based on
Western Digital’s NuBus bus system and was subsequently acquired by TI
to create the Explorer.
</p>
<p>
The NuBus was, in turn, used by Motorola 68k-based Macintosh and early
PowerPC systems as well as the NeXT Cube. These NuBus-based Macs were
subsequently used to create personal Lisp workstations which employed a
VLSI integrated Lisp chip and used the Mac as I/O system. Both Symbolics
and TI offered such a system, MacIvory and MicroExplorer, respectively.
The latest development is an emulator of Symbolics Lisp machines, the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GeneraOs" title="Genera OS">Genera OS</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you own a MacIvory or MicroExplorer card you want to sell,
please get in touch</strong>
</p>
<p>
However, there were also efforts to implement Lisp on smaller machines,
including popular 8-bit CPUs. The
<a href="https://archive.org/details/BYTE_Vol_04-08_1979-08_Lisp" title="BYTE August 1979">August
1979 issue of BYTE magazine</a> was dedicated to Lisp and did not only
provide a lot of background on the language and its application, but
also published the implementation of a Lisp interpreter written by S.
Tucker Taft in assembly for the Motorola 6800. Unfortunately, the space
in that issue was constrained, so only a part of the interpreter source
code was published and the complete code could be ordered from BYTE. 45
years later, this is no longer possible, so I thought the code was lost…
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the power of Mastodon, Pablo Marx (thanks a lot!) managed to
find the original listing of that Lisp implementation and sent me
<a href="files/BYTE_6800_LISP_Interpreter.pdf" title="Lisp source PDF">the
scanned document as PDF</a> as well as
<a href="https://github.com/pablomarx/lisp6800" title="Github 6800 Lisp repository">a
link to his github repository with the 6800 Lisp code</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested to know how a low-level implementation of a Lisp
VM, including the REPL, lambdas, and a garbage collector works, I can
recommend taking a look at this article and the accompanying source
code. I’m thinking of porting the VM to my
<a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex
Vectrex game console clone</a>. This is a fascinating piece of hardware
based on Motorola’s 6809 CPU, the successor of the 6800, which is not
binary compatible. However, the
<a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13975/how-did-the-6809-achieve-source-code-compatibility-with-the-6800" title="conversion">assembler
source code can be easily converted</a>. The Vectrex and the Scopetrex
clone use a vector CRT display, which makes developing software for the
system quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
Automatic conversion of the assembly code should also be possible,
e.g. there is a

<p>There’s a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0">Beatles song</a>,
by John Lennon, that was written by cribbing promotional items from a
19th-century
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite!#Background">circus
poster</a>. It’s kind of like asking ChatGPT to give you some random
phrases and presenting that as your creativity. I think I’m going to
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/4aafde35-2903-48e3-88c0-bcd8725ac702">try
that now</a>. I asked ChatGPT to write a poem using ideas from a random
song written by John Lennon. It chose Imagine. I asked that it write a
poem using the ideas in Day Tripper. And finally I asked it to write a
song based on the story of The Matrix.</p>

apparently my
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/24.html#a161904">post</a>
yesterday where I said I was “doing some of my best writing in ChatGPT”
was confusing. I meant literally what I said. <i>My</i> writing. Not
that I was using ChatGPT to do my writing for me. I can understand that
some people do that, writing isn’t one of their things. However writing
is one of my things. I’ve been writing every day for almost
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">thirty years</a>. My writing
style has changed a lot over the years. I don’t necessarily think it’s
gotten better, it’s just different. I would never post writing publicly
written by a anyone other than me without saying it was. Writing for me
is very personal. On the other hand, I don’t draw very well, never have.
I used to be good at box diagrams with arrows, but I’m really out of
practice. So if you see something colorful here, that <i>was</i> drawn
by a bot, unless it says otherwise. I think we all have to be very clear
about that. Now, I do write a lot in ChatGPT because I’m trying to get
it to help me solve problems, almost always technical. Basically you
have to
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/b4235922-c4e2-4996-89cf-48c34cf2af67">sketch</a>
out the problem in English very specifically so it gives you back what
you want. I never thought I’d be programming in English, but here I am
doing it. I really want a copy of everything I write, because someday I
might want to feed it into a bot other than ChatGPT. There’s the
lock-in. <i>They own part of me, and I don’t even get a copy. </i>Yes
yes I know I can download individual conversations, but not if they
include an image btw, did you think of that? And who has time to
remember to download them. This is fucked up. One of my action items is
to hook <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> up to their API so
I’m not relying on their editor. Every time you find yourself typing
into a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little
text box</a> the alarms should go off.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-25, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>It’s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then
a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone,
now my full time job. While there’s always things that can be improved,
it’s fair to say the search engine has never worked as well as it does
right now. A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps
biggest of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and
into a proper enterprise server.</p>
