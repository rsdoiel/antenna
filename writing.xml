The 31st Interactive Fiction Competition is now history! Results will go live on the [IFComp Website](https://ifcomp.org/comp/2024) at 7pm Eastern.

If you missed the awards livestream, it will be available for a few days on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/interactivefictioncomp) and will be permanently archived over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@IFTechFoundation) shortly.

Of course, we are already planning for the ‘26 Comp. Please provide your feedback on what went well, what could have gone better, what we should do more of, and what we should consider changing or leaving behind, by filling the [Post-Competition Survey](https://forms.gle/uzCX1MUQ8mUSbCvB8).

This year’s survey is a little more important than usual, as we’re seeking thoughts on the future of how we address the UK Online Safety Act, how much generative artificial intelligence should be allowed in the competition, whether or not you’d like us to continue the awards livestream, and highlighting some important new volunteer roles for those who are interested. Please check it out!</source:markdown>
