## Lego Horizon Adventures is a delightful, kid-friendly twist on Horizon Zero Dawn

date: 2024-11-13, updated: 2024-11-13, from: Polygon Website

Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West aren’t exactly kid-friendly. Both games were rated T for Teen, and I tend to think of them as these high-minded stories about found family, billionaire greed, and environmental collapse. So, reinterpreting those stories through plasticky slapstick feels somehow disingenuous. When Lego Horizon Adventures was announced, I immediately thought, [&#8230;]

## The geri-action movie Thelma lets 94-year-old June Squibb play the Tom Cruise game

This feature was previously published ahead of Thelma’s theatrical release. It has been updated for the film’s streaming release. Action movies used to be the domain of younger stars: All those gunfights, car chases, death-defying stunts, and nefarious-crime-thwartings take a lot of energy and flexibility, not to mention the ability to heal up afterward.
