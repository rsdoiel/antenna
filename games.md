date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website

Credit the COVID-19 pandemic, social media, or turnip gambling, but as of Nintendo’s latest financial data, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is second to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in all-time Switch software sales.

## This Game Boy Micro homage is trying to do too much

date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website

The Ayaneo Pocket Micro is the modern Sony Walkman of gaming handhelds — that is to say, its boxy, high-end design is strangely appealing, and because of its high price and narrow focus, it’s only going to please a certain type of person. To stand out from the crowd of Android gaming handhelds, of which [&#8230;]

## The weakest Donkey Kong Country is still pretty great

date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Polygon Website

Donkey Kong Country Returns just won’t stop returning. Players may recall the game’s initial launch for the Wii in 2010 and perhaps even the updated Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the 3DS from 2013, but that’s just the tip of the banana hoard. Returns was also reissued for both Wii and 3DS as part [&#8230;]

## When is Godzilla coming to Fortnite this week?

date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website

Godzilla is coming to Fortnite in Chapter 6 Season 1, ready to stomp on everything (and look extremely weird wearing Kicks while doing so). Compared to previous seasonal skins, like Solid Snake, Geralt of Rivia, and Wolverine, Godzilla’s intimidating bulk doesn’t quite transpose to a vaguely humanoid frame. But the character’s signature chonkiness (Fortnite’s Godzilla [&#8230;]

Roselia, the thorn Pokémon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Roselia can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Roserade is actually a really good grass- and poison-type attacker, so it’s worth grabbing a powerful one if you can. If you already have a shiny Roselia (or any of its family [&#8230;]

## The Helldivers 2 devs won’t have much to do with the movie, apparently

The upcoming Helldivers movie won’t heavily involve the developers of the game, according to Arrowhead Game Studios creative director Johan Pilestedt.

## How did these hit games find their first 1,000 players?

date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-10, from: Polygon Website

One poorly understood aspect of the modern games industry is the question of how players find new games. Particularly for smaller indie devs with little or no advertising budget, it’s sort of miraculous that any game can go from 0 players to thousands, let alone millions. Most people give the credit for breakout hit indie [&#8230;]
