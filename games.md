date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website

But also in that time, Nvidia’s longtime competitor AMD (which has [&#8230;]

## Kraven the Hunter embodies the fatal flaw of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Polygon Website

After seeing Kraven the Hunter in theaters in December 2024, I couldn’t stop thinking about one detail of the movie.

Kraven was a huge box-office flop, scoring around $60 million worldwide on a [&#8230;]

date: 2025-03-15, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website

Statistically, you probably haven’t seen the Monster Hunter movie, probably because it came out at exactly the wrong time. Paul W.S. Anderson’s adaptation of Capcom’s video game series was released in December 2020, during a period where many people were still staying home rather than going to the theaters. It’s one of the only box-office [&#8230;]

## Why Wheel of Time’s Josha Stradowski sees season 3 Rand as Mike Tyson

date: 2025-03-15, updated: 2025-03-14, from: Polygon Website

Rand al’Thor is a singular figure in the Wheel of Time series: Though there are other men who try their hand at channeling, Rand’s prophetic role as the Dragon Reborn means he’s the sole man who’s able to use magic effectively (or, at least, without eventually being driven mad).&#160; That also puts Josha Stradowski, the [&#8230;]
