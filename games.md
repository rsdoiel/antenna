date: 2024-10-30, updated: 2024-10-30, from: Polygon Website

The Marvel Cinematic Universe did not end with Avengers: Endgame or the Phase 3 wrap-up feature Spider-Man: No From Home, but it did take a break for a few years before Phases 4 and 5, and that return has been increasingly shaky.

## Best AK-74 loadout and class build in Black Ops 6

date: 2024-10-29, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Polygon Website

The best AK-74 loadout in Black Ops 6 (note: not the AK-47) bridges the gap between close-range combat and fighting at long distances because, while it packs a serious punch, it takes some work to control the recoil. In previous Call of Duty games, the AK-74 has featured as an SMG instead, whereas the AK-47 [&#8230;]

It has such a slow fire rate you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking this isn&#8217;t even an SMG at all because it&#8217;s by far the slowest in the [&#8230;]

Many fans of tabletop miniatures gaming feel as though the largest franchises in the space have, sadly, lost their edge.

## Best Jackal PDW loadout and class build in Black Ops 6

As soon as you unlock the Jackal PDW in Black Ops 6, you should start leveling it up right away. This is because, though it may have been nerfed since the beta, it&#8217;s still the best SMG at launch — and can tear enemies to shreds when kitted out correctly. While all of the SMGs [&#8230;]

## How Netflix’s Remarkable Life of Ibelin pulled off its World of Warcraft scenes without Blizzard’s knowledge

date: 2024-10-29, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Polygon Website

The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, now streaming on Netflix, is one movie nested inside another. The outer movie is a sensitive, moving documentary about Mats Steen, a Norwegian World of Warcraft player who died of a degenerative muscular disease at age 25.

## Best C9 loadout and class build in Black Ops 6

date: 2024-10-29, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Polygon Website

The best C9 loadout in Black Ops 6 may seem familiar, because it is essentially the MP5 from Call of Duty games of old. It&#8217;s one of the better SMGs in the game and while it&#8217;s not quite as strong as the Jackal PDW, it fills a slightly different role in that it excels at [&#8230;]
