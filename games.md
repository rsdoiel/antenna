## The best sci-fi and fantasy books of 2024

date: 2024-12-10, updated: 2024-12-10, from: Polygon Website

Our favorite books this year were so wonderfully human. A sexbot’s quest for self-determination; a haunted house inhabited by angry witches; more than one heartbreaking new take on time travel — genre fiction is always about how we live now, but this year how we live now seems so much closer to the surface.&#160; With [&#8230;]

## Can Murkrow be shiny in Pokémon Go?

Murkrow, the darkness Pokémon from Johto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Murkrow can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Honestly, Honchkrow is not a terrible option for both a dark- and flying-type attacker, if you have no better choices. It’s even better with its shadow form, where it’s strangely reliable.

## The 50 best movies of 2024

date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-09, from: Polygon Website

2024 was an oddball year for movies, heavily shaped by the disruption of the 2023 Hollywood strikes and an industry hedging its bets against a stronger 2025 by postponing many of its would-be blockbusters for a year or more. That left a lot of open space at multiplexes, which responded by booking smaller movies, from [&#8230;]
