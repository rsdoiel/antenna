date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website

Spyro Reignited Trilogy is coming to Xbox Game Pass on November 12 or, for those of you as calendar-blind as me, Tuesday. The bundle, originally released in 2018, includes remakes of Spyro the Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto’s Rage!, and Spyro: Year of the Dragon from the original PlayStation. Sypro Reignited Trilogy may scrap the classic [&#8230;]

## The host of Dropout’s Smartypants tells you how to throw a banger PowerPoint party

date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website

Of Dropout’s many fun new shows in 2024, the most exciting premise was Smartypants. It takes the concept of the “PowerPoint party,” where groups of friends get together to give individual presentations on topics they are obsessed with, and places it within the framing device of the “Smartypants society.” That means a who’s who of [&#8230;]

## Marvel remains ‘committed’ to Blade, despite removing it from the release calendar

date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website

Five years after announcing a reboot of Blade set within the continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel… still hasn’t made a reboot of Blade set within the continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fans got a tease — remember that post-credits scene in Eternals? — but theoretical star Mahershala Ali has yet to appear [&#8230;]

## Judero is a psychedelic trip through Scottish folklore

date: 2024-11-11, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website

Judero, released for PC on Sept. 16, swings for the fences with a do-it-yourself spirit that sets the game apart from both its AAA and indie contemporaries. As the first game developed by Talha and Jack Co — Talha Kaya (Soul Searching, Pill Baby) and Jack King-Spooner (Beeswing, Dujanah) — it’s the perfect example of [&#8230;]

## 10 video games that are actually funny

date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website

Life is a funny thing. You know what else is funny? Video games. Crafting an enjoyable or edifying gaming experience is challenging enough. But creating a game that manages to be hilarious? That’s a feat of design and writing worthy of admiration. If you find yourself in need of a good hearty chuckle, we’ve got [&#8230;]

## Sebastian Stan is so glad he doesn’t have to explain the ending of A Different Man

date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website

Aaron Schimberg’s fantastical dark comedy A Different Man is one of 2024’s richest, strangest movies —&#160;a film about a man who radically changes his appearance and his life, but is haunted by the success of someone who looks just like he used to. It’s a perfect viewing companion for The Substance, another woozy, disturbing 2024 [&#8230;]

## Arcane was always going to have a banger season 2 soundtrack

date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website

Arcane’s secret sauce has always been its soundtrack. There’s no better example of this than one of the early scenes of season 2’s first episode, as Caitlyn mourns the death of her mother. Rather than forcing grief-stricken dialogue to communicate how she’s feeling, the show cuts to a completely unique animation style, with stylized black [&#8230;]

## Europa is chill — its story isn’t

At the risk of being entirely unrelatable: You know that music they play at the spa? That synthy, spaced-out soundscape type of stuff that isn’t exactly music, but isn’t exactly not music? The sort of playlist you can find if you take a wrong turn from your favorite lo-fi playlist? Chord after relaxing chord, interspersed [&#8230;]
