date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

Ten years after Bloodborne&#8216;s release, its fans are still exploring the game and finding new secrets, while stubbornly waiting waiting for a sequel.

## K-Pop Demon Hunters and Star Wars Jedi is the crossover we never knew we needed

If someone had told me that my most recent hyperfixation, the Netflix phenomenon known as KPop Demon Hunters, would cross with my oldest, most beloved wire mother known as Star Wars, I’d have been very skeptical.
