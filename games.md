## Secret Level’s Outer Worlds episode is missing a key part of the game

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website

If The Outer Worlds could be summed up in three words, I’d go with “capitalism is bad.” That message is dressed up with silly mascot costumes, over-the-top advertising, and cheeky dialogue, but once you scratch at that silliness, the satire becomes quite clear. The Secret Level animated anthology spends one episode in this world, following [&#8230;]

## ​​​​Windblown uses friendship to get around roguelike dread
