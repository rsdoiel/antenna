date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website

For decades, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a misbegotten artifact of a specific era of network TV variety-show thinking, and Lucasfilm seemed content to pretend it never happened. Fans considered it a black mark on George Lucas’ franchise, and made it the butt of endless fandom jokes. But that’s changed over the past decade [&#8230;]
