Of Dropout’s many fun new shows in 2024, the most exciting premise was Smartypants. It takes the concept of the “PowerPoint party,” where groups of friends get together to give individual presentations on topics they are obsessed with, and places it within the framing device of the “Smartypants society.” That means a who’s who of [&#8230;]

## Sebastian Stan is so glad he doesn’t have to explain the ending of A Different Man

date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-11, from: Polygon Website

Aaron Schimberg’s fantastical dark comedy A Different Man is one of 2024’s richest, strangest movies —&#160;a film about a man who radically changes his appearance and his life, but is haunted by the success of someone who looks just like he used to. It’s a perfect viewing companion for The Substance, another woozy, disturbing 2024 [&#8230;]

## Arcane was always going to have a banger season 2 soundtrack

date: 2024-11-10, updated: 2024-11-08, from: Polygon Website
