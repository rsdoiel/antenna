## Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a better, more grown-up version of a quirky zombie classic

date: 2024-08-13, updated: 2024-08-13, from: Polygon Website

Even as Resident Evil has risen from the dead, Capcom&#8217;s other zombie franchise, Dead Rising, has been in a state of decay since 2016. But a new version of the original Dead Rising promises to breathe new life into the series&#160;&#8212;&#160;and might indicate that Capcom is ready to take its sillier zombie brand seriously again.

## Fall Guys in Fortnite is a bleak vision of the metaverse

date: 2024-08-13, updated: 2024-08-13, from: Polygon Website

Mediatonic released the bouncy, bumbling Fall Guys game in August 2020. During the pandemic, it served as a spot of joy in uneasy times. The game felt like what would happen if you made 50 Teletubbies compete on American Ninja Warrior simultaneously. It was bursting with energy. But now that it’s come to Fortnite, Fall [&#8230;]

## How tech limitations actually made Silent Hill and Crash Bandicoot better games

date: 2024-08-13, updated: 2024-08-13, from: Polygon Website

All video games are captive to the constraints of technology. But sometimes human ingenuity and art can creatively circumvent reality’s would-be limitations, resulting in something unexpected — except to those who worked tirelessly to make it possible. It’s difficult to imagine Silent Hill without its spooky, ominous fog, or Crash Bandicoot without crates to smash, [&#8230;]

## Can Lileep be shiny in Pokémon Go?

date: 2024-08-13, updated: 2024-08-07, from: Polygon Website

Lileep, the sea lily Pok&#233;mon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild in Pok&#233;mon Go. Yes, Lileep can be shiny in Pok&#233;mon Go! Neither of these Pok&#233;mon are going to see much use as attackers, gym defenders, nor PvP Pok&#233;mon, but getting a shiny is still nice for your collection. The fact that Lileep&#8217;s [&#8230;]

## All new Helldivers 2 enemies should be revealed in-game

date: 2024-08-12, updated: 2024-08-12, from: Polygon Website

The latest Helldivers 2 update is the biggest yet, and fans are unhappy with its balance changes and flamethrower nerfs designed to make liberal application of cleansing flame less overwhelmingly popular. While many players are eagerly awaiting more buffs from Arrowhead, I&#8217;m excited for a whole other reason: There&#8217;s a big cloud of Terminid spores [&#8230;]

The developers of Stalker 2, GSC Game World, released a massive 35-minute video to YouTube on Monday teasing the upcoming sequel of their beloved open-world shooter franchise.

## Get the Borderlands Pandora’s Box Collection for less than a night out at the movies

date: 2024-08-12, updated: 2024-08-12, from: Polygon Website

At this point, I think we can safely assume that nobody is going to spend their hard-earned money on tickets to see the Borderlands movie. The reviews from fans and critics have been absolutely scathing, and frankly, I think we all deserved better. Borderlands is a looter-shooter franchise that has a surprising amount of lore [&#8230;]
