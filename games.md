## The best sci-fi movies you can watch at home

date: 2024-09-04, updated: 2024-09-04, from: Polygon Website

Science fiction, to echo Ursula K. Le Guin, is not predictive, but descriptive. While most science fiction films attempt (and fail) to extrapolate the ideas and concerns of their respective present to predict what the world may look like in the not-so-distant future, these extrapolations ultimately amount to stories that exist in conversation with the [&#8230;]

Ten years ago this month, when The Adventure Zone started as a one-off actual play experiment on the My Brother, My Brother and Me podcast, two of its four hosts worked here, at Polygon.

## Prosecutor’s Gambit is the best Ace Attorney story since the original trilogy

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-09-03, from: Polygon Website

The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is closing a loop that’s been open a long time. The first Investigations game, a spinoff of the popular lawyer-based, detective-adjacent adventure games starring Phoenix Wright, was released in 2009 (or 2010 in English). Despite following fan-favorite prosecutorial rival Miles Edgeworth, it didn’t sell well, particularly in the West. And [&#8230;]

## Can Wooloo be shiny in Pokémon Go?

Wooloo, the sheep Pokémon from Galar, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Wooloo can be shiny in Pokémon Go! The adorable sheep orb, Wooloo, is a great shiny with its color scheme inverting.

## Rethinking Lara Croft was a ‘unique pressure,’ says Tomb Raider showrunner

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-08-31, from: Polygon Website

Lara Croft is “adventurous.” She “hits hard.” She&#8217;s “slick,” “sleek,” “sexy,” and “proficient in dual-wielding pistols.” And the definition of all those qualities is something different to every player that has stepped into her boots over the last 30 years. So what does Lara Croft need to be to be Lara Croft?&#160; It’s a question [&#8230;]

## Pokémon Go Ditto disguises list for September 2024

## Mass Effect: The Board Game prioritizes tactical action over space opera

Board games based on popular video game licenses, much like the recently released Borderlands, are — more often than not — a bit shit.

The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated.
