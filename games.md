All too often, publishers pull the plug on video games, whether that means delisting them from digital storefronts or shutting multiplayer servers off. The Stop Killing Games movement, spearheaded by YouTuber Ross Scott, is fighting against publishers killing their games, what it calls “a radical assault on consumer rights and even the concept of ownership [&#8230;]

date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website

If anyone can lay claim to the most iconic track in Nintendo’s jubilant kart racer, it’s probably Twitch streamer Technical. The 22-year-old holds the distinction of having the fastest possible run time in Mario Kart 8’s Rainbow Road, both for original version and the Deluxe re-release on Switch. Naturally, the speed demon has been grinding [&#8230;]

## The Jurassic Park franchise could have been a lot worse — and there’s proof

date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website

By now, it’s a familiar pattern: A new Jurassic Park franchise movie movie comes out during the summer, garnering middling and sometimes exhausted-sounding reviews. Yes, it has some decent special effects and maybe a fun set piece or two, but it’s not a patch on Steven Spielberg’s 1993 original. Terms like “out of ideas,” “incurious,” [&#8230;]

## The Jurassic World movies just had their Last Jedi ‘nope’ moment

date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website

In 2018, Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom gave the 25-year-old Jurassic Park franchise its most ambitious, startling shift since the first movie brought dinosaurs into the modern world. Until that point in the series, the various resurrected dino species had been confined to parks, islands, and experimental facilities, which hapless humans had to enter [&#8230;]

## Developer’s Game Pass critique has set off a firestorm

date: 2025-07-07, updated: 2025-07-07, from: Polygon Website

Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription is likely the best deal around: For a fraction of the price of a full game, you get access to hundreds of titles every month, some of which are brand new. But when video games cost millions to make, and news of studio layoffs are constant, you don’t need to look [&#8230;]

AMC Plus’ ongoing adventure series Nautilus is set before the events of Jules Verne’s classic science fiction novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, following a young Nemo shortly after he built his submarine. That gave Star Trek: Discovery’s Shazad Latif the chance to make the mysterious captain his own. “I had free rein, because we [&#8230;]
