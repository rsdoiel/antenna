## This 4 TB SSD is matching its lowest price ever

Listen, I love the ROG Ally X, but its 1 TB of built-in storage barely puts a dent in my Steam Library. I know I could use a microSD card for some extra space, but the sub-optimal transfer speeds means downloading anything takes forever, and I don’t have that kind of time. Thankfully, there’s an [&#8230;]

Fans have wondered what HBO’s new Harry Potter TV show will be like since the moment it was announced in 2023: What would a long(er)-form retelling of the classic book series look like? Could the show get out from underneath the shadow of writer J.K. Rowling’s gender politics? Do we need to see Hogwarts again, [&#8230;]

## The newest Two Point management sim is satisfying, monotonous, and punny

Two Point Museum does not care whether I have to make dinner or not.

## Practical Pockets treasure map location and solution in Avowed

Practical Pockets is unusual as far as Avowed treasure maps go. This Emerald Stair map is looking out from the treasure&#8217;s location, not showing you where it is. Lucky for you, the location is within close reach and has few enemies patrolling nearby (unlike the region’s Painter&#8217;s Regret treasure map map). The reward at the [&#8230;]

## Painter’s Regret treasure map location and solution in Avowed

Painter&#8217;s Regret is one of the first treasure maps you can get in the Emerald Stair region of Avowed — and potentially one of the more dangerous quests there as well. The map itself is in a safe area, but the treasure location is surrounded by a group high-level enemies. Your reward is a trinket [&#8230;]

## Monster Hunter Wilds is so streamlined, it may have lost its soul

A large beast covered in fur dives through a small, circular arena in the Iceshard Cliffs, tendrils of segmented scales twisting away from its body as it lunges forward and attempts to knock me off balance. I dive between its legs, blades whirling, opening a wound on its exposed chest. Instinctively I take advantage of [&#8230;]
