date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website

The original PlayStation made its debut in Japan back in Dec. of 1994, meaning that very soon, the Sony console will be 30 years old. To celebrate, Sony is rolling out 30th anniversary editions of its current generation of hardware, including the PlayStation 5 Pro and regular PlayStation 5, all sporting the grey colors of [&#8230;]

## The cover of the new Discworld tabletop RPG brings back a flood of memories

date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-09, from: Polygon Website

If, like me, you grew up in the U.K. in the 1980s (I appreciate that you probably didn’t), then the covers of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels must exert a strong nostalgic pull on you. In fact, they probably do if you’re any sort of fan of Pratchett’s long-running comedy fantasy series. Josh Kirby’s artwork was [&#8230;]

## Pokémon and Planet Earth collide in this incredible YouTube series

date: 2024-10-10, updated: 2024-10-10, from: Polygon Website

This fan-made YouTube series has given me a newfound appreciation for the majesty of Pokémon. It’s called “Pokéarth” and it reimagines the fictional creatures as if they were the subjects of nature documentary series like Planet Earth. The episodes show a new side to beloved Pokémon like Wailord and Spheal. Animator EnlargedKai has released four episodes [&#8230;]

## Mario &#038; Luigi’s new game feels fun and familiar, but maybe a little formulaic

The first new Mario &#38; Luigi game in nearly a decade is the long-awaited return to Nintendo’s wonderful sub-franchise of action role-playing games. Mario &#38; Luigi: Brothership evokes memories of the Mario Bros.’ lighthearted and colorful story-driven games, plus those of other Nintendo games, like The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Spirit Tracks.

## How to stream Xbox games to your Steam Deck, ‘one weird trick’ edition

I’ve owned the Xbox Series S, which I affectionately call the Baby Xbox, since launch day. And yet I almost never play any games on it, compared to my other devices. Why? Because until recently, I didn’t have the ability to stream Xbox games to my Steam Deck. Now, thanks to a little app called [&#8230;]

## Omg, they’re finally singing in a Wicked trailer!

date: 2024-10-09, updated: 2024-10-09, from: Polygon Website

Wicked is one of the most famous and successful musicals of all time, with iconic songs like “Defying Gravity,” “Popular,” and “For Good” transcending beyond musical theater. Based on the 1995 fantasy novel by Gregory Maguire, itself inspired by The Wizard of Oz (both the movie and the original novel), Wicked is the origin story [&#8230;]

## After Shadow of the Tomb Raider, an animated Lara Croft had to laugh, cry, and wrestle like a pro

Since her first tomb-raiding adventure nearly 30 years ago, Lara Croft has trotted the entire globe in pursuit of artifacts and international threats. So where does one even begin crafting a new Tomb Raider story, told entirely in unplayable animation? Showrunner Tasha Huo had a vision — and Netflix bought in.&#160; “Obviously you can start [&#8230;]

This year marks the 10th anniversary of The Game Awards, and in that time Geoff Keighley’s annual event has established itself quite firmly as the leading awards ceremony for the game industry — the Oscars of gaming. It remains promotionally overstuffed to the point that it’s still arguably better known for trailers than awards, but [&#8230;]

## Our favorite Steam Deck fold-up keyboard is 22% off

Amazon’s October Prime Day is a great opportunity to save on big ticket tech and gaming products. It’s also a time to get deals on affordable gadgets that can make life a bit easier.

## Silent Hill 2 owes much to Christina Aguilera at the 1999 Teen Choice Awards

date: 2024-10-09, updated: 2024-10-09, from: Polygon Website

Konami’s Silent Hill series is famously inspired by film and pop culture, as proven by the first game’s strong Kindergarten Cop influence. But one specific ’90s reference in Silent Hill 2 has been fascinating fans for more than 20 years: the game’s Christina-Aguilera-at-the-1999-Teen-Choice-Awards connection. Maria, one of Silent Hill 2’s antagonists, is clearly modeled after [&#8230;]

## ‘Like new’ PlayStation Portals are still $60 off through Amazon for Prime Day

Discounts on the PlayStation Portal, Sony’s remote player for the PS5 with an 8-inch screen, are nearly impossible to come by. We’re surprised that Amazon has one for October Prime Day (and that is has lasted through day 2), but there’s a catch. The company has a large stock of “like new” units that were [&#8230;]

## Nintendo announces new game hardware: an alarm clock!

## Joker: Folie à Deux flips the script on Harley Quinn — but not on Todd Phillips’ problems writing women

date: 2024-10-08, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website

Todd Phillips’ Joker sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is catching flak from fans for deviating from perceived canon — both the various comics versions of longtime Batman villain Joker, and what fans thought they were seeing in the earlier film. But that lack of fidelity should be the movie’s greatest strength — especially when it comes [&#8230;]

## Sony’s stellar XM4 noise-canceling headphones are 63% off for Prime Day

It’s typical for Sony to knock an extra $50 or so off its headphones once they become outdated. What’s atypical is the kind of deal that’s happening now on its WH1000XM4 over-ear headphones. Ahead of Amazon’s October Prime Day, the last-gen (but still great) noise-canceling headphones are $129.99 at Target — a whopping 63% discount [&#8230;]
