## New California law means digital stores can’t imply you’re buying a game when you’re merely licensing it

date: 2024-10-11, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

When you turn on your Xbox Series X, open the Microsoft Store, and buy Farming Simulator 22, you might think you own the game, but you’d be wrong. You actually paid for a license to play the game — not to own it. Companies can revoke the license at any time. It doesn’t happen all [&#8230;]

## Caddo Lake is extremely produced by M. Night Shyamalan, if you get what I’m saying

date: 2024-10-11, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

Nicole Kidman may be right about going to the movies — we&#160;do&#160;go to that place to laugh, to cry, to care, to see dazzling images on a huge silver screen.
