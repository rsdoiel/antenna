date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website

Healing your units after a retreat is critical to winning wars in Civilization 7 — a game where wars are inevitable, even if you’re not looking for a Military Victory.

## Ayaneo 3 is a Steam Deck on steroids — in every way

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Polygon Website

It felt like magic. The Steam Deck played practically everything when Valve launched the handheld in 2022. By toggling to low graphical settings, even Elden Ring ran on the diminutive screen. But in 2025, gaming’s latest visual spectacles — including critical darlings Indiana Jones and Dragon’s Dogma 2 — won’t boot on Valve’s now-aging hardware. [&#8230;]
