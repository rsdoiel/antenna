## How to get assists in Marvel Rivals

date: 2025-01-21, updated: 2025-01-21, from: Polygon Website

Assists in Marvel Rivals are when you help an ally get an elimination during the game. Duelist and Vanguard players might not be getting as many assists as their Strategist counterparts, but that&#8217;s due to how they help allies get eliminations — so rather than not getting the final hit on an enemy, you need [&#8230;]

The Galar region is in Pokémon Go, meaning Pokémon from the Sword and Shield games (Gen 8) will start appearing over time.

Rookidee makes its debut in Pokémon Go as part of Jan. 2025’s “Steeled Resolve” event.

## Night Agent season 2 on Netflix, The Agency season finale, and more new TV this week

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website

It’s all thriller, no filler this week in television — well, that plus a comedy-drama about girls trying to find fulfilling love and sex during their sophomore year of college. But the main events this week are pretty much all some type of espionage thriller. Pretty much all of these spies are stressed (predictable) and [&#8230;]

## Can’t wait for Red God? Play the Red Rising board game

It’s 2025, and no, we still haven’t heard word about a Red God release date. In the meantime, though, I’ve been holding myself over lately with the Red Rising board game. Turns out, a conveniently color-coded social hierarchy lends itself not just to timely social commentary, but also to the bones of a terrific board [&#8230;]

## Marvel Snap down, caught in the TikTok ban

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Polygon Website

All focus was on TikTok in the last week, as the company prepared to — and eventually did — shut down its video-sharing app to adhere to a national security law explicitly aimed at the ByteDance-owned company. But the the U.S. action has resulted in a broader ripple effect. Marvel Snap players discovered on Saturday [&#8230;]

## A weekend deal sent Skyrim rocketing back up the Steam charts

There’s life in the old dog yet. Despite The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim having presumably been played by every living human at this point, a 90% off deal has made the 13-year-old role-playing game one of the most-played games on Steam once more. The deal reduced the price of Skyrim’s updated Special Edition to just [&#8230;]

## Marvel Rivals player dedicates himself to its worst hero to prove she isn’t as bad as you think

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website

Most Marvel Rivals tier lists agree: Scarlet Witch is one of the worst heroes to play if you plan on climbing the game’s competitive ranks. Like Moira in Overwatch, she’s devastating if left unchecked, but crumbles as soon as people know how to deal with her. In the highest ranks where the meta revolves around [&#8230;]

## Netflix revived and killed the interactive movie — but its platform is still a game

date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website

Game designer Sam Barlow deserves a lot of credit for driving the “redemption” of FMVs. The full-motion video game format was pioneered in the early ’90s as a cutting-edge visual technique in an age when computer graphics were more simplistic. But long before that, filmmakers were experimenting with ways to make films more interactive, in [&#8230;]

## Grand Theft Hamlet’s creators put Shakespeare in GTA to put chaos back into Shakespeare

date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website

Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length machinima, made entirely in-game in Grand Theft Auto Online. It’s also a slapstick comedy of errors about three friends trying to fill an empty period in their lives by staging a production of William Shakespeare’s [&#8230;]
