## Alien: Romulus is Ready Player One for the Alien universe

date: 2024-08-20, updated: 2024-08-20, from: Polygon Website

Fede Álvarez may have been the perfect director to refresh the Alien film franchise. His movie Alien: Romulus is incredibly well shot, with the camera slinking like a predator down each beautiful hallway in the failing Romulus space station, building tension with each step the characters take. Problem is, he just happened to be the [&#8230;]

## Black Myth: Wukong beginner’s tips before starting

date: 2024-08-20, updated: 2024-08-20, from: Polygon Website

Black Myth: Wukong is, as our review said, both confounding and spectacular. It’s an action RPG soulslike that has a lot of the genre’s usual beats — XP and skill tree, checkpoints that save your progress while also respawning enemies — while also putting its own unique spin on them.

## Black Myth: Wukong publisher issues bizarre directive on what streamers can (and can’t) say

Ahead of Black Myth: Wukong’s Aug. 20 release date, publisher Hero Games (acting on behalf of developer Game Science) reportedly sent a strange directive to several video game streamers who received early codes for the game: Don’t talk about anything that “instigates negative discourse.” Several organizations, including gaming content agency GLHF and Forbes, confirmed that [&#8230;]

Mankey, the pig monkey Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Mankey can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Mankey and Primeape can both be shiny.

## 10 YA novels adults should read

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

There is a stereotype that books shelved under Young Adult literature are not for adults.

## The animated Watchmen replicates the comics to a T — but why?

Published across 1986 and 1987, Watchmen deconstructed the traditions of cape comics, captivating the minds of superhero fans and normies alike.
