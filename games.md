## Everybody wants to change the world in Paper Trail and Slider

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

As an interactive medium, games can imbue in you a sense of accomplishment that, while not impossible to convey in noninteractive genres, comes naturally in an art form with fail states. If you can fail, it stands to reason that [&#8230;]

## 10 YA novels adults should read

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

There is a stereotype that books shelved under Young Adult literature are not for adults. That if a story is appropriate for children, then it must only be appropriate for children, or that if it contains elements kids are supposed to outgrow — fairy tales, magic, coming of age stories — there’s nothing there to [&#8230;]

## Silent Hill 2 (2024) is most successful when it&#8217;s doing its best Silent Hill 2 (2001) imitation

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-19, from: Polygon Website

Before sitting down to play three hours of the Silent Hill 2 remake at a recent Konami-led press event in London, we were shown a new trailer. Like the previous trailers, it left me skeptical. Although I’m not opposed to the project of remaking Silent Hill 2, I’m wary of any modernizing instinct that replaces [&#8230;]

## The animated Watchmen replicates the comics to a T — but why?

date: 2024-08-18, updated: 2024-08-18, from: Polygon Website

The impulse to iterate on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#8217; Watchmen is, perhaps, a testament to its singularity. Published across 1986 and 1987, Watchmen deconstructed the traditions of cape comics, captivating the minds of superhero fans and normies alike. Hollywood spent years trying to crack an adaptation, while DC dreamed of expanding the story, but [&#8230;]
