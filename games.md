## Rings of Power is introducing moral grayness to a series that doesn’t need it

date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-09-01, from: Polygon Website

The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated. There are Valar and Maiar, magic trees everywhere, ambiguously powerful rings, and at least two Dark Lords who want to throw the world into chaos. One thing that J.R.R. Tolkien always made plain in his universe, however, is the difference between the right side [&#8230;]

Thriller fans know by now to keep an eye out for new Jeremy Saulnier movies. From his over-the-top horror debut Murder Party to the deceptively low-key one-two punch confrontation dramas of Blue Ruin and Green Room to the viciously chilly William Giraldi adaptation Hold the Dark, Saulnier specializes in moody films punctuated by shockingly graphic [&#8230;]

## Ok, but why do certain languages spoken with American intonations sound exactly like Simlish?

In the early hours of the morning, a TikTok video titled “Does Japanese with a California valley girl accent = Simlish?” popped up on my For You page. The algorithm knows me too well.

Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies, new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits, the streaming service’s fire hose of content makes what’s coming difficult to parse.

## With a fresh reinterpretation of The Killer, John Woo mints another action star

date: 2024-08-31, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website

It’s not unheard of for a director to remake one of their most significant works. But it’s rare for it to work out as well as John Woo’s remake of his classic hitman action movie The Killer. Michael Haneke famously gave it a go with his shot-for-shot English-language remake of his disturbing 1997 meta slasher [&#8230;]

Dread it or run from it, but hero shooters arrive all the same.

Never Stop Blowing Up was always going to be one of Dimension 20’s most outrageous series. The homebrew game designed for the occasion combined Kids on Bikes with a simple yet compelling dice game.
