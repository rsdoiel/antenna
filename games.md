Amazon’s October Prime Day is now underway, and it’s full of great deals.

## Joker: Folie à Deux flips the script on Harley Quinn — but not on Todd Phillips’ problems writing women

date: 2024-10-08, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website

Todd Phillips’ Joker sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is catching flak from fans for deviating from perceived canon — both the various comics versions of longtime Batman villain Joker, and what fans thought they were seeing in the earlier film. But that lack of fidelity should be the movie’s greatest strength — especially when it comes [&#8230;]

## One of my favorite electronic screwdrivers is nearly half off for Prime Day

date: 2024-10-08, updated: 2024-10-08, from: Polygon Website

I have a lot of screwdriving solutions, and it is my earnestly held belief that each one is beautiful and special. (Editor’s note: This is true!) Sometimes you need the power and endurance of the impact driver; other times, the compact ratcheting screwdriver with the extra bits tucked away in its butt. But one screwdriver [&#8230;]

## What if Pokémon Snap was soaked in pumpkin spice?

date: 2024-10-08, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website

Penko Park is among the best Pokémon Snap-likes available, a delightful, polished, and spooky riff on a neglected but beloved genre. So why has nobody heard of it? Bad timing. The adorably creepy photography game launched in October 2020, buried beneath the twin shitpiles of the pandemic and the previous election cycle. Four years later, [&#8230;]

## Sony’s stellar XM4 noise-canceling headphones are 63% off for Prime Day

date: 2024-10-07, updated: 2024-10-07, from: Polygon Website

It’s typical for Sony to knock an extra $50 or so off its headphones once they become outdated. What’s atypical is the kind of deal that’s happening now on its WH1000XM4 over-ear headphones. Ahead of Amazon’s October Prime Day, the last-gen (but still great) noise-canceling headphones are $129.99 at Target — a whopping 63% discount [&#8230;]

There’s a percentage of people who will go absolutely feral at the first confirmation of information about the next Persona game. The runaway success of Persona 5 converted first-time players into evangelical worshippers at the altar of Altus.

## The legend of Goblin Green: Why gamers love one discontinued Warhammer paint over all others

date: 2024-10-07, updated: 2024-10-04, from: Polygon Website

For a certain vintage of gamer who grew up painting and playing Warhammer at the local mall’s Games Workshop, one color of paint stands out from the rest: Goblin Green. The color, somewhere between a subtle olive green and a vibrant grassy green, wasn’t only essential for those collecting an army of orcs and goblins. [&#8230;]

Nothing you’re about to read about Phoenix Springs — the new point-and-click mystery game from Calligram Studio — is the full truth. It’s the truth to me, for now. But really, it’s all up to interpretation, and this is how I’ve chosen to represent that interpretation to you, the reader. I can’t even tell you [&#8230;]

## The Rings of Power refuses to weigh in on the most pressing Tolkien debate of our time

Season 1 of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power promised a balrog, and while the tragic sacrifice of King Durin in the mithril-rich depths beneath Khazad-dûm might have been brief, it was certainly spectacular. But there’s one thing it didn’t do, and that’s give Rings of Power’s answer to a simple question: [&#8230;]
