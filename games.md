The three Gigantamax Galar starters (Rillaboom, Cinderace, [&#8230;]

## The Lonesome Guild champions the power of friendship

date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-20, from: Polygon Website

The Lonesome Guild, to be published by indie trailblazer Don’t Nod, is something of a departure from developer Tiny Bull Studios&#8217; previous games: a VR title and a Lovecraftian horror game. The Lonesome Guild is decidedly much more kid-friendly, featuring a cast of anthropomorphic animals adventuring together — along with a ghost, who’s more “Casper [&#8230;]

Bottle Caps are a very rare item added to Pokémon games in Pokémon Sun and Moon, and after many years, you can grab Gold Bottle Caps in Pokémon Go. These items are still exceedingly rare to find in mainline games, which makes sense, as they’re used for increasing your Pokémon’s stats. It’s no different in [&#8230;]

Growlithe, the Puppy and Scout Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Growlithe can be shiny in Pokémon Go!

## The reason new Pixar doesn’t always feel like old Pixar

date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-22, from: Polygon Website

The new Pixar movie Elio maintains the animation studio’s house style. It has elements of buddy comedy, with an 11-year-old human boy befriending a sweet-natured alien; it deals with complicated coming-of-age emotions reminiscent of later-period Pixar movies like Coco, Turning Red, and Luca; it whisks audiences away to a whimsically animated and eye-pleasing new world, [&#8230;]

## The 5 best Die Hard knockoffs

date: 2025-06-22, updated: 2025-06-21, from: Polygon Website

There are five official Die Hard movies. Given star Bruce Willis’ retirement from acting, it’s likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.
