But there was one title very striking for its (almost) complete absence: Dragon Age: The [&#8230;]

## As public perception of AI sours, crowdfunding platforms scramble

date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website

As the use of generative artificial intelligence in tabletop proliferates, there appears to be a rapidly growing divide between consumers and creators regarding its ethical implementation. Simultaneously, there are key differences between how the three major crowdfunding platforms — specifically BackerKit, Gamefound, and Kickstarter — treat the technology. A recent project, a card game called [&#8230;]

## Beadle &#038; Grimm’s new Star Trek sets take escape room games to the final frontier

date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Polygon Website

The Star Trek franchise is a flexible one, in which the best Trek series find time to be both serious and silly, to host trial episodes, action-adventure, submarine thrillers, and even the occasional mystery (with or without Data dressed up as Sherlock Holmes).  Maybe that’s what makes Beadle &#38; Grimm’s latest project, currently seeking funding [&#8230;]

date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website

Few events in the Dune franchise are more critical to explaining its universe than the Butlerian Jihad, so it may be a surprise to learn that the fictional war still holds a lot of mystery for many Dune fans.&#160; Frank Herbert, who created the series, had a few vague explanations of the Jihad, but never [&#8230;]
