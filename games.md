All characters in Marvel Rivals fit into one of three roles: vanguards (tanks), duelists (damage), and strategists (support).

## Sea of Stars local co-op revived my love for turn-based RPGs

date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website

I was a bit skeptical the first time I heard about the local co-op mode in Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. A turn-based game can feel a bit slow when playing alone, so I couldn’t really imagine how it would work with another person sitting next to me the entire time. However, I played Sea [&#8230;]

## This Game Boy Micro homage is trying to do too much

The Ayaneo Pocket Micro is the modern Sony Walkman of gaming handhelds — that is to say, its boxy, high-end design is strangely appealing, and because of its high price and narrow focus, it’s only going to please a certain type of person.

## The weakest Donkey Kong Country is still pretty great

Godzilla is coming to Fortnite in Chapter 6 Season 1, ready to stomp on everything (and look extremely weird wearing Kicks while doing so). Compared to previous seasonal skins, like Solid Snake, Geralt of Rivia, and Wolverine, Godzilla’s intimidating bulk doesn’t quite transpose to a vaguely humanoid frame.
