## Bramble Country walkthrough in Donkey Kong Bananza

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Polygon Website

Bramble Country is a challenge level in Donkey Kong Bananza that continues one of the game&#8217;s patterns: Sticking one Banandium Gem in an easy-to-miss but hard-to-reach spot. This one is slightly more devious than the other challenge levels, though. You can&#8217;t use your hand slap sonar to show where it&#8217;s hiding. In this Donkey Kong [&#8230;]

After three years of silence, Rockstar Games surprised the world with an update for Red Dead Online, the MMO-lite spinoff of its acclaimed open-world western.

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Polygon Website

In Donkey Kong Bananza, you’ll hit The Junction after completing the Forest or Freezer Layer.
