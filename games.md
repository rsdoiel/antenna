## The newest Two Point management sim is satisfying, monotonous, and punny

date: 2025-02-25, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Polygon Website

Two Point Museum does not care whether I have to make dinner or not. Like so many other titles in the genre, this management sim churns forward, upward, and onward until the end of time — or until burglars start stealing money from your donation bin because you forgot to give the security guards a [&#8230;]

## Practical Pockets treasure map location and solution in Avowed

date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Polygon Website

Practical Pockets is unusual as far as Avowed treasure maps go. This Emerald Stair map is looking out from the treasure&#8217;s location, not showing you where it is. Lucky for you, the location is within close reach and has few enemies patrolling nearby (unlike the region’s Painter&#8217;s Regret treasure map map). The reward at the [&#8230;]

## Painter’s Regret treasure map location and solution in Avowed

date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Polygon Website

Painter&#8217;s Regret is one of the first treasure maps you can get in the Emerald Stair region of Avowed — and potentially one of the more dangerous quests there as well. The map itself is in a safe area, but the treasure location is surrounded by a group high-level enemies. Your reward is a trinket [&#8230;]

After somehow both teasing it a month ago and shadow-dropping it Monday alongside Annapurna Interactive’s 2025 showcase, Sayonara Wild Hearts is now available on PlayStation 5. Granted, you’ve been able to play the PlayStation 4 version on PS5 forever, but now you can play in 4k with 120 fps visuals and haptic feedback in the [&#8230;]

## Monster Hunter Wilds is so streamlined, it may have lost its soul

date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Polygon Website

A large beast covered in fur dives through a small, circular arena in the Iceshard Cliffs, tendrils of segmented scales twisting away from its body as it lunges forward and attempts to knock me off balance. I dive between its legs, blades whirling, opening a wound on its exposed chest. Instinctively I take advantage of [&#8230;]

## A Destiny 2 bug broke some class rules — but Bungie isn’t fixing it

date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Polygon Website

Destiny 2 players recently discovered a bug introduced by the game’s Heresy update earlier in February. The issue allowed three powerful exotic glaive weapons that were intended to be class-specific — the Edge of Intent, the Edge of Concurrence, and the Edge of Action — as well as some older swords to become playable across [&#8230;]

## Hulking-out faces, ranked

Playing Marvel’s Hulk (or a Hulk-like) requires fearlessness. While budget constraints demand a decent amount of time spent walking and talking as humanoid Bruce Banner or Jennifer Walters or, most recently, Thaddeus Ross in Captain America: Brave New World, at some point, the gamma radiation kicks in and the snarling begins.&#160; No actor can look [&#8230;]

## Yellowjackets’ biggest moment this week was about its smallest mystery

Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, as an adult) is not happy about the gold necklace situation at the end of the latest Yellowjackets episode.  Which is understandable. At the very least, it’s a token from her dead best friend, someone she’s haunted by the mere thought of, and sometimes scared she lives in the total shadow of [&#8230;]
