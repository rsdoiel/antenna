## Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza is so much more than a silly diversion

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-17, from: Polygon Website

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-18, from: Polygon Website

Your background in Avowed is the baseline on which you’ll role-play for the duration of the game.

## The best class abilities to pick first in Avowed

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-18, from: Polygon Website

You don’t choose a class in Avowed the way you would in typical fantasy RPG. Rather, your class is defined by the abilities you choose to invest in. There are three classes of ability trees in Avowed: fighter, ranger, and wizard (which correlate respectively to archetypical warrior, rogue, and mage classes). Fairly early on, you’re [&#8230;]

## ‘A New Age Begins’ for Critical Role. Let’s hope it’s one for actual play and TTRPGs, too

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-14, from: Polygon Website

How you feel about the finale of Critical Role’s third main campaign hinges a lot on what you think Critical Role — and actual play, and maybe even TTRPGs — is about. Is it an extended worldbuilding exercise? Is it a story told? Is it a game played? Is it just… content made by your [&#8230;]

Inkay, the revolving Pokémon from Kalos, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Inkay can be shiny in Pokémon Go! While neither of this Pokémon have use in PvP content, Malamar is actually used in both Great and Ultra League PvP, so it may be worth grabbing some with decent IVs to [&#8230;]

## The best way to beat a hard level is to stop playing it

date: 2025-02-17, updated: 2025-02-14, from: Polygon Website

The cycle of pushing beyond a difficult level or boss is probably familiar to most everyone: You fail a lot, over and over. Eventually, you decide it’s not happening and you step away. When you return to the game, you breeze past what once felt insurmountable in a try or two. The reason this experience [&#8230;]

In 2012, Roger Ebert wrote, “I remain convinced that in principle, video games cannot be art.” The question of what is or isn’t art feels tired in 2025, but the ever-shifting defenses of why can still be intriguing.
