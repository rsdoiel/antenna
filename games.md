date: 2025-07-11, updated: 2025-07-11, from: Polygon Website

James Gunn’s Superman avoids rehashing the Man of Steel’s origin story, instead opening with a simple round of on-screen exposition explaining that Kal-El arrived on Earth 30 years ago, and has been known as the most powerful superhero on the planet for the past three years. But the film’s intro also contains another detail that [&#8230;]

James Gunn’s Superman is a reset for the DC Comics Universe on the big screen, moving away from Zack Snyder’s portrayal of superheroes as godlike beings, and favoring a sillier world where metahumans are commonplace.

For some people, Mario Kart World is a nonstop cow party. For others, it’s a slow stroll that’s periodically interrupted by lightning strikes.

## The Jurassic Park franchise could have been a lot worse — and there’s proof

By now, it’s a familiar pattern: A new Jurassic Park franchise movie movie comes out during the summer, garnering middling and sometimes exhausted-sounding reviews. Yes, it has some decent special effects and maybe a fun set piece or two, but it’s not a patch on Steven Spielberg’s 1993 original. Terms like “out of ideas,” “incurious,” [&#8230;]
