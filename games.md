## Smile 2 is smarter, scarier, and much better than the first movie

date: 2024-10-17, updated: 2024-10-16, from: Polygon Website

The original Smile felt like a miracle when it was released in 2022: a well-crafted, decidedly solid horror movie plucked from the obscure hell of direct-to-streaming release and turned into a genuine box-office hit. But for all its commercial success, Smile could never escape the fact that it started life as an excellent short film [&#8230;]

Mario Party tends to elicit a range of emotions. Some who have been raised on its particular brand of Star-grabbing, minigame-fueled chaos love the randomness and friction — the feeling that, at any point, a comical series of errors can send you from first to last place or vice versa. Others find it maddening. If [&#8230;]
