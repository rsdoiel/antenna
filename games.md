## Dune: Prophecy makes a big choice about one of the universe’s most important events

date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-15, from: Polygon Website

Few events in the Dune franchise are more critical to explaining its universe than the Butlerian Jihad, so it may be a surprise to learn that the fictional war still holds a lot of mystery for many Dune fans.&#160; Frank Herbert, who created the series, had a few vague explanations of the Jihad, but never [&#8230;]
