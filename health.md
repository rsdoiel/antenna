## A flexible peptide linking the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains of MxiG controls type III secretion signaling and stable sorting platform assembly in Shigella

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Shigella flexneri uses its type III secretion system (T3SS) to invade human enterocytes. The T3SS injectisome is controlled by proteins at the tip of an exposed needle that sense host cell contact. Substrate selection and powering of secretion is controlled by a cytoplasmic assembly called the sorting platform (SP). The Shigella SP possesses six pod structures linked to a central ATPase via radial spokes. The SP associates with the injectisome inner membrane ring (IR) via the adaptor protein MxiK. The major IR component is MxiG, whose globular periplasmic domain (MxiGP) packs with MxiJ in a 24-fold symmetry. MxiG also has a transmembrane helix attached to a small cytoplasmic domain (MxiGC) via a flexible linker peptide. Change from the IR’s 24-fold symmetry to six-fold symmetry for the SP in Shigella occurs via MxiGC pairs that associate with MxiK. The intervening pairs shift to the center of the IR/SP assembly, which is distinct from what is seen for Salmonella. This implicates the linker in dynamic motions at the IR-SP interface, but the functional importance of the linker is unknown. Using a library of mutants, we found that the linker can accept diverse mutations without eliminating injectisome function. However, some mutants were found to give rise to subpopulations able to form needles and secrete effectors in the absence of a stably assembled SP. Mutants lacking the entire linker could not secrete any effector proteins (e.g. the IpaD tip protein) and had no T3SS-related virulence functions, however, there were subpopulations that could still secrete MxiH and assemble visible needles. In contrast, a very short linker could export IpaD to the needle tip, but could not rapidly respond to external secretion signals and were thus unable to quickly enter epithelial cells. These findings implicate the MxiG linker in signaling processes that are sensed at the needle tip. Our findings suggest that the native MxiG linker peptide has evolved to maximize T3SS function at steps beyond needle formation, while needle formation can occur even when the SP is highly destabilized.

## Age-related vaginal microecology and infection epidemiology among premenopausal and postmenopausal gynecologic outpatients: a cross-sectional study

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPostmenopausal estrogen deficiency disrupts vaginal microecological balance. This cross-sectional study investigates the epidemiology of vaginal infections and alterations in microbiota composition, enzymes, and metabolites among premenopausal and postmenopausal gynecologic outpatients.MethodsThe study analyzed the vaginal microecology data from 27,346 women who underwent examinations at Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital between 2018 and 2023. Parameters including vaginal cleanliness, bacterial density, and diversity were systematically evaluated. Additionally, a total of 20 participants (10 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal women) were enrolled for nontargeted LC-MS metabolomic analysis through stratified random sampling.ResultsThe population comprised 22,525 (82.4%) premenopausal women (18–44 years), 3,456 (12.6%) transitioning women (45–55 years), and 1,365 (5.0%) postmenopausal women (>55 years). In mixed infections, BV + VVC co-infections predominated (1264/2766, 45.7%). Postmenopausal women showed significantly higher BV prevalence (22.8% vs. 17.9%, P < 0.001) and AV (24.8% vs. 4.6%, P < 0.001), but lower rates of VVC (1.2% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.001). In postmenopausal women, BV-associated biomarkers (including clue cells and sialidase activity) and inflammatory markers (such as pus cells and leukocyte esterase activity) were concurrently elevated. Metabolomic analysis identified elevated chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate levels alongside reduced O-phosphothreonine, morpholine, and diethanolamine.ConclusionAge significantly influences vaginal microecology, altering infection epidemiology, microbiota, enzymes, and metabolites. Accounting for these age-related estrogen changes in clinical interventions is critical for effective management.

## A novel YGGT family protein is localized in the apicoplast and is essential for the organelle inheritance

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite. Most apicomplexan parasites contain an endosymbiont-derived organelle called the apicoplast. This organelle is critical for the survival of parasites because it plays a role in several essential metabolic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining the apicoplast have not been well understood. In this study, we investigated the function of an apicoplast-residing protein called TgYCAP in the inheritance of the apicoplast. Our results showed that conditional knockdown of TgYCAP severely inhibited the growth of the parasite and disrupted the inheritance of the apicoplast. In addition, the YGGT domain is essential for its function in the apicoplast.

## TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism is associated with elevated IFN-α level in asymptomatic HTLV-1 infection

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAlterations in the immune response may influence the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases. TLR3 detects viral nucleic acids, including HTLV-1, and triggers the production of IFN-I and other cytokines. Genetic variations in TLR3 may alter the antiviral and inflammatory responses and contribute to the progression of HTLV-1 infection. The present study investigated the association of polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene (rs5743305 T/A and rs3775291 C/T) with HTLV-1 infection status and their relationship with infection-associated diseases, receptor expression levels, proviral load, and inflammatory and antiviral cytokines.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 179 individuals with HTLV-1 infection (82 with inflammatory diseases and 97 asymptomatic individuals) and 179 controls. Genotyping of polymorphisms, analysis of TLR3 gene expression, and quantification of proviral load were performed by real-time PCR, and cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).ResultsThe polymorphisms showed no correlation with susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection, or the occurrence of disease symptoms linked to the infection. The presence of disease symptoms was associated with higher TNF-α levels and proviral load. TLR3 rs5743305 T/A polymorphism was not associated with variations in TLR3 and IFN-α levels. For the TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism, asymptomatic individuals carrying the TT polymorphic genotype presented significantly higher IFN-α levels and lower proviral load. The profile of asymptomatic individuals carrying the polymorphic genotypes for TLR3 rs3775291 C/T was characterized by higher levels of TLR3 and IFN-α and lower levels of proviral load, TNF-α and IL-6 compared to those with the wild-type genotype.ConclusionAlthough polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene have not been associated with the presence of symptoms of HTLV-1-related inflammatory diseases, the TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism appears to contribute to a better evolution of the HTLV-1 infection status and inflammatory process among asymptomatic individuals.

## Towards the elimination of infectious HPV: exploiting CRISPR/Cas innovations

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

HPV has been conclusively associated with various human malignancies, making the development of prevention and treatment strategies for HPV-induced diseases a high priority. Currently, primary prevention methods include HPV immunization and routine screening, which significantly reduce the risk of HPV transmission. However, for patients diagnosed with invasive, advanced, or recurrent malignancies, non-virus-specific therapies frequently lead to drug resistance and adverse effects, resulting in minimal improvement in treatment efficacy for numerous patients. Viral genome-targeting therapy is emerging as a promising avenue for the future management of HPV infections. With the rapid advancement of genetic modification technologies, the CRISPR/Cas system has demonstrated significant potential in treating viral infections. Its ability to selectively target and edit viral genomes for elimination positions it as a highly effective approach for combating HPV. This review will explore the functions and applications of the CRISPR/Cas system as an innovative therapy for HPV. We will illustrate the prospective efficacy of CRISPR/Cas as a groundbreaking and promising cure for HPV infections, while also addressing the opportunities and challenges associated with this novel approach.
