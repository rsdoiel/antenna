## Integrative study of chicken lung transcriptome to understand the host immune response during Newcastle disease virus challenge

date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionNewcastle disease is one of the significant issues in the poultry industry, having catastrophic effects worldwide. The lung is one of the essential organs which harbours Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and plays a vital role in the immune response. Leghorn and Fayoumi breeds are known to have differences in resistance to Newcastle disease. Along with genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also known to regulate various biological pathways through gene regulation.MethodsThis study analysed the lung transcriptome data and identified the role of genes and long non-coding RNAs in differential immune resistance. The computational pipeline, FHSpipe, as used in our previous studies on analysis of harderian gland and trachea transcriptome was used to identify genes and lncRNAs. This was followed by differential expression analysis, functional annotation of genes and lncRNAs, identification of transcription factors, microRNAs and finally validation using qRT-PCR.Results and discussionA total of 8219 novel lncRNAs were identified. Of them, 1263 lncRNAs and 281 genes were differentially expressed. About 66 genes were annotated with either an immune-related GO term or pathway, and 12 were annotated with both. In challenge and breed-based analysis, most of these genes were upregulated in Fayoumi compared to Leghorn, and in timepoint-based analysis, Leghorn challenge chicken showed downregulation between time points. A similar trend was observed in the expression of lncRNAs. Co-expression analysis has revealed several lncRNAs co-expressing with immune genes with a positive correlation. Several genes annotated with non-immune pathways, including metabolism, signal transduction, transport of small molecules, extracellular matrix organization, developmental biology and cellular processes, were also impacted. With this, we can understand that Fayoumi chicken showed upregulated immune genes and positive cis-lncRNAs during both the non-challenged and NDV-challenge conditions, even without viral transcripts in the tissue. This finding shows that these immune-annotated genes and coexpressing cis-lncRNAs play a significant role in Fayoumi being comparatively resistant to NDV compared to Leghorn. Our study affirms and expands upon the outcomes of previous studies and highlights the crucial role of lncRNAs during the immune response to NDV.ConclusionThis analysis clearly shows the differences in the gene expression patterns and lncRNA co-expression with the genes between Leghorn and Fayoumi, indicating that the lncRNAs and co-expressing genes might potentially have a role in differentiating these breeds. We hypothesise that these genes and lncRNAs play a vital role in the higher resistance of Fayoumi to NDV than Leghorn. This study can pave the way for future studies to unravel the biological mechanism behind the regulation of immune-related genes.

## Optimization of bacteriophage therapy for difficult-to-treat musculoskeletal infections: a bench-to-bedside perspective

date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Given the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance, scientists are urgently seeking adjunct antimicrobial strategies, such as phage therapy (PT). However, despite promising results for the treatment of musculoskeletal infections in our center, crucial knowledge gaps remain. Therefore, a prospective observational study (PHAGEFORCE) and a multidisciplinary approach was set up to achieve and optimize standardized treatment guidelines. At our center, PT is strictly controlled and monitored by a multidisciplinary taskforce. Each phage treatment follows the same pathway to ensure standardization and data quality. Within the PHAGEFORCE framework, we established a testing platform to gain insight in the safety and efficacy of PT, biodistribution, phage kinetics and the molecular interaction between phages and bacteria. The draining fluid is collected to determine the phage titer and bacterial load. In addition, all bacterial isolates are fully characterized by genome sequencing to monitor the emergence of phage resistance. We hereby present a standardized bench-to-bedside protocol to gain more insight in the kinetics and dynamics of PT for musculoskeletal infections.

## Distinctive features and prognostic utility of neutrophil in severe patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae infection

date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundNeutrophil plays a pivotal role in the management of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Delineate the clinical characteristics and prognostic utility of neutrophil in severe patients with K. pneumoniae infection are crucial for clinical management and prognostic assessment.MethodsK. pneumoniae patients with different infection sites were enrolled from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and eICU Collaborative Research Database. Temporal variations of neutrophil counts within 30 days of clinical onset were examined using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curves. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.ResultsA total of 1,705 patients caused by K. pneumonia were included in the study. The non-survivor group exhibited a comparatively older age and a higher proportion of K. pneumoniae infections originating from respiratory and bloodstream sources compared to the survivor group (38.4% vs 21.1%, p<0.0001, and 15.1% vs 10.3%, p=0.021). Patients combined with multiple drug resistance strains, respiratory infection, liver disease, and above 60 years exhibited a specific dynamic process of neutrophil levels. Neutrophils counts peaked at admission and 1-2 weeks later. There was a ‘U’-shaped relationship between neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.ConclusionsNeutrophils in K. pneumoniae infected patients have distinctive features and dynamic clinical trajectories. Close monitoring of severe patients infected with K. pneumoniae upon admission and during the first 1-2 weeks after admission is of utmost importance, particularly for patients with a neutrophil count exceeding 8.0×109/L.

## The influence of Helicobacter pylori infection on acute coronary syndrome and lipid metabolism in the Chinese ethnicity

date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients frequently present a relatively high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. H. pylori was previously hypothesized to induce ACS through the regulation of lipid levels. However, the risk of H. pylori-induced ACS varies significantly among different ethnic groups, and the associations between H. pylori and lipid parameters remain unclear. This study aimed to systematically assess the risk of ACS in Chinese populations with H. pylori infection while also evaluating the effects of H. pylori on lipid parameters.Materials and methodsA hospital-based case−control study involving 280 participants was conducted. Immunoblotting was used for the detection and genotyping of H. pylori. The associations between H. pylori and ACS, as well as lipid parameters, were analyzed via the chi-square test and a multiple logistic regression model.ResultsH. pylori infection significantly increased the risk of ACS among all participants (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.76−9.25, P < 0.05), with no associations with virulence factors (cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) or vacuole toxin geneA (VacA)). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant increase in the risk of ACS among the elderly population aged 56−64 years with H. pylori infection. Additionally, a substantial association was observed between H. pylori and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). No significant differences were found in lipid parameters, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the LDL/HDL ratio, between individuals positive and negative for H. pylori infection. Similar results were observed between the ACS group and the control group.ConclusionsOur study has demonstrated for the first time that H. pylori does not significantly impact lipid metabolism but increases the risk of ACS fourfold in the Chinese population (OR = 4.04, 95% CI: 1.76−9.25). Furthermore, the virulence factors of H. pylori (CagA and VacA) may not be involved in the mechanisms by which they promote the development of ACS. This finding provides additional evidence for the association between H. pylori and ACS among different ethnic groups and refutes the biological mechanism by which H. pylori affects ACS through lipid metabolism regulation. Regular screening for H. pylori and eradication treatment in elderly individuals and those at high risk for ACS may be effective measures for reducing the incidence of ACS. Future research should include multicenter randomized controlled trials and explore host genetics and the effects of H. pylori on the gut microbiota as potential biological pathways linking H. pylori and ACS.

## Fusobacterium nucleatum induces invasive growth and angiogenic responses in malignant oral keratinocytes that are cell line- and bacterial strain-specific

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic commensal of the oral cavity recently reported to be associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we investigate the impact on oral keratinocytes of infection with a genetically diverse set of strains of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum recovered from patients with oral dysplasia (n=6). We employed H357 oral keratinocytes derived from a stage 1 OSCC and H376 cells derived from a stage 3 OSCC. Adhesion phenotypes were strain specific, with 3/6 clinical isolates examined exhibiting higher adherence to the stage 3 H376 cell line. Conversely, intracellular invasion was greatest in the H357 cells and was associated with specific transcriptional responses including autophagy and keratinization. Infection of both H357 and H376 cell lines induced transcriptional and cytokine responses linked to cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. F. nucleatum infection induced greater levels of MMP9 secretion in the H376 cell line which was associated with enhanced motility and invasion phenotypes. Additionally, the degree of F. nucleatum induced invasive growth by H376 cells varied between different clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum. Blockage of CCL5 signalling using the inhibitor metCCL5 resulted in reduced keratinocyte invasion. F. nucleatum infection also induced expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine MCP-1 and the angiogenic growth factor VEGF-A resulting in increased capillary-like tube formation in HUVEC cells, most significantly in H376 cells. Treatment of HUVEC cells with resveratrol, a VEGF-A signalling inhibitor, significantly attenuated F. nucleatum induced tube formation. Our data indicate that the outcomes of F. nucleatum-oral cell interactions can vary greatly depending on the bacterial genotype and the malignant phenotype of the host cell.

## Changes in the epidemiological patterns of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus infection among pediatric patients and their correlation with severe cases: a long-term retrospective study

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) in southern China both pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, as well as identify associated risk factors for severe infections.MethodsThe study conducted a real-time PCR analysis on hospitalized children with ARTI from 2012 to 2023, specifically targeting RSV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens. Additionally, demographic data was collected during this analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of RSV occurs triennially, and likewise, the temporal pattern of hMPV outbreaks mirrors that of RSV. The peak infection rates of RSV and hMPV occurred during and following the implementation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures. The incidence of RSV infection exhibited bimodal peaks in 2022, while hMPV demonstrated seasonal peaks during the spring, fall, and winter periods post-COVID-19 pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an upward trend in the proportion of female patients and patients aged one year and older presenting with ARTI, RSV infections, and hMPV infections. Infant (OR = 4.767, 95%CI: [3.888–5.846], p < 0.0001), presence of co-infection (OR = 0.540, 95%CI: [0.404–0.722], p < 0.0001), and existence of comorbidities (OR = 1.582, 95%CI: [1.285–1.949], p < 0.0001) was the risk ratio for the severity of RSV infection. Children infected with hMPV under the age of 1 year (OR = 0.322, 95%CI: [0.180 – 0.575], p < 0.0001), as well as those with comorbidities (OR = 8.809, 95%CI: [4.493 – 17.272], p < 0.0001), have a higher risk of developing severe illness.ConclusionThe changing epidemiological patterns have the potential to lead to widespread severe outbreaks among children, particularly those with underlying medical conditions who may experience more severe symptoms. Conducting surveillance for pneumoviridae viruses in children is an imperative measure to establish a robust foundation for future epidemic prevention and treatment strategies.

## Unlocking the power of short-chain fatty acids in ameliorating intestinal mucosal immunity: a new porcine nutritional approach

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a subset of organic fatty acids with carbon chains ranging from one to six atoms in length, encompass acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These compounds are the endproducts of dietary fiber fermentation, primarily catalyzed by the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways within the gut microbiota. SCFAs act as pivotal energy substrates and signaling molecules in the realm of animal nutrition, exerting a profound influence on the intestinal, immune system, and intestinal barrier functions. Specifically, they contibute to 60-70% of the total energy requirements in ruminants and 10-25% in monogastric animals. SCFAs have demonstrated the capability to effectively modulate intestinal pH, optimize the absorption of mineral elements, and impede pathogen invasion. Moreover, they enhance the expression of proteins associated with intestinal tight junctions and stimulate mucus production, thereby refining intestinal tissue morphology and preserving the integrity of the intestinal structure. Notably, SCFAs also exert anti-inflammatory properties, mitigating inflammation within the intestinal epithelium and strengthening the intestinal barrier’s defensive capabilities. The present review endeavors to synthesize recent findings regarding the role of SCFAs as crucial signaling intermediaries between the metabolic activities of gut microbiota and the status of porcine cells. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the current literature on SCFAs’ impact on immune responses within the porcine intestinal mucosa.
