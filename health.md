## Pathogenetic identification in ticks and yaks from Zoige County, China

date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background:Ticks represent a significant vector for the transmission of infectious diseases, with the prevalence of tick-borne diseases becoming a prominent global health concern in recent decades. Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., and Piroplasma have been identified as significant pathogens with the potential to impact human and animal health. However, there is a dearth of data concerning the prevalence of these pathogens in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China.MethodsIn this study, a total of 643 Dermacentor silvarum and 314 Haemaphysalis longicornis were identified through the application of morphological and molecular identification techniques on 957 ticks collected from yaks in Zoige County. The assessed of Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Theileria spp., and Babesia spp. was assessed in 957 ticks and 96 blood samples collected from yaks.ResultsSignificant discrepancies were observed in the positivity rates for the four pathogens among the tick species and sampling sites. The identification of different species within the four pathogens was based on the analysis of the 16S rRNA of Anaplasma spp., the ompA and ompB genes of Rickettsia spp., and the 18S rRNA of Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. The prevalence ranges of the four pathogens are 9.9-50.2%, 29.5-100%, 16.2-46.4%, and 14.5-58.4%, respectively.ConclusionIn view of the growing zoonotic risks, further investigations into the prevalence of additional pathogens in ticks and animals, including livestock, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, are essential.

## The ovarian cancer-associated microbiome contributes to the tumorâ€™s inflammatory microenvironment

date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

A growing body of research has established a correlation between tumors and persistent chronic inflammatory infiltration. As a primary instigator of inflammation, the majority of microbiomes naturally residing within our bodies engage in a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. Nevertheless, alterations in the microbiome's composition or breaches in the normal barrier function can disrupt the internal environment's homeostasis, potentially leading to the development and progression of various diseases, including tumors. The investigation of tumor-related microbiomes has contributed to a deeper understanding of their role in tumorigenesis. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the microbiome alterations and the associated inflammatory changes in ovarian cancer. It may aid in advancing research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ovarian cancer-associated microbiome, providing potential theoretical support for the future development of microbiome-targeted antitumor therapies and early screening through convenient methods.

## Non-tuberculous mycobacteria enhance the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway to induce immunosuppression and facilitate pulmonary colonization

date: 2024-10-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The increasing prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections alongside tuberculosis (TB) underscores a pressing public health challenge. Yet, the mechanisms governing their infection within the lung remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic sequencing, machine learning classifiers, SparCC, and MetOrigin methods to profile bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from NTM/TB patients. Our aim is to unravel the intricate interplay between lung microbial communities and NTM/Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Our investigation reveals a discernible reduction in the compositional diversity of the lung microbiota and a diminished degree of mutual interaction concomitant with NTM/TB infections. Notably, NTM patients exhibit a distinct microbial community characterized by marked specialization and notable enrichment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, driving pronounced niche specialization for NTM infection. Simultaneously, these microbial shifts significantly disrupt tryptophan metabolism in NTM infection, leading to an elevation of kynurenine. Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium paraintracellulare, Mycobacterium abscessus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been implicated in the metabolic pathways associated with the conversion of indole to tryptophan via tryptophan synthase within NTM patients. Additionally, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase converts tryptophan into kynurenine, fostering an immunosuppressive milieu during NTM infection. This strategic modulation supports microbial persistence, enabling evasion from immune surveillance and perpetuating a protracted state of NTM infection. The elucidation of these nuanced microbial and metabolic dynamics provides a profound understanding of the intricate processes underlying NTM and TB infections, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention and management.
