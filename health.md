## Comparative performance evaluation of FilmArray RP 2.1 and targeted next-generation sequencing in upper respiratory tract infections

date: 2025-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionUpper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) represent a significant global health burden, impacting patient morbidity and quality of life. The implementation of accurate pathogen detection methods is crucial for precise diagnosis and effective clinical management of URTIs. This study evaluates the clinical performance of targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) as a diagnostic tool for comprehensive identification of URTI-associated pathogens.MethodsA total of 190 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients were enrolled for the study. These specimens underwent pathogen identification using both tNGS and the FilmArray respiratory panel. The results obtained from these two methods were then compared.ResultsOverall, tNGS identified 164 positive samples, compared to 91 positives identified by FilmArray. Regarding the shared target species or subtypes, tNGS identified 97 positive samples, whereas the FilmArray respiratory panel detected 88 positives out of 190 specimens. tNGS identified a diverse array of 34 different pathogens, significantly surpassing the 12 pathogens identified by the FilmArray panel. The detection rates for tNGS and FilmArray were 51.05% (97/190) and 46.32% (88/190), respectively. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the detection rates of 10 specific respiratory pathogens (with ≥3 positives). Furthermore, the overall pathogen detection accuracy of tNGS was determined to be 90.16% (95%CI = 83.45%~94.81%), with a sensitivity of 95.45% (88.77%~98.75%).ConclusionsThe tNGS method demonstrates broader pathogen detection capability compared to the FilmArray, achieving a higher positive detection rate in upper respiratory tract infections. It demonstrates high accuracy and sensitivity, offering a viable and rapid diagnostic approach for upper respiratory tract infections.

date: 2025-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes ongoing economic losses to the livestock industry. Monitoring antibodies via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a key tool for ensuring the eradication of BVDV from cattle herds. We developed an indirect ELISA (rE2-iELISA) using CHO-S-expressed recombinant E2 protein, the major immunogenic glycoprotein mediating viral attachment and immune evasion. Optimized assay conditions included: 0.4 μg/well antigen coating, 5% BSA blocking, 1:100 serum dilution, and 1:5000 secondary antibody dilution. The assay demonstrated exclusive specificity for BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 with detection sensitivity to 1:1,500 serum dilution. Validation revealed exceptional diagnostic performance: ROC analysis showed 0.998 AUC (cutoff=0.125), 94.8% concordance with IDEXX ELISA, and the intra- and inter-batch coefficient of variation are both less than 5%. The experimental results indicate that the indirect ELISA detection method based on BVDV rE2 exhibits good sensitivity, specificity, and stability. And a stable serological tool for BVDV surveillance and vaccine efficacy evaluation in cattle populations.

## Exosome in HBV infection: current concepts and future perspectives

date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Exosomes are nanoparticles delimited by a lipid bilayer that are secreted by a wide variety of cells. They play a significant role in the pathophysiological processes associated with HBV infection, which poses huge burdens for public health. Emerging evidence has been demonstrated that exosomes are extensively associated with the replication and transmission processes of HBV. In this review, we outline the process of exosome production, composition and function. Moreover, we elaborate on the essential role of exosomes in the pathology processes of HBV infection. Exosomes could serve as essential biomarkers for early detection of HBV infection and HBV-related diseases. Finally, we outline the therapeutic potential of exosomes in anti-HBV therapy, which may provide novel insights into the prevention and treatment of HBV.

## Gut microbiota and metabolomics in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: interaction, mechanism, and therapeutic value

date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The global epidemic of Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) urgently demands breakthroughs in precision medicine strategies. Its pathogenesis centers on the cascade dysregulation of the gut microbiota-metabolite-liver axis: microbial dysbiosis drives hepatic lipid accumulation and fibrosis by suppressing short-chain fatty acid synthesis, activating the TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway, and disrupting bile acid signaling. Metabolomics further reveals characteristic disturbances including free fatty acid accumulation, aberrantly elevated branched-chain amino acids (independently predictive of hepatic steatosis), and mitochondrial dysfunction, providing a molecular basis for disease stratification. The field of precision diagnosis is undergoing transformative innovation—multi-omics integration combined with AI-driven analysis of liver enzymes and metabolic biomarkers enables non-invasive, ultra-high-accuracy staging of fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies are shifting towards personalization: microbial interventions require matching to patient-specific microbial ecology, drug selection necessitates efficacy and safety prediction, and synthetically engineered “artificial microbial ecosystems” represent a cutting-edge direction. Future efforts must establish a “multi-omics profiling–AI-powered dynamic modeling–clinical validation” closed-loop framework to precisely halt MAFLD progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by deciphering patient-specific mechanisms.

## Prevention of donation-related infections: investigating the use of antibiotics in the decontamination of preservation fluid for organ transplantation

date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundDonation-related infections (DRIs), particularly those caused by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGNB), can have disastrous consequences because of their extensive drug resistance. Contamination during graft acquisition and transport can lead to DRIs, and the use of antibiotics in preservation fluid (PF) before organ transplantation can reduce the incidence of DRIs. This study was to determine and compare the effectiveness of different PF decontamination regimens to prevent CRGNB related DRIs.MethodsTwelve CRGNB strains were chosen to be the targets of decontamination, and a drug concentration gradient was established for each test drug based on the previous clinical research. In addition the standard decontamination procedures were performed to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of polymyxin B (PB), colistin sulfate (CS), colistimethate sodium (CMS) and amikacin (AK) in the 0~4°C PF, and to explore the antimicrobial effects of CMS after different preprocessing methods.ResultsPB and CS exhibited significantly better antimicrobial effectiveness against CRGNB than AK and CMS in the 0~4°C PF, and the antimicrobial effects on CRGNB increased with the increasing concentration of drugs. Notably, CMS after pretreatment (CMS-AP), its antibacterial was significantly enhanced at 4°C.ConclusionsThe PF decontamination is important in preventing the DRIs caused by CRGNB, and the decontamination regimens based on PB or CS were confirmed effective. Notably, CMS could even achieve a better decontamination effect than PB after a simple and fast pretreatment.

## Dominance of the GI-19 genotype and genomic characterization of the S1 gene in avian infectious bronchitis virus from 2020 to 2024

date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The continuous emergence of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variants poses a critical threat to poultry health and productivity in China. In this study, we conducted comprehensive genetic and antigenic analyses of IBV strains isolated in our laboratory between 2020 and 2024. A total of 94 IBV isolates were sequenced for the S1 gene, revealing widespread nucleotide insertions, deletions, and mutations. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GI-19 was the predominant genotype (70.21%), followed by GI-13 (21.28%). Recombination analysis using RDP 5.42 identified 14 recombinant strains, primarily GI-13/GI-22 (50%), GI-19/GI-7 (28.6%), and GI-19/GI-22 (21.4%), which were further confirmed using Simplot. Glycosylation analysis revealed that all isolates possessed 14 to18 N-glycosylation sites, whereas only the SDJN3/23 strain contained an O-glycosylation site (position 416). Novel cleavage site motifs (HRRKR, HRHRR, RRFRR) were identified in GI-19 strains, diverging from the canonical HRRRR. The evolutionary rate calculated via BEAST software, was 1.98 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year. Serum neutralization assays demonstrated that GI-19 recombinants exhibited partial one-way cross-protection against GI-1, GI-13, and GI-22 genotypes (titer ≥ 1:32), but reciprocal neutralization was limited. Overall, we systematically characterized the genetic diversity and antigenic evolution of the currently circulating IBV strains in China, emphasizing the critical demand for genotype-specific vaccine development and dynamic surveillance systems to counteract viral immune escape.

## Postbiotics enhance the efficacy of derivative compound mouthwash against clinical Helicobacter pylori strains

date: 2025-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundA previous study indicated that poly L-lysine-glycerol monolaurate mouthwash reduced the virulence of Helicobacter pylori; however, these compounds are derivatives. Thus, this study aimed to compare the effects of postbiotics, postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate, and poly L-lysine-glycerol monolaurate mouthwashes against clinical H. pylori strains.MethodsPostbiotics, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei SD1, L. rhamnosus SD4, and L. rhamnosus SD11 were examined for anti-bacterial activity and synergistic effects. Subsequently, mouthwashes containing postbiotics, postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate, and poly L-Lysine-glycerol monolaurate were prepared and evaluated for their ability to reduce H. pylori adhesion to host cells, suppress inflammation induced by H. pylori, eradicate biofilm, decrease cagA expression, and assess epithelial cell viability. The stability of the mouthwashes was evaluated every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks for their efficacy against H. pylori growth, biofilm eradication, and epithelial cell viability.ResultsThe postbiotics, L. paracasei SD1 and L. rhamnosus SD11, demonstrated significant anti-H. pylori activity, with synergistic effects observed in combinations with derivative compounds. Postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate mouthwashes exhibited higher efficacy in reducing H. pylori adhesion to host cells (42.64-43.83%), suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, eradicating biofilm (82.62% at 24 h), and reducing cagA expression (112.60 fold) compared to others. Such mouthwashes also displayed low cytotoxicity (< 30% for 15 min) to all cells tested. The stability was observed up to 24 weeks.ConclusionThis in vitro study demonstrated that postbiotic-glycerol monolaurate mouthwash revealed the highest efficacy against H. pylori with low cytotoxicity to host cells. The stability lasted for 24 weeks.

## MicroRNA-27b alleviates septic cardiomyopathy by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the protective role of microRNA-27b (miR-27b) in septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) and its regulatory mechanism on the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff)/mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) axis.MethodsTranscriptome data from septic patients’ cardiac tissues (GSE79962) were analyzed. Serum miR-27b expression was measured in SCM patients (n=11), sepsis-only patients (n=22), and healthy controls (n=30). Mouse SCM model and HL-1 cardiomyocyte model were established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. The molecular mechanism was investigated using miR-27b agonist/antagonist and Mff intervention, combined with RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy.ResultsBioinformatics analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-27b in SCM cardiac tissues (log2FC=-3.9, P<0.001). Clinical validation showed lower miR-27b expression in SCM patients’ serum compared to sepsis-only patients and healthy controls (P<0.05). LPS-induced SCM model exhibited cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury, mitochondrial abnormalities, decreased miR-27b expression, and increased Mff and MAVS levels. miR-27b targeted Mff to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, thus attenuating LPS-induced cardiomyocyte inflammation and apoptosis, while Mff overexpression reversed this protective effect.ConclusionmiR-27b alleviates myocardial injury and inflammation in SCM by targeting the Mff/MAVS axis to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, representing a potential novel therapeutic target for SCM.

## Assessing the potential impact of salidroside on Chikungunya virus-induced acute interstitial nephritis via network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vitro experiments

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is often linked to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in fatal cases. Given the global spread of CHIKV and the lack of targeted antiviral treatments, there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies against CHIKV-induced AIN. This study explored the therapeutic potential of salidroside (Sal) using an integrative approach involving network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vitro validation. Network pharmacology analysis identified 18 overlapping targets between Sal and AIN, including TNF, IL6 and AKT1. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between Sal and key pathway proteins (Vina scores < –6), notably TNF, IL6 and BCL2. In vitro assays using CHIKV-infected 293T cells demonstrated that Sal (7.8125–2000 μM) enhanced cell viability by 8.9–25.9%, with the greatest effect observed at 1000 μM, without significantly altering viral replication. Mechanism analysis using the KEGG and FerrDB databases implicated apoptosis and ferroptosis in CHIKV-induced AIN pathogenesis. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that Sal significantly downregulated ferroptosis-related genes (IL-6, IL-1β, SIRT1, PARP1, HMOX1) and apoptosis-associated markers (Bax, TNF-α, PARP1) in infected cells. Consistent with these findings, molecular docking demonstrated that Sal binds strongly to the ferroptosis-related protein GPX4 (Vina score: –6.3) and the apoptosis regulator NFKB1 (Vina score: –6.0). These results suggest that Sal is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of CHIKV-induced AIN.

## Metagenomic next-generation sequencing-based characterization of the viral spectrum in clinical pulmonary and peripheral blood samples of patients

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables comprehensive profiling of viral communities in clinical samples. However, comparative analyses of the virome across anatomical compartments and disease states remain limited. This study aims to characterize the virome in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood samples from patients with various clinical conditions using mNGS.MethodsA total of 338 clinical samples—including 240 BALF and 69 blood samples for DNA sequencing, and 18 BALF and 11 blood samples for RNA sequencing—underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Following removal of host-derived reads, high-quality non-human sequences were aligned to a viral reference database. Virome composition was assessed through alpha and beta diversity metrics. Principal coordinates analysis was used to evaluate disease-related variation, and virus–bacteria associations in BALF were investigated via Spearman correlation.ResultsSequencing yielded an average of 51 million raw reads per sample, resulting in approximately 8 million non-human reads after host filtering. Distinct virome profiles were observed between BALF and blood samples. Bacteriophages dominated all groups, with Siphoviridae and Myoviridae as the most abundant families, although only 13.6% of viral abundance could be assigned to known families. Diversity analyses revealed significant differences between BALF and peripheral blood, and DNA-sequenced BALF samples showed disease-specific viral signatures in pulmonary infections. In contrast, tumor presence had no significant effect on virome composition in either BALF or blood. Network analysis identified complex virus–bacteria correlations in BALF, with genera such as Haemophilus, Megasphaera, and Treponema as key bacterial hosts.ConclusionsThis study reveals pronounced differences in virome composition between the respiratory and circulatory systems and highlights the specific influence of pulmonary disease—but not tumors—on the pulmonary virome. The observed virus–bacteria networks provide novel insights into pulmonary microbial ecology and underscore the importance of integrating host and disease context in virome studies.

## The J-shaped association between the ratio of neutrophil counts to prognostic nutritional index and mortality in ICU patients with sepsis: a retrospective study based on the MIMIC database

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe ICU faces persistent challenges with sepsis, marked by systemic inflammation and metabolic disruptions, often leading to poor outcomes. Despite advances, reliable biomarkers for predicting sepsis outcomes are needed. This study introduces a novel indicator combining neutrophil count and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) to improve predictive accuracy by addressing both inflammatory and nutritional-immune aspects.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing data from the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on adults diagnosed with sepsis per Sepsis 3.0 criteria. We excluded those younger than 18, with ICU stays under 48 hours, multiple ICU admissions, or incomplete data. Participants’ neutrophil counts/PNI ratios were calculated and correlated with 30, 60, and 90-day hospital and ICU mortality, utilising Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models and subgroup analysis.ResultsWe included 2,116 patients from 22,517 eligible cases. Survival analysis demonstrated lower survival probabilities for higher neutrophil counts/PNI ratios across all observed time windows. Cox regression models revealed a significant association between higher neutrophil counts/PNI ratios and increased short- to medium-term mortality. The restricted cubic spline regression models illustrated a J-shaped relationship between neutrophil counts/PNI and mortality.ConclusionThe neutrophil counts/PNI ratio is a promising prognostic biomarker for sepsis-related outcomes in ICU settings, offering improved risk stratification and potentially guiding therapeutic interventions. Further research is warranted to validate these findings across diverse populations.

## Rapid generation of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 reporter viruses and replicons for antiviral research

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe large size of coronavirus genome, along with the instability of certain genomic sequences, makes the construction of reverse genetics for coronaviruses particularly challenging. The rapid development and application of reverse genetics systems for coronaviruses require further exploration.MethodsUsing transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast and the in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 system, reverse genetics systems of two mild coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were rapidly established. Antiviral assays, high-content imaging, and NanoLuc luciferase assays were used to characterize reporter viruses and replicon systems.ResultsWe rapidly assembled infectious clones for two mild coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, using transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast. The infected clones could stably express the mGreenLantern reporter gene. We further generated T7 promoter-driven RNA replicon of HCoV-229E and CMV promoter-driven DNA replicon of HCoV-OC43, with the readout of NanoLuc luciferase activity. The effectiveness of these tools for antiviral study was evaluated using the broad-spectrum RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, exhibiting high sensitivity, efficiency, and convenience.DiscussionThe application of yeast-based TAR cloning significantly facilitates the rapid assembly of large viral genome, and the establishment of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E reverse genetics systems provides valuable platforms for studying the biology and developing antivirals against coronaviruses.

## Development and optimization of a novel nanocarrier SabiWhite-loaded ethosomal gel for targeted skin inflammation complicated by multidrug-resistant pathogens

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aimed to develop and evaluate SabiWhite-loaded ethosomes (SW-ETH) for topical application, focusing on improving stability, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy. Ethosomal formulations are known for their enhanced drug delivery properties, making them suitable for skin inflammation.MethodsThe SW-ETH formulations were developed utilizing an adapted cold preparation technique. A 3² factorial design was used to optimize phospholipid concentration and ethanol content, and their impact on vesicle size and entrapment efficiency (EE%) was assessed. Structural characterization of SabiWhite was performed using melting point determination, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). In vitro drug release was assessed using a Franz diffusion cell, and anti-inflammatory and skin irritation studies were performed on Wistar rats.ResultsSabiWhite exhibited a melting point of 96°C and characteristic FTIR peaks, confirming its identity and purity. XRD analysis revealed its crystalline nature, while ethosomal formulations showed a shift to an amorphous state. The optimized SW-ETH formulation (SW-ETH 6) had a vesicle size of 184.4 nm, an EE% of 92.5%, and a zeta potential of -13.50 mV, indicating stable and uniform vesicles. In-vitro drug release from SW-ETH 6 showed a sustained release profile with 93.12% drug release over 24 hours. In vivo, SW-ETH demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects with 36.17% edema inhibition at 150 minutes, comparable to Diclofenac gel (41.92%). No skin irritation was observed, and the formulation was classified as non-irritant. Stability tests confirmed minimal changes in appearance, viscosity, and drug content over 120 days at different storage conditions.ConclusionSW-ETH demonstrated effective drug encapsulation, enhanced anti-inflammatory activity, and excellent biocompatibility, making it a promising candidate for topical therapy. Further clinical validation is warranted to confirm its therapeutic potential.

## Helile formula from “Tai ping sheng hui fang”: anti-Helicobacter pylori activity, gut microbiota modulation, and inflammatory response regulation

date: 2025-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (HP) is a major gastric pathogen linked to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted the search for alternative treatments. Helile formula, derived from the ancient “Taiping Shenghuifang,” is known to treat various degrees of diarrhea and has potential for treating gastrointestinal disorders. However, the antibacterial efficacy, material basis, and action mechanisms of the helile formula against HP remain undetermined.MethodsThe chemical constituents were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The in vitro anti-HP activity and underlying mechanisms were investigated through a series of assays, including the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe morphological changes, cell viability and cell adhesion activity assays, assessment of nitric oxide (NO) production, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for gene expression analysis. For the in vivo anti-HP infection study and mechanism exploration, techniques such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for histological examination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cytokine and antibody quantification, 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) sequencing for microbial community profiling, and metabolomics for global metabolite analysis were employed.ResultsMultiple constituents of helile formula, namely ellagic acid, gallic acid, chebulagic acid, chebulic acid, and corilagin, were identified. In vitro, helile formula increased bacterial outer-membrane permeability, disrupted HP structure, inhibited toxin-related genes, and suppressed cell adhesion. In male Kunming mice, helile formula effectively reversed HP-induced inflammation. It modulated key metabolites, such as adenine, panaxytriol, 4-hydroxyglutamate semialdehyde, and N-alpha-Acetyl-L-lysine. It influenced the gut microbiota, especially families like Muribaculaceae and Lactobacillaceae. Adenine, in particular, repaired HP-caused damage to GES1 cells, reduced HP - mediated cell adhesion, and inhibited HP-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated the remarkable anti-HP efficacy of the helile formula in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the helile formula represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the management of HP infections.

## Tryptophan metabolic reprogramming modulates cytokine networks in nucleos(t)ide analogue-treated chronic hepatitis B patients

date: 2025-07-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background & aimsHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health challenge. Tryptophan metabolism influences immune regulation, but its interplay with cytokines during antiviral therapy is unclear. We investigated associations between tryptophan pathways and cytokine profiles in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with varying treatment outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 106 CHB patients (including 29 functional cure cases) receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and 29 healthy controls. Plasma levels of 20 tryptophan metabolites (kynurenine, serotonin, and bacterial pathways) were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS, and 12 cytokines were measured via flow cytometry. Multivariate analyses were performed.ResultsFunctional cure patients showed unique metabolic patterns. Indole-3-carboxaldehyde (IAld) levels increased progressively from HBsAg positive groups (HBeAg-: 63.324 nmol/L; HBeAg+: 65.938 nmol/L) to functional cure (91.44 nmol/L) and healthy controls (130.634 nmol/L) (P < 0.01), exhibiting negative correlations with HBsAg (r = -0.31) and IFN-γ (r = -0.53) but positive correlation with IL-1β (r = 0.47). Picolinic acid (PA) was significantly elevated in the functional cure group (P < 0.001), associated with reduced HBsAg, IL-2 and increased IL-1β, IL-10 levels, indicating potential antiviral effects. Serotonin (5-HT) levels were higher in cured patients and correlated with IL-1β and IFN-α (P < 0.05). HBeAg-positive patients displayed increased kynurenine-to-tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) ratios (P < 0.05), while non-cured patients showed metabolic blockade downstream of 3-hydroxykynurenine (elevated 3-HK/Kyn ratios and reduced KA, XA/3-HK, 3-HAA/3-HK, and NAA levels; P < 0.05).ConclusionsThe tryptophan metabolites (IAld, PA, 5-HT) were found to correlate with cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-10), potentially implicating their involvement in immune regulation and antiviral responses. These observations delineate a metabolic-immune framework that may inform future therapeutic development for HBV.
