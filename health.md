## Roles of circRNAs in viral pathogenesis

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs with a covalently closed circular structure, lacking 5’-caps or 3’-poly(A) tails. They are relatively conserved, highly stable, and often exhibit tissue- or cell-specific production in eukaryotic cells. Based on the advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, multiple reports have suggested that viruses and other microorganisms may encode circRNA-like molecules, providing new insights into the physiological and pathological roles of circRNAs. The innate immune system functions as the body’s primary defense mechanism against viral infections. It detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activates signaling pathways to suppress viral replication and limit their spread. CircRNAs are involved in regulation of the host innate immune signaling pathways and play essential roles in viral pathogenesis. It has been shown that circRNAs can regulate gene expression by acting as miRNA sponges or protein sponges, or encoding small proteins in specific cases. For example, previous studies have revealed that circRNAs participate in the host antiviral immune response through the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by acting as miRNA sponges. This review highlights research progress in the regulation and functions of host- and virus-encoded circRNAs in host-virus interactions, as well as their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in clinical applications.

## Rapid and sensitive identification of Candida in blood based on M1 beads enrichment combined with multiple recombinase-aided PCR: a culture-independent approach

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionClinically, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of Candida bloodstream infections rely on rapid and sensitive detection methods. However, the long turn-around time and low detection rate of blood culture (the gold standard) make rapid diagnosis of Candida challenging. This study develops a novel molecular assay (M1-mRAP) designed for the rapid and sensitive detection of three Candida species in blood samples: Candida albicans(CA), Candida tropicalis(CT), and Candida glabrata(CG).MethodsWe used the M1-mRAP method aimed at detecting Candida DNA in blood samples, in which we developed a novel multiplex recombinase-aided PCR (mRAP) assay for sensitive amplification of Candida DNA and used a self-developed recombinant human mannan-binding lectin beads (M1 beads)method for enrichment of Candida in blood. The analytical sensitivity of mRAP was evaluated using Candida recombinant plasmids. The analytical sensitivity of the M1-mRAP method for blood sample detection was assessed using quantitative Candida simulated blood samples. The clinical performance of the mRAP and M1-mRAP methods was evaluated in 120 non-blood samples and 9 blood samples and compared with conventional qPCR methods.ResultsThe limit of detection(LOD) for CA, CT, and CG by the mRAP method were 4, 4, and 3 copies/μL, respectively. The LOD for CA, CT, and CG simulated blood samples by the M1-mRAP were 2, 2, and 1 CFU/mL, and the overall detection time was about 3.5 h. Clinical assays of mRAP and M1-mRAP showed that these two methods were consistent with qPCR (P<0.05), but had better clinical detection ability than qPCR. Specifically, the mRAP method identified 5 (4.2%) qPCR-negative samples, while M1-mRAP detected 1 (11.1%) classified as the qPCR grey zone sample.ConclusionThe M1-mRAP method provides rapid and sensitive detection of low concentrations of CA, CT, and CG blood samples and has the potential to emerge as an important tool for the early detection of Candida bloodstream infections in clinical settings.

## The gut microbiota-inflammation-HFpEF axis: deciphering the role of gut microbiota dysregulation in the pathogenesis and management of HFpEF

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a disease that affects multiple organs throughout the body, accounting for over 50% of heart failure cases. HFpEF has a significant impact on individuals’ life expectancy and quality of life, but the exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Emerging evidence implicates low-grade systemic inflammation as a crucial role in the onset and progression of HFpEF. Gut microbiota dysregulation and associated metabolites alteration, including short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxides, amino acids, and bile acids can exacerbate chronic systemic inflammatory responses and potentially contribute to HFpEF. In light of these findings, we propose the hypothesis of a “gut microbiota-inflammation-HFpEF axis”, positing that the interplay within this axis could be a crucial factor in the development and progression of HFpEF. This review focuses on the role of gut microbiota dysregulation-induced inflammation in HFpEF’s etiology. It explores the potential mechanisms linking dysregulation of the gut microbiota to cardiac dysfunction and evaluates the therapeutic potential of restoring gut microbiota balance in mitigating HFpEF severity. The objective is to offer novel insights and strategies for the management of HFpEF.

## Regulatory effects on virulence and phage susceptibility revealed by sdiA mutation in Klebsiella pneumoniae

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe World Health Organization has identified multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains as the highest priority in 2024. Understanding the regulatory routes of virulence features is crucial for the development of novel anti-virulence strategies. SdiA, a LuxR-like quorum sensing (QS) receptor that responds to N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), is involved in the regulation of virulence traits in some Gram-negative bacteria. The function of this receptor in the virulence of K. pneumoniae remains uncertain. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the function of SdiA in K. pneumoniae biofilm formation and virulence.MethodsTo this end, a genetic knockout of sdiA was conducted, and virulence-related phenotypic studies were performed following AHL provision.Results and DiscussionThe results demonstrate that sdiA deficiency increases susceptibility to phage infection and human serum resistance, and promotes biofilm maturation and cell filamentation, although no effect on virulence was observed in vivo in the Galleria mellonella infection model. On the other hand, C6-HSL promoted sdiA-dependent biofilm maturation, capsule production and serum resistance while reducing virulence against G. mellonella in the absence of sdiA. The addition of C6-HSL did not affect phage susceptibility. The results of this study demonstrate that AHLs and SdiA exert a dual influence on virulence phenotypes, operating both independently and hierarchically. These findings provide new insights into the virulence of K. pneumoniae and its regulation by SdiA.

## Identification of causative agents of infective endocarditis by metagenomic next-generation sequencing of resected valves

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundInfective endocarditis (IE) is a rare and life-threatening condition with considerable mortality rates. Diagnosis is often complicated by negative blood culture results, limiting the accurate identification of causative pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cardiac valve specimens compared to conventional clinical laboratory methods for identifying pathogens in IE.MethodsNineteen patients with suspected IE who were scheduled for surgical valve removal were prospectively enrolled. The metagenomic workflow included bacterial DNA enrichment from resected valves using the Molzym Ultra-Deep Microbiome Prep, sequencing of metagenomic libraries using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and Kraken 2 taxonomic assignments based on read data.ResultsValve mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 100% relative to the final adjudicated pathogen diagnosis. Blood culture, considered the reference standard, exhibited slightly higher sensitivity (88.2%) with comparable specificity (100%). In comparison, valve culture (sensitivity: 29.4%, specificity: 50.0%) and microscopy (sensitivity: 35.3%, specificity: 100%) showed lower diagnostic performance. Delays between blood culture negativization and valve resection impacted mNGS sensitivity, likely due to pathogen clearance. Notably, valves resected within 12 days from blood culture negativization achieved 100% diagnostic accuracy, emphasizing the importance of timing for optimal mNGS results.ConclusionThis study underscores mNGS as a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting IE pathogens, complementing traditional diagnostic methods. The detection of antibiotic resistance genes and multi-locus sequence typing profiles in some samples further demonstrated its utility.

## Computational analysis of Ayurvedic metabolites for potential treatment of drug-resistant Candida auris

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This study explored the effectiveness of secondary metabolites of referred traditional Ayurvedic plants in treating fungal infections, particularly targeting Candida auris. Recognized as a global health threat, this fungus is notorious for its resistance to several antifungal treatments. The inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase causes the depletion of ergosterol, ultimately resulting in the inhibition of fungal cell growth. A total of 469 metabolites, including alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins from Ayurvedic plants, were screened against CYP51 (PDB ID: 4UYL) using molecular docking. Key active site residues, namely HIS461, CYS463, and TYR122, were targeted to inhibit the ergosterol synthesis, with VNI employed to benchmark the findings. Shortlisted metabolites underwent physicochemical analysis, ADMET analyses, and the principles of medicinal chemistry, which were confirmed through pharmacokinetic simulations. Further, this study investigated the molecular dynamics (MD) of co-crystalized VNI, trans-p-coumaric acid, and MCPHB [(r)-n-(1’-methoxycarbonyl-2’-phenylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzamide] to evaluate RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, cross-correlation of residue motions, PCA, and free energy decomposition. The top compounds demonstrated favorable drug-like criteria. They exhibited good absorption potential with high gastrointestinal uptake. Distribution and metabolism were manageable with low risks of drug-drug interactions. Excretion profiles indicated proper clearance, and toxicity assessments showed low potential for cardiovascular issues. The results showed stable interactions for trans-p-coumaric acid and MCPHB, suggesting that all the ligands maintain stable binding interactions with the protein, which preserves structural integrity across all systems. This comprehensive approach suggests that these natural metabolites from Ayurvedic medicine could potentially serve as primary agents against fungal diseases, pending further validation through controlled in vitro and in vivo clinical trials.

## The investigation of molecular epidemiological characteristics and resistance mechanism of tigecycline resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae from a large teaching hospital in southwest China, Chongqing

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae is one of the main pathogens of nosocomial infection, among which carbapenems can be used for multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, in the past decade, the resistance rate of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae has increased yearly. Tigecycline has good antibacterial activity in treating severe bacterial infections, but the reports of tigecycline resistance are increasing. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of drug resistance and epidemiological characteristics of tigecycline-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (TRKP) in a large teaching hospital in southwest China, Chongqing.MethodsWe isolated 30 TRKP strains from this hospital between August 2021 and December 2023. By PCR and sequencing, we examined the presence and mutation rates of genes associated with tigecycline resistance, including acrR, oqxR, ramR, tmexC, tet(x), tet(A), tet(L), and rpsj, and performed efflux pump inhibition experiments to verify efflux pump activity. At the same time, real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the expression levels of efflux pump genes (acrB and oqxB) and ramA. To investigate the prevalence trend of TRKP in our hospital, we performed multi-site sequence typing (MLST) analysis.ResultsThe mutation rates of ramR (73.3%) and tet(A) (63.3%) were significant. In efflux pump inhibition experiments, PaβN could reverse the resistance of 29 TRKP strains (96.7%) to tigecycline. Real-time RT-PCR results showed that acrB and ramA genes were up-regulated in 22 strains, while oqxB genes were overexpressed in only 4 strains. MLST analysis showed that these strains could be divided into 25 different ST subtypes, indicating that no outbreak of TRKP occurred in our hospital. In addition, two tmexCD-torpj positive strains, ST661 and ST1561, were identified for the first time.ConclusionThe efflux pump acrB and tet(A) mutations are the primary mechanisms of resistance to tigecycline-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae at our hospital. The ramR mutation can mediate efflux pump activity of acrB by up-regulating ramA overexpression.

## Infection of human induced pluripotent stem cells by an oncogenic herpesvirus

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveAs one of the major human oncogenic viruses, Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is closely related to several cancers such as Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). KSHV can infect a broad tropism of human primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Embryonic stem cell-like pluripotent stem cells can be generated by the simultaneous introduction of several factors, into somatic cells, yielding induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. However, it remains unclear whether human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are permissive to KSHV and how this oncogenic virus infection may affect cellular gene profile.MethodsIn the current study, we examined whether hiPSCs were permissive to KSHV infection. The flow cytometry was used to assess the impacts of KSHV infection on hiPSCs viability and apoptosis. The Illumina RNA-Sequencing was used to determine cellular gene profile changed in KSHV-infected hiPSCs and lytically induced cells.ResultsWe report that KSHV successfully establishes latent infection in hiPSCs, which can be completely induced to lytic reactivation and release infectious virions. KSHV de novo infection arrests the growth of hiPSCs through inducing cell apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in global cellular gene expression in KSHV-infected hiPSCs as well as lytically induced cells.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate hiPSCs as a powerful tool to explore the potential impacts of KSHV infection on stem cell functions and virus pathogenesis in stem cell differentiated cells.

## Stool carriage of CTX-M/CMY-producing Salmonella enterica in a Chinese tertiary hospital in Shenzhen, China

date: 2025-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Salmonellosis, caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella, is a common foodborne gastrointestinal infection. Third-generation cephalosporins are recommended as the first-line treatment for Salmonella infections. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance, and the transmission of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) genes in 96 clinical Salmonella isolates collected between 2020 and 2022 at a tertiary hospital in Shenzhen, China. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing to identify serotypes, multilocus sequence typing, antimicrobial resistance genes in these isolates, and the genetic structures of the blaCTX-M/blaCMY genes. Seventeen Salmonella serotypes were identified, with S. 4,[5],12:i:- (37.5%) being the most common, followed by S. Enteritidis (15.63%), S. Typhimurium (14.58%), S. London (7.29%), and S. Rissen (5.21%). MLST analysis revealed 19 distinct sequence types (STs), with ST34 being the most prevalent (36.46%), followed by ST11 (15.63%) and ST19 (13.54%). Antimicrobial resistance testing showed those isolates had high levels of resistance to ampicillin (72.92%) and tetracycline (71.88%), with 70.83% of isolates as multidrug-resistant (MDR). Three blaCTX-M genes (blaCTX-M-14,blaCTX-M-55, and blaCTX-M-65) and blaCMY-2 were identified among 18 cefotaxime-resistant strains, of which one and 12 isolates successfully transferred blaCMY or blaCTX-M to E. coli C600 via conjugation, respectively. The blaCTX-M/blaCMY-2-carrying contigs in nine Salmonella isolates ranged from 2,156 to 164,862 bp, were located either on the chromosome (n=1) or plasmids (IncI1, IncK1, IncA/C) (n=9), and the blaCTX-M/blaCMY-2 genes were associated with ISEcp1. Our study demonstrates the diversity of MDR Salmonella serotypes in clinical isolates, and highlights the role of plasmids and mobile genetic elements in the horizontal transfer of blaCTX-M/blaCMY, emphasizing the need for continuous surveillance of Salmonella in clinical samples.

## Tick HRF-dependent ferroptosis pathway to promote tick acquisition of Babesia microti

date: 2025-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

B. microti is a tick-transmitted zoonotic erythrocytic intracellular parasite. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death that affects pathogen replication in the host. Currently, there is limited research concerning the effect of tick ferroptosis on Babesia infection and the underlying mechanism of action. The present study used a B. microti -mouse- Haemaphysalis longicornis infection model in which nymphs fed on the blood of B. microti-infected mice. The midgut divalent iron (p<0.01) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (p<0.05) levels were significantly elevated in infected ticks, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that mitochondrial ridges were absent or decreased in size. Downregulation of ferritin 1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in ticks infected with B. microti suggests that these changes promote ferroptosis. In vivo studies demonstrated that the ferroptosis promoter Erastin increased B. microti load (p<0.05), while the inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 effectively decreased load (p<0.01). Tick histamine-releasing factor (HRF), a protein related to the antioxidant system, was downregulated in infected nymphs compared with uninfected nymphs (p<0.05), and interference with HRF promoted tick acquisition of B. microti (p<0.001). Transcriptomic analyses showed that HRF interference promotes tick ferroptosis by downregulating ferritin 1 and GPX4. Meanwhile, interference with tick HRF molecules showed increased divalent iron and ROS and decreased mitochondrial ridges compared with controls. These findings highlight the critical role of tick HRF molecules in regulating ferroptosis and acquisition of B. microti, thereby providing important insights for a deeper understanding of the tick-Babesia interaction.

## The role of intestinal homeostasis in sevoflurane-induced myelin development and cognitive impairment in neonatal mice

date: 2025-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundInhalational anesthetic sevoflurane is commonly used in pediatric anesthesia. Multiple exposures to sevoflurane in early postnatal life have been associated with long-term abnormalities in myelin development and cognitive and memory impairments, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Disruption of gut microbiota is recognized as an important contributor to neurological diseases. Here, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying the abnormal myelin development induced by multiple sevoflurane exposures in neonatal rats by analyzing gut homeostasis.MethodsSix-day-old (P6) C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 hours per day for three consecutive days. Mice exposed to a mixture of 60% nitrogen and oxygen under the same conditions and duration served as controls. Behavioral tests were conducted between P32 and P42. At P9 (24 hours after the last sevoflurane exposure) and P42 (after the completion of behavioral tests), intestinal and brain examinations were performed to investigate the effects of sevoflurane exposure during the lactation and adolescent periods on gut homeostasis and myelin development in mice. Subsequently, the ameliorative effects of butyrate supplementation on sevoflurane-induced abnormalities in myelin development and cognitive and memory impairments were observed.ResultsAfter repeated exposure to sevoflurane, neonatal mice developed persistent gut microbiota imbalance accompanied by a decrease in short-chain fatty acids. Short-term intestinal inflammation emerged, with damage to the mucus layer and barrier function. In the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, the expression of genes and transcription factors related to oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development was significantly affected, and these changes persisted even after the exposure ended. There was a reduction in proteins associated with oligodendrocytes and myelin formation, which had a certain impact on memory and cognitive behavior. This study also explored the potential connections between microbiota, metabolism, the gut, the brain, and behavior. Timely supplementation with butyrate could effectively reverse these changes, indicating that gut homeostasis is crucial for brain neurodevelopment.ConclusionMultiple exposures to sevoflurane in neonatal mice disrupt gut homeostasis and affect oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin development in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, inducing cognitive and memory impairments. Supplementation with butyrate can alleviate these changes.

## Exploration of the primary antibiofilm substance and mechanism employed by Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741 to inhibit biofilm of Streptococcus mutans

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionLactobacillus salivarius serves as a probiotic potentially capable of preventing dental caries both in vitro and in vivo. This study focused on understanding the key antibiofilm agents and the mechanisms of action of the Lactobacilli supernatant against Streptococcus mutans.MethodsStreptococcus mutans biofilm was constructed and the cell-free supernatant of Lactobacillus salivarius was added. After the biofilm was collected, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were then performed to get gene information. The influence of temperature, pH and other factors on the supernatant were measured and non-targeted metabolome analysis was performed to analyze the effective components.ResultsThe findings indicated that the supernatant derived from Lactobacillus salivarius could inhibit the biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans at different times. Through transcriptome analysis, we discovered that the cell-free supernatant reduced biofilm formation, by suppressing phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems along with two ATP-binding cassette transporters, rather than directly affecting the genes that code for glucosyltransferases; additionally, the supernatant was observed to diminish the expression of genes linked to two-component systems, polyketides/non-ribosomal peptides, acid stress response, quorum sensing, and exopolysaccharide formation. Non-targeted LC-MS/MS analysis was employed to discover a variety of potential active compounds present in the cellular filtrate of Lactobacillus salivarius that hinder the growth of S. mutans, including phenyllactic acid, sorbitol, and honokiol.DiscussionIn summary, our findings support the evaluation of Lactobacillus salivarius as a promising oral probiotic aimed at hindering the formation of biofilms by cariogenic pathogens and the development of dental caries.

## aac(6’)-Iaq, a novel aminoglycoside acetyltransferase gene identified from an animal isolate Brucella intermedia DW0551

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundBacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antimicrobials is becoming increasingly severe due to their use as commonly prescribed antibiotics. The discovery of new molecular mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance is critical for the effective treatment of bacterial infections.MethodsBacteria in goose feces were isolated by plate streaking. The identification and characterization of a novel resistance gene from the bacterial genome involved various techniques, including molecular cloning, drug susceptibility testing, protein expression and purification, and enzyme kinetic analysis. Additionally, whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic studies were performed.ResultsBrucella intermedia DW0551, isolated from goose feces, was resistant to 35 antibiotics, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was particularly high for most aminoglycoside antibiotics. The novel aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6’)-Iaq encoded by B. intermedia DW0551 conferred resistance to netilmicin, sisomicin, amikacin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and ribostamycin. The amino acid sequence of AAC(6’)-Iaq shared the highest identity (52.63%) with the functionally characterized aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6’)-If. AAC(6’)-Iaq contained all the conserved sites of the acetyltransferase family NAT_SF. The enzyme exhibited strong affinity and catalytic activity toward netilmicin and sisomicin. The mobile genetic element (MGE) was not found in the flanking regions of the aac(6’)-Iaq and aac(6’)-Iaq-like genes.ConclusionIn this work, a novel aminoglycoside acetyltransferase gene, designated aac(6’)-Iaq, which conferred resistance to a variety of aminoglycoside antimicrobials, was identified in an animal Brucella intermedia isolate. Identification of new antibiotic resistance mechanisms in bacteria isolated from animals could aid in the treatment of animal and human infectious diseases caused by related bacterial species.

## Gut microbiota: an emerging target connecting polycystic ovarian syndrome and insulin resistance

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly heterogeneous metabolic disorder, with oligomenorrhea and hirsutism as patients’ primary complaints. Hyperinsulinemia is a crucial pathophysiological mechanism in the development of PCOS, with 50-70% of patients exhibiting insulin resistance (IR). This condition not only exacerbates ovulatory dysfunction but also leads to various adverse metabolic outcomes, such as dyslipidemia and diabetes, and increases the risk of cardiovascular events both before and after menopause. Gut microbiota is a microbial community within the host that possesses significant metabolic potential and is shaped by external environmental factors, the neuro-immune network, and metabolism. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely related to the development and progression of PCOS. Despite the growing recognition of the potential role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS, its clinical application remains in its infancy. Currently, most clinical guidelines and expert consensus still emphasize traditional therapeutic approaches, such as hormonal treatments, lifestyle modifications, and insulin sensitizers. However, accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota may influence the metabolic and reproductive health of PCOS patients through various mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the role of gut microbiota between PCOS and IR is essential. This review describes the changes in the gut microbiota of IR-PCOS patients, examines the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota contributes to IR in PCOS patients, and updates the evidence supporting the gut microbiota as a potential metabolic regulatory target in IR-PCOS. In summary, gut microbiota dysbiosis may be involved in the development and progression of IR in PCOS patients, and improving gut microbiota may offer metabolic stability benefits.

## Predicting the immunological nonresponse to antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV: a machine learning-based multicenter large-scale study

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAlthough highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly enhanced the prognosis for people living with HIV (PLWH), some individuals fail to achieve adequate immune reconstitution, known as immunological nonresponse (INR), which is linked to poor prognosis and higher mortality. However, the early prediction and intervention of INR remains challenging in South China.MethodsThis study included 1,577 PLWH who underwent at least two years of HAART and clinical follow-up between 2017 and 2022 at two major tertiary hospitals in South China. We utilized logistic multivariate regression to identify independent predictors of INR and employed restricted cubic splines (RCS) for nonlinear analysis. We also developed several machine-learning models, assessing their performance using internal and external datasets to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was further interpreted using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values.ResultsIndependent predictors of INR included baseline, 6-month and 12-month CD4+ T cell counts, baseline hemoglobin, and 6-month hemoglobin levels. RCS analysis highlighted significant nonlinear relationships between baseline CD4+ T cells, 12-month CD4+ T cells and baseline hemoglobin with INR. The Random Forest model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, with ROC areas of 0.866, 0.943, and 0.897 across the datasets. Calibration was robust, with Brier scores of 0.136, 0.102, and 0.126. SHAP values indicated that early CD4+T cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratio were crucial in predicting INR.ConclusionsThis study introduces the random forest model to predict incomplete immune reconstitution in PLWH, which can significantly assist clinicians in the early prediction and intervention of INR among PLWH.

## Characterization of FosA13, a novel fosfomycin glutathione transferase identified in a Morganella morganii isolate from poultry

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundM. morganii is a species of the genus Morganella in the family Enterobacteriaceae. This species primarily causes infections of postoperative wounds and the urinary tract. Some isolates of M. morganii exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics due to multidrug resistance traits, complicating clinical treatment; thus, there is a growing need to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of this pathogen.MethodsA total of 658 bacterial strains were isolated from anal fecal swabs from poultry and livestock and from the surrounding environment in Wenzhou, China, via plate streaking. The full genome sequences of the bacteria were obtained via next-generation sequencing platforms. The standard agar dilution method was employed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various antimicrobial agents. The resistance gene (fosA13) of the isolate was identified using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and confirmed via molecular cloning. The FosA13 protein encoded by the novel resistance gene fosA13 was expressed with the vector pCold I, and its enzyme kinetics parameters were characterized. The genetic background and evolutionary process of the sequence of this novel resistance gene were analyzed by means of bioinformatics methods.ResultsIn this study, we identified a new chromosomally encoded fosfomycin resistance gene, designated fosA13, from the M. morganii isolate DW0548, which was isolated from poultry on a farm in Wenzhou, China. Compared with the control strain (pUCP19/DH5α), the recombinant strain carrying fosA13 (pUCP19-fosA13/DH5α) presented a fourfold increase in the MIC value for fosfomycin. The enzyme kinetics data of FosA13 revealed effective inactivation of fosfomycin, with a kcat/Km of (1.50 ± 0.02)×104 M-1·s-1. Among functionally characterized resistance proteins, FosA13 presented the highest amino acid (aa) homology (55.6%) with FosA. FosA13 also contained essential functional residues of FosA proteins. The isolate M. morganii DW0548 presented high MIC values (≥ 8 μg/mL) for 5 classes of antimicrobials, namely, aminoglycosides, β-lactams, quinolones, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, but only two functionally characteristic antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been identified in the complete genome: a β-lactam resistance gene (blaDHA-16) and a phenol resistance gene (catII). These findings indicate that in addition to the novel resistance gene identified in this work, other uncharacterized resistance mechanisms might exist in M. morganii DW0548.ConclusionA novel chromosomal fosfomycin resistance gene, fosA13, was identified in an animal M. morganii isolate, and its enzymatic parameters were characterized. This protein shares the highest aa identity of 55.6% with the functionally characterized protein FosA and has all the essential functional residues of FosA proteins. Exploring more antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of this pathogen would help clinicians choose effective drugs to treat infectious diseases in animal husbandry and clinical practice and facilitate the development of methods to prevent the spread of resistance between bacteria of different species.

## Fungi from Malus in Qujing, China: two new species, three new records, and insights into potential host jumping and lifestyle switching

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Apple trees [Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae)] are one of the important temperate fruit crops in China. In comparison to other temperate fruits, such as grapes and pears, fungal studies (in Yunnan) associated with M. domestica are fewer in number. In the present study, we investigated fungi associated with M. domestica in Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China. Samples were collected from apple gardens in different locations. Single spore isolation was carried out to isolate saprobic fungi, while the surface sterilization method was carried out to isolate endophytic fungi. Molecular analyses were carried out to determine the phylogenetic placement of the new collections. Based on the combined methods of morphology and phylogeny, Cytospora qujingensis sp. nov. and Hypoxylon malongense sp. nov. are introduced as novel saprobic and endophytic taxa, respectively. Moreover, Aureobasidium pullulans and Cytospora schulzeri are reported as new geological records from southwestern China. Allocryptovalsa castaneae is reported on M. domestica in China for the first time. The checklist of fungi associated with M. domestica in China is presented.

## Adaptive attenuation of virulence mediated by Wzc mutation in ST11-KL47 Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe impact of the hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype in ST11-KL47 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp) pathogenicity warrants investigation for public health risk assessment.MethodsWe analyzed 230 clinical ST11-KL47 CRKp to identify the key factor in mucoviscosity acquisition via comparative genomic analysis. Sedimentation value served as the objective index to quantify HMV. The virulence in vivo was assessed using Galleria mellonella and mouse infection models. We employed genome engineering, capsular polysaccharides (CPS) quantification, and visualization to explore the role of Wzc mutation in CPS biosynthesis and HMV. The biological impact of Wzc-mediated HMV was investigated through competitive growth analysis, biofilm formation, serum resistance, anti-phagocytic ability, and adhesion assays. Transcriptomic analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized to explore the relationship between polysaccharide composition, physical distribution, and changes in virulence.ResultsThe Wzc mutations are identified as the key to mucoviscosity acquisition. Unexpectedly, Wzc-mediated HMV CRKp exhibits reduced pathogenicity versus non-mucoviscosity (NMV) strains in different animal models, with competitive disadvantage, decreased biofilm formation, serum resistance, and adhesion, yet higher anti-phagocytic ability in vitro. CPS extraction and visualization of genome-engineered strains verify the Wzc mutations mediate HMV by standardizing CPS chain length and overproducing cell-free extracellular polysaccharides (cell-free EPS). Transcriptomic results, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) quantification, and SEM collectively indicate a downregulation of LPS synthesis and the masking of LPS in HMV strains.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the Wzc-induced HMV attenuates ST11-KL47 CRKp virulence by modifying the exopolysaccharide composition and physical distribution.

## The microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide and the kidney diseases

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite, is a co-metabolite produced by both gut microbiota and livers, originating from foods rich in choline or carnitine. Emerging evidence suggests that TMAO may play a role in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Research has demonstrated that heightened levels of TMAO are correlated with a heightened likelihood of kidney disease advancement and cardiovascular incidents among individuals with chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, TMAO has been observed to stimulate inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in animal models of kidney disease. Mechanistically, TMAO may contribute to kidney disease pathogenesis by inhibiting autophagy, activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, targeting TMAO may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of kidney diseases. Future studies are needed to further investigate the role of TMAO in kidney disease pathogenesis and to develop TMAO-targeted therapies for the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases.

## Genomic epidemiology and public health implications of zoonotic monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium ST34

date: 2025-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMonophasic Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type 34 (mSTM ST34) has emerged as a significant global health threat, but our understanding of its genomic epidemiology and potential public health implications in international and regional contexts remains limited. This study aims to fill this crucial gap by assessing the genomic epidemiology of multidrug resistance (MDR) mSTM ST34, as well as its clinical characteristics and virulence.MethodsTo achieve the objectives of this study, we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of mSTM ST34 isolates. We obtained a global dataset comprising 13,844 strains from public databases, along with 339 strains from a regional surveillance collection in Zhejiang Province, China. This dataset aims to provide in-depth insights into antimicrobial resistance, mobile genetic elements, and pathogenicity. Additionally, we meticulously assessed the association between phenotypic profiles and clinical presentations.ResultsOur findings revealed that the prevalence of mSTM ST34 has surpassed that of the previously dominant ST19. In addition, we observed an increase in the detection of the IncQ1 plasmid, which is responsible for disseminating MDR. The prevalence of mSTM ST34 carriage was exceptionally high among children (≤12 years old) and elderly individuals (≥65 years old), with 92.6% of the isolates exhibiting MDR, including resistance to frontline antimicrobials such as third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the human mSTM ST34 strain demonstrates a remarkable capacity for biofilm formation, which increases its virulence in animal models and complicates therapeutic interventions.ConclusionsmSTM ST34 has surpassed the previously dominant ST19, and its ability to transmit across multi-species increases its potential for further human transmission. This study addresses critical gaps in our understanding of mSTM ST34 prevalence, highlighting the importance of whole genome sequencing in surveilling zoonotic pathogens.

## Urinary microbiota changes among NMIBC patients during BCG therapy: comparing BCG responders and non-responders

date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The gold standard for treating high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer involves the transurethral removal of cancerous tissue followed by BCG immunotherapy. So far, there is no reliable biomarker for predicting BCG efficacy and identifying patients who will or will not respond to BCG treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that urinary microbiota may play a crucial role in BCG efficacy. This study aimed to explore (i) changes in urinary microbiota during the six induction cycles of BCG and (ii) its potential predictive role in determining the outcome of BCG treatment. To this end, catheterized urine samples were collected before each of the six BCG doses and bacterial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patient inclusion criteria were male gender, no previous history of urothelial cancer, no other malignancies, no active infection, and no antibiotic usage for at least 20 days before the first BCG dose. We observed a significant decrease in biodiversity, measured by the Shannon Index, during the first week of therapy in 10 out of 12 patients (p=0.021). Additionally, differences in microbiota composition before the start of BCG therapy were noted between responders and non-responders to BCG therapy. Non-responders exhibited a 12 times higher abundance of genus Aureispira (p<0.001), and, at the species level, a 27-fold lower abundance of Negativicoccus succinivorans (p<0.001). Throughout the treatment, the abundance of the genus Aureispira decreased, showing an eightfold reduction by the end of therapy among non-responders (p<0.001). Our findings suggest that urinary microbiota plays an active role before and during the course of BCG therapy. However, this is a preliminary study, and further research involving larger patient cohorts is needed.

## Distinct gut microbiome features characterize Fasciola hepatica infection and predict triclabendazole treatment outcomes in Peruvian patients

date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundFasciola hepatica, a globally distributed helminth, causes fasciolosis, a disease with significant health and economic impacts. Variability in triclabendazole (TCBZ) efficacy and emerging resistance are remaining challenges. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences host-helminth interactions and is associated with anthelmintic effects, but its association with human F. hepatica infection and TCBZ efficacy is not well understood.MethodsIn this study, we investigated the relationship between Fasciola hepatica infection and the gut microbiome through metagenomic shotgun sequencing of 30 infected and 60 age- and sex-matched uninfected individuals from Peru. Additionally, we performed a longitudinal analysis to evaluate microbiome dynamics in relation to TCBZ treatment response.Results and discussionInfection was associated with specific microbial taxonomic and functional features, including higher abundance of Negativibacillus sp900547015, Blautia A sp000285855, and Prevotella sp002299635 species, and enrichment of microbial pathways linked to survival under stress and depletion of pathways for microbial growth. Unexpectedly, we identified that responders to TCBZ treatment (who cleared infection) harbored many microbiome features significantly different relative to non-responders, both before and after treatment. Specifically, the microbiomes of responders had a higher abundance Firmicutes A and Bacteroides species as well as phospholipid synthesis and glucuronidation pathways, while non-responders had higher abundance of Actinobacteria species including several from the Parolsenella and Bifidobacterium genera, and Bifidobacterium shunt and amino acid biosynthesis pathways.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the impact of helminth infection on gut microbiome and suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in modulating TCBZ efficacy, offering novel insights into F. hepatica-microbiome interactions and paving the way for microbiome-informed treatment approaches.

## Gut microbiome is associated with radiotherapy response in lung cancer patients with brain metastases

date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeTo investigate the gut microbiome of lung cancer patients with brain metastases undergoing radiotherapy, identify key microorganisms associated with radiotherapy response, and evaluate their potential as biomarkers.Methods and materialsThis study enrolled 55 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Fecal samples were collected before radiotherapy and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the gut microbiome’s composition and function. Patients were categorized into response (n=28) and non-response (n=27) groups based on treatment efficacy, and α-diversity, β-diversity, and functional pathways were compared between them. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size was used to identify microbial features associated with treatment efficacy. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive capacity of clinical and microbial factors for treatment outcomes.ResultsNo significant difference in α-diversity was observed between the groups (P > 0.05), but β-diversity differed significantly (P = 0.036). Twelve characteristic microorganisms were identified in the response group, including g_ Oscillibacter and g_ Blautia, and nine in the non-response group, such as f_ Desulfovibrionaceae and g_ Megamonas. Metabolic pathways associated with treatment response included ketone body metabolism and pathways related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Multivariate analysis identified g_Flavonifractor (odds ratio [OR] = 6.680, P = 0.004), g_Negativibacillus (OR = 3.862, P = 0.014), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.054, P = 0.017), and systemic inflammation response index (OR = 1.367, P = 0.043) as independent predictors of radiotherapy response. The nomogram and microbiome models achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.935 and 0.866, respectively, demonstrating excellent predictive performance. Decision curve analysis further confirmed these models provided significant net benefits across risk thresholds.ConclusionsThe composition and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome in lung cancer patients with brain metastases prior to radiotherapy are associated with therapeutic response and possess potential as predictive biomarkers. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings.
