## Treatment of xerostomia in Sjögren’s syndrome – what effect does it have on the oral microbiome?

date: 2025-04-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphatic infiltration of secretory tissues. The disease results in dryness of the eyeball or mouth, which often occur simultaneously. Agents used to treat Sjögren’s syndrome may improve oral hydration and the patient’s quality of life. There are several pharmacological and non-pharmacological agents used to treat significant problem like xerostomia. The use of appropriate medicines (i.e. pilocarpine and cevimeline) may cause changes in the local microbiome, which is very sensitive to quantitative changes in water. As a result of Sjögren’s syndrome, a new balance of the microbiome is established in the oral cavity, which, if disturbed by medical measures, may increase the risk of oral lesions (such as periodontopathies or caries) or reduce this risk. Overall, the knowledge regarding microbiological aspects and agents treating oral dryness is still not well described but initial results indicate some microbial alterations.

## Distinct blood and oral microbiome profiles reveal altered microbial composition and functional pathways in myocardial infarction patients

date: 2025-04-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe blood microbiome, increasingly recognized as a distinct microbial niche, may originate partly from oral translocation. We systematically compared circulating and oral microbiome profiles between healthy individuals and myocardial infarction (MI) patients to identify disease-associated signatures.MethodsThe current study recruited 20 participants, including 10 healthy controls and 10 patients with MI. Blood and Saliva samples were collected from each participant to analyze the association between blood and oral microbiome in MI patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.ResultsThe blood microbiome showed significantly greater alpha diversity than the oral microbiome (p<0.05), but beta diversity did not differ significantly. The blood microbiome in MI patients had higher levels of Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteriota, genus Bacteroides, and lower Proteobacteria, whereas the oral microbiome was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Veillonella, and Prevotella_7. LEfSe analysis revealed distinct blood microbial taxa-Actinobacteria in MI patients and Enterobacterales in controls. In contrast, the oral microbiota of healthy subjects was enriched in Rothia, Micrococcaceae, and Micrococcales, while no distinct taxa were associated with MI. Both blood and oral microbiomes showed significant functional pathway differences (KEGG) between groups. Additionally, microbiome signatures significantly correlated with clinical and demographic markers.DiscussionOur study demonstrates that the blood harbors a distinct microbiome characterized by specific microbial taxa and functional pathways rather than merely reflecting oral bacterial translocation. These findings suggest that the circulating microbiome may play an active role in the pathology of MI. Furthermore, we identified significant associations between these microbial signatures and clinical disease markers. This highlights the potential importance of the blood microbiome in understanding the mechanisms underlying MI and its diagnostic or therapeutic implications.

## Vaginal microbiota changes of persistent human papillomavirus infection after cervical conization

date: 2025-04-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveWe investigated the changes in vaginal microbiota among females with persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection following cervical conization in Xinjiang, China.MethodsA total of 108 female participants were enrolled in the study, including 37 HPV-positive females without cervical conization (Group P1), 37 HPV-positive females after cervical conization (Group P2), and 34 HPV-negative females after cervical conization (Group N). DNA was extracted from vaginal secretions, and the V3-V4 regions of bacterial 16S rDNA were amplified and sequenced using NovaSeq technology. The diversity analysis of the bacterial microbiota was conducted using QIIME2 and R software, while the phenotypic analysis was performed with Bugbase software.ResultsLactobacillus was the predominant genus in the vaginal microbiota of women with persistent HPV infection after cervical conization in Xinjiang. Following partial cervical resection, the α-diversity of the vaginal microbiota decreased, particularly among patients who had cleared HPV. Bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes were common in the vaginal environment, with their relative abundance increasing in cases of persistent HPV infection. Postoperative persistent HPV infection was found to be correlated not only with pathogens linked to bacterial vaginosis but also with those associated with aerobic vaginitis. Gardnerella and Atopobium, as well as Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, demonstrated a symbiotic synergy. Both Lactobacillus and Gardnerella exhibited negative correlations with many pathogenic bacteria. Anaerobic and biofilm formation were the most evident phenotypes in individuals with persistent HPV infection after conization.ConclusionThe vaginal microbiota of women with persistent HPV infection following cervical conization is characterized by the coexistence of Lactobacillus dominance and increased microbial diversity. Anaerobic bacteria and biofilm formation may play a significant role in the persistence of HPV infection post-surgery, and the role of Gardnerella in the vaginal flora under an HPV-infected state warrants further study.
