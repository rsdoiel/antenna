## Prevalence of the oral pathogen Filifactor alocis and its FtxA toxin related to clinical parameters and presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans

date: 2025-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The Gram-positive organism Filifactor alocis is implicated in multiple oral diseases including periodontitis, and approximately 50% of known strains encode and produce a recently identified repeat-in-toxin (RTX) protein, FtxA, partly homologous to the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin. By assessing a longitudinal Ghanaian study population of adolescents, we recently identified a possible correlation between F. alocis levels, ftxA gene carriage, and progression of clinical attachment loss (CAL). To extend knowledge on the possible significance of F. alocis and its FtxA in periodontal disease, we have in the present work analyzed saliva samples in an independent cohort of periodontitis (n=156), collected at two private periodontal specialist practices in Perth, Western Australia. The present results corroborate that high loads of F. alocis and the presence of its ftxA gene together are associated with parameters of periodontal tissue destruction and severity. Moreover, among the individuals carrying A. actinomycetemcomitans, a majority also exhibited an ftxA-positive F. alocis, supporting the notion of the synergistic behavior of these two species. This emphasizes that F. alocis and its ftxA are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and may have ecological roles, with diagnostic and prognostic implications for the disease.

## High-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a prognostic marker for 90-day transplant-free mortality in hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure

date: 2025-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) is linked to dyslipidemia and inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and 90-day transplant-free (TF) mortality in patients with HBV-ACLF.MethodsA prospective cohort of 287 patients with HBV-ACLF from Beijing Ditan Hospital was enrolled between January 2016 and December 2019. The prognostic accuracy of lipid profile parameters was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the association between HDL-C levels and mortality was assessed using a restricted cubic spline analysis. Correlations between lipid profile parameters and inflammatory factors were analyzed. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to assess 90-day TF mortality, and log-rank tests were used for comparison analysis. These results were internally validated between January 2020 and December 2023 (n=125).ResultsPatients with lower HDL-C levels exhibited higher mortality rates (adjusted hazard ratio for HDL-C < 0.13 mmol/L: 4.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.35–11.85) compared with those in the reference group (with HDL-C levels above 0.36 mmol/L). An “L-shaped” association was observed between HDL-C levels and TF mortality. The prognostic value of HDL-C (AUC at day 90: 0.732) was comparable to the model for end-stage liver disease score of 0.729. Additionally, HDL-C levels were inversely correlated with interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (all P<0.05). In the training cohort, the 90-day TF mortality rates were 8.3%, 15.2%, 24.0%, and 43.2% for the extremely low, low, medium, and high-risk subgroups, respectively, while in the validation cohort, they were 4.5%, 18.5%, 31.2%, and 44.7%, respectively.ConclusionsHDL-C levels < 0.13 mmol/L were associated with increased 90-day transplant-free mortality in patients with HBV-ACLF. An inverse correlation was found between HDL-C levels and inflammatory markers.

## Visible and rapid detection of feline chaphamaparvovirus using multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification and lateral flow dipstick assay

date: 2025-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Feline chaphamaparvovirus (FeChPV) is a novel parvovirus previously reported in Canadian cats and Chinese dogs with diarrhea in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Herein, we aimed to establish a simple detection method for FeChPV in field clinics. The primers and probes for the multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification and lateral flow dipstick (MIRA-LFD) assay were designed to target the conserved regions of the FeChPV genome and determine the optimal reaction temperature and time. Without relying on precision instruments, FeChPV detection using the MIRA-LFD assay was completed within 20 min at 37°C, without any cross-reaction with other reference viruses. The newly established MIRA-LFD assay had a detection limit of 32.3 copies/μL, which was 10-fold lower than that of the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Furthermore, the MIRA-LFD assay detected 29 FeChPV-positive samples among 417 cats with diarrhea, providing a slightly higher positivity rate than the nested PCR assay. These results indicate that the newly developed MIRA-LFD assay for FeChPV detection is an efficient, economical, reliable, and simple method that can help in the early prevention and control of FeChPV infection.

## Whole-genome analysis of a ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain isolated from the sputum of a 5-year-old child with pneumonia

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sequence type (ST) 45 is a major global MRSA lineage with huge strain diversity and a high clinical impact. In Hainan and Guangzhou of China, the ST45-MRSA was mainly associated with t116.MethodsThe MRSA strain SA2107 was isolated from the sputum of a 5-year-old child with pneumonia. The whole genome of SA2107 was sequence using Illumina (Novaseq 6000) and PacBio (Sequel IIe) sequencers, and the sequences were assembled using hybrid assembly. The carriage of antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes, and mobile genetic elements were identified using bioinformatics tools. The comparative genomic analyses of MRSA strain SA2107 with other MRSA strains worldwide were performed.FindingsThe genome size of ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 MRSA strain SA2107 was ~2.9 Mb. Mobile genetic elements analysis of SA2107 revealed two plasmids (30,064-bp pSA2107-1 and 8,033-bp pSA2107-2), three prophages, two integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), and two insertion sequences (ISs, IS431 and IS1272). The SCCmec IVa (2B) carried by SA2107 contained the class B mec gene complex (IS431-mecA-ΔmecR1-IS1272) and type 2 ccr gene complex (ccrA2 and ccrB2). Besides mecA, another beta-lactam resistance gene blaZ was found to located on six copies of bla complex (blaZ, blaR1, and blaI) on the chromosome of SA2107. Three kinds of virulence factors were detected on the chromosome of SA2107, including genes encoding toxins, exoenzyme, and immune-modulating protein. Notably, the three prophages harbored by the chromosome of SA2107 all carried virulence genes.ConclusionThus far, only three complete genomes available for ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 strain from United States, Germany, and Australia, respectively. The strain SA2107 was the first complete genome data (CP104559) from China for ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 MRSA.

## Characteristics of lower respiratory microbiota in children’s refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia pre- and post-COVID-19 era

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionLittle was known about the characteristics of low respiratory tract (LRT) microbiota of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP) in children before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsForty-two children diagnosed with RMPP in 2019 (Y2019 group) and 33 children diagnosed with RMPP in 2023 (Y2023 group), entered into the study. The characteristics of the clinical findings were examined, and the LRT microbiota was analyzed by metagenomic next generation sequencing.ResultsThe ratio of consolidate, atelectasis, lung necrosis, and erythema multiforme in Y2023 group was significantly higher than that in Y2019 (P<0.05). Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae was the top species of the LRT microbiota in both groups. The rate of macrolide resistance MP in Y2023 was significantly higher than that in Y2019 (P<0.05), and the mutant site was all 23S rRNA A2063G. There were no significant differences in α-diversity and β-diversity of LRT microbiota between Y2019 and Y2023 group. Trichoderma citrinoviride, Canine mastadenovirus A, Ralstonia pickettii, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the biomarkers of LRT microbiota in children with RMPP of Y2023. The abundance of Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae positively correlated with the levels of D-dimer and LDH, negatively correlated with the counts of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and CD16+CD56+ NK cells.DiscussionOur study showed that high abundance of MP was correlated with the severity of RMPP and decrease of immune cells. Trichoderma citrinoviride, Canine mastadenovirus A, Ralstonia pickettii, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the biomarkers in microbiota of LRT in children with RMPP post COVID-19 era.

## CAM/TMA-DPH as a promising alternative to SYTO9/PI for cell viability assessment in bacterial biofilms

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAccurately assessing biofilm viability is essential for evaluating both biofilm formation and the efficacy of antibacterial treatments. Traditional SYTO9 and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead staining in biofilm viability assays often ace challenges due to  non-specific staining, limiting precise differentiation between live and dead cells. To address this limitation, we investigated an alternative staining method employing calcein acetoxymethyl (CAM) to detect viable cells based on esterase activity, and 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH) to assess the remaining biofilm population.MethodsBiofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium were matured and exposed to varying concentrations of antibiotics or sterile medium. Biofilm viability was assessed using CAM/TMA-DPH or SYTO9/PIstaining, followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and ImageJ-based biofilm surface coverage quantification. Viability findings were compared with colony-forming units (CFU/mL), a standard microbial viability measure.ResultsCAM/TMA-DPH staining demonstrated strong positive correlations with CFU counts across all bacterial species (r = 0.59 - 0.91), accurately reflecting biofilm vitality. In contrast, SYTO9/PI staining consistently underestimated the viability of untreated biofilms, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae, where a negative correlation with CFU/mL was observed (r = –0.04). Positive correlations for SYTO9/PI staining were noted in other species (r = 0.65 - 0.79). These findings underscore the limitations of membrane integrity-based staining methods and highlight the advantages of metabolic-based probes like CAM/TMA-DPH.DiscussionOur findings suggest that CAM/TMA-DPH staining provides a promising alternative to SYTO9/PI for cell viability assessment in bacterial biofilms, highlighting the advantages of metabolic-based probes over traditional membrane integrity assays. The consistency of CAM/TMA-DPH staining across different bacterial species underscores its potential to advance studies on biofilm and contribute to the development of more effective anti-biofilm treatments, which is essential for clinical management of biofilm-associated infections.

## Characterization of the Vibrio anguillarum VaRyhB regulon and role in pathogenesis

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe marine Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio anguillarum is one of the major pathogens in aquaculture. Iron uptake is a prerequisite for virulence and is strictly controlled by a global iron uptake regulator, Fur, which acts as a repressor under iron-replete conditions. When iron is depleted, Fur also functions as an activator, playing an important role in pathogenesis. It is unclear whether this upregulation model is mediated by a small RNA, RyhB. MethodsThe small RNA, VaryhB, was deleted in V. anguillarum strain 775, and its regulon was investigated using transcriptomic analysis. The roles of VaRyhB in siderophore synthesis, chemotaxis and motility, and oxidative stress were evaluated using chrome azurol S (CAS) liquid assay, swimming motility assay, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, respectively. The virulence of VaRyhB was evaluated by challenging turbot larvae intraperitoneally. ResultsThe small RNA called VaRyhB identified in V. anguillarum strain 775 is significantly longer than that in Escherichia coli. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that VaRyhB is critical for iron homeostasis under limited iron conditions, and deletion of VaRyhB resulted in lower expression levels of certain genes for siderophore biosynthesis and transport, thereby leading to impaired growth, reduced siderophore production, and decreased pathogenesis. The virulence factor motility is also upregulated by VaRyhB, and reduced motility capability was observed in the ΔVaryhB mutant, which may be another reason resulting in weak pathogenesis. The sensitivity toward H2O2 in the ΔVafur mutant could be restored by the loss of VaRyhB, suggesting that the role of Fur in oxidative stress is mediated by VaRyhB. VaRyhB also functions to inhibit the expression of genes involved in Fe-S assembly and the TCA cycle. In addition, two aspects of the type VI secretion system and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis were first identified as being regulated by VaRyhB. ConclusionIn V. anguillarum, the sRNA VaRyhB plays a critical role in the inhibition of genes involved in the TCA cycle, Fe-S assembly, and the type VI secretion system. It is also essential for the activation of siderophore synthesis, chemotaxis and motility, and anaerobic denitrification. Our work provides the first evidence of the VaRyhB regulon and its role in the pathogenesis of V. anguillarum.

## Decoding mitochondrial DNA  damage and repair associated with H. pylori infection

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mitochondrial genomic stability is critical to prevent various human inflammatory diseases. Bacterial infection significantly increases oxidative stress, driving mitochondrial genomic instability and initiating inflammatory human disease. Oxidative DNA base damage is predominantly repaired by base excision repair (BER) in the nucleus (nBER) as well as in the mitochondria (mtBER). In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of spontaneous and H. pylori infection-associated oxidative mtDNA damage, mtDNA replication stress, and its impact on innate immune signaling. Additionally, we discuss how mutations located on mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS) of BER genes may contribute to mtDNA genome instability and innate immune signaling activation. Overall, the review summarizes evidence to understand the dynamics of mitochondria genome and the impact of mtBER in innate immune response during H. pylori-associated pathological outcomes.

## Borrelia burgdorferi tolerates alteration to P66 porin function in a murine infectivity model

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Borrelia burgdorferi exists in a complex enzootic life cycle requiring differential gene regulation. P66, a porin and adhesin, is upregulated and essential during mammalian infection, but is not produced or required within the tick vector. We sought to determine whether the porin function of P66 is essential for infection. Vancomycin treatment of B. burgdorferi cultures was used to screen for P66 porin function and found to generate spontaneous mutations in p66 (bb0603). Three novel, spontaneous, missense P66 mutants (G175V, T176M, and G584R) were re-created by site-directed mutagenesis in an infectious strain background and tested for infectivity in mice by ID50 experiments. Two of the three mutants retained infectivity comparable to the isogenic control, suggesting that B. burgdorferi can tolerate alteration to P66 porin function during infection. The third mutant exhibited highly attenuated infectivity and produced low levels of P66 protein. Interestingly, four isolates that were recovered for p66 sequencing from mouse tissues revealed novel secondary point mutations in genomic p66. However, these secondary mutations did not rescue P66 porin function. New structural modeling of P66 is presented and consistent with these experimental results. This is the first work to assess the contribution of P66 porin function to B. burgdorferi pathogenesis.

## Rapid diagnostic testing combined with an immediate infectious disease consultation increases the rate of septic intensive care unit patients on targeted antibiotic therapy

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) combined with immediate infectious disease (ID) consultation on the treatment of septic patients with positive blood cultures in intensive care units in a setting without 24/7 service.MethodsAdult ICU patients in a tertiary care hospital with positive blood cultures were included from January 2019 to December 2020. The control group underwent routine laboratory testing, and for the intervention group, RDT was applied with immediate ID consultation.ResultsIn 77 out of the 91 patients in the intervention group, the pathogen was identified by RDT. Regarding antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), genotypic testing (ePlex®) was successful for Gram-positive cocci, but inadequate for Gram-negative rods. Phenotypic resistance testing with the Accelerate PhenoTest® took too long to be successfully integrated into the intervention. Adaptation of empirical antibiotic therapy was recommended for 72.7% of the patients. Adherence to the ID consultation post-RDT results was high at 82.3%. In the control group, adaptation of the initial antibiotic therapy would have been recommended for 81.8% of patients, if the species identification had been available. Overall adherence to the local antibiotic therapy guideline for sepsis was significantly lower in the control than in the intervention group (27.8% versus 89.3%, p<0.001).ConclusionIntegration of an RDT system in the microbiological workflow for septic patients in ICU combined with a standardized ID intervention led to a significantly higher percentage of adequate antimicrobial treatment and greater adherence to local antibiotic therapy recommendations, even in a setting where 24/7 service is not available.

## Decoding MexB efflux pump genes: structural, molecular, and phylogenetic analysis of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveEmerging drug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of great concern in clinical settings. P. aeruginosa activates its efflux-pump system in order to evade the effect of antibiotics. The current investigation aims to detect MexB genes in P. aeruginosa, their structural and molecular analysis and their impact on antimicrobial susceptibility profiling.MethodsA total of 42 clinical specimens were aseptically collected from hospitalized patients who had underlying infections related to medical implants. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) were used for the identification of isolates. The methods used in this study were antibiotic susceptibility profiling, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sanger sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, MolProbity score, Ramachandran plot analysis and multiple sequence alignment.ResultsThe highest resistance was shown by P. aeruginosa against cefoperazone (67%), gentamycin and amikacin (66%) each, followed by cefotaxime (64%). The prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) was 57% and 12%, respectively. The presence of an active efflux-pump system was indicated by the MexB genes found in most of the resistant isolates (p<0.05). Following addition of efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a significant decrease (p<0.05) in MIC was observed in resistance, that revealed the presence of active efflux pump system. Phylogenetic analysis revealed evolutionary relationships with the P. aeruginosa strains isolated in Switzerland, Denmark and Germany. Protein domain architecture revealed that MexB gene proteins were involved in particular efflux pump function. Protein sequences aligned by multiple sequence alignment revealed conserved regions and sequence variants, which suggested antibiotic translocation and evolutionary divergence. These highly conserved regions could be used for diagnostic purposes of efflux pump MexB genes.ConclusionTo avoid their spread in hospital settings, responsible authorities ought to begin rigorous initiatives in order to reduce the prevalence of multi-drug resistant, extensively drug resistant, and efflux pump carrying isolates in clinical settings.

## Whole-genome sequencing reveals transmission pattern and drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis intra- or inter-hosts

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) remains a serious global public health problem. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is responsible for approximately 10 million new TB cases globally each year. This study aimed to investigate transmission pattern and drug resistance of MTB in Shenzhen, China.MethodsA retrospective study on 286 samples from 184 TB patients collected between 2015 and 2018 in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital was conducted using whole-genome sequencing. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed using both phenotypic DST (pDST) and molecular DST (mDST). Sample diversity was evaluated by SNPs and transmission clusters were identified based on SNP differences of 12 or fewer in genetic clusters.ResultsExcept four samples identified as non-tuberculous mycobacteria, 282 MTB samples (181 patients) underwent mDST, with 244 samples (162 patients) undergoing pDST. The overall multidrug-resistant rate in patients was 22.31% in pDST (12.00% for new patients and 40.82% for retreatment patients) and 34.48% in mDST (20.41% for new patients and 58.21% for retreatment patients). Totally 92 transmission clusters were identified, encompassing 70.21% samples (57.46% patients), with 5 clusters containing samples (15, 5.32%) from different patients (9, 4.97%), indicating recent transmission. The drug-resistant mutations in 36 of 45 transmission clusters (80.00%) were identical in all samples, suggesting the transmission of drug resistance. Patients with multiple samples were categorized into simultaneous sampling (SS) and continuous sampling (CS) groups, revealing significant differences in treatment types, treatment outcomes, residential addresses, and drug resistance types. mDST showed greater accuracy than pDST in SS and CS groups. A novel method based on heterozygous SNPs and two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test were developed and identified 12 (4.26%) samples as mixed infection samples. Six of 12 patients had mixed and pure samples together, and major strains of mixed samples were closer to corresponding pure strains than minor strains.ConclusionsThis retrospective study, conducted at the only municipal hospital specializing in infectious diseases in Shenzhen, provides the opportunity to understand drug resistance of TB patients, which mainly are refractory patients. The study revealed transmission patterns of MTB, analyzed mixed infections, and tracked changes in MTB strains during short/long-term treatment.

## Lateral flow assay as radiological prognosis factor of pulmonary cryptococcosis: a single center retrospective study in China

date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundLateral flow assay (LFA) has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cryptococcosis. However, its role in predicting therapeutic efficacy for pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC) remains underexplored.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of HIV-negative patients with PC to describe the clinical profile and identify potential predictors of radiological prognosis.ResultsAll the 168 participants received antifungal therapy with a triazole agent. Of these, 84.5% experienced partial or complete absorption of pulmonary lesions. The results of the gamma test, chi-square trend test, and ordinal logistic regression all indicated that both baseline LFA and changes in LFA after treatment were significant predictors of imaging prognosis. The degree of radiological improvement was inversely associated with the baseline LFA positive grade(P for linear-by-linear association: 0.011, Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.17; γ= -0.368, P = 0.045). Patients with a decrease in LFA after therapy had significantly better radiological outcomes compared to those with equal or increased LFA(linear-by-linear association, P = 0.014, Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.188; γ = 0.371, P = 0.012). Additionally, favorable outcomes were more likely in patients with lesions confined to the right lung.ConclusionsLFA shows potential of monitoring radiological outcomes in pulmonary cryptococcosis.

## Vitamin D supplementation during intensive care unit stay is associated with improved outcomes in critically Ill patients with sepsis: a cohort study

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPatients with vitamin D deficiency are susceptible to increased microbial infection and increased risk of mortality. However, whether vitamin D supplementation would improve their prognosis remains uncertain.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from MIMIC-IV database, a publicly available database containing clinical information on patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) from 2008 to 2019. Adult patients with sepsis were included in the analysis. The exposure factor was vitamin D supplementation during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Both propensity score matching (PSM) and stepwise regression analyses were employed to adjust for potential confounders.ResultsA total of 20230 eligible patients were enrolled in the entire unmatched cohort, and 8710 patients were included in the matched cohort. In PSM analysis, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 14.04% (250/1780) in the vitamin D group and 22.31% (1546/6930) in the no vitamin D group. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased 28-day all-cause mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.49-0.64; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed consistent benefits regardless of the baseline vitamin D status (deficiency: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.33-1.50; p = 0.36; insufficiency: HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; p < 0.001; sufficiency: HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88; p = 0.03). Additionally, vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased ICU mortality (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.29-0.48; p < 0.001) and reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48-0.68; p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis using the unmatched cohort confirmed these findings (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76; p < 0.001).ConclusionsVitamin D supplementation may reduce mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. However, further high-quality prospective studies are still needed to validate these findings.

## SERINC5 counters retroviruses and non-retroviruses

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

SERINC5 (serine incorporator 5), a member of the serine incorporator family, has been identified as a retrovirus restriction factor that inhibits the fusion of virions with the plasma membrane, thus blocking the release of the viral core into target cells and subsequently attenuating viral infectivity. Several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), have evolved mechanisms to antagonize the host protein SERINC5 through HIV Nef, MLV glycosylated Gag, and the EIAV S2 protein. These viral proteins degrade SERINC5 on the cell surface through the endolysosomal system. In addition to its direct antiviral ability, SERINC5 also modulates immunity to inhibit the replication of retroviruses and nonretroviruses. This review summarizes the interaction between SERINC5 and viral replication, providing a promising avenue for fighting viral diseases.

## A mouse model of immunosuppression facilitates oral Candida albicans biofilms, bacterial dysbiosis and dissemination of infection

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Opportunistic pathogens are a major threat to people, especially those with impaired immune systems. Two of the most important microbes in this category are the fungus Candida albicans and Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Enterococcus, which share overlapping niches in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The clinical importance of oral C. albicans biofilm and its interaction with the host under immunosuppressive conditions remains largely understudied. Here, we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) with cortisone acetate injection on alternate days and a continuous supply of C. albicans in drinking water for three days, resulting in immunosuppression. Results showed abundant growth of resident oral bacteria and a strong C. albicans biofilm on the tongue consisting of hyphae which damaged papillae, the epidermal layer, and invaded tongue tissue with the accumulation of inflammatory cells as demonstrated by Grocott’s methenamine silver and hematoxylin and eosin staining, respectively. The dispersed microbes from the oral biofilm colonized the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and damaged its integrity, disseminating microbes to other organs. Although no visible damage was observed in the kidney and liver, except increased lipid vacuoles in the liver cells, C. albicans was found in the liver homogenate. Intriguingly, we found co-occurrence of Enterococcus faecalis in the tongue, liver, and stool of immunosuppressed control and C. albicans infected organs. Targeted 16S rRNA and ITS2 amplicon sequencing of microbes from the fecal samples of mice confirmed the above results in the stool samples and revealed an inverse correlation of beneficial microbes in the dysbiosis condition. Our study shows that mucosal-oral infection of C. albicans under immunosuppressed conditions causes tissue damage and invasion in local and distant organs; the invasion may be aided by the overgrowth of the resident endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and other members, including the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.

## Impact of HIV on HPV-related cancers in men who have sex with men: a review

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) significantly increases the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related cancers among men who have sex with men (MSM). Conversely, HPV infection can also influence HIV acquisition rates. HIV-induced immune suppression may affect chromosomal stability, gene expression, protein function and other molecular components in MSM with HPV-related cancers. Additionally, HIV infection also alters cellular mechanisms by compromising immune responses and epithelial integrity. In this review, we reviewed the influence of HIV on specific HPV-related cancers in MSM, including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, penile cancer, and anal cancer. We integrated epidemiological data from the past five years and discussed diagnosis and treatment strategies. Overall, our review offers crucial insights into the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of these co-infection MSM patients. Our review aims to assist future research in developing effective treatment strategies for MSM with HIV/HPV co-infection.

## Population genetic analysis of clinical Mycobacterium abscessus complex strains in China

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTo explore the genetic characteristics of the Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) population in China, given its rising clinical importance among nontuberculous mycobacteria.MethodsWe conducted population genetic analyses on 360 MABC genomes from China, focusing on core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), pan-genome characterization, population genetics, and antimicrobial resistance gene profiling.ResultsOur analysis identified 273 M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (MabA) and 87 M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (MabM) isolates, uncovering 68 sequence types (STs), with ST5 being the most common. cgMLST classified 33.3% of isolates into six dominant circulating clones (DCCs) and 49.4% into 59 genomic clusters at a threshold of 25 different alleles, including 18 international clusters linking Chinese isolates with seven other countries. The MABC pan-genome is open, with MabA exhibiting greater accessory gene diversity and higher gene turnover compared to MabM. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as prophages and genomic islands, were prevalent across all genomes. 139 to 151 virulence factors (VFs) were identified per genome, with distinct accessory VFs in MabA and MabM affecting immune modulation and metabolism. Resistance gene profiling revealed ubiquitous mtrA, RbpA, and blaMAB, with MabA-specific erm(41) conferring resistance to macrolides and β-lactams. Common rrs and rrl gene mutations indicated widespread resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides, while gyrA mutations suggested emerging fluoroquinolone resistance. An acquired erm(46) gene, likely obtained via phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer, was detected in one MabA strain.ConclusionThis study provides key genetic insights into the dynamics of MABC in China. The widespread distribution of DCCs, high genomic clustering rates, open pan-genome, and distinct resistance patterns between MabA and MabM, along with MGEs, highlight the need for targeted surveillance and tailored therapies to address emerging challenges in MABC infections.

## Identification of serotype O3b and high-risk clone ST37 of Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed by comparative genomic analysis

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundEpidemiological risk factors such as the demography of a place, environment, food, livestock, and companion animals are known sources of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become a powerful tool to complement traditional microbiological characterization of foodborne pathogens. Moreover, K. pneumoniae has several species complexes (KpSC) and is very difficult to differentiate using routine microbiological methods. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of K. pneumoniae in fish available in the retail market using WGS.MethodsIsolation of K. pneumoniae, identification of K. pneumoniae isolates, and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were performed. Whole-genome sequencing of K. pneumoniae genomes and phylogenomic analysis were conducted for visual comparison of the genomes. Furthermore, genomes of non-human origin that were submitted from India to the NCBI database were downloaded and included in the comparative analysis.ResultsThe findings showed that many antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) are prominent, including acrD, BaeR, cpxA, mdtB, mdtC, CRP, H-NS, KpnE, KpnF, KpnG, KpnH, acrA, acrB, marA, ramB, oqxA, oqxB, LptD, and emrR. Four fish-sourced isolates had different blaSHV resistance gene variants. The presence of ARGs for aminoglycosides [aac(3)-IId], fluoroquinolones (oqxA, oqxB), and fosfomycin (fosA5, fosA6) in these K. pneumoniae isolates from fish sources was found. One of the CIFT-K6 isolates had the uncommon serotype of K. pneumoniae O3b with the high-risk clone “ST37.” The ST515 sequence type was present in two K. pneumoniae isolates (CIFT-K7 and CIFT-K8), but the O3b serotype and ST192 allele type were present in the CIFT-K10 isolate.ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, this research study represents the first Indian report of K. pneumoniae linked to fish, specifically the high-risk clone ‘ST37’ and two other STs, 515 and 192. The most common plasmid type detected in all four isolates was IncFIB, and 75% of the isolates were IncFII and IncHI1B. The prevalence of ARGs linked to efflux pump resistance mechanisms is highlighted by the analysis of genome sequence data.

## The histone methyltransferase DOT1B is dispensable for stage differentiation and macrophage infection of Leishmania mexicana

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Conserved histone methyltransferases of the DOT1 family are involved in replication regulation, cell cycle progression, stage differentiation, and gene regulation in trypanosomatids. However, the specific functions of these enzymes depend on the host evasion strategies of the parasites. In this study, we investigated the role of DOT1B in Leishmania mexicana, focusing on life cycle progression and infectivity. In contrast to Trypanosoma brucei, in which DOT1B is essential for the differentiation of mammal-infective bloodstream forms to insect procyclic forms, L. mexicana DOT1B (LmxDOT1B) is not critical for the differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes in vitro. Additionally, there are no significant differences in the ability to infect or differentiate in macrophages or sand fly vectors between the LmxDOT1B-depleted and control strains. These findings highlight the divergence of the function of DOT1B in these related parasites, suggesting genus-specific adaptations in the use of histone modifications for life cycle progression and host adaptation processes.
