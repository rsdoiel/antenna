## The predictive value of peripheral blood cell mitochondrial gene expression in identifying the prognosis in pediatric sepsis at preschool age

date: 2024-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSepsis represents a severe manifestation of infection often accompanied by metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and the expression of specific mitochondrial genes have emerged as sensitive indicators of mitochondrial function. To investigate the utility of mitochondrial gene expression in peripheral blood cells for distinguishing severe infections and predicting associated outcomes, we conducted a prospective cohort study.MethodsWe established a prospective cohort comprising 74 patients with non-sepsis pneumonia and 67 cases of sepsis induced by respiratory infections, aging from 2 to 6 years old. We documented corresponding clinical data and laboratory information and collected blood samples upon initial hospital admission. Peripheral blood cells were promptly isolated, and both total DNA and RNA were extracted. We utilized absolute quantification PCR to assess mtDNA-CN, as well as the expression levels of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6. Subsequently, we extended these comparisons to include survivors and non-survivors among patients with sepsis using univariate and multivariate analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the diagnostic potential.ResultsThe mtDNA-CN in peripheral blood cells was significantly lower in the sepsis group. Univariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in the expression of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 in patients with sepsis. However, multivariate analysis did not support the use of mitochondrial function in peripheral blood cells for sepsis diagnosis. In the comparison between pediatric sepsis survivors and non-survivors, univariate analysis indicated a substantial reduction in the expression of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 among non-survivors. Notably, total bilirubin (TB), mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 levels were identified as independent risk factors for sepsis-induced mortality. ROC curves were then established for these independent risk factors, revealing areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.753 for TB (95% CI 0.596–0.910), 0.870 for mt-CO1 (95% CI 0.775–0.965), 0.987 for mt-ND1 (95% CI 0.964–1.000), and 0.877 for mt-ATP6 (95% CI 0.793–0.962).ConclusionMtDNA-CN and mitochondrial gene expression are closely linked to the severity and clinical outcomes of infectious diseases. Severe infections lead to impaired mitochondrial function in peripheral blood cells. Notably, when compared to other laboratory parameters, the expression levels of mt-CO1, mt-ND1, and mt-ATP6 demonstrate promising potential for assessing the prognosis of pediatric sepsis.

## MnoSR removal in Mycobacterium smegmatis triggers broad transcriptional response to 1,3-propanediol and glucose as sole carbon sources

date: 2024-07-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe two-component signal transduction systems play an essential role in the adaptation of bacteria to changing environmental conditions. One of them is the MnoSR system involved in the regulation of methylotrophic metabolism in M. smegmatis.MethodsMycobacterium smegmatis mutant strains ΔmnoS, ΔmnoR and ΔmnoS/R lacking functional mnoS, mnoR and both genes were generated using a homologous recombination approach. MnoR recombinant protein was purified by affinity column chromatography. The present study employs molecular biology techniques: cloning strategies, global RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, EMSA, Microscale thermophoresis, and bioinformatics analysis.Results and discussionThe ∆mnoS, ∆mnoR, and ∆mnoS/R mutant strains were generated and cultured in the presence of defined carbon sources. Growth curve analysis confirmed that inactivation of the MnoSR impairs the ability of M. smegmatis cells to use alcohols such as 1,3-propanediol and ethanol but improves the bacterial growth on ethylene glycol, xylitol, and glycerol. The total RNA sequencing method was employed to understand the importance of MnoSR in the global responses of mycobacteria to limited carbon access and in carbon-rich conditions. The loss of MnoSR significantly affected carbon utilization in the case of mycobacteria cultured on glucose or 1,3-propanediol as sole carbon sources as it influenced the expression of multiple metabolic pathways. The numerous transcriptional changes could not be linked to the presence of evident MnoR DNA-binding sites within the promotor regions for the genes outside of the mno operon. This was confirmed by EMSA and microscale thermophoresis with mutated MnoR binding consensus region. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the system’s vital role in metabolic adaptability, providing insights into its potential impact on the environmental survival of mycobacteria.

## Small RNA GadY in Escherichia coli enhances conjugation system of IncP-1 by targeting SdiA

date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Plasmid-mediated conjugation is a common mechanism for most bacteria to transfer antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The conjugative transfer of ARGs is emerging as a major threat to human beings. Although several transfer-related factors are known to regulate this process, small RNAs (sRNAs)-based regulatory roles remain to be clarified. Here, the Hfq-binding sRNA GadY in donor strain Escherichia coli (E. coli) SM10λπ was identified as a new regulator for bacterial conjugation. Two conjugation models established in our previous studies were used, which SM10λπ carrying a chromosomally integrated IncP-1α plasmid RP4 and a mobilizable plasmid pUCP24T served as donor cells, and P. aeruginosa PAO1 or E. coli EC600 as the recipients. GadY was found to promote SM10λπ-PAO1 conjugation by base-pairing with its target mRNA SdiA, an orphan LuxR-type receptor that responds to exogenous N-acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs). However, SM10λπ-EC600 conjugation was not affected due to EC600 lacking AHLs synthase. It indicates that the effects of GadY on conjugation depended on AHLs-SdiA signalling. Further study found GadY bound SdiA to negatively regulate the global RP4 repressors KorA and KorB. When under ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin treatment, GadY expression in donor strain was enhanced, and it positively regulated quinolone-induced SM10λπ-PAO1 conjugation. Thus, our study provides a novel role for sRNA GadY in regulating plasmid-mediated conjugation, which helps us better understand bacterial conjugation to counter antibiotic resistance.

## Characteristics and pathogenicity of Vibrio alginolyticus SWS causing high mortality in mud crab (Scylla serrata) aquaculture in Hong Kong

date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionVibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium belonging to the family of Vibrionaceae, a common pathogen in aquaculture animals, However, studies on its impact on Scylla serrata (mud crabs) are limited. In this study, we isolated V. alginolyticus SWS from dead mud crab during a disease outbreak in a Hong Kong aquaculture farm, which caused up to 70% mortality during summer.MethodsExperimental infection and histopathology were used to investigate the pathogenicity of V. alginolyticus SWS in S. serrata and validate Koch’s postulates. Comprehensive whole-genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and biochemical characterization were also performed. ResultsOur findings showed that V. alginolyticus SWS caused high mortality (75%) in S. serrata with infected individuals exhibiting inactivity, loss of appetite, decolored and darkened hepatopancreas, gills, and opaque muscle in the claw. Histopathological analysis revealed tissue damage and degeneration in the hepatopancreas, gills, and claw muscle suggesting direct and indirect impacts of V. alginolyticus SWS infection.ConclusionsThis study provides a comprehensive characterization of V. alginolyticus SWS as an emerging pathogen in S. serrata aquaculture. Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance, early detection, and the development of targeted disease management strategies to mitigate the economic impact of vibriosis outbreaks in mud crab aquaculture.

## Role of cuticular genes in the insect antimicrobial immune response

date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Insects are established models for understanding host-pathogen interactions and innate immune mechanisms. The innate immune system in insects is highly efficient in recognizing and opposing pathogens that cause detrimental effects during infection. The cuticular layer which covers the superficial layer of the insect body participates in host defense and wound healing by inducing innate immune responses. Previous studies have started to address the involvement of cuticular genes in conferring resistance to insect pathogens, particularly those that infect by disrupting the insect cuticle. For example, the cuticular gene Transglutaminase (TG) in Drosophila melanogaster plays a structural role in cuticle formation and blood coagulation and also possesses immune properties against pathogenic infection. However, more information is becoming available about the immune function of other cuticular gene families in insects. In this review, we aim to highlight the recent advances in insect cuticular immunity and address the necessity of pursuing further research to fill the existing gaps in this important field of insect immunology. This information will lead to novel strategies for the efficient management of agricultural insect pests and vectors of plant and human disease.

## The expression of immune response genes in patients with chronic Chagas disease is shifted toward the levels observed in healthy subjects as a result of treatment with Benznidazole

date: 2024-07-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionChagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite infection, is a potentially life-threatening neglected tropical disease with a worldwide distribution. During the chronic phase of the disease, there exists a fragile balance between the host immune response and parasite replication that keeps patients in a clinically-silent asymptomatic stage for years or even decades. However, in 40% of patients, the disease progresses to clinical manifestations mainly affecting and compromising the cardiac system. Treatment is recommended in the chronic phase, although there are no early markers of its effectiveness. The aim of this study is to identify differential expression changes in genes involved in the immune response in antigen-restimulated PBMC from chronic patients with Chagas disease due to benznidazole treatment.MethodsThus, high-throughput real-time qPCR analysis has been performed to simultaneously determine global changes in the expression of 106 genes involved in the immune response in asymptomatic (IND) and early cardiac manifestations (CCC I) Chagas disease patients pre- and post-treatment with benznidazole.Results and discussionThe results revealed that 7 out of the 106 analyzed genes were differentially expressed (4 up- and 3 downregulated) after treatment in IND patients and 15 out of 106 (3 up- and 12 downregulated) after treatment of early cardiac Chagas disease patients. Particularly in CCC I patients, regulation of the expression level of some of these genes towards a level similar to that of healthy subjects suggests a beneficial effect of treatment and supports recommendation of benznidazole administration to early cardiac Chagas disease patients. The data obtained also demonstrated that both in asymptomatic patients and in early cardiac chronic patients, after treatment with benznidazole there is a negative regulation of the proinflammatory and cytotoxic responses triggered as a consequence of T. cruzi infection and the persistence of the parasite. This downregulation of the immune response likely prevents marked tissue damage and healing in early cardiac patients, suggesting its positive effect in controlling the pathology.

## Elevation of IL-8 secretion induced by PEDV infection via NF-κB signaling pathway

date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is associated with severe enteritis, which contributes to high mortality in piglets. The aim of this study was to describe molecular mechanisms associated with proinflammatory cytokine(s) production during PEDV infection. We showed that infection of porcine intestine epithelial cell clone J2 (IPEC-J2) with PEDV induces a gradual increase in interleukin 8 (IL-8) production at different time points, as well as infection of Vero E6 with PEDV. The secretion of IL-8 in these two cell lines infected with PEDV is related to the activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, the cells expressing PEDV M or E protein can induce the upregulation of IL-8. These findings suggest that the IL-8 production can be the initiator of inflammatory response by the host cells upon PEDV infection.

## Biliary atresia: the role of gut microbiome, and microbial metabolites

date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease affecting both the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, potentially leading to chronic cholestasis and biliary cirrhosis. Despite its prevalence, the exact mechanisms behind BA development remain incompletely understood. Recent research suggests that the gut microbiota and its metabolites may play significant roles in BA development. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the changing characteristics of gut microbiota and their metabolites at different stages of BA in children. It discusses their influence on the host’s inflammatory response, immune system, and bile acid metabolism. The review also explores the potential of gut microbiota and metabolites as a therapeutic target for BA, with interventions like butyrate and gut microbiota preparations showing promise in alleviating BA symptoms. While progress has been made, further research is necessary to untangle the complex interactions between gut microbiota and BA, paving the way for more effective prevention and treatment strategies for this challenging condition.

## Molecular and phenotypic characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in a Japanese tertiary care hospital

date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This study aimed to investigate the bacterial characteristics of pneumococcal isolates obtained from a tertiary care hospital in Japan. We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility, possession of macrolide resistance genes, pneumococcal serogroup/serotype, and sequence type (ST) of pneumococcal isolates from patients aged 15 years or older between 2011 and 2020 at Nagasaki University Hospital. Of the 73 isolates analyzed, 86.3% showed resistance to macrolides, and 28.8%, 46.6%, and 11.0% harbored mefA, ermB, and both, respectively. Of the isolates possessing ermB, 97.6% showed high levels of macrolide resistance [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, > 16 µg/mL]. Solithromycin (MIC range, 0.03–0.25 µg/mL), regardless of the presence of macrolide resistance genes, and lascufloxacin (MIC range, 0.06–0.5 µg/mL) showed potent in vitro activity against pneumococci. Serotype 19A was the most prevalent (six isolates), followed by serotypes 10A, 15A, and 15B/C (five isolates each). Four serotypes (11A, 19A, 22F, and 23B) and five STs (36, 99, 433, 558, and 3111) were significantly correlated with the presence of macrolide resistance genes. All four isolates with serotype 11A/ST99 and three isolates with serotype 19A/ST3111 harbored both mefA and ermB. No macrolide resistance genes were detected in either of the two isolates with serotype 22F/ST433, while all ten isolates with serogroup 15 (serotypes 15A and 15B/C, five isolates each) possessed ermB alone. Our study revealed the bacterial characteristics of the pneumococcal isolates obtained from our hospital. In vitro activity of solithromycin and lascufloxacin against these isolates was confirmed.

## Genome composition-based deep learning predicts oncogenic potential of HPVs

date: 2024-07-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) account for more than 30% of cancer cases, with definite identification of the oncogenic role of viral E6 and E7 genes. However, the identification of high-risk HPV genotypes has largely relied on lagged biological exploration and clinical observation, with types unclassified and oncogenicity unknown for many HPVs. In the present study, we retrieved and cleaned HPV sequence records with high quality and analyzed their genomic compositional traits of dinucleotide (DNT) and DNT representation (DCR) to overview the distribution difference among various types of HPVs. Then, a deep learning model was built to predict the oncogenic potential of all HPVs based on E6 and E7 genes. Our results showed that the main three groups of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma HPVs were clearly separated between/among types in the DCR trait for either E6 or E7 coding sequence (CDS) and were clustered within the same group. Moreover, the DCR data of either E6 or E7 were learnable with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Either CNN classifier predicted accurately the oncogenicity label of high and low oncogenic HPVs. In summary, the compositional traits of HPV oncogenicity-related genes E6 and E7 were much different between the high and low oncogenic HPVs, and the compositional trait of the DCR-based deep learning classifier predicted the oncogenic phenotype accurately of HPVs. The trained predictor in this study will facilitate the identification of HPV oncogenicity, particularly for those HPVs without clear genotype or phenotype.
