## A combination of recombinase polymerase amplification with CRISPR technology rapidly detects goose parvovirus with high accuracy and sensitivity

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundGoose parvovirus (GPV) poses a significant threat to the waterfowl industry, necessitating reliable detection methods. However, conventional techniques are often time-consuming, equipment-dependent, or lack sufficient sensitivity for detecting early-stage infection. In contrast, emerging CRISPR/Cas12a-based systems offer a promising alternative for rapid, sensitive, and on-site diagnostics.MethodsWe developed and optimized a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a assay targeting the conserved VP3 gene of GPV. The analytical and diagnostic performance of this assay was rigorously validated using plasmid standards and clinical specimens from both experimentally infected and field-collected ducklings.ResultsOur developed assay combines RPA with CRISPR/Cas12a technology for rapid GPV nucleic acids detection. This method achieves a detection limit of 10 copies/μL of the VP3 gene within one hour, demonstrating high sensitivity and rapid turnaround. The assay exhibited exceptional specificity, with no cross-reactivity against other waterfowl viruses, and showed robust reproducibility, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation consistently below 5.0%. Clinical validation using 42 field samples confirmed a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and 95.5% specificity, showing superior performance to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in both metrics. Furthermore, the assay supports flexible visual readouts using portable blue light transilluminators, facilitating on-site interpretation.ConclusionsThis study established a highly field-deployable RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay for rapid, visual detection of GPV with outstanding sensitivity and specificity. Its capability for instrument-free on-site diagnosis via blue light transillumination makes this approach particularly promising for resource-limited settings.

## Overcoming dengue vaccine challenges through next-generation virus-like particle immunization strategies

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Dengue fever represents an escalating global health threat, as unprecedented outbreaks expose significant limitations of current vaccine strategies. Conventional live-attenuated dengue vaccines, while partially efficacious, face critical hurdles including serotype imbalances and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This review critically assesses virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines as a promising alternative, providing safer, non-replicating platforms that mimic viral structure without risks associated with live replication. Technological advancements in recombinant expression systems have improved VLP yield, stability, and scalability, addressing deployment obstacles. Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that tetravalent dengue VLP vaccines induce balanced neutralizing antibodies across all serotypes, effectively circumventing ADE in animal models. These findings suggest superior safety and robust immune responses, potentially surpassing live-attenuated and mRNA-based vaccines. We emphasize advancements in VLP vaccine technology, including novel tetravalent particle designs engineered to exclude ADE-related immunopathogenic components (prM protein), innovative stability-enhancing formulation techniques, and cost-effective recombinant production platforms (yeast and plant-based systems). Additionally, this review proposes novel deployment strategies, such as regional manufacturing hubs, standardized modular VLP platforms, adaptive clinical trial frameworks leveraging surrogate endpoints, and strengthened international coordination for equitable vaccine distribution. Integrating these scientific innovations and practical strategies positions dengue VLP vaccines as pivotal next-generation solutions for global dengue prevention.

## Exopolysaccharide production by seven basidiomycetous fungi and their antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities against Salmonella infection

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The discovering new fungal strains, optimal production, and understanding the fundamental aspects of exopolysaccharides (EPs) are important to utilize them in an industrial, medical, and biotechnological perspective. In this study, the optimal conditions for EP production from seven basidiomycetous fungal strains were investigated. The results indicated that six fungal species, Schizophyllum commune, Ganoderma fornicatum, G. williamsianum, Earliella scabrosa, Favolus tenuiculus, and Pycnoporus sanguineus, produced the highest EP yield in potato dextrose broth. The highest yield of EPs produced by Lentinus sajor-caju was obtained in mushroom complete medium broth. It was found that a pH value between 6 and 8 in the liquid culture media promoted EP production. The highest EP yield was obtained for 10 to 14 days which depends on fungal strain. Interestingly, this present study revealed the first report of EP production from G. fornicatum, G. williamsianum, E. scabrosa, F. tenuiculus, and P. sanguineus, including the genera Earliella and Favolus. The obtained crude EPs showed water solubilization ability. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra exhibited typical carbohydrate patterns in all crude EPs. Monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that the crude EPs were primarily composed of glucose, followed by fructose, allose, and allulose, with variations depending on the fungal strain. Additionally, crude EPs demonstrated positive antioxidant potential. Finally, we determined the anti-Salmonella and immunomodulatory effects of crude EPs from S. commune, G. fornicatum, and L. sajor-caju due to their high EP yield. Pretreatment of mouse macrophages with these fungal EPs enhanced the phagocytic killing activity of Salmonella-infected macrophages. Upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages were detected in the fungal EPs-treated groups. Our study reported the optimizing conditions for EP production from several strains of Basidiomycetous fungi and their potential as an alternative to antibiotics for multidrug-resistant Salmonella infection.

## The effects of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites in pregnant women

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cervical cerclage is widely used to reduce the risk of preterm birth in pregnant women. The effects of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites are not fully clear. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites. Our results showed that the clinical characteristics [white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocytes, platelet, NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, and C-reactive protein (CRP)] and α-diversity (Observed, Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson indexes) of the vaginal microbiota were not altered during pregnancy after cervical cerclage. 16S rRNA gene sequencing found that the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae and Blautia was significantly increased in the post-cerclage group compared with the pre-cerclage group, but the relative abundance of Sneathia was significantly reduced. In addition, the volcano plot revealed that a total of 19 metabolites [including alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, LPE (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PS(16:0/15:0), N-acetylhistamine, carnitine, pseudouridine, and allopregnanolone] were significantly changed during pregnancy after cervical cerclage. Pathway analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database showed that the changes in the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites mainly involved purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The alteration in the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites induced by cervical cerclage is associated with the therapeutic efficacy of cervical cerclage. Further studies are needed to explore how the vaginal microbiota affects the outcomes of pregnancy.

## Oral bacterial community dynamics during induction of gingival inflammation

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe human oral cavity is a complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem integral to oral and overall health. While the specific roles of microbial communities in health and disease are not fully understood, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota is, along with inadequate immune fitness, recognized as a key factor driving the onset of inflammatory conditions such as gingivitis. Gingivitis, an early and reversible stage of periodontal disease, involves shifts in microbial composition and diversity. This study aimed to investigate the compositional dynamics of the oral microbiota during the early stages of gingival inflammation, focusing on changes across multiple oral niches and their relationship to clinical outcomes.MethodsWe conducted an experimental gingivitis intervention study with 41 healthy volunteers. After a two-week baseline period, participants refrained from oral hygiene for two weeks to induce gingivitis, followed by a one-week resolution phase with resumed oral hygiene. Clinical parameters, including plaque and bleeding scores, were monitored at seven time points. Samples from saliva and five oral niches (tongue, keratinized gingiva, supragingival, subgingival, and interproximal dental plaque) were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to evaluate microbial dynamics and their associations with clinical outcomes.ResultsThe study revealed pronounced microbial changes, particularly in supragingival plaque, where Leptotrichia and Prevotella increased while Streptococcus decreased. Alpha diversity significantly increased in supragingival plaque, tongue, and saliva during gingivitis induction, highlighting shifts in microbial complexity. Clinical correlations indicated that plaque presence was primarily associated with bacterial load, while gingival bleeding was driven by compositional changes in supragingival plaque and tongue biofilms. These findings suggest that microbial density and composition independently contribute to gingivitis markers.ConclusionThis study concludes that occurrence of dental plaque and gingival bleeding are independent clinical parameters, linked to bacterial load and composition, respectively. Interactions between multiple niches, especially the tongue, influence clinical outcomes, highlighting a complex, nonlinear dynamic behavior in the oral microbiota. These findings suggest intricate ecological interactions that may approach tipping points, advancing understanding of microbial dynamics during gingival inflammation and informing future strategies for managing gingivitis.
