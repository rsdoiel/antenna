## Distinct gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles in HBV-related liver cirrhosis: insights into disease progression

date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) is a significant global health issue, affecting gut microbiota (GM) composition and metabolic processes. This study aimed to explore the associations between intestinal microbiota, metabolic profiles, and disease progression in patients with HBV-LC.MethodsFecal samples were collected prospectively from 40 healthy controls (HC) and 83 HBV-LC patients between December 2022 and August 2023. Gut microbiota alterations at various stages of liver function were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Untargeted metabolomics was employed to identify potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways associated with early cirrhosis. Additionally, correlations between bacterial genera, inflammatory markers, and metabolites were investigated.ResultsHBV-LC patients demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial diversity and relative abundance compared to the HC group. Genera such as Alistipes and Lachnospira were notably depleted, while Fusobacterium and Enterococcus were enriched in patients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores ≥ 21 or Child-Turcotte-Pugh C grade. Correlation analyses revealed strong associations between intestinal flora, clinical indicators of disease severity, and inflammatory factors. Metabolic analysis showed decreased levels of tocopherol and 21-hydroxypregnenolone, which were strongly linked to the reduced abundance of Alistipes and Lachnospira. Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and linoleic acid metabolism emerged as critical enrichment pathways.ConclusionsHBV-LC patients displayed significant alterations in gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, which correlated closely with disease severity and inflammatory status. These findings provide new insights into cirrhosis pathogenesis and suggest potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

## In situ identification of toxin-producing Clostridioides difficile in stool samples based on single-cell Raman spectroscopy

date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Clostridioides difficile (CD) has emerged as one of the most prevalent nosocomial infections in hospitals and is the primary causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. In recent years, C. difficile-induced infections have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a particularly rapid increase in incidence observed in China. C. difficile strains are categorized into toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing based on their ability to synthesize toxins, with the pathogenicity of C. difficile being strictly dependent on the protein toxins produced by the toxin-producing strains. Therefore, early and rapid identification of toxin-producing C. difficile is crucial for the diagnosis and prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Currently, the detection methods of C. difficile infection carried out by clinical laboratories in China mainly include C. difficile toxin-producing culture, cell culture toxin assay, toxin assay by immunological methods, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) assay and nucleic acid amplification assay.However, current detection methods for CDI in clinical laboratories in China exhibit significant limitations, such as being time-consuming, operationally complex, and lacking in specificity and sensitivity. Raman microspectroscopy has been shown to have the potential for rapid and reliable identification in microbial diagnostics, with the method reducing the time to results to less than 1 hour, including the processing of clinical samples, the measurement of single-cell Raman spectra, and the final diagnosis through the use of training models. In this study, we aimed to predict in situ strain identification and virulent strain identification of 24 raw clinical stool samples by constructing a reference single-cell Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) database of common intestinal flora and C. difficile, as well as a reference SCRS database of toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing C. difficile strains. The results showed that the accuracy of C. difficile strain identification in clinical stool samples was 83%, and the accuracy of virulent strain prediction was 80%. These findings suggest that Raman spectroscopy may be a viable method for the rapid in situ identification of virulent and non-virulent C. difficile strains and holds promise for clinical application in the rapid diagnosis of CDI.

## Clinical features and management of postoperative lumbar intervertebral space infections following spinal endoscopy: a retrospective analysis

date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPostoperative lumbar intervertebral space infections following spinal endoscopy are infrequent but severe complications that can markedly affect patient recovery and treatment outcomes. Early diagnosis remains challenging due to the nonspecific nature of clinical symptoms. This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for postoperative intervertebral space infections.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 14 cases of postoperative intervertebral space infections following spinal endoscopy. The data set included patient demographics, clinical symptoms, imaging findings, blood culture results, and treatment approaches. The analysis assessed early diagnosis and treatment outcomes concerning the infection’s progression and the use of MRI, inflammatory markers, and empirical antibiotics.ResultsThe most common clinical symptoms included localized back pain, neurological deficits, and fever, though these lacked specificity. MRI proved valuable in diagnosing early infections. The majority of cases exhibited elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ESR. The treatment plan included early surgical intervention with debridement and internal fixation, along with extended antibiotic therapy.ConclusionThe early identification and intervention of postoperative intervertebral space infections following spinal endoscopy are of critical importance. The implementation of a strict aseptic technique, the execution of careful preoperative planning, and the timely use of MRI for diagnosis are essential to the prevention and effective treatment of these infections. This study underscores the necessity of a comprehensive approach to minimize the risk of postoperative intervertebral space infections and to enhance patient outcomes.

## Polymicrobial urine cultures: reconciling contamination with the urobiome while recognizing the pathogens

date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Polymicrobial or mixed urine cultures of more than one predominant microbe confound clinical urinary tract infection diagnosis. The current College of American Pathologists clinical laboratory standard states that a urine sample cultured with more than two isolates with >10,000 colony forming units/ml is to be considered contaminated. However, the presence of urinary sample bacteria in individuals without urinary symptoms (referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria) is common especially in older people and in pregnant individuals. Furthermore, the discovery of an indigenous urinary microbiome (urobiome) in healthy humans throughout life from shortly after birth to death conflicts with the long-standing notion that urine derived from sterile filtered blood should be sterile above the urethral sphincter. Polymicrobial infections are not consistent with Koch’s postulates that a single pathogen is causal for disease. In this review, we will discuss current standards of contamination, how to reconcile the sterility of urine with the existence of the urobiome, a history of polymicrobial infections, and why re-examining current practices is essential for the practice of medicine, improving quality of life, and potentially saving lives.

## A 3-year retrospective analysis of microbial species and key biomarkers associated with wound infections in Shantou Hospital, China

date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

A biomarker is an important indicator of a normal physiological or pathological process, or a pharmacological response to a therapeutic intervention. This retrospective study aimed to measure blood biomarkers in wound patients, identify the microorganisms responsible for wound infections and determine their drug susceptibility patterns at a tertiary care hospital in China. The study was conducted between 2022 and 2024, including 279 patients. A total of 33 microbial species were isolated using culture techniques, identified, and analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility. The organisms were predominantly gram-positive (50.8%), with Staphylococcus aureus (80.2%) being the most prevalent species. Among the gram-negative bacteria (41.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.6%) was the most predominant species. Biomarkers such as white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values were higher than normal in most of microbial species associated with wound infections. The WBC value in gram-positive infections and the neutrophil and ESR values in fungal infections were statistically significantly higher than the normal range (p = 0.0002, p = 0.002, and p = 0.003, respectively). Albumin levels were high value in P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae (0.48 and 0.56 respectively), while lymphocytes levels were the lowest value (-0.62) in S. aureus. Resistance to at least one antibiotic was identified in 82.4% of the isolates. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant microbes in different wound infections is a significant concern in China. A health awareness campaign, coupled with improved hygiene measures, should be implemented to prevent the spread of microorganisms responsible for wound infections within the community.
