## Mapping the global research landscape on psoriasis and the gut microbiota: visualization and bibliometric analysis

date: 2025-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPsoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease with a complex pathogenesis. Recently, the role of gut microbiota in psoriasis has attracted increasing attention. A systematic bibliometric analysis of relevant literature is necessary to understand better the current state and development trends in this field.Materials and methodsThe Web of Science Core Collection database was searched for literature indexed from 2004 to October 15, 2024. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using Bibliometrix, CiteSpace (version 6.3.R1), R 4.2.2 with the Bibliometrix package, Scimago Graphica 1.0.45, and VOSviewer (version 1.6.20.0) to visualize publication types, years, authors, countries, institutions, journal sources, references, and keywords.ResultsThe development of psoriasis and gut microbiota research can be divided into two phases: slow growth (2004–2014) and rapid development (2014–2024). Lidia Rudnicka is the most active and influential author. China produced the highest number of publications, followed by the United States, which had the highest number of citations per article. The International Journal of Molecular Sciences published the most articles. In contrast, articles in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, British Journal of Dermatology, and Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology were cited over 1,000 times. Keyword and co-citation analyses identified evolving research hotspots. Early studies focused on the association between gut microbiota and comorbid inflammatory diseases. Recent research has delved into specific mechanisms, such as disruption of gut barrier function, short-chain fatty acid metabolism alterations, impaired regulatory T-cell function, and excessive activation of Th17 cells. These mechanisms highlight how gut dysbiosis exacerbates psoriasis patients’ systemic inflammation and skin lesions.ConclusionThe field of psoriasis and gut microbiota research is developing rapidly despite uneven research distribution. This bibliometric evaluation assesses the current state of research and provides new perspectives for understanding the complex interactions between microbes and the host. Future efforts should strengthen international collaboration to deeply explore the mechanisms of gut microbiota’s role in psoriasis, especially its potential applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

## Revolutionizing Lyme disease vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis of promising candidates

date: 2025-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The most prevalent vector-borne diseases in North America and Europe is still Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. As incidence rates rise, this poses a serious threat to public health. Since there is presently no vaccine for Lyme disease that is suitable for human use after the LYMErix vaccine was withdrawn in 2002 due to safety issues and insufficient adoption, there is an urgent need for an effective vaccination to protect at-risk populations. Numerous intriguing vaccine candidates have been developed as a result of advances in molecular biology and immunology; nevertheless, it is still unclear which candidate provides the best balance of durability, safety, and efficacy. The purpose of this meta-analysis and systematic review is to assess the safety and effectiveness of many Lyme disease vaccine candidates that are presently undergoing clinical trials. According to PRISMA guideline, the systematic review was performed, and the meta-analysis was performed using random-effect model. This study evaluates the efficacy of multiple Lyme disease vaccine candidates and identifies recombinant OspA-based formulations as the most promising by combining data from observational studies and randomized controlled trials. With an emphasis on OspA-based and multivalent vaccinations, we present comparative evaluations of immune responses, side effects, and long-term protection across vaccine platforms. This research is to help steer public health policy and vaccine development activities in the direction of a successful Lyme disease vaccine and emphasizes how certain vaccine candidates may lessen the impact of Lyme disease.

## Roles played by IL-8 in altering dynamics of trabecular meshwork cells after human cytomegalovirus infection

date: 2025-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is known to infect the trabecular meshwork cells (HTMCs) and corneal endothelial cells leading to chronic and recurrent elevations of the intraocular pressure (IOP) as secondary glaucoma. To investigate how HCMV affects the function of HTMCs, we analyzed the effects of HCMV infection on cultured HTMCs infected with the endothelial-adapted strain, TB40/E, of HCMV. We studied the induced molecular mechanisms focusing on the OAG-associated chemokines, IL-8 and CCL2. The HTMCs were analyzed for transcriptome changes using RNAseq analysis. Our results showed that HCMV infection activated interferon signaling and significantly increased the expression of IL-8 and CCL2. The IL-8-responsive transcriptional pathway was analyzed by using a CXCR2 antagonist which is associated with cellular movement and development of the hematological system. In contrast, the CCL2-sensitive pathway, assessed using a CCR2 antagonist, was linked to olfactory receptor signaling and keratinization. HCMV infection activated cell motility with the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. The infection-induced activation of cell motility was dependent on both CXCR2 and CCR2, and IL-8 stimulated filopodia-mediated cell motility. HCMV infection also induced cell contraction that was dependent on CXCR2, but not on CCR2, and it involved the activation of Rac1/Cdc42. These results suggest that HCMV infection altered the cytoskeletal dynamics and contraction of the HTMCs in a CCR2- and CXCR2-dependent manner. These changes have the potential of causing an increase in the resistance to aqueous humor outflow in HCMV-associated anterior uveitis and corneal endotheliitis.

## The role of virulence genes in Campylobacter pathogenicity: a perspective from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries

date: 2025-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Campylobacter spp., primarily C. jejuni and C. coli, are leading causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. This review provides an overview of literature on the prevalence and distribution of virulence genes in C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from both food samples and humans across GCC countries. The reviewed evidence highlights a gap in our understanding of how differences in the virulence profile affect the pathogenicity of Campylobacter. Research has shown that C. coli is the predominant species found in retail chicken carcasses in the UAE, while C. jejuni is more common in chicken carcasses across other GCC countries. Studies also reveal distinct genotypes of C. jejuni and C. coli, each with varying pathogenicity. These findings underscore the need for further research on the role of virulence genes in shaping the pathogenicity of Campylobacter, which is essential for developing effective intervention and control strategies in the GCC region.

## Combinations of posaconazole and tacrolimus are effective against infections with azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus

date: 2025-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSolid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus are at increased risk of developing pulmonary aspergillosis, a severe to deadly complication with limited treatment options, especially against azole-resistant strains. This study investigates the antifungal interaction between posaconazole and tacrolimus, prompted by a case where a liver transplant recipient on tacrolimus experienced unexpected eradication of chronic Aspergillus fumigatus colonization following posaconazole prophylaxis.MethodsWe compared the combined antifungal activity of posaconazole and tacrolimus against azole-sensitive and resistant A. fumigatus in vitro against planktonic isolates and biofilm formation and in vivo in Galleria mellonella larvae, to evaluate the potential benefit over posaconazole monotherapy.ResultsThe posaconazole-tacrolimus combination demonstrated a 4-fold increase in efficacy against azole-resistant isolates and a 30-fold increase against an azole-sensitive strain, in contrast to voriconazole. Moreover, this combination enhanced antifungal activity by 4- to 15-fold against biofilm formation of azole-sensitive strains, though no synergy was observed against azole-resistant biofilms. In vivo studies in Galleria mellonella confirmed a 2- to 7-fold decrease in fungal burden of both azole-sensitive and azole-resistant strains when combining posaconazole with tacrolimus, relative to posaconazole alone.ConclusionIn vitro and in vivo findings confirm that posaconazole may offer therapeutic benefits for treating A. fumigatus infections in patients receiving tacrolimus. These results warrant further confirmation in mice and exploration of their clinical implications.

## Microphysiological gut-on-chip enables extended in vitro development of Cryptosporidium hominis

date: 2025-04-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCryptosporidium hominis is the dominant Cryptosporidium species infecting humans, but most advances in developing robust in vitro culturing platforms for Cryptosporidium have utilised C. parvum. Consequently, there is relatively little available information specific to the biology and life cycle of C. hominis. The present study utilised a pumpless and tubeless gut-on-chip to generate a physiologically relevant in vitro environment by applying a constant fluid shear stress of 0.02 dyn cm-2 to HCT-8 cells. MethodsGut-on-chips were fabricated using standard soft lithography. C. hominis oocysts isolated from human pathology samples were used to infect the human ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma (HCT-8) cell line under a constant fluid shear stress of 0.02 dyn cm-2. Parasite growth was assessed using a C. hominis-specific quantitative PCR, a Cryptosporidium genus-specific immunofluorescence assay, and scanning electron microscopy. Differences in the HCT-8 transcriptome with and without fluid shear stress, and the host-parasite interaction, were both assessed using bulk transcriptomics.ResultsTranscriptomic analysis of the HCT-8 cell line cultured within the gut-on-chip demonstrated a metabolic shift towards oxidative phosphorylation when compared to the same cell line cultured under static conditions. Extended C. hominis (subtype IdA15G1) cultures were sustained for up to 10 days within the gut-on-chip as shown by a C. hominis-specific qPCR and a Cryptosporidium genus-specific immunofluorescence assay, which demonstrated ~30-fold amplification in the gut-on-chip over the duration of the experiment. Scanning electron microscopy of infected monolayers identified trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogamonts, microgamonts, and possible gamont-like stages at 48 h post-infection. The potential role of gamonts in the Cryptosporidium life cycle remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Transcriptomes of HCT-8 cells infected with C hominis revealed upregulation of biological processes associated with cell cycle regulation and cell signalling in C. hominis-infected cells under fluid shear stress compared to static culture. ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that bioengineered gut-on-chip models support extended C. hominis growth and can be used to interrogate responses of host cells to infection. Owing to its relative simplicity, the pumpless and tubeless gut-on-chip can be accessible to most laboratories with established HCT-8 infection models for Cryptosporidium culture.

## FAS mediates apoptosis, inflammation, and treatment of pathogen infection

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The FAS cell surface death receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, activates both apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling upon interaction with its ligand FASL. It is critical in cell migration, invasion, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. Pathogen infection can influence host cells’ behavior by modulating the FAS/FASL pathway, thereby influencing disease progression. Understanding the role of FAS signaling in the context of pathogen interactions is therefore crucial. This review examines FAS-mediated apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms of apoptosis and inflammation induced by bacterial and viral infections. Additionally, it highlights therapeutic strategies, including drug, cytokine, antibody, and FASL recombinant protein therapies, providing new directions for treating pathogenic infections and cancers, as well as insights into developing novel therapeutic approaches.

## The heart of the matter: modeling HIV-associated cardiovascular comorbidities in nonhuman primate models

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) that effectively suppresses HIV replication, and reduced AIDS progression, the clinical spectrum of HIV infection has dramatically changed. Currently, the people living with HIV (PLWH) who receive ART have a nearly normal prognostic of survival, yet they still experience higher morbidity and mortality than age-matched uninfected subjects. The higher risk of death in PLWH is linked to persistence of residual systemic inflammation and T-cell activation. These factors contribute to accelerated aging and higher incidence of HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions, thereby presenting new diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This new shifting paradigm of HIV infection associates a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, in stark contrast to the reduced incidence of opportunistic infections. The incidence of acute myocardial infarction and coronary disease is several folds higher in PLWH than in the general population. Study of United States (US) death certificates listing HIV infection shows that the deaths from CVD doubled between 1996 and 2006. CVD will become an even more prominent comorbidity considering that more than 50% of PLWH in the US are over 50 years old, an age that more frequently associates CVD, and cardiovascular complications are more frequent in urban African-Americans and Hispanics, which are disproportionately affected by HIV. Therefore, reducing the overall risk of these complications will become the primary challenge in the management of chronic HIV infection. Not surprisingly, the REPRIEVE trial showed a substantial benefit of statins to PLWH, and the current guidelines include statin administration to PLWH. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models for the cardiovascular comorbidities associated with HIV are currently available and their use for testing new therapeutic approaches aimed at countering the effects of hypercoagulability and CVD is discussed. Their use can be of tremendous help to understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and the determinants of CVD in PLWH, which are currently poorly understood. Use of the NHP models could help in dissecting the relative contribution of the virus, behavioral factors, and ART to cardiovascular risk, having the potential to help us establish new strategic approaches aimed at controlling HIV-related CVD.

## Repeated-dose toxicity and immunogenicity evaluation of a recombinant subunit COVID-19 vaccine (ZF2001) in rats

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had given rise to a massive epidemic. Owing to the high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 and the lack of effective therapies, safe and effective vaccination is the optimum choice for controlling this epidemic and preventing infection. The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001, which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS-CoV-2, has a significant protective effect against COVID-19. At the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, to promote the early approval of ZF2001 for clinical trials by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA), a comprehensive evaluation of its toxicity in vivo was warranted. In the present study, a major part of the above series of studies, we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the ZF2001 vaccine for the first time in adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The male and female rats were administered three doses of the ZF2001 vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg NCP-RBD protein/dose, containing the aluminum-based adjuvant). The safety profile of ZF2001 was assessed by observing the general health status, local toxicity at the site of administration, immunotoxicity, immunogenicity, blood chemistry and hematology parameters in SD rats. In general, our results indicated that the ZF2001 vaccine did not induce significant systemic toxicity in rats, with a no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 50 μg NCP-RBD protein/rat. Moreover, the ZF2001 vaccine showed good immunogenicity by inducing the production of specific IgG antibodies in rats after three consecutive immunizations. In addition, histological examination revealed recoverable inflammatory changes in quadricep muscles and adjacent lymph nodes at the vaccine injection site. In summary, our systematic toxicology study proves the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the ZF2001 vaccine, which further supports the results of clinical trials of ZF2001.

## Microbiome dysbiosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection: implication for pathophysiology and management strategies of COVID-19

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in late 2019 initiated a global health crisis marked by widespread infection, significant mortality, and long-term health implications. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200 symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its implications in disease severity and for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Furthermore, it highlights the dual role of the microbiome in modulating disease progression, and as a promising target for advancing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches in managing COVID-19.

## Reference range of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in healthy individuals and its predictive value for post-trauma nosocomial infections

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aimed to establish the reference range of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte absolute ratio (NLR) in healthy individuals, explore the association between NLR and post-trauma nosocomial infections, and evaluate the effectiveness of NLR in predicting clinical outcomes of post-trauma infections.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted based on medical records of acute trauma patients from the China National Center for Trauma Medical and health examination data from Chengdu First People’s Hospital, Sichuan Province. The reference range of NLR was established, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for infection, with subgroup analysis conducted by age. The predictive value of NLR for post-trauma infections was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).ResultsA total of 175,019 individuals were included, comprising 165,504 healthy individuals (753 minors [0.45%, <18 years] and 164,751 adults [99.55%]) and 9,515 acute trauma patients (8,602 in the control group [90.40%] and 913 with post-trauma infections [9.60%]). The 2.5th-97.5th percentile range for NLR was 0.69-3.48 in minors and 0.86-3.83 in adults. NLR was identified as an independent risk factor for post-trauma infections, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.18-1.73). Additionally, NLR showed a positive correlation with common inflammatory markers, CRP (r = 0.37 [0.32-0.42], weak correlation) and PCT (r = 0.52 [0.45-0.58], moderate correlation). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that NLR had an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69-0.73, P < 0.0001) for predicting infections, with a diagnostic cutoff value of 4, sensitivity of 60.28% (95% CI: 59.24-61.31), and specificity of 72.85% (95% CI: 69.71-75.77). No significant differences in NLR values were observed between groups with pulmonary infections, urinary tract infections, combined pulmonary and urinary infections, and soft tissue infections (P > 0.05). However, NLR values were significantly higher in patients with fungal infections compared to those without (P = 0.03).ConclusionThe current 2.5th-97.5th percentile range of NLR is 0.69-3.48 in minors and 0.86-3.83 in adults. With increasing age, the reference range widens, and females tend to have a slightly broader range than males. NLR is an independent risk factor for post-trauma infections, showing higher predictive value in patients over 60 years of age. Although NLR cannot differentiate infection sites or pathogen types, elevated NLR values may provide a reference for identifying fungal infections.

## Investigation of dynamic microbial migration patterns in the respiratory tract

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe role of the respiratory microbiome in lung diseases is increasingly recognized, with the potential migration of respiratory pathogens being a significant clinical consideration. Despite its importance, evidence elucidating this phenomenon remains scarce.MethodsThis prospective study collected clinical samples from patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), including oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was employed to analyze respiratory microbial diversity, complemented by Bayesian source tracking and sequence alignment analyses to explore pathogen migration patterns.ResultsA cohort of 68 patients was enrolled, with 56 diagnosed with LRTI and 12 with non-infectious respiratory conditions. A statistically significant disparity in respiratory microbiome diversity was observed between infected and non-infected groups (p < 0.05). Intriguingly, no significant variations in microbial community structure, including alpha and beta diversity, were detected across different respiratory tract sites within individuals. The Bayesian source tracking analysis revealed a pronounced migration pattern among pathogens compared to the overall microbial community, with migration ratios of 51.54% and 1.92%, respectively (p < 0.05). Sequence similarity analysis further corroborated these findings, highlighting a notable homology among specific migrating pathogens.ConclusionThis study represents a pioneering effort in deducing pathogen migration patterns through microbial source tracking analysis. The findings provide novel insights that could significantly advance clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for respiratory infections.

## Therapeutic approaches for septicemia induced by multidrug-resistant bacteria using desert-adapted plants

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

AimSepticemia, a life-threatening condition, can arise when bacterial infections are left untreated, allowing the pathogens to spread into the bloodstream. Moreover, infections caused by MDR bacteria are particularly challenging, as they can persist and lead to septicemia even when treated with conventional antibiotics. This study aimed to address this crisis by investigating combination therapies using desert-adapted medicinal plant extracts, including Jasonia candicans (J. candicans), Cistanche tubulosa, Moltkiopsis ciliata, and Thymelea hirsuta, as alternative treatments. The goal was to develop new strategies to combat resistance and improve the management of septic patients.MethodologyIn this study, 400 blood samples from septic patients were analyzed to identify Gram-negative bacterial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance patterns were assessed using standard susceptibility tests. Medicinal plant extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays, while COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition and antioxidant activity were measured using in vitro assays. Histopathological examinations were conducted on treated mice to assess tissue damage and response.ResultsWe observed a high prevalence of E. coli and K. pneumoniae among septic patients. Multidrug resistance was widespread, with many isolates showing high resistance to various antibiotics, although all were susceptible to colistin. Evaluation of desert-adapted plant extracts revealed that J. candicans exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity and the strongest COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities, as well as antioxidant effects, compared to other extracts and Celecoxib, with a concentration required to achieve 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50) value of 71.97 μg/mL for antioxidant activity. Moreover, the combination of this extract with amikacin showed a synergistic effect, significantly enhancing antimicrobial efficacy and converting over 50% of amikacin-resistant strains to sensitive phenotypes. Histopathological analysis of mice showed that the combination of J. candicans extract and amikacin resulted in reduced severity of pulmonary lesions and splenic damage compared to amikacin alone.ConclusionWe highlighted the potential of J. candicans extracts as combination therapies alongside traditional antibiotics for combating MDR Gram-negative infections, due to their superior antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.

## Analysis of the diagnostic and prognostic value of Peripheral blood mononuclear cell microRNA-9-5p in patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-9-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in sepsis patients.MethodsDifferentially expressed miR-9-5p in sepsis were screened from a database and available literature. Subsequently, iBMDM cell validation was conducted and the expression level of miR-9-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined using RT-qPCR in 69 sepsis patients and 30 non-sepsis patients with infections, 24 hours after ICU admission. A control group that comprised 35 healthy individuals, matched for age and sex, was set up from those who agreed to provide blood samples laboratory analysis.ResultsOn admission to the ICU, the levels of miR-9-5p were significantly higher in sepsis patients (10.13 [3.21, 24.94]) than in non-sepsis patients with infections (2.08 [1.68, 3.18]) and healthy controls (0.86 [0.36, 1.88]) (p < 0.001). The miR-9-5p levels were positively correlated with the severity of the disease as indicated by the SOFA score (r=0.656, P<0.001). The AUC of miR-9-5p in predicting sepsis, septic shock, and in-hospital death was 0.825, 0.821, and 0.845, respectively.ConclusionElevated expression levels of miR-9-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are significantly associated with an increased risk of sepsis and septic shock, and also indicate a higher risk of organ dysfunction.

## The metagenomic and whole-genome metagenomic detection of multidrug-resistant bacteria from subclinical mastitis-affected cow’s milk in India

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in farm animal products threaten human health by causing zoonotic infections. The complete genome sequences of MDR bacteria from subclinical mastitis-affected cow’s milk have not yet been comprehensively documented in India. In this study, using a bacterial metagenomic sequencing approach, we detected the nearly complete genome sequences of Pseudomonas veronii and Staphylococcus xylosus from subclinical mastitis-affected cow’s milk. Furthermore, we sequenced the nearly complete genome sequences of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus hominis, and S. xylosus from subclinical mastitis-affected cow’s milk using a whole-genome metagenomic sequencing method. Our analysis subsequently revealed that the complete genome sequences of the identified bacteria contained MDR genes and genes for multiple virulence factors. These MDR bacteria may pose a public health risk through exposure to milkers, milk handlers, and farm workers or through the handling and consumption of unpasteurized milk.

ObjectiveA single-center retrospective study was conducted according to the latest diagnostic criteria of the European Consortium for Mycology in Medicine/International Society for Human and Animal Mycoses (ECMM/ISHAM) Consensus, which describes the clinical characteristics, factors influencing and prognosis of a group of patients with COVID-19 (Omicron variant) combined with invasive pulmonary mycoses with onset of disease at the end of 2022.MethodsThis study retrospectively analyzed data related to 58 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia due to COVID-19 infection admitted to the ICU of critical care medicine, respiratory ICU, and ICU of the Department of Infections at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from December 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. CAPA was defined according to the ECMM/ISHAM consensus criteria. Our study compared the clinical and microbiological characteristics and associated risk factors of fungal infections and pulmonary fungal infections and performed univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA).Results17 (29.3%) of the 58 critically ill patients were diagnosed with CAPA, of which 10 (58.82%) patients were Probable CAPA and 7 (41.18%) patients were Possible CAPA. Among this Aspergillus strains, Aspergillus fumigatus strains were found in 13 cases (76.47%) and Aspergillus niger strains in 4 cases (23.53%). 7 (41.18%) patients had concomitant bacterial fungal infections with a mortality rate of 57.14% (4/7), of which Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common pathogen. Among the patients with CAPA, galactomannan assay of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed in 5 patients with a 100% (5/5) positivity rate, and two or more serum galactomannan (GM) assays were performed in 17 patients, with a probability of favorable results in both cases of 41.2% (7/17). The 60-day mortality rate in patients with CAPA was 52.9% (9/17), whereas the non-CAPA patients had a 60-day mortality rate of 24.4% (10/41), which was statistically different (P = 0.035). Diabetes mellitus (P = 0.018, OR: 5.040 (95% CI: 1.314-19.337)), renal insufficiency (P=0.002, OR: 11.259 (95% CI: 2.480-51.111)), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P = 0.003, OR: 6.939 (95% CI: 1.963-24.531)), elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P = 0.022, OR: 4.160 (95% CI: 1.226~14.113)), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.002, OR: 8.100 (95%CI: 2.132~30.777)), increased duration of steroids use (P = 0.022, OR: 1.071 (95%CI: 1.010~1.135)), increased cumulative dose of steroids use ((P < 0.001, OR: 1.012 (95%CI: 1.009~1.015)), use of tocilizumab (P = 0.020, OR: 11.480 (95%CI: 2.480~51.111)), and increased length of hospitalization in ICU (P = 0.021, OR: 1.038 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.071)), and increase in the type of antibiotics used (P = 0.002, OR: 1.603 (95% CI: 1.181 to 2.176)) were the risk factors for the occurrence of fungal infections, whereas the use of steroids or not, the use of baricitinib or not, and hypertension did not have a significant effect on the occurrence of fungal infections (P > 0.05). Patients with CAPA had a higher mortality rate, and their hospitalization was prolonged compared to non-CAPA patients. The all-cause mortality rate for patients with CAPA was 52.9%. We also performed univariate and multivariate analyses of potential factors associated with mortality, including the use of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.040 OR: 10.500, (95% CI: 1.115 to 98.914)), advanced age (P = 0.043 OR: 1.212, (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.460)), and a significantly higher CRP level (P = 0.042 OR: 1.043, (95% CI: 1.002~1.078)) had a worse prognosis. Steroids use, gender, and diabetes mellitus were not associated with patient death (P > 0.05).

## Yeast protein as a fishmeal substitute: impacts on reproductive performance, immune responses, and gut microbiota in two sow hybrids

date: 2025-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe persistent African swine fever epidemic has significantly compromised China’s swine production. To accelerate production recovery, commercial farms are increasingly adopting retention of two-way backcross sows (Landrace × Yorkshire × Landrace, LLY) for breeding. This study aimed to investigate the effects of yeast protein, an emerging sustainable protein source, on reproductive performance, immune responses, and gut microbiota in two-way crossbred sows (Landrace × Yorkshire, LY) and LLY sows.MethodsThe experiment employed a 2×2 factorial design evaluating two fixed factors: sow hybrid (LY vs LLY) and yeast protein supplementation (0% vs 2.6%). The four treatment groups were: LY sows without yeast protein supplementation (LY-C), LLY sows without yeast protein supplementation (LLY-C), LY sows with yeast protein supplementation (LY-YP), and LLY sows with yeast protein supplementation (LLY-YP). A total of one hundred healthy sows of 2-6 parities (50 LY sows and 50 LLY sows), were stratified by backfat thickness, body weight, and parity, then randomly allocated to the four treatment groups on day 105 of gestation, with 25 sows in each group. The experimental period lasted from day 106 of gestation to day 18 of lactation.Results and conclusionYeast protein supplementation showed no significant effects on most reproductive parameters of different sow hybrids, but reduced backfat loss by 30.5% during lactation (P < 0.05) and demonstrated a numerical reduction in mummification rate of fetuses (P = 0.06). Immunological assessments revealed that LLY sows exhibited 26.8% lower serum IgM concentration than LY sows (P < 0.05), while yeast protein supplementation significantly reduced serum IL-1β levels by 45.6% (P < 0.05) on day 18 of lactation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed comparable fecal microbial diversity across treatments (P > 0.05), though differences were observed in certain bacterial genera between LY and LLY sows during late gestation and lactation. Yeast protein supplementation enriched beneficial bacteria including Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and Christensenellaceae_R_7_group, while suppressing potentially detrimental bacteria such as Family_XIII_AD3011_group (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the practical feasibility of retaining LLY sows for commercial breeding. Yeast protein supplementation, as a substitute for fishmeal during late gestation and lactation, significantly reduced lactational backfat loss, moderately attenuated inflammatory response, and enhanced gut microbiome homeostasis through selective microbial enrichment in sows.
