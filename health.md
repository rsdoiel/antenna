## Whole-genome sequencing and machine learning reveal key drivers of delayed sputum conversion in rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis

date: 2025-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) remains a major global health challenge, with delayed sputum culture conversion (SCC) predicting poor treatment outcomes. This study integrated whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and machine learning to identify clinical and genomic determinants of SCC failure in 150 RR-TB patients (2019–2023). Phenotypic and genotypic analysis revealed high rates of isoniazid resistance (74.0%) and rpoB mutations (97.3%, predominantly Ser450Leu), with 90% of strains belonging to Lineage 2 (Beijing family). While 64.7% achieved 2-month SCC, 18.0% remained culture-positive at 6 months. Univariate analysis linked 2-month SCC failure to smear positivity, resistance to isoniazid, amikacin, capreomycin, and levofloxacin, and pre-XDR-TB status, though only smear positivity (aOR=2.41, P=0.008) and levofloxacin resistance (aOR=2.83, P=0.003) persisted as independent predictors in multivariable analysis. A Random Forest model achieved robust prediction of SCC failure (AUC: 0.86 ± 0.06 at 2 months; 0.76 ± 0.10 at 6 months), identifying levofloxacin resistance (feature importance: 6.37), embB_p.Met306Ile (5.94), and smear positivity (5.12) as top 2-month predictors, while katG_p.Ser315Thr (4.85) and gyrA_p.Asp94Gly (3.43) dominated 6-month predictions. These findings underscore smear positivity, levofloxacin resistance, and specific resistance mutations as critical drivers of SCC failure, guiding targeted RR-TB treatment strategies.

## The AcrAB efflux pump contributes to the virulence of Enteroaggregative E. coli by influencing the aggregative behavior

date: 2025-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Multidrug efflux pumps play a major role in the emergence of antibiotic resistance. AcrAB is particularly important among them, as it is the main RND pump in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. In addition to contributing to multidrug resistance, AcrAB also plays a significant role in the virulence of several pathogens. Here, we report that AcrAB contributes to both adhesion to host cells and biofilm formation in EAEC, an enteropathogenic group of E. coli known to cause both acute and persistent diarrhea. EAEC is an emerging pathotype of E. coli characterized by its ability to adhere extensively to epithelial cells in an aggregative manner and to form voluminous biofilms, which favor infection persistence. We found that the deletion of acrB prevents biofilm formation and reduces the export of extracellular DNA (eDNA). By using a specific inhibitor of AcrB, we confirmed the requirement of AcrB transporter activity for biofilm biogenesis. The characteristic aggregative pattern of EAEC is also strongly impaired in the absence of AcrB or in the presence of an efflux-defective AcrB D408A transporter, while it is restored in the ΔacrB strain complemented with acrB. Finally, we show that the EAEC 17-2 ΔacrB derivative is significantly less lethal than the wild type in Caenorhabditis elegans. Complementation with the acrB gene, but not with the acrBD408A allele, fully restores the virulence phenotype after infection. Overall, our results confirm the relevance of the AcrAB efflux pump as a virulence determinant and contribute to understanding the mechanisms adopted by EAEC to form thick biofilms and copious adherence to the epithelial cells, both features enhancing persistence during infections.

## Autophagy in mycobacterial infections: molecular mechanisms, host-pathogen interactions, and therapeutic opportunities

date: 2025-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycobacteria pose significant global health burdens, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex causing tuberculosis-a leading infectious killer claiming over 1.25 million lives annually-and NTM driving pulmonary and ulcerative infections, particularly in immunocompromised populations. Autophagy, a conserved cellular degradation pathway, serves as a critical mechanism of host defense against mycobacteria by delivering bacteria to the lysosome. As a response, mycobacteria have evolved intricate strategies to subvert or exploit autophagy for survival. Consequently, autophagy exhibits a dichotomous role in mycobacterial infection: functioning as a protective mechanism of host while simultaneously serving as a virulence determinant hijacked by bacteria for their survival. This review synthesizes current insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating host-initiated autophagy during mycobacterial infection, as well as the bacterial strategies for subverting or hijacking autophagic pathways. While autophagy may be hijacked by mycobacteria, substantial evidence from numerous studies demonstrates that autophagy-activating agents may be beneficial in restricting mycobacteria infection, even with multidrug-resistant strains. This review also systematizes promising agents that enhance autophagy to improve bacterial clearance. By synthesizing the latest research findings, this article aims to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between autophagy and mycobacteria, paving the way for efficient host-directed therapies (HDTs) against this severely harmful pathogen.

## The clinical impact of 16S ribosomal RNA PCR and sequencing in the identification of bacterial infections: a 7-year report from a Lebanese tertiary care center

date: 2025-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe identification of bacterial pathogens in the clinical setting is essential for providing optimal care and improving outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to assess the performance of the 16S test in bacterial identification from different samples and determine its impact on clinical outcomes.MethodsThis was a retrospective study of patient samples collected from all age-groups at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), from May 2016 to December 2022. Descriptive statistics were conducted to calculate the 16S test positivity rate and to describe the different types of organisms. Univariate analyses were performed to study the clinical impact of the 16S test and its comparison to the conventional bacterial culture among different characteristics. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsA total of 1489 specimens were submitted for the 16S test during the study period. Of the submitted tests, 395 (26%) had bacteria identified by the 16S test and/or culture. Out of the culture negative/16S positive group, the majority were from specimens collected from the skin and soft tissue system (24 out of 92, 26.1%). This was followed by musculoskeletal specimens (15 out of 92, 16.3%), and central nervous system specimens (14 out of 92, 15.2%). Pus samples had a positivity rate of 66.3% with 5 times higher odds of being positive compared to non-pus samples (25%). Overall, there were 260 identified organisms by 16S test of which the most detected organisms were Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp. and Enterobacterales. The results revealed that 16S testing impacted management in 45.9% of the cases (83/181) showing a change in management. Antibiotic escalation was applied in 31.3% of cases (26/83). Antibiotic de-escalation occurred in 41% of cases (34/83). A change in the treating diagnosis was noted in 26.5% of cases (22/83).ConclusionIdentification of pathogens using the 16S test in combination with conventional cultures is essential in clinical diagnostics and management of infectious diseases to provide targeted therapy and improve antimicrobial stewardship. Shorter turnaround time, improved patient management, and cost-effectiveness are key factors to consider when advocating for the broader adoption of 16S testing.

## Stenotrophomonas tuberculopleuritidis sp. nov., a novel pathogenic Stenotrophomonas species isolated from tuberculous pleurisy patient

date: 2025-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionStenotrophomonas represents a group of bacteria that exhibit significant value in industrial and agricultural applications, while also posing pathogenic risks to humans. 704A1T was isolated from a patient with tuberculous pleurisy. Its 16S rRNA sequence showed the highest homology (99.72%) with a Stenotrophomonas strain without defined species classification. It is necessary to clarify the species 704A1T belonging to and its potential pathogenicity to humans.MethodsSystematical evaluations including phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, antibiotic susceptibility, genomic sequencing were conducted. The pathogenicity and immunological characteristics were tested by intranasally inoculated C57BL/6J mice.Results704A1T is Gram negative rod-shaped bacterium with flagella at single extreme. Showing highly similar with S. maltophilia, 704A1T also displayed distinct characteristic peaks in fatty acid profiling and MALDI-TOF analysis. 704A1T was resistance to 21 antibiotics, including four anti-tuberculosis drugs: rifampicin, streptomycin, rifabutin, and cycloserine. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of 704A1T compared to defined Stenotrophomonas species ranged from 80.03% to 89.6%, below than both the commonly accepted 95%-96% ANI threshold for prokaryote species and the 95% threshold suggested for Stenotrophomonas. Though no mortality was observed, 704A1T could cause severe consolidation in murine lung tissue and has the ability of hematogenous dissemination.ConclusionResults supported the classification of 704A1T (=GDMCC 1.4133T) as a novel species within the genus Stenotrophomonas, for which the name Stenotrophomonas tuberculopleuritidis sp. nov. is proposed. 704A1T is a multi-antibiotic resistance strain with potentially stronger pathogenicity than S. maltophilia and requires more clinical attention. The isolation of 704A1T underscored the importance of sustained surveillance and taxonomic clarity of Stenotrophomonas species emerging from clinical environments.

## Systems pharmacology-based optimization of Ma Xing Shi Gan components for the enhanced treatment of chick health issues caused by infectious bronchitis virus

date: 2025-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) imposes severe economic burdens on the poultry industry, and current treatments face challenges in efficacy and sustainability, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. To address this, this study employed the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Computing Platform (TCMICS) to collect clinical prescriptions for IBV treatment, based on which two optimized versions of the traditional Chinese medicine Maxing Shigan Decoction (MXSG), namely MXSG-mix1 and MXSG-mix2, were designed. In vitro cell culture and in vivo chicken model experiments were then carried out, including egg testing, clinical symptom observation, immune function analysis, and viral load quantification, to assess the antiviral activity of the optimized formulations.MethodsTo explore the underlying mechanisms, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was combined with network pharmacology to identify 28 active compounds in MXSG-mix and 47 key genes involved in viral replication, inflammation, and apoptosis pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking and RT-qPCR were performed, which confirmed that MXSG-mix downregulated BCL2 expression and interacted with AKT1 and CASP3, thus inhibiting IBV-induced cell apoptosis.Results and discussionThe results showed that both MXSG-mix1 and MXSG-mix2 exhibited superior anti-IBV activity compared to traditional MXSG, effectively reducing viral load and improving immune responses in vivo. In conclusion, integrating TCMICS, LC-MS, and network pharmacology offers a novel paradigm for developing veterinary TCM formulations. The optimized MXSG-mix shows potential as an effective, multi-target therapeutic against IBV, providing valuable insights for future anti-viral drug development in poultry medicine.

## Biofilm formation and role of other pathogenic factors in the virulence of Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates

date: 2025-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Medical device-associated infections represent a significant healthcare challenge, as sterilization of the biomaterial often necessitates device removal. The most frequently isolated microorganism in these infections is Staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal capable of causing a wide range of nosocomial infections. The primary virulence factor of S. epidermidis is biofilm formation, which decreases antibiotic efficacy and host immune response. However, additional factors play crucial roles in infection establishment. Understanding the interplay between virulence factors is essential to developing preventive strategies that inhibit microbial adhesion and biofilm development. In this study, we analyzed the presence of genes associated with adhesion and biofilm formation (ica-dependent and ica-independent pathways) in 25 clinical isolates of S. epidermidis and four control strains: ATCC 12228, ATCC 35983, ATCC 35984, and the HAM 892 mutant. Resistance profile was determined, and biofilm quantification and composition of matrix was performed using multiple methodologies. Additionally, parameters associated with initial adherence as cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) were investigated. A strong correlation was observed among different methods for measuring biofilm formation and matrix composition. The 14 icaADBC+ isolates exhibited higher prevalence of the aap, bhp, mecA, and IS256 genes, with polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) identified as the main matrix component. In contrast, icaADBC− biofilm-producing strains formed biofilms rich in other polysaccharides and proteins. The 15 non-biofilm-producing isolates showed significantly higher hydrophobicity levels, suggesting that this factor plays a critical role in initial adhesion and colonization. This study highlights the diverse mechanisms underlying biofilm formation in S. epidermidis and identifies hydrophobicity as a potential pathogenicity factor contributing to its virulence.

## Exploring protein–protein ligation approaches for the cytosolic delivery of antigens using AIP56

date: 2025-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe intracellular delivery of biologics, particularly large cargoes like proteins, remains a challenge in biotechnology and biomedicine. The modular structure of well-characterized AB toxins allows different cargoes to be grafted, creating a target-specific biotechnological tool capable of cytosolic delivery.MethodsIn this study, we employed protein–protein fusion strategies—SpyCatcher003, SnoopCatcher, and SnoopLigase—to generate chimeras between the delivery region of AIP56 (AIP56L258-N497) and β-lactamase and performed functional delivery assays.ResultsThe chimeras were successfully obtained using these strategies and were all able to deliver β-lactamase into the cytosol of J774.A1 macrophages. Cellular fractionation showed that, although most of the β-lactamase remains associated with the endosomal compartment, an active portion is released into the cytosol.ConclusionAIP56 delivery region transporting other cargo directly to the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells might be a promising platform for antigen/cargo delivery. This study highlights the potential of protein–protein fusion strategies to create versatile, antigenically distinct toxin-based delivery systems for therapeutic applications.

## Serological field investigations revealing natural exposure of one-humped dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) to foot-and-mouth disease virus in India

date: 2025-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most significant animal diseases globally, affecting over 60 susceptible species including camelids particularly Bactrian camels. In order to gather baseline evidence on the current status of FMD in Indian camels, a preliminary random serosurvey was conducted in camels of Rajasthan state with significant camel population. A total of 777 sera collected from one-humped dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) across 11 districts of Rajasthan during 2016–2017 were screened for FMD virus (FMDV) 3ABC nonstructural protein (NSP)-antibodies using the commercial PrioCHECK® FMDV NS kit. The sera were further tested using in-house liquid phase blocking (LPB) ELISA to evaluate the level of protective structural protein (SP)-antibody responses against three vaccine strains of FMDV serotypes O, A and Asia 1 if any. Out of 777 serum samples, 117 (15.05%; 95% Confidence Interval: 12.6%-17.7%) tested positive for 3ABC NSP-antibodies indicating the exposure of camels to FMDV. However, none of the sera tested in LPB ELISA showed a protective log10 antibody titre of ≥1.8 against any of the three FMDV serotypes confirming the absence of vaccination in these animals. This report provides retrospective evidence of anti-FMDV antibody response in dromedaries in India. Nevertheless, the role of dromedaries in epidemiology and transmission of FMDV remains unclear, emphasizing the need for further extensive serological screening of a larger number of samples. To the best of our knowledge, the present study, although preliminary, seems to be the first of its kind reporting the evidence of anti-FMDV antibody response in dromedaries in India.

## A flexible peptide linking the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains of MxiG controls type III secretion signaling and stable sorting platform assembly in Shigella

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Shigella flexneri uses its type III secretion system (T3SS) to invade human enterocytes. The T3SS injectisome is controlled by proteins at the tip of an exposed needle that sense host cell contact. Substrate selection and powering of secretion is controlled by a cytoplasmic assembly called the sorting platform (SP). The Shigella SP possesses six pod structures linked to a central ATPase via radial spokes. The SP associates with the injectisome inner membrane ring (IR) via the adaptor protein MxiK. The major IR component is MxiG, whose globular periplasmic domain (MxiGP) packs with MxiJ in a 24-fold symmetry. MxiG also has a transmembrane helix attached to a small cytoplasmic domain (MxiGC) via a flexible linker peptide. Change from the IR’s 24-fold symmetry to six-fold symmetry for the SP in Shigella occurs via MxiGC pairs that associate with MxiK. The intervening pairs shift to the center of the IR/SP assembly, which is distinct from what is seen for Salmonella. This implicates the linker in dynamic motions at the IR-SP interface, but the functional importance of the linker is unknown. Using a library of mutants, we found that the linker can accept diverse mutations without eliminating injectisome function. However, some mutants were found to give rise to subpopulations able to form needles and secrete effectors in the absence of a stably assembled SP. Mutants lacking the entire linker could not secrete any effector proteins (e.g. the IpaD tip protein) and had no T3SS-related virulence functions, however, there were subpopulations that could still secrete MxiH and assemble visible needles. In contrast, a very short linker could export IpaD to the needle tip, but could not rapidly respond to external secretion signals and were thus unable to quickly enter epithelial cells. These findings implicate the MxiG linker in signaling processes that are sensed at the needle tip. Our findings suggest that the native MxiG linker peptide has evolved to maximize T3SS function at steps beyond needle formation, while needle formation can occur even when the SP is highly destabilized.

## Age-related vaginal microecology and infection epidemiology among premenopausal and postmenopausal gynecologic outpatients: a cross-sectional study

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPostmenopausal estrogen deficiency disrupts vaginal microecological balance. This cross-sectional study investigates the epidemiology of vaginal infections and alterations in microbiota composition, enzymes, and metabolites among premenopausal and postmenopausal gynecologic outpatients.MethodsThe study analyzed the vaginal microecology data from 27,346 women who underwent examinations at Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital between 2018 and 2023. Parameters including vaginal cleanliness, bacterial density, and diversity were systematically evaluated. Additionally, a total of 20 participants (10 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal women) were enrolled for nontargeted LC-MS metabolomic analysis through stratified random sampling.ResultsThe population comprised 22,525 (82.4%) premenopausal women (18–44 years), 3,456 (12.6%) transitioning women (45–55 years), and 1,365 (5.0%) postmenopausal women (>55 years). In mixed infections, BV + VVC co-infections predominated (1264/2766, 45.7%). Postmenopausal women showed significantly higher BV prevalence (22.8% vs. 17.9%, P < 0.001) and AV (24.8% vs. 4.6%, P < 0.001), but lower rates of VVC (1.2% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.001). In postmenopausal women, BV-associated biomarkers (including clue cells and sialidase activity) and inflammatory markers (such as pus cells and leukocyte esterase activity) were concurrently elevated. Metabolomic analysis identified elevated chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate levels alongside reduced O-phosphothreonine, morpholine, and diethanolamine.ConclusionAge significantly influences vaginal microecology, altering infection epidemiology, microbiota, enzymes, and metabolites. Accounting for these age-related estrogen changes in clinical interventions is critical for effective management.

## A novel YGGT family protein is localized in the apicoplast and is essential for the organelle inheritance

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite. Most apicomplexan parasites contain an endosymbiont-derived organelle called the apicoplast. This organelle is critical for the survival of parasites because it plays a role in several essential metabolic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining the apicoplast have not been well understood. In this study, we investigated the function of an apicoplast-residing protein called TgYCAP in the inheritance of the apicoplast. Our results showed that conditional knockdown of TgYCAP severely inhibited the growth of the parasite and disrupted the inheritance of the apicoplast. In addition, the YGGT domain is essential for its function in the apicoplast.

## TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism is associated with elevated IFN-α level in asymptomatic HTLV-1 infection

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAlterations in the immune response may influence the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases. TLR3 detects viral nucleic acids, including HTLV-1, and triggers the production of IFN-I and other cytokines. Genetic variations in TLR3 may alter the antiviral and inflammatory responses and contribute to the progression of HTLV-1 infection. The present study investigated the association of polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene (rs5743305 T/A and rs3775291 C/T) with HTLV-1 infection status and their relationship with infection-associated diseases, receptor expression levels, proviral load, and inflammatory and antiviral cytokines.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 179 individuals with HTLV-1 infection (82 with inflammatory diseases and 97 asymptomatic individuals) and 179 controls. Genotyping of polymorphisms, analysis of TLR3 gene expression, and quantification of proviral load were performed by real-time PCR, and cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).ResultsThe polymorphisms showed no correlation with susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection, or the occurrence of disease symptoms linked to the infection. The presence of disease symptoms was associated with higher TNF-α levels and proviral load. TLR3 rs5743305 T/A polymorphism was not associated with variations in TLR3 and IFN-α levels. For the TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism, asymptomatic individuals carrying the TT polymorphic genotype presented significantly higher IFN-α levels and lower proviral load. The profile of asymptomatic individuals carrying the polymorphic genotypes for TLR3 rs3775291 C/T was characterized by higher levels of TLR3 and IFN-α and lower levels of proviral load, TNF-α and IL-6 compared to those with the wild-type genotype.ConclusionAlthough polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene have not been associated with the presence of symptoms of HTLV-1-related inflammatory diseases, the TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism appears to contribute to a better evolution of the HTLV-1 infection status and inflammatory process among asymptomatic individuals.

## Towards the elimination of infectious HPV: exploiting CRISPR/Cas innovations

date: 2025-08-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

HPV has been conclusively associated with various human malignancies, making the development of prevention and treatment strategies for HPV-induced diseases a high priority. Currently, primary prevention methods include HPV immunization and routine screening, which significantly reduce the risk of HPV transmission. However, for patients diagnosed with invasive, advanced, or recurrent malignancies, non-virus-specific therapies frequently lead to drug resistance and adverse effects, resulting in minimal improvement in treatment efficacy for numerous patients. Viral genome-targeting therapy is emerging as a promising avenue for the future management of HPV infections. With the rapid advancement of genetic modification technologies, the CRISPR/Cas system has demonstrated significant potential in treating viral infections. Its ability to selectively target and edit viral genomes for elimination positions it as a highly effective approach for combating HPV. This review will explore the functions and applications of the CRISPR/Cas system as an innovative therapy for HPV. We will illustrate the prospective efficacy of CRISPR/Cas as a groundbreaking and promising cure for HPV infections, while also addressing the opportunities and challenges associated with this novel approach.
