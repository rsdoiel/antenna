## Nitric oxide-producing monocyte-myeloid suppressor cells expand and accumulate in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of Yersinia enterocolitica-infected mice

date: 2024-10-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionYersinia enterocolitica (Ye) is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gastrointestinal infections. The myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) constitute a cellular population with the capacity of inducing the specific suppression of T cells. Although there is evidence supporting the role of MDSCs in controlling the immune responses in several bacterial infections, its role during Ye infection has not yet been reported. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to analyze MDSCs after oral Ye infection.MethodsC57BL/6 wild-type mice were infected with Ye WAP-314 serotype O:8. The proliferation of splenocytes and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) cells was measured as well as the levels of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in culture supernatants. The frequency and subsets of MDSCs were analyzed in the intestinal mucosa and spleen by flow cytometry. Furthermore, monocytic-MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs) and polymorphonuclear-MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) were purified from the spleen of infected mice and their suppressor activity was evaluated in co-cultures with purified T cells.Resultswe observed a marked expansion of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells, a phenotype consistent with MDSCs, in the spleen and intestinal mucosa of Ye-infected mice. Interestingly, a robust proliferation of splenocytes and MLN cells was observed only when the MDSCs were depleted or the NO production was blocked. In addition, we determined that only Mo-MDSCs had the ability to suppress T-cell proliferation.ConclusionOur results highlight a mechanism by which Ye may induce suppression of the immune responses. We suggest that NO-producing Mo-MDSCs expand and accumulate in MLN and spleen of Ye-infected mice. These cells can then suppress the T-cell function without interfering with the anti-bacterial effector response. Instead, these immature myeloid cells may perform an important function in regulating the inflammatory response and protecting affected tissues.

## Co-frequency or contrary? The effects of Qiwei Baizhu Powder and its bioactive compounds on mucosa-associated microbiota of mice with antibiotic-associated diarrhea

date: 2024-10-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Qiwei Baizhu Powder (QWBZP) has been proven effective in treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and the mechanism is associated with regulating the gut microbiota. However, the role of the bioactive compounds of QWBZP in regulating the gut microbiota is still unclear. In this study, 24 mice were divided into a normal control group (N), a model group (R), a QWBZP decoction group (TW), and a QWBZP-TG group (TG). AAD mouse models were established by mixed antibiotic administration. After modeling, mice in the TW group and TG group were treated with QWBZP decoction and QWBZP-TG, respectively. Mice in the N group and R group were gavaged with sterile water. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to investigate the changes of mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) in the small intestine of mice. Moreover, the levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D-Lactate, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The results showed that QWBZP-TG significantly altered the diversity, structure, and abundance of MAM in the AAD mice. QWBZP-TG exerted a stronger suppression effect on Escherichia and Clostridium compared with QWBZP decoction. Meanwhile, QWBZP-TG downregulated the abundance of Lactobacillus, which elicited an opposite effect to QWBZP decoction. Prevotella was the signature bacteria that responded to the QWBZP-TG intervention. Furthermore, both QWBZP decoction and QWBZP-TG decreased the levels of DAO, D-Lactate, sIgA, IL-6, and TNF-α in the AAD mice. The role of glycosides is to help QWBZP ameliorate diarrhea symptoms by inhibiting the proliferation of diarrhea-associated bacteria, reducing inflammation and regulating immunity.

## IFN-treated macrophage-derived exosomes prevents HBV-HCC migration and invasion via regulating miR-106b-3p/PCGF3/PI3K/AKT signaling axis

date: 2024-10-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundStudies revealed that exosomes from IFN-α-treated liver non-parenchymal cells (IFN-exo) mediate antiviral activity. MiR-106b-3p has been shown to play a paradoxical role in disease progressing from different studies. However, its specific role in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) and the underlying mechanism remains unclear.MethodHuh7 cells transient transfected with plasmids of HBV-C2 and B3 were co-cultured with IFN-exo. Cell supernatants were collected to detect miR-106b-3p, HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA levels. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed. The putative targets of miR-106b-3p were identified by a dual-luciferase reporter system. The expression of PCGF3, migratory proteins(MMP2/9), and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related proteins were assessed by western blot. The expression of PCGF3 mRNA was quantitative analyzed by using 52 pairs of paraffin-embedded tissues from HCC patients. siRNAs-PCGF3 were used to knocked-down PCGF3 expression.ResultsThe expression of miR-106b-3p was significantly higher in THP-1 cells and supernatants treated with IFN-exo than those untreated. Significantly increased expression of miR-106b-3p and decreased expression of HBsAg and HBV DNA were observed in Huh7-C2/B3 cells treated with IFN-exo. In addition, miR-106b-3p was directly target to PCGF3. Scratch healing assay and transwell assay showed that either IFN-exo or miRNA-106-3p over-expression, or siRNAs-PCGF3 inhibited migration and invasion of Huh7-C2/B3 cells, and subsequently resulted in suppression of p-AKT/AKT and p-PI3K/PI3K. Notably, the expression level of PCGF3 was significantly lower in HBeAg (+)-HCC tumor tissues than HBeAg (-)-HCC tumor.ConclusionIFN-α-induced macrophage-derived miR-106b-3p inhibits HBV replication, HBV- Huh7 cells migration and invasion via regulating PCGF3/PI3K/AKT signaling axis. miR-106b-3p and PCGF3 were potential biomarkers in the prevention and treatment of HBV-HCC.
