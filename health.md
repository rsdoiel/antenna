## Seasonal human coronavirus NL63 epidemics in children in Guilin, China, reveal the emergence of a new subgenotype of HCoV-NL63

date: 2024-04-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSeasonal human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a frequently encountered virus linked to mild upper respiratory infections. However, its potential to cause more severe or widespread disease remains an area of concern. This study aimed to investigate a rare localized epidemic of HCoV-NL63-induced respiratory infections among pediatric patients in Guilin, China, and to understand the viral subtype distribution and genetic characteristics.MethodsIn this study, 83 pediatric patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infections and positive for HCoV-NL63 were enrolled. Molecular analysis was conducted to identify the viral subgenotypes and to assess genetic variations in the receptor-binding domain of the spiking protein.ResultsAmong the 83 HCoV-NL63-positive children, three subgenotypes were identified: C4, C3, and B. Notably, 21 cases exhibited a previously unreported subtype, C4. Analysis of the C4 subtype revealed a unique amino acid mutation (I507L) in the receptor-binding domain of the spiking protein, which was also observed in the previously reported C3 genotype. This mutation may suggest potential increases in viral transmissibility and pathogenicity.DiscussionThe findings of this study highlight the rapid mutation dynamics of HCoV-NL63 and its potential for increased virulence and epidemic transmission. The presence of a unique mutation in the C4 subtype, shared with the C3 genotype, raises concerns about the virus’s evolving nature and its potential public health implications. This research contributes valuable insights into the understanding of HCoV-NL63’s epidemiology and pathogenesis, which is crucial for effective disease prevention and control strategies. Future studies are needed to further investigate the biological significance of the observed mutation and its potential impact on the virus’s transmissibility and pathogenicity.

## Gut microbiota composition in travellers is associated with faecal lipocalin-2, a mediator of gut inflammation

date: 2024-04-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionWe examined the gut microbiota of travellers returning from tropical areas with and without traveller’s diarrhoea (TD) and its association with faecal lipocalin-2 (LCN2) levels.MethodsParticipants were recruited at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain, and a single stool sample was collected from each individual to perform the diagnostic of the etiological agent causing gastrointestinal symptoms as well as to measure levels of faecal LCN2 as a biomarker of gut inflammation. We also characterised the composition of the gut microbiota by sequencing the region V3-V4 from the 16S rRNA gene, and assessed its relation with the clinical presentation of TD and LCN2 levels using a combination of conventional statistical tests and unsupervised machine learning approaches.ResultsAmong 61 participants, 45 had TD, with 40% having identifiable etiological agents. Surprisingly, LCN2 levels were similar across groups, suggesting gut inflammation occurs without clinical TD symptoms. Differential abundance (DA) testing highlighted a microbial profile tied to high LCN2 levels, marked by increased Proteobacteria and Escherichia-Shigella, and decreased Firmicutes, notably Oscillospiraceae. UMAP analysis confirmed this profile’s association, revealing distinct clusters based on LCN2 levels. The study underscores the discriminatory power of UMAP in capturing meaningful microbial patterns related to clinical variables. No relevant differences in the gut microbiota composition were found between travellers with or without TD.DiscussionThe findings suggest a correlation between gut microbiome and LCN2 levels during travel, emphasising the need for further research to discern the nature of this relationship.

## Seroprevalence of the novel swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus in China assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

date: 2024-04-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The endemic outbreak of SADS-CoV has resulted in economic losses and potentially threatened the safety of China’s pig industry. The molecular epidemiology of SADS-CoV in pig herds has been investigated in many provinces in China. However, there are no data over a long-time span, and there is a lack of extensive serological surveys to assess the prevalence of SADS-CoV in Chinese swine herds since the discovery of SADS-CoV. In this study, an indirect anti-SADS-CoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the SADS-CoV S1 protein was established to investigate the seroprevalence of SADS-CoV in Chinese swine herds. Cross-reactivity assays, indirect immunofluorescence, and western blotting assays showed that the developed ELISA had excellent SADS-CoV specificity. In total, 12,978 pig serum samples from 29 provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions in China were tested from 2022 to 2023. The results showed that the general seroprevalence of SADS-CoV in China was 59.97%, with seroprevalence ranging from 16.7% to 77.12% in different provinces and from 42.61% to 68.45% in different months. SADS-CoV is widely prevalent in China, and its seroprevalence was higher in Northeast China, North China, and Central China than in other regions. Among the four seasons, the prevalence of SADS-CoV was the highest in spring and the lowest in autumn. The results of this study provide the general seroprevalence profile of SADS-CoV in China, facilitating the understanding of the prevalence of SADS-CoV in pigs. More importantly, this study is beneficial in formulating preventive and control measures for SADS-CoV and may provide directions for vaccine development.

## Roles of airway and intestinal epithelia in responding to pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis

date: 2024-04-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Epithelial cells form a resilient barrier and orchestrate defensive and reparative mechanisms to maintain tissue stability. This review focuses on gut and airway epithelia, which are positioned where the body interfaces with the outside world. We review the many signaling pathways and mechanisms by which epithelial cells at the interface respond to invading pathogens to mount an innate immune response and initiate adaptive immunity and communicate with other cells, including resident microbiota, to heal damaged tissue and maintain homeostasis. We compare and contrast how airway and gut epithelial cells detect pathogens, release antimicrobial effectors, collaborate with macrophages, Tregs and epithelial stem cells to mount an immune response and orchestrate tissue repair. We also describe advanced research models for studying epithelial communication and behaviors during inflammation, tissue injury and disease.

## Application value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in hematological patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia

date: 2024-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a novel non-invasive and comprehensive technique for etiological diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, its practical significance has been seldom reported in the context of hematological patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia, a unique patient group characterized by neutropenia and compromised immune responses.MethodsThis retrospective study evaluated the results of plasma cfDNA sequencing in 164 hematological patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia. We assessed the diagnostic efficacy and clinical impact of mNGS, comparing it with conventional microbiological tests.ResultsmNGS identified 68 different pathogens in 111 patients, whereas conventional methods detected only 17 pathogen types in 36 patients. mNGS exhibited a significantly higher positive detection rate than conventional methods (67.7% vs. 22.0%, P < 0.001). This improvement was consistent across bacterial (30.5% vs. 9.1%), fungal (19.5% vs. 4.3%), and viral (37.2% vs. 9.1%) infections (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The anti-infective treatment strategies were adjusted for 51.2% (84/164) of the patients based on the mNGS results.ConclusionsmNGS of plasma cfDNA offers substantial promise for the early detection of pathogens and the timely optimization of anti-infective therapies in hematological patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia.

## Survey of Rickettsia species in hematophagous arthropods from endemic areas for Japanese spotted fever in China

date: 2024-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Japanese spotted fever (JSF) is caused by Rickettsia japonica, mainly vectored by hard ticks. However, whether R. japonica can be transmitted by other arthropods remains unknown. Moreover, it is of interest to investigate whether other Rickettsia species cause spotted fever in endemic areas. In this study, a survey of Rickettsia species was performed in hematophagous arthropods (mosquitoes, tabanids, and ticks) from endemic areas for JSF in Hubei Province, central China. The results showed that the diversity and prevalence of Rickettsia species in mosquitoes are low, suggesting that mosquitoes may not be the vector of zoonotic Rickettsia species. A novel Rickettsia species showed a high prevalence (16.31%, 23/141) in tabanids and was named “Candidatus Rickettsia tabanidii.” It is closely related to Rickettsia from fleas and mosquitoes; however, its pathogenicity in humans needs further investigation. Five Rickettsia species were identified in ticks. Rickettsia japonica, the agent of JSF, was detected only in Haemaphysalis longicornis and Haemaphysalis hystricis, suggesting that they may be the major vectors of R. japonica. Notably, two novel species were identified in H. hystricis ticks, one belonging to the spotted fever group and the other potentially belonging to the ancestral group. The latter one named “Candidatus Rickettsia hubeiensis” may provide valuable insight into the evolutionary history of Rickettsia.

## Rutin prevents EqHV-8 induced infection and oxidative stress via Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway

date: 2024-04-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway has been extensively studied for its role in regulating antioxidant and antiviral responses. The Equid herpesvirus type 8 (EqHV-8) poses a significant threat to the equine industry, primarily manifesting as respiratory disease, abortions, and neurological disorders in horses and donkeys. Oxidative stress is considered a key factor associated with pathogenesis of EqHV-8 infection. Unfortunately, there is currently a dearth of therapeutic interventions available for the effective control of EqHV-8. Rutin has been well documented for its antioxidant and antiviral potential. In current study we focused on the evaluation of Rutin as a potential therapeutic agent against EqHV-8 infection.MethodsFor this purpose, we encompassed both in-vitro and in-vivo investigations to assess the effectiveness of Rutin in combatting EqHV-8 infection.Results and DiscussionThe results obtained from in vitro experiments demonstrated that Rutin exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on EqHV-8 at multiple stages of the viral life cycle. Through meticulous experimentation, we elucidated that Rutin’s antiviral action against EqHV-8 is intricately linked to the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway-mediated antioxidant response. Activation of this pathway by Rutin was found to significantly impede EqHV-8 replication, thereby diminishing the viral load. This mechanistic insight not only enhances our understanding of the antiviral potential of Rutin but also highlights the significance of antioxidant stress responses in combating EqHV-8 infection. To complement our in vitro findings, we conducted in vivo studies employing a mouse model. These experiments revealed that Rutin administration resulted in a substantial reduction in EqHV-8 infection within the lungs of the mice, underscoring the compound’s therapeutic promise in vivo.ConclusionIn summation, our finding showed that Rutin holds promise as a novel and effective therapeutic agent for the prevention and control of EqHV-8 infections.

## Antimicrobial peptides in livestock: a review with a one health approach

date: 2024-04-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), often referred to as nature’s antibiotics, are ubiquitous in living organisms, spanning from bacteria to humans. Their potency, versatility, and unique mechanisms of action have garnered significant research attention. Unlike conventional antibiotics, peptides are biodegradable, adding to their appeal as potential candidates to address bacterial resistance in livestock farming—a challenge that has been under scrutiny for decades. This issue is complex and multifactorial, influenced by a variety of components. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed a comprehensive approach known as One Health, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human-animal-environment relationships in tackling such challenges. This review explores the application of AMPs in livestock farming and how they can mitigate the impact of this practice within the One Health framework.

## A combination of GRA3, GRA6 and GRA7 peptides offer a useful tool for serotyping type II and III Toxoplasma gondii infections in sheep and pigs

date: 2024-04-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The clinical consequences of toxoplasmosis are greatly dependent on the Toxoplasma gondii strain causing the infection. To better understand its epidemiology and design appropriate control strategies, it is important to determine the strain present in infected animals. Serotyping methods are based on the detection of antibodies that react against segments of antigenic proteins presenting strain-specific polymorphic variations, offering a cost-effective, sensitive, and non-invasive alternative to genotyping techniques. Herein, we evaluated the applicability of a panel of peptides previously characterized in mice and humans to serotype sheep and pigs. To this end, we used 51 serum samples from experimentally infected ewes (32 type II and 19 type III), 20 sheep samples from naturally infected sheep where the causative strain was genotyped (18 type II and 2 type III), and 40 serum samples from experimentally infected pigs (22 type II and 18 type III). Our ELISA test results showed that a combination of GRA peptide homologous pairs can discriminate infections caused by type II and III strains of T. gondii in sheep and pigs. Namely, the GRA3-I/III-43 vs. GRA3-II-43, GRA6-I/III-213 vs. GRA6-II-214 and GRA6-III-44 vs. GRA6-II-44 ratios showed a statistically significant predominance of the respective strain-type peptide in sheep, while in pigs, in addition to these three peptide pairs, GRA7-II-224 vs. GRA7-III-224 also showed promising results. Notably, the GRA6-44 pair, which was previously deemed inefficient in mice and humans, showed a high prediction capacity, especially in sheep. By contrast, GRA5-38 peptides failed to correctly predict the strain type in most sheep and pig samples, underpinning the notion that individual standardization is needed for each animal species. Finally, we recommend analyzing for each animal at least 2 samples taken at different time points to confirm the obtained results.

## Updates on traditional methods for combating malaria and emerging Wolbachia-based interventions

date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The escalating challenge of malaria control necessitates innovative approaches that extend beyond traditional control strategies. This review explores the incorporation of traditional vector control techniques with emerging Wolbachia-based interventions. Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria, offers a novel approach for combatting vector-borne diseases, including malaria, by reducing the mosquitoes’ ability to transmit these diseases. The study explores the rationale for this integration, presenting various case studies and pilot projects that have exhibited significant success. Employing a multi-dimensional approach that includes community mobilization, environmental modifications, and new biological methods, the paper posits that integrated efforts could mark a turning point in the struggle against malaria. Our findings indicate that incorporating Wolbachia-based strategies into existing vector management programs not only is feasible but also heightens the efficacy of malaria control initiatives in different countries especially in Pakistan. The paper concludes that continued research and international collaboration are imperative for translating these promising methods from the laboratory to the field, thereby offering a more sustainable and effective malaria control strategy.

## Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG powder supplementation alleviates intestinal injury in piglets challenged by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has become a challenging problem in pig industry worldwide, causing significant profit losses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) has been regarded as a safe probiotic strain and has been shown to exert protective effects on the intestinal dysfunction caused by PEDV. This study evaluated the effect of LGG on the gut health of lactating piglets challenged with PEDV. Fifteen piglets at 7 days of age were equally assigned into 3 groups (5 piglets per group): 1) control group (basal diet); 2) PEDV group: (basal diet + PEDV challenged); 3) LGG + PEDV group (basal diet + 3×109 CFU/pig/day LGG + PEDV). The trial lasted 11 days including 3 days of adaptation. The treatment with LGG was from D4 to D10. PEDV challenge was carried out on D8. PEDV infection disrupted the cell structure, undermined the integrity of the intestinal tract, and induced oxidative stress, and intestinal damage of piglets. Supplementation of LGG improved intestinal morphology, enhanced intestinal antioxidant capacity, and alleviated jejunal mucosal inflammation and lipid metabolism disorders in PEDV-infected piglets, which may be regulated by LGG by altering the expression of TNF signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion and absorption pathway.

## Chikungunya virus infection in human microglial C20 cells induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis

date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionChikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is associated with acute clinical manifestations and chronic joint inflammation. CHIKV has emerged as a significant causative agent of central nervous system (CNS) complications, including encephalitis and related sequelae. Microglial cells, crucial for immune responses and tissue repair in the CNS, play a vital role in the host response to viral infections, with their activation potentially leading to either protection or pathology. In this study, the infection biology of CHIKV in the C20 human microglial cell line was investigated.MethodsThe permissiveness of C20 cells to CHIKV infection was assessed, and viral replication kinetics were compared to Vero E6 cells. Cytopathic effects of CHIKV infection on C20 cells were examined, along with ultrastructural changes using transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, apoptosis induction, mitochondrial membrane potential, and alterations in cell surface marker expression were evaluated by flow cytometry.ResultsCHIKV infection demonstrated permissiveness in C20 cells, similar to Vero cells, resulting in robust viral replication and cytopathic effects. Ultrastructural analysis revealed viral replication, mature virion formation, and distinctive cytoplasmic and nuclear changes in infected C20 cells. CHIKV infection induced significant apoptosis in C20 cells, accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and altered expression of cell surface markers such as CD11c, CD14, and HLA-DR. Notably, decreased CD14 expression was observed in CHIKV-infected C20 cells.DiscussionThe study findings suggest that CHIKV infection induces apoptosis in C20 microglial cells via the mitochondrial pathway, with significant alterations in cell surface marker expression, particularly CD14 that is linked with apoptosis induction. These observations provide valuable insights into the role of human microglial cells in the host response to CHIKV infection and contribute to the knowledge on the neuropathogenesis of this virus.

## Integrating machine learning algorithms and single-cell analysis to identify gut microbiota-related macrophage biomarkers in atherosclerotic plaques

date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe relationship between macrophages and the gut microbiota in patients with atherosclerosis remains poorly defined, and effective biological markers are lacking. This study aims to elucidate the interplay between gut microbial communities and macrophages, and to identify biomarkers associated with the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. The goal is to enhance our understanding of the underlying molecular pathways and to pave new avenues for diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies in the disease.MethodsThis study employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis on atherosclerosis datasets to identify macrophage-associated genes and quantify the correlation between these genes and gut microbiota gene sets. The Random Forest algorithm was utilized to pinpoint PLEK, IRF8, BTK, CCR1, and CD68 as gut microbiota-related macrophage genes, and a nomogram was constructed. Based on the top five genes, a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was applied to construct gut microbiota-related macrophage clusters and analyze their potential biological alterations. Subsequent single-cell analyses were conducted to observe the expression patterns of the top five genes and the interactions between immune cells. Finally, the expression profiles of key molecules were validated using clinical samples from atherosclerosis patients.ResultsUtilizing the Random Forest algorithm, we ultimately identified PLEK, IRF8, CD68, CCR1, and BTK as gut microbiota-associated macrophage genes that are upregulated in atherosclerotic plaques. A nomogram based on the expression of these five genes was constructed for use as an auxiliary tool in clinical diagnosis. Single-cell analysis confirmed the specific expression of gut microbiota-associated macrophage genes in macrophages. Clinical samples substantiated the high expression of PLEK in unstable atherosclerotic plaques.ConclusionGut microbiota-associated macrophage genes (PLEK, IRF8, CD68, CCR1, and BTK) may be implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques and could serve as diagnostic markers to aid patients with atherosclerosis.

## Detection of novel Plasmodium falciparum coronin gene mutations in a recrudescent ACT-treated patient in South-Western Nigeria

date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRoutine surveillance for antimalarial drug resistance is critical to sustaining the efficacy of artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs). Plasmodium falciparum kelch-13 (Pfkelch-13) and non-Pfkelch-13 artemisinin (ART) resistance-associated mutations are uncommon in Africa. We investigated polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum actin-binding protein (Pfcoronin) associated with in vivo reduced sensitivity to ART in Nigeria.MethodsFifty-two P. falciparum malaria subjects who met the inclusion criteria were followed up in a 28-day therapeutic efficacy study of artemether-lumefantrine in Lagos, Nigeria. Parasite detection was done by microscopy and molecular diagnostic approaches involving PCR amplification of genes for Pf18S rRNA, varATS, telomere-associated repetitive elements-2 (TARE-2). Pfcoronin and Pfkelch-13 genes were sequenced bi-directionally while clonality of infections was determined using 12 neutral P. falciparum microsatellite loci and msp2 analyses. Antimalarial drugs (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, amodiaquine, chloroquine and some quinolones) resistance variants (DHFR_51, DHFR_59, DHFR_108, DHFR_164, MDR1_86, MDR1_184, DHPS_581 and DHPS_613) were genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis.ResultsA total of 7 (26.92%) cases were identified either as early treatment failure, late parasitological failure or late clinical failure. Of the four post-treatment infections identified as recrudescence by msp2 genotypes, only one was classified as recrudescence by multilocus microsatellites genotyping. Microsatellite analysis revealed no significant difference in the mean allelic diversity, He, (P = 0.19, Mann-Whitney test). Allele sizes and frequency per locus implicated one isolate. Genetic analysis of this isolate identified two new Pfcoronin SNVs (I68G and L173F) in addition to the P76S earlier reported. Linkage-Disequilibrium as a standardized association index, IAS, between multiple P. falciparum loci revealed significant LD (IAS = 0.2865, P=0.02, Monte-Carlo simulation) around the neutral microsatellite loci. The pfdhfr/pfdhps/pfmdr1 drug resistance-associated haplotypes combinations, (108T/N/51I/164L/59R/581G/86Y/184F), were observed in two samples.ConclusionPfcoronin mutations identified in this study, with potential to impact parasite clearance, may guide investigations on emerging ART tolerance in Nigeria, and West African endemic countries.

## High-fat diets induce inflammatory IMD/NFκB signaling via gut microbiota remodeling in Drosophila

date: 2024-04-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

High-fat diets (HFDs), a prevailing daily dietary style worldwide, induce chronic low-grade inflammation in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, promoting a variety of diseases including pathologies associated with neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms linking HFDs to inflammation are not entirely clear. Here, using a Drosophila HFD model, we explored the mechanism of HFD-induced inflammation in remote tissues. We found that HFDs activated the IMD/NFκB immune pathway in the head through remodeling of the commensal gut bacteria. Removal of gut microbiota abolished such HFD-induced remote inflammatory response. Further experiments revealed that HFDs significantly increased the abundance of Acetobacter malorum in the gut, and the re-association of this bacterium was sufficient to elicit inflammatory response in remote tissues. Mechanistically, Acetobacter malorum produced a greater amount of peptidoglycan (PGN), a well-defined microbial molecular pattern that enters the circulation and remotely activates an inflammatory response. Our results thus show that HFDs trigger inflammation mediated by a bacterial molecular pattern that elicits host immune response.

## Genomic insights into the diversity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of group B Streptococcus clinical isolates from Saudi Arabia

date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDetailed assessment of the population structure of group B Streptococcus (GBS) among adults is still lacking in Saudi Arabia. Here we characterized a representative collection of isolates from colonized and infected adults.MethodsGBS isolates (n=89) were sequenced by Illumina and screened for virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants. Genetic diversity was assessed by single nucleotide polymorphisms and core-genome MLST analyses.ResultsGenome sequences revealed 28 sequence types (STs) and nine distinct serotypes, including uncommon serotypes VII and VIII. Majority of these STs (n=76) belonged to the human-associated clonal complexes (CCs) CC1 (33.71%), CC19 (25.84%), CC17 (11.24%), CC10/CC12 (7.87%), and CC452 (6.74%). Major CCs exhibited intra-lineage serotype diversity, except for the hypervirulent CC17, which exclusively expressed serotype III. Virulence profiling revealed that nearly all isolates (94.38%) carried at least one of the four alpha family protein genes (i.e., alphaC, alp1, alp2/3, and rib), and 92.13% expressed one of the two serine-rich repeat surface proteins Srr1 or Srr2. In addition, most isolates harbored the pilus island (PI)-2a alone (15.73%) or in combination with PI-1 (62.92%), and those carrying PI-2b alone (10.11%) belonged to CC17. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the sequenced isolates according to CCs and further subdivided them along with their serotypes. Overall, isolates across all CC1 phylogenetic clusters expressed Srr1 and carried the PI-1 and PI-2a loci, but differed in genes encoding the alpha-like proteins. CC19 clusters were dominated by the III/rib/srr1/PI-1+PI-2a (43.48%, 10/23) and V/alp1/srr1/PI-1+PI-2a (34.78%, 8/23) lineages, whereas most CC17 isolates (90%, 9/10) had the same III/rib/srr2/P1-2b genetic background. Interestingly, genes encoding the CC17-specific adhesins HvgA and Srr2 were detected in phylogenetically distant isolates belonging to ST1212, suggesting that other highly virulent strains might be circulating within the species. Resistance to macrolides and/or lincosamides across all major CCs (n=48) was associated with the acquisition of erm(B) (62.5%, 30/48), erm(A) (27.1%, 13/48), lsa(C) (8.3%, 4/48), and mef(A) (2.1%, 1/48) genes, whereas resistance to tetracycline was mainly mediated by presence of tet(M) (64.18%, 43/67) and tet(O) (20.9%, 14/67) alone or in combination (13.43%, 9/67).DiscussionThese findings underscore the necessity for more rigorous characterization of GBS isolates causing infections.

## Characterization and efficacy against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii of a novel Friunavirus phage from sewage

date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a new threat in recent years, owing to its rapidly increasing resistance to antibiotics and new effective therapies are needed to combat this pathogen. Phage therapy is considered to be the most promising alternative for treating CRAB infections. In this study, a novel phage, Ab_WF01, which can lyse clinical CRAB, was isolated and characterized from hospital sewage. The multiplicity of infection, morphology, one-step growth curve, stability, sensitivity, and lytic activity of the phage were also investigated. The genome of phage Ab_WF01 was 41, 317 bp in size with a GC content of 39.12% and encoded 51 open reading frames (ORFs). tRNA, virulence, and antibiotic resistance genes were not detected in the phage genome. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that phage Ab_WF01 is a novel species of the genus Friunavirus, subfamily Beijerinckvirinae, and family Autographiviridae. The in vivo results showed that phage Ab_WF01 significantly increased the survival rate of CRAB-infected Galleria mellonella (from 0% to 70% at 48 h) and mice (from 0% to 60% for 7 days). Moreover, after day 3 post-infection, phage Ab_WF01 reduced inflammatory response, with strongly ameliorated histological damage and bacterial clearance in infected tissue organs (lungs, liver, and spleen) in mouse CRAB infection model. Taken together, these results show that phage Ab_WF01 holds great promise as a potential alternative agent with excellent stability for against CRAB infections.

## Modulation of Campylobacter jejuni adhesion to biotic model surfaces by fungal lectins and protease inhibitors

date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Campylobacter jejuni, a Gram-negative bacterium, is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness worldwide. Its adhesion mechanism is mediated by several bacterial factors, including flagellum, protein adhesins, lipooligosaccharides, proteases, and host factors, such as surface glycans on epithelial cells and mucins. Fungal lectins, specialized carbohydrate-binding proteins, can bind to specific glycans on host and bacterial cells and thus influence pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of fungal lectins and protease inhibitors on the adhesion of C. jejuni to model biotic surfaces (mucin, fibronectin, and collagen) and Caco-2 cells as well as the invasion of Caco-2 cells. The lectins Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) and Laccaria bicolor tectonin 2 (Tec2) showed remarkable efficacy in all experiments. In addition, different pre-incubations of lectins with C. jejuni or Caco-2 cells significantly inhibited the ability of C. jejuni to adhere to and invade Caco-2 cells, but to varying degrees. Pre-incubation of Caco-2 cells with selected lectins reduced the number of invasive C. jejuni cells the most, while simultaneous incubation showed the greatest reduction in adherent C. jejuni cells. These results suggest that fungal lectins are a promising tool for the prevention and treatment of C. jejuni infections. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of fungi as a rich reservoir for novel anti-adhesive agents.

## Innate immune response against vector-borne bunyavirus infection and viral countermeasures

date: 2024-04-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Bunyaviruses are a large group of important viral pathogens that cause significant diseases in humans and animals worldwide. Bunyaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that infect a wide range of hosts. Upon entry into host cells, the components of viruses are recognized by host innate immune system, leading to the activation of downstream signaling cascades to induce interferons (IFNs) and other proinflammatory cytokines. IFNs bind to their receptors and upregulate the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Many ISGs have antiviral activities and confer an antiviral state to host cells. For efficient replication and spread, viruses have evolved different strategies to antagonize IFN-mediated restriction. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the interactions between bunyaviruses and host innate immune response.
