## Antibiofilm activity of carotenoid crocetin against Staphylococcal strains

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis stand as notorious threats to human beings owing to the myriad of infections they cause. The bacteria readily form biofilms that help in withstanding the effects of antibiotics and the immune system. Intending to combat the biofilm formation and reduce the virulence of the pathogens, we investigated the effects of carotenoids, crocetin, and crocin, on four Staphylococcal strains. Crocetin was found to be the most effective as it diminished the biofilm formation of S. aureus ATCC 6538 significantly at 50 µg/mL without exhibiting bactericidal effect (MIC >800 µg/mL) and also inhibited the formation of biofilm by MSSA 25923 and S. epidermidis at a concentration as low as 2 µg/mL, and that by methicillin-resistant S. aureus MW2 at 100 µg/mL. It displayed minimal to no antibiofilm efficacy on the Gram-negative strains Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as a fungal strain of Candida albicans. It could also curb the formation of fibrils, which partly contributes to the biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. Additionally, the ADME analysis of crocetin proclaims how relatively non-toxic the chemical is. Also, crocetin displayed synergistic antibiofilm characteristics in combination with tobramycin. The presence of a polyene chain with carboxylic acid groups at its ends is hypothesized to contribute to the strong antibiofilm characteristics of crocetin. These findings suggest that using apocarotenoids, particularly crocetin might help curb the biofilm formation by S. aureus and S. epidermidis.

## Causal relationships between gut microbiota and lymphoma: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMultiple studies have suggested a possible connection between the gut microbiota and the development of lymphoma, though the exact nature of this relationship remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether a causal association exists between gut microbiota and lymphoma.MethodsA bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was conducted to investigate potential causal effects between gut microbiota and various lymphoma subtypes. The primary method employed for MR analysis was inverse variance weighted (IVW), supplemented by additional methods including MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode approaches. The Cochrane Q test, MR-PRESSO global test and MR-Egger intercept test were performed to assess pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Furthermore, a reverse MR analysis was performed to explore potential reverse causal effect.ResultsThe primary MR analysis identified 36 causal relationships between genetic liabilities in gut microbiota and different lymphoma subtypes. Neither the MR-PRESSO test nor the MR-Egger regression detected any pleiotropy, and Cochran’s Q test indicated no significant heterogeneity.ConclusionsOur MR analysis revealed substantial causal associations between gut microbiota and lymphoma, offering new insights into lymphoma prevention and management microbiota.

## The myxozoans Myxobolus cerebralis and Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae modulate rainbow trout immune responses: quantitative shotgun proteomics at the portals of entry after single and co-infections

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionLittle is known about the proteomic changes at the portals of entry in rainbow trout after infection with the myxozoan parasites, Myxobolus cerebralis, and Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae. Whirling disease (WD) is a severe disease of salmonids, caused by the myxosporean M. cerebralis, while, proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is caused by T. bryosalmonae, which instead belongs to the class Malacosporea. Climate change is providing more suitable conditions for myxozoan parasites lifecycle, posing a high risk to salmonid aquaculture and contributing to the decline of wild trout populations in North America and Europe. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide the first proteomic profiles of the host in the search for evasion strategies during single and coinfection with M. cerebralis and T. bryosalmonae.MethodsOne group of fish was initially infected with M. cerebralis and another group with T. bryosalmonae. After 30 days, half of the fish in each group were co-infected with the other parasite. Using a quantitative proteomic approach, we investigated proteomic changes in the caudal fins and gills of rainbow trout before and after co-infection.ResultsIn the caudal fins, 16 proteins were differentially regulated post exposure to M. cerebralis, whereas 27 proteins were differentially modulated in the gills of the infected rainbow trout post exposure to T. bryosalmonae. After co-infection, 4 proteins involved in parasite recognition and the regulation of host immune responses were differentially modulated between the groups in the caudal fin. In the gills, 11 proteins involved in parasite recognition and host immunity, including 4 myxozoan proteins predicted to be virulence factors, were differentially modulated.DiscussionThe results of this study increase our knowledge on rainbow trout co-infections by myxozoan parasites and rainbow trout immune responses against myxozoans at the portals of entry, supporting a better understanding of these host-parasite interactions.

## Unravelling the acute respiratory infection landscape: virus type, viral load, health status and coinfection do matter

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAcute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common infections in the general population and are mainly caused by respiratory viruses. Detecting several viruses in a respiratory sample is common. To better understand these viral codetections and potential interferences, we tested for the presence of viruses and developed quantitative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) for the viruses most prevalent in coinfections: human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and quantified their viral loads according to coinfections and health status, age, cellular abundance and other variables.Materials and methodsSamples from two different cohorts were analyzed: one included hospitalized infants under 12 months of age with acute bronchiolitis (n=719) and the other primary care patients of all ages with symptoms of ARI (n=685). We performed Multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs, and quantitative PCR on samples positive for HRV or/and RSV to determine viral loads (VL). Cellular abundance (CA) was also estimated by qPCR targeting the GAPDH gene. Genotyping was performed either directly from first-line molecular panel or by PCR and sequencing for HRV.ResultsThe risks of viral codetection were 4.1 (IC95[1.8; 10.0]) and 93.9 1 (IC95[48.7; 190.7]) higher in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis than in infants in primary care for RSV and HRV respectively (p<0.001). CA was higher in samples positive for multiple viruses than in mono-infected or negative samples (p<0.001), and higher in samples positive for RSV (p<0.001) and HRV (p<0.001) than in negative samples. We found a positive correlation between CA and VL for both RSV and HRV. HRV VL was higher in children than in the elderly (p<0.05), but not RSV VL. HRV VL was higher when detected alone than in samples coinfected with RSV-A and with RSV-B. There was a significant increase of RSV-A VL when codetecting with HRV (p=0.001) and when co-detecting with RSV-B+HRV versus RSV-A+ RSV-B (p=0.02).ConclusionsMany parameters influence the natural history of respiratory viral infections, and quantifying respiratory viral loads can help disentangle their contributions to viral outcome.

## Dietary fiber may benefit chondrocyte activity maintenance

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The understanding of the link between the gut-bone axis is growing yearly, but the mechanisms involved are not yet clear. Our study analyzed the role of Sestrin2 (SESN2)pathway in the gut-bone axis. We established an osteoarthritis (OA) model in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using the anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) procedure, followed by a dietary intervention with varying levels of dietary fiber content for 8 weeks. By 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota, we found that high dietary fiber (HDF) intake could significantly increase the Bacillota-dominant gut microbiota. Meanwhile, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and histological analysis showed that intervention with HDF could reduce the degree of bone and joint lesions and inflammation. We hypothesize that HDF increased the dominant flora of Bacillota, up-regulated the expression of SESN2 in knee joint, and reduced gut permeability, thereby reducing systemic inflammatory response and the degree of bone and joint lesions. Therefore, the present study confirms that changes in gut microbiota induced by increased dietary fiber intake delayed the onset of OA by promoting up-regulation of SESN2 expression at the knee joint to maintain chondrocyte activity and reduce synovial inflammation.

## Sonication protocols and their contributions to the microbiological diagnosis of implant-associated infections: a review of the current scenario

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Addressing the existing problem in the microbiological diagnosis of infections associated with implants and the current debate about the real power of precision of sonicated fluid culture (SFC), the objective of this review is to describe the methodology and analyze and compare the results obtained in current studies on the subject. Furthermore, the present study also discusses and suggests the best parameters for performing sonication. A search was carried out for recent studies in the literature (2019-2023) that addressed this research topic. As a result, different sonication protocols were adopted in the studies analyzed, as expected, and consequently, there was significant variability between the results obtained regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the technique in relation to the traditional culture method (periprosthetic tissue culture – PTC). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as the main etiological agents by SFC and PTC, with SFC being important for the identification of pathogens of low virulence that are difficult to detect. Compared to chemical biofilm displacement methods, EDTA and DTT, SFC also produced variable results. In this context, this review provided an overview of the most current scenarios on the topic and theoretical support to improve sonication performance, especially with regard to sensitivity and specificity, by scoring the best parameters from various aspects, including sample collection, storage conditions, cultivation methods, microorganism identification techniques (both phenotypic and molecular) and the cutoff point for colony forming unit (CFU) counts. This study demonstrated the need for standardization of the technique and provided a theoretical basis for a sonication protocol that aims to achieve the highest levels of sensitivity and specificity for the reliable microbiological diagnosis of infections associated with implants and prosthetic devices, such as prosthetic joint infections (PJIs). However, practical application and additional complementary studies are still needed.

## Comparative characterization of supragingival plaque microbiomes in malocclusion adult female patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with removable aligners or fixed appliances: a descriptive cross-sectional study

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the effects of removable aligners and fixed appliances on the supragingival bacterial communities in adult female patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.MethodsSupragingival plaque samples from 48 female individuals underwent microbiome analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) using PacBio Sequel sequencing. The study included 13 adults without orthodontic treatment needs as the control group (Group C), and 35 patients with comparable initial orthodontic conditions who received treatment at a university clinic in Beijing, China. The treatment involved either traditional fixed brackets (Group B, n = 17) or Invisalign® aligners (Group AT, n = 18). Bioinformatics methods were used for data analysis.ResultsFrom the 48 plaque samples, a total of 334,961 valid reads were obtained, averaging 6,978 sequences per sample. The 16S rDNA sequences were classified into 25,727 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Significant variances in alpha and beta diversity among the groups were noted. Group B microbiome exhibited an increased presence of Gram-negative bacteria. At the phylum level, Actinobacteriota was significantly more prevalent in Group C samples, while Bacteroidota was enriched in Group B samples. Family-level relative abundance analysis showed a notable increase in Saccharibacteria (formerly TM7) and Prevotellaceae in Group B. Genus-level analysis revealed a significant rise in Lautropia in Group AT. Fixed orthodontic appliances were linked to oral microbiome changes, notably an enhanced relative abundance of anaerobes, including periodontal pathogens.ConclusionThe observation points to the impact of orthodontic appliance on the oral microbial community, highlighting the difference between traditional braces (Group B) and clear aligners (Group AT)in terms of the predominance of anaerobic and gram negative bacteria. This emphasizes the importance of considering the microbiological effects when choosing orthodontic appliance and underscores the need for tailored oral hygiene practices for individuals undergoing these treatments. This research might provide insights that could assist in the development of innovative cleaning techniques and antibacterial materials.

## Vairimorpha (Nosema) ceranae can promote Serratia development in honeybee gut: an underrated threat for bees?

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The genus Serratia harbors opportunistic pathogenic species, among which Serratia marcescens is pathogenic for honeybees although little studied. Recently, virulent strains of S. marcescens colonizing the Varroa destructor mite’s mouth were found vectored into the honeybee body, leading to septicemia and death. Serratia also occurs as an opportunistic pathogen in the honeybee’s gut with a low absolute abundance. The Serratia population seems controlled by the host immune system, but its presence may represent a hidden threat, ready to arise when honeybees are weakened by biotic and abiotic stressors. To shed light on the Serratia pathogen, this research aims at studying Serratia’s development dynamics in the honeybee body and its interactions with the co-occurring fungal pathogen Vairimorpha ceranae. Firstly, the degree of pathogenicity and the ability to permeate the gut epithelial barrier of three Serratia strains, isolated from honeybees and belonging to different species (S. marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, and Serratia nematodiphila), were assessed by artificial inoculation of newborn honeybees with different Serratia doses (104, 106, and 108 cells/mL). The absolute abundance of Serratia in the gut and in the hemocoel was assessed in qPCR with primers targeting the luxS gene. Moreover, the absolute abundance of Serratia was assessed in the gut of honeybees infected with V. ceranae at different development stages and supplied with beneficial microorganisms and fumagillin. Our results showed that all tested Serratia strains could pass through the gut epithelial barrier and proliferate in the hemocoel, with S. marcescens being the most pathogenic. Moreover, under cage conditions, Serratia better proliferates when a V. ceranae infection is co-occurring, with a positive and significant correlation. Finally, fumagillin and some of the tested beneficial microorganisms could control both Serratia and Vairimorpha development. Our findings suggest a correlation between the two pathogens under laboratory conditions, a co-occurring infection that should be taken into consideration by researches when testing antimicrobial compounds active against V. ceranae, and the related honeybees survival rate. Moreover, our findings suggest a positive control of Serratia by the environmental microorganism Apilactobacillus kunkeei in a in vivo model, confirming the potential of this specie as beneficial bacteria for honeybees.

## Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 and CSP antigen diversity in parasite isolates from southern Ghana

date: 2024-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDiversity in malarial antigens is an immune evasion mechanism that gives malaria parasites an edge over the host. Immune responses against one variant of a polymorphic antigen are usually not fully effective against other variants due to altered epitopes. This study aimed to evaluate diversity in the Plasmodium falciparum antigens apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) from circulating parasites in a malaria-endemic community in southern Ghana and to determine the effects of polymorphisms on antibody response specificity.MethodsThe study involved 300 subjects, whose P. falciparum infection status was determined by microscopy and PCR. Diversity within the two antigens was evaluated by msp2 gene typing and molecular gene sequencing, while the host plasma levels of antibodies against PfAMA1, PfCSP, and two synthetic 24mer peptides from the conserved central repeat region of PfCSP, were measured by ELISA. ResultsOf the 300 subjects, 171 (57%) had P. falciparum infection, with 165 of the 171 (96.5%) being positive for either or both of the msp2 allelic families. Gene sequencing of DNA from 55 clonally infected samples identified a total of 56 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the Pfama1 gene and these resulted in 44 polymorphic positions, including two novel positions (363 and 365). Sequencing of the Pfcsp gene from 69 clonal DNA samples identified 50 non-synonymous SNPs that resulted in 42 polymorphic positions, with half (21) of these polymorphic positions being novel. Of the measured antibodies, only anti-PfCSP antibodies varied considerably between PCR parasite-positive and parasite-negative persons. DiscussionThese data confirm the presence of a considerable amount of unique, previously unreported amino acid changes, especially within PfCSP. Drivers for this diversity in the Pfcsp gene do not immediately seem apparent, as immune pressure will be expected to drive a similar level of diversity in the Pfama1 gene.
