## Fungi-Kcr: a language model for predicting lysine crotonylation in pathogenic fungal proteins

date: 2025-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionLysine crotonylation (Kcr) is an important post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins, playing a key role in regulating various biological processes in pathogenic fungi. However, the experimental identification of Kcr sites remains challenging due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of mass spectrometry-based techniques.MethodsTo address this limitation, we developed Fungi-Kcr, a deep learning-based model designed to predict Kcr modification sites in fungal proteins. The model integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), and word embedding to effectively capture both local and long-range sequence dependencies.ResultsComprehensive evaluations, including ten-fold cross-validation and independent testing, demonstrate that Fungi-Kcr achieves superior predictive performance compared to conventional machine learning models. Moreover, our results indicate that a general predictive model performs better than species-specific models. DiscussionThe proposed model provides a valuable computational tool for the large-scale identification of Kcr sites, contributing to a deeper understanding of fungal pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. The source code and dataset for Fungi-Kcr are available at https://github.com/zayra77/Fungi-Kcr.

## Schmallenberg virus epidemiology and regional control strategies: diagnostics, vaccines, and vector management

date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an emerging orthobunyavirus transmitted by Culicoides midges. It poses a serious global health threat to ruminants, especially during pregnancy, causing abortion, stillbirths, and congenital malformations. Since its first outbreak in 2011, SBV has spread across Europe and other regions. Its transmission has expanded due to global climate change and increased animal trade, resulting in recurrent outbreaks in endemic regions and a growing risk of introduction into non-endemic areas. This situation highlights the urgent need for improved control strategies. This review summarizes the pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics of SBV and provides an overview of recent advancements in diagnostic approaches, vaccine development, and vector control. Diagnostic approaches, such as serological assays and nucleic acid-based tests, have become the primary tools for SBV detection. However, their applicability in clinical settings still requires further optimization. In terms of vaccine development, existing inactivated vaccines have limitations, including the inability to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals. This has driven the development of next-generation vaccines, such as recombinant protein, viral vector, and mRNA-based platforms. For vector control, integrated approaches combining chemical, ecological, and biological strategies have been proposed to interrupt the transmission of the virus by Culicoides midges. Additionally, this review emphasizes the necessity of region-specific control strategies tailored to the differing epidemiological contexts. In endemic regions, comprehensive measures, including pathogen surveillance, vaccination programs, and Culicoides control, are critical. In non-endemic regions, the focus should be on enhancing border biosecurity, monitoring international trade, and establishing early warning systems. These strategies not only provide a scientific foundation for SBV control but also offer practical guidance for managing the spread of similar vector-borne viruses globally.

## Epidemiological, clinical, and molecular analysis of human adenovirus infections in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Tianjin, China

date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHuman Adenovirus (HAdV) is a significant pathogen for acute respiratory infections(ARIs) in children. However, its epidemiological patterns, serotype distribution changes, and molecular mechanisms associated with severe pneumonia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic require further elucidation through large-scale and molecular typing studies.MethodsThis study used a retrospective cohort design to analyze 28060 respiratory specimens from Tianjin Children’s Hospital from March 2022 to March 2024. HAdV detection and typing were performed through targeted high-throughput sequencing and PCR-based amplification of Penton, Hexon, and Fiber genes for phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, clinical data were compared to assess differences in clinical presentations among pediatric patients infected with different HAdV types.ResultsThe overall HAdV detection rate was 8.9% (2,484/28,060), with significant male predominance (9.2% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.019) and age-specific susceptibility peaking in school-aged children (10.4%, P < 0.001). Seasonal patterns demonstrated winter predominance (15.9%), contrasting with other seasons (P < 0.001). Genotyping of 1,914 positive specimens demonstrated HAdV-3 dominance (53.4%, 1,022), followed by HAdV-7 (17.7%, 338), HAdV-2 (8.4%, 160), HAdV-1 (7.9%, 152), and HAdV-21 (6.4%, 122). The diagnosis mainly included pneumonia, bronchitis, adenopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Genotype-clinical correlations showed distinct patterns: HAdV-3 (55.6%) and HAdV-7 (20.9%) predominated in pneumonia cases, with HAdV-7 linked to severe pneumonia (P<0.001). HAdV-3 (40.6%) and HAdV-2 (16.7%) were more common in adenopharyngitis, while HAdV-3 and HAdV-21 were more common in bronchitis (51.2% and 11.1%) and URTIs (31.9% and 19.1%). Molecular characterization revealed structural conservation in the Penton protein of HAdV-C and identified Hexon as the most polymorphic region with 85 variable sites, indicating divergent evolutionary pressures across viral domains.ConclusionHAdV-3, HAdV-7, HAdV-2, and HAdV-1 were the predominant HAdV types in children hospitalized with ARIs in Tianjin. Moreover, not only the epidemiological characteristics of different HAdV types vary, but there are also certain differences in the clinical symptoms and outcomes of children infected with different types of HAdV. Therefore, it is essential to differentiate HAdV types for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management purposes.

## Pathogenic characterization of Phialophora submersa, a new black yeast isolated from freshwater sediments in Spain

date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Phialophora submersa is a recently described black yeast species (Chaetothyriales), isolated from freshwater sediments in Catalonia (Spain). It is closely related to P. americana and P. verrucosa, two opportunistic pathogens known to cause subcutaneous infections in humans and animals. This study investigates the pathogenic potential of P. submersa, its in vitro susceptibility to clinically relevant antifungal agents, and its response to various cellular stressors. Using a murine macrophage (J774A.1) infection model, we evaluated phagocytosis, intracellular survival, cell damage, and the expression of six immune-related genes (TNF-α, CCL20, RELA, TP53, NLRP3, IL-1β), in comparison with P. americana and P. verrucosa. The results showed that P. submersa induced higher phagocytosis rates in murine macrophages than the P. verrucosa, although lower than P. americana. Cell damage, intracellular survival, and expression of the immune-related genes were higher after macrophage infection with P. verrucosa than with P. submersa and P. americana, which exhibited comparable profiles. All three species displayed similar antifungal susceptibility profiles, being susceptible to most azoles (except fluconazole), terbinafine, and echinocandins (with reduced efficacy against P. verrucosa), but showed moderate resistance to flucytosine, amphotericin B, and olorofim. The resistance of P. submersa to stress was strain-dependent, with only one strain exhibiting notable resistance to multiple stressors. This research provides new insights into the biology of P. submersa, including its potential as a human pathogen, and the molecular factors that could drive an infection process.

## Antibacterial, antifungal, and antibiofilm activities of biogenic zinc nanoparticles against pathogenic microorganisms

date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe increasing resistance to antimicrobial drugs has prompted global efforts to combat pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The World Health Organization’s recent report underscores the urgent need for innovative antimicrobial strategies to address infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. This study presents a comparative evaluation of the effects of biogenically synthesized zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, highlighting their effectiveness against both planktonic and sessile forms of these tested pathogens.MethodsThe antimicrobial effects were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, broth microdilution, and time-kill assays. Biofilm formation and eradication were evaluated through crystal violet staining, resazurin assays, and colony-forming unit quantification. Additionally, the oxidative and nitrosative stress toxicity mechanisms triggered by ZnNPs, particularly those related to cellular stress, were investigated.ResultsThe results demonstrated that ZnNPs exhibit concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. ZnNPs inhibit biofilm formation by up to 50% in E. coli and yeast species, and up to 80% in S. aureus.DiscussionThese antibiofilm activities were attributed to disruptions in cellular stress metabolism, primarily driven by nitrosative stress through enhanced production of reactive nitrogen intermediates. ZnNPs synthesized through green methods offer significant advantages due to their biocompatibility and potential biomedical applications. These findings advance our understanding of ZnNPs in combating biofilm-associated infections, offering promising strategies to address pathogenic bacteria and fungi, which pose a critical threat to global health.
