## Pleiotropic roles of LAMMER kinase, Lkh1 in stress responses and virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans

date: 2024-05-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Dual-specificity LAMMER kinases are highly evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and play pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes, such as growth, differentiation, and stress responses. Although the functions of LAMMER kinase in fungal pathogens in pathogenicity and stress responses have been characterized, its role in Cryptococcus neoformans, a human fungal pathogen and a model yeast of basidiomycetes, remains elusive. In this study, we identified a LKH1 homologous gene and constructed a strain with a deleted LKH1 and a complemented strain. Similar to other fungi, the lkh1Δ mutant showed intrinsic growth defects. We observed that C. neoformans Lkh1 was involved in diverse stress responses, including oxidative stress and cell wall stress. Particularly, Lkh1 regulates DNA damage responses in Rad53-dependent and -independent manners. Furthermore, the absence of LKH1 reduced basidiospore formation. Our observations indicate that Lkh1 becomes hyperphosphorylated upon treatment with rapamycin, a TOR protein inhibitor. Notably, LKH1 deletion led to defects in melanin synthesis and capsule formation. Furthermore, we found that the deletion of LKH1 led to the avirulence of C. neoformans in a systemic cryptococcosis murine model. Taken together, Lkh1 is required for the stress response, sexual differentiation, and virulence of C. neoformans.

## FAIR compliant database development for human microbiome data samples

date: 2024-05-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSharing microbiome data among researchers fosters new innovations and reduces cost for research. Practically, this means that the (meta)data will have to be standardized, transparent and readily available for researchers. The microbiome data and associated metadata will then be described with regards to composition and origin, in order to maximize the possibilities for application in various contexts of research. Here, we propose a set of tools and protocols to develop a real-time FAIR (Findable. Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) compliant database for the handling and storage of human microbiome and host-associated data.MethodsThe conflicts arising from privacy laws with respect to metadata, possible human genome sequences in the metagenome shotgun data and FAIR implementations are discussed. Alternate pathways for achieving compliance in such conflicts are analyzed. Sample traceable and sensitive microbiome data, such as DNA sequences or geolocalized metadata are identified, and the role of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) data regulations are considered. For the construction of the database, procedures have been realized to make data FAIR compliant, while preserving privacy of the participants providing the data.Results and discussionAn open-source development platform, Supabase, was used to implement the microbiome database. Researchers can deploy this real-time database to access, upload, download and interact with human microbiome data in a FAIR complaint manner. In addition, a large language model (LLM) powered by ChatGPT is developed and deployed to enable knowledge dissemination and non-expert usage of the database.

## An altered gut microbiome in pre-eclampsia: cause or consequence

date: 2024-05-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, are a leading cause of serious and debilitating complications that affect both the mother and the fetus. Despite the occurrence and the health implications of these disorders there is still relatively limited evidence on the molecular underpinnings of the pathophysiology. An area that has come to the fore with regard to its influence on health and disease is the microbiome. While there are several microbiome niches on and within the body, the distal end of the gut harbors the largest of these impacting on many different systems of the body including the central nervous system, the immune system, and the reproductive system. While the role of the microbiome in hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia, has not been fully elucidated some studies have indicated that several of the symptoms of these disorders are linked to an altered gut microbiome. In this review, we examine both pre-eclampsia and microbiome literature to summarize the current knowledge on whether the microbiome drives the symptoms of pre-eclampsia or if the aberrant microbiome is a consequence of this condition. Despite the paucity of studies, obvious gut microbiome changes have been noted in women with pre-eclampsia and the individual symptoms associated with the condition. Yet further research is required to fully elucidate the role of the microbiome and the significance it plays in the development of the symptoms. Regardless of this, the literature highlights the potential for a microbiome targeted intervention such as dietary changes or prebiotic and probiotics to reduce the impact of some aspects of these disorders.

## The footprint of gut microbiota in gallbladder cancer: a mechanistic review

date: 2024-05-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary system with the worst prognosis. Even after radical surgery, the majority of patients with GBC have difficulty achieving a clinical cure. The risk of tumor recurrence remains more than 65%, and the overall 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. The gut microbiota refers to a variety of microorganisms living in the human intestine, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, which profoundly affect the host state of general health, disease and even cancer. Over the past few decades, substantial evidence has supported that gut microbiota plays a critical role in promoting the progression of GBC. In this review, we summarize the functions, molecular mechanisms and recent advances of the intestinal microbiota in GBC. We focus on the driving role of bacteria in pivotal pathways, such as virulence factors, metabolites derived from intestinal bacteria, chronic inflammatory responses and ecological niche remodeling. Additionally, we emphasize the high level of correlation between viruses and fungi, especially EBV and Candida spp., with GBC. In general, this review not only provides a solid theoretical basis for the close relationship between gut microbiota and GBC but also highlights more potential research directions for further research in the future.

## Untargeted metabolomics in gastric and colorectal cancer patients – preliminary results

date: 2024-05-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionRecent years, microbiota-associated aspects have been analysed in multiple disorders regarding cancers. Existing evidence pints that gut microorganisms might take part in tumour origin and therapy efficacy. Nevertheless, to date, data on faecal metabolomics in cancer patients is still strongly limited. Therefore, we aimed to analyse gut untargeted metabolome in gastrointestinal cancer patients (i.e., gastric and colorectal cancer).Patients and methodsThere were 12 patients with either gastric (n=4) or colorectal cancer (n=8) enrolled and 8 analysed (n=4 each). Stool samples were collected prior to anti-cancer treatments. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted by means of mass spectrometry.ResultsA plethora of metabolites in cancer patients we analysed were noted, with higher homogenity in case of gastric cancer patients. We found that the level of Deoxyguanosine,m/z 266.091,[M-H]-, Uridine,m/z 245.075,[M+H]+, Deoxyguanosine,m/z 268.104,[M]+, 3-Indoleacetic acid,m/z 176.07,[M+H]+, Indoxyl,m/z 132.031,[M-H]-, L-Phenylalanine,m/z 164.073,[M-H]-, L-Methionine,m/z 150.058,[M+NH4]+, was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients and Ethyl hydrogen malonate,m/z 133.031,[M+H]+ in gastric cancer.ConclusionThe overall insights into untargeted metabolomics showed that most often higher levels of analysed metabolites were detected in colorectal cancer patients compared to gastric cancer patients. The link between gut metabolome and both local and distal metastasis might exist, however it requires confirmation in further multi-centre studies regarding larger sample size.

## The diagnostic value of metagenomics next-generation sequencing in HIV-infected patients with suspected pulmonary infections

date: 2024-05-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTraditional microbiological detection methods used to detect pulmonary infections in people living with HIV (PLHIV) are usually time-consuming and have low sensitivity, leading to delayed treatment. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for microbial diagnosis of suspected pulmonary infections in PLHIV.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed PLHIV who were hospitalized due to suspected pulmonary infections at the sixth people hospital of Zhengzhou from November 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of PLHIV were collected and subjected to routine microbiological examination and mNGS detection. The diagnostic performance of the two methods was compared to evaluate the diagnostic value of mNGS for unknown pathogens.ResultsThis study included a total of 36 PLHIV with suspected pulmonary infections, of which 31 were male. The reporting period of mNGS is significantly shorter than that of CMTs. The mNGS positive rate of BALF samples in PLHIV was 83.33%, which was significantly higher than that of smear and culture (44.4%, P<0.001). In addition, 11 patients showed consistent results between the two methods. Futhermore, mNGS showed excellent performance in identifying multi-infections in PLHIV, and 27 pathogens were detected in the BALF of 30 PLHIV by mNGS, among which 15 PLHIV were found to have multiple microbial infections (at least 3 pathogens). Pneumocystis jirovecii, human herpesvirus type 5, and human herpesvirus type 4 were the most common pathogen types.ConclusionsFor PLHIV with suspected pulmonary infections, mNGS is capable of rapidly and accurately identifying the pathogen causing the pulmonary infection, which contributes to implement timely and accurate anti-infective treatment.
