## Causal associations between human gut microbiota and osteomyelitis: a Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent studies have emphasized the role of gut microbiota in the onset and progression of osteomyelitis. However, the exact types of gut microbiota and their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of theoretical support for treatments that improve osteomyelitis by altering the gut microbiota.MethodsIn our study, we utilized the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to date from the MiBioGen consortium, involving 13,400 participants. The GWAS data for osteomyelitis were sourced from the UK Biobank, which included 4,836 osteomyelitis cases and 486,484 controls. We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization framework for a detailed investigation into the causal relationship between gut microbiota and osteomyelitis. Our methods included inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode approaches. Additionally, we applied Cochran’s Q statistic to assess the heterogeneity of the instrumental variable.ResultsAt the class level, Bacilli and Bacteroidia were positively correlated with the risk of osteomyelitis. At the order level, only Bacteroidales showed a positive association with osteomyelitis. At the genus level, an increased abundance of Butyricimonas, Coprococcus3, and Tyzzerella3 was positively associated with the risk of osteomyelitis, whereas Lachnospira was negatively associated. Sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy.ConclusionThis study reveals that classes Bacilli and Bacteroidia, order Bacteroidales, and genera Butyricimonas, Coprococcus3, and Tyzzerella3 are implicated in increasing the risk of osteomyelitis, while the genus Lachnospira is associated with a reduced risk. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which these specific bacterial groups influence the pathophysiology of osteomyelitis

## Endometrial microbiota alteration in female patients with endometrial polyps based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe potential role of the endometrial microbiota in the pathogenesis of endometrial polyps (EPs) warrants further investigation, given the current landscape of limited and inconclusive research findings. We aimed to explore the microecological characteristics of the uterine cavity in patients with EPs and investigate the potential of endometrial microbiota species as novel biomarkers for identifying EPs.MethodsEndometrial samples were collected from 225 patients who underwent hysteroscopies, of whom 167 had EPs, whereas 58 had non- hyperproliferative endometrium status. The endometrial microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We characterized the endometrial microbiota and identified microbial biomarkers for predicting EPs.ResultsThe endometrial microbial diversity and composition were significantly different between the EP and control groups. Predictive functional analyses of the endometrial microbiota demonstrated significant alterations in pathways involved in sphingolipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and apoptosis between the two groups. Moreover, a classification model based on endometrial microbial ASV-based biomarkers along with the presence of abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms achieved powerful classification potential in identifying EPs in both the discovery and validation cohorts.ConclusionOur study indicates a potential association between altered endometrial microbiota and EPs. Endometrial microbiota-based biomarkers may prove valuable for the diagnosis of EPs.Clinical trial registrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100052746).

## Beyond pathogens: the intriguing genetic legacy of endogenous retroviruses in host physiology

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The notion that viruses played a crucial role in the evolution of life is not a new concept. However, more recent insights suggest that this perception might be even more expansive, highlighting the ongoing impact of viruses on host evolution. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are considered genomic remnants of ancient viral infections acquired throughout vertebrate evolution. Their exogenous counterparts once infected the host’s germline cells, eventually leading to the permanent endogenization of their respective proviruses. The success of ERV colonization is evident so that it constitutes 8% of the human genome. Emerging genomic studies indicate that endogenous retroviruses are not merely remnants of past infections but rather play a corollary role, despite not fully understood, in host genetic regulation. This review presents some evidence supporting the crucial role of endogenous retroviruses in regulating host genetics. We explore the involvement of human ERVs (HERVs) in key physiological processes, from their precise and orchestrated activities during cellular differentiation and pluripotency to their contributions to aging and cellular senescence. Additionally, we discuss the costs associated with hosting a substantial amount of preserved viral genetic material.

## Molecular mechanisms of tigecycline-resistance among Enterobacterales

date: 2024-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The global emergence of antimicrobial resistance to multiple antibiotics has recently become a significant concern. Gram-negative bacteria, known for their ability to acquire mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, represent one of the most hazardous microorganisms. This phenomenon poses a serious threat to public health. Notably, the significance of tigecycline, a member of the antibiotic group glycylcyclines and derivative of tetracyclines has increased. Tigecycline is one of the last-resort antimicrobial drugs used to treat complicated infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria or even pan-drug-resistant (PDR) bacteria. The primary mechanisms of tigecycline resistance include efflux pumps’ overexpression, tet genes and outer membrane porins. Efflux pumps are crucial in conferring multi-drug resistance by expelling antibiotics (such as tigecycline by direct expelling) and decreasing their concentration to sub-toxic levels. This review discusses the problem of tigecycline resistance, and provides important information for understanding the existing molecular mechanisms of tigecycline resistance in Enterobacterales. The emergence and spread of pathogens resistant to last-resort therapeutic options stands as a major global healthcare concern, especially when microorganisms are already resistant to carbapenems and/or colistin.

## Deep mutational scanning of the RNase III-like domain in Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing protein KREPB4

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Kinetoplastid pathogens including Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania species, are early diverged, eukaryotic, unicellular parasites. Functional understanding of many proteins from these pathogens has been hampered by limited sequence homology to proteins from other model organisms. Here we describe the development of a high-throughput deep mutational scanning approach in T. brucei that facilitates rapid and unbiased assessment of the impacts of many possible amino acid substitutions within a protein on cell fitness, as measured by relative cell growth. The approach leverages several molecular technologies: cells with conditional expression of a wild-type gene of interest and constitutive expression of a library of mutant variants, degron-controlled stabilization of I-SceI meganuclease to mediate highly efficient transfection of a mutant allele library, and a high-throughput sequencing readout for cell growth upon conditional knockdown of wild-type gene expression and exclusive expression of mutant variants. Using this method, we queried the effects of amino acid substitutions in the apparently non-catalytic RNase III-like domain of KREPB4 (B4), which is an essential component of the RNA Editing Catalytic Complexes (RECCs) that carry out mitochondrial RNA editing in T. brucei. We measured the impacts of thousands of B4 variants on bloodstream form cell growth and validated the most deleterious variants containing single amino acid substitutions. Crucially, there was no correlation between phenotypes and amino acid conservation, demonstrating the greater power of this method over traditional sequence homology searching to identify functional residues. The bloodstream form cell growth phenotypes were combined with structural modeling, RECC protein proximity data, and analysis of selected substitutions in procyclic form T. brucei. These analyses revealed that the B4 RNaseIII-like domain is essential for maintenance of RECC integrity and RECC protein abundances and is also involved in changes in RECCs that occur between bloodstream and procyclic form life cycle stages.

## Research progress on the microbiota in bladder cancer tumors

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The microbiota, also referred to as the microbial community, is a crucial component of the human microenvironment. It is located predominantly in various organs, including the intestines, skin, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and reproductive tract. The microbiota maintains a symbiotic relationship with the human body, influencing physiological and pathological functions to a significant degree. There is increasing evidence linking the microbial flora to human cancers. In contrast to the traditional belief that the urethra and urine of normal individuals are sterile, recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology and bacterial cultivation methods have led to the discovery of specific microbial communities in the urethras of healthy individuals. Given the prevalence of bladder cancer (BCa) as a common malignancy of the urinary system, researchers have shifted their focus to exploring the connection between disease development and the unique microbial community within tumors. This shift has led to a deeper investigation into the role of microbiota in the onset, progression, metastasis, prognosis, and potential for early detection of BCa. This article reviews the existing research on the microbiota within BCa tumors and summarizes the findings regarding the roles of different microbes in various aspects of this disease.

## Isolation of mucosa-associated microbiota dysbiosis in the ascending colon in hepatitis C virus post-sustained virologic response cirrhotic patients

date: 2024-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAchieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) reduces all-cause mortality. However, the mechanisms and risk factors for liver fibrosis and portal hypertension post-SVR remain incompletely understood. In the gut-liver axis, mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) substantially influence immune and metabolic functions, displaying spatial heterogeneity at the anatomical intestinal site. We analyzed MAM composition and function to isolate the locoregional MAM involved in chronic liver disease progression in HCV post-SVR patients.MethodsWe collected MAM samples from three intestinal sites (terminal ileum, ascending colon, and sigmoid colon) via brushing during colonoscopy in 23 HCV post-SVR patients and 25 individuals without liver disease (controls). The 16S rRNA of bacterial DNA in specimens collected with a brush and in feces was sequenced. The molecular expression of intestinal tissues and hepatic tissues were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsIn the post-SVR group, the microbial β-diversity of MAM, especially in the ascending colon, differed from the control group and was associated with liver fibrosis progression. In PICRUSt analysis, MAM in the ascending colon in the liver cirrhosis (LC) group showed compromised functions associated with the intestinal barrier and bile acid production, and FGF19 expression was markedly decreased in the terminal ileum biopsy tissue in the LC group. At the genus level, six short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial genera, Blautia, Alistipes, Roseburia, Agathobaculum, Dorea, and Pseudoflavonifractor were reduced in the ascending colon of post-SVR LC patients.ConclusionIn patients of HCV post-SVR, we identified the association between the degree of liver fibrosis and dysbiosis of mucosa-associated SCFA-producing bacterial genera that may be related to intestinal barrier and bile acid production in the ascending colon.
