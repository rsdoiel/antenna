## Clinical value of heparin-binding protein in adult bacterial intracranial infection

date: 2024-11-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe accurate and sensitive diagnosis of intracranial infection continues to pose a critical challenge. This study aimed to probe into the clinical value of heparin binding protein (HBP) in bacterial intracranial infection.MethodsPatients suspected of having bacterial intracranial infection and admitted to Shanghai General Hospital from November 2021 to November 2023 were selected as study subjects and divided into an infected group and a non-infected group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of HBP, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as their value in differentiating Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacterial infections.ResultsAccording to the results of bacterial identification, the infected groups were divided into a Gram-negative bacteria group (n = 142) and a Gram-positive bacteria group (n = 128), while the non-infected group comprised 120 patients after neurosurgery involving dura opening. Statistically significant differences were observed in the levels of HBP, PCT, and CRP between the infected group and the non-infected group (all p< 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of HBP was 0.935, and the AUCs of PCT and CRP were 0.931 and 0.863, respectively. In the comparison of HBP, PCT, and CRP levels in the Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria groups, the AUCs were 0.816, 0.602, and 0.591, respectively. When the cutoff value of HBP was 72.34 ng/mL, its specificity reached 96.1% and its sensitivity was 57.8%. When PCT and CRP levels were less than 1.67 ng/mL and 23.12 ng/mL, respectively, both the sensitivity (52.3%, 53.1%) and specificity (66.9%, 59.9%) were relatively low.ConclusionHBP, PCT, and CRP can be employed as diagnostic indicators for bacterial intracranial infection. HBP (>72.34 ng/mL) can act as an important index for the diagnosis of Gram-negative bacteria in patients with intracranial infection.

## Multiple cross displacement amplification-based lateral flow biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of Helicobacter pylori

date: 2024-11-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori, HP), recognized globally as one of the most widespread bacteria, serves as primary etiological agent for numerous gastroduodenal diseases, highlighting the urgent need to develop rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for H. pylori infection. Here, we devised a new diagnostic test that merged multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) with nanoparticle‐based lateral flow biosensor (LFB), termed HP‐MCDA‐LFB, to facilitate the rapid and sensitive detection of H. pylori. The whole detection workflow, which includes stages such as DNA template extraction (~15 min), MCDA pre-amplification (~40 min), and result readout (~2 min), was efficiently completed within 1 h. After optimization, the HP-MCDA-LFB assay demonstrated remarkable sensitivity in detecting H. pylori, with a detection threshold as low as 60 fg of genomic DNA (~56 copies) per microliter. Furthermore, the HP-MCDA-LFB assay also achieved a perfect specificity rate of 100%, exhibiting no cross-reactivity with non-Helicobacter isolates. Particularly, the clinical feasibility of HP-MCDA-LFB assay was validated using 40 antral mucosa samples, among which 17 tested positive for H. pylori, which was in complete agreement with the results obtained from the rapid urease test. In conclusion, the HP‐MCDA‐LFB method developed in this study is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for diagnosing H. pylori infection, indicating great potential for H. pylori eradication therapy.

## Deciphering the pathogen heterogeneity for precise diagnosis and personalized therapeutics of infections after kidney transplantation: insights from metagenomic next-generation sequencing

date: 2024-11-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe aim of this study was to compare the detection performance of mNGS against that of conventional tests (CT) in patients suffering from infection after kidney transplantation.MethodsA total of 138 samples from 85 kidney transplant patients with acute or chronic infections were simultaneously analyzed using mNGS and CT from July 2021 to August 2023.ResultsCompared with CT, mNGS demonstrated a higher sensitivity (95.96% vs. 27.27%) but lower specificity (48.72% vs. 84.62%) in pathogen detection. Moreover, mNGS exhibited significant advantages in detecting mixed and rare infections. The pathogens commonly identified in kidney transplant patients were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), followed by Pneumocystis jirovecii and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). mNGS guided the precise clinical diagnosis in 89.13% of cases and assisted in altering therapeutics from empirical antibiotic approaches to personalized plans in 56.10% of cases, including treatment escalation (40.65%), initiation (11.38%), drug adjustment (3.25%), and de-escalation (0.81%).DiscussionOur study demonstrated the superior detection performance of mNGS and its significant clinical value.  This reflected the great potential of mNGS as a complementary clinical detection technology for kidney transplant patients.

## Unveiling the hidden arsenal: new insights into Proteus mirabilis virulence in UTIs

date: 2024-11-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in urinary tract infections (UTIs) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). The pathogenic mechanisms of Proteus mirabilis are complex and diverse, involving various virulence factors, including fimbriae, flagella, urease, polyphosphate kinase, lipopolysaccharides, cyclic AMP receptor protein, Sigma factor RpoE, and RNA chaperone protein Hfq. These factors play crucial roles in bacterial colonization, invasion, evasion of host immune responses, biofilm formation, and urinary stone formation. This paper is the first to comprehensively describe the hydrogenase system, autotransporter proteins, molybdate-binding protein ModA, and two-component systems as virulence factors in Proteus mirabilis, providing new insights into its pathogenic mechanisms in urinary tract infections. This review explores the mechanisms of biofilm formation by Proteus mirabilis and the various virulence factors involved in UTIs, revealing many newly discovered virulence factors from recent studies. These findings may offer new targets for clinical treatment of UTIs and vaccine development, highlighting the importance of understanding these virulence factors.

## Salmonella Typhi Haplotype 58 biofilm formation and genetic variation in isolates from typhoid fever patients with gallstones in an endemic setting in Kenya

date: 2024-11-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Although typhoid fever has largely been eliminated in high-income countries, it remains a major global public health concern especially among low- and middle-income countries. The causative agent, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is a human restricted pathogen with a limited capacity to replicate outside the human host. Human carriers, 90% of whom have gallstones in their gallbladder, continue to shed the pathogen for an ill-defined period of time after treatment. The genetic mechanisms involved in establishing the carrier state are poorly understood, but S. Typhi is thought to undergo specific genetic changes within the gallbladder as an adaptive mechanism. In the current study, we aimed to identify the genetic differences in longitudinal clinical S. Typhi isolates from asymptomatic carriers with gallstones in a typhoid endemic setting in Nairobi, Kenya. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed from 22 S. Typhi isolates, 20 from stool samples, and 2 from blood samples, all genotype 4.3.1 (H58). Out of this, 19 strains were from four patients also diagnosed with gallstones, of whom three had typhoid symptoms and continued to shed S. Typhi after treatment. All isolates had point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), and only sub-lineage 4.3.1.2.EA3 encoded multidrug resistance genes. There was no variation in antimicrobial resistance patterns among strains from the same patient/household. Non-multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates formed significantly stronger biofilms in vitro than the MDR isolates, p<0.001. A point mutation within the treB gene (treB A383T) was observed in strains isolated after clinical resolution from patients living in 75% of the households. For missense mutations in Vi capsular polysaccharide genes, tviE P263S was also observed in 18% of the isolates. This study provides insights into the role of typhoid carriage, biofilm formation, AMR genes, and genetic variations in S. Typhi during asymptomatic carriage.

## Saliva NIR spectroscopy and Aquaphotomics: a novel diagnostic approach to Paratuberculosis in dairy cattle

date: 2024-11-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionParatuberculosis is a granulomatous intestinal infection that affects ruminant animals worldwide. The disease is often detected when most animals are already infected due to the long incubation period and the high transmissibility of the infectious agent. The lack of a comprehensive method to diagnose Paratuberculosis is a global challenge. Therefore, a non-destructive, fast, and cost-effective diagnostic method for early detection of Paratuberculosis is crucial.MethodsNear-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Aquaphotomics have the potential to diagnose the disease by detecting changes in biological fluids. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of NIRS and Aquaphotomics for Paratuberculosis in dairy cattle by monitoring and data mining of saliva. The diagnostic models were developed according to saliva spectra of dairy cattle in the NIR range and 12 water absorbance bands from 100 to 200 days after calving in two groups: positive and negative, based on the same results of seven ELISA tests of blood plasma, as a reference test.ResultsBoth NIRS and Aquaphotomics methods had high diagnostic accuracy. Using QDA and SVM models, 99% total accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 100% specificity were achieved in internal validation. The total accuracy in external validation was 90%. This study presents two novel approaches to diagnosing Paratuberculosis in dairy cattle using saliva.DiscussionThe study found that changes in water absorbance spectral patterns of saliva caused by complex physiological changes, such as the amount of antibody related to Paratuberculosis in dairy cattle as biomarkers, are crucial in detecting Paratuberculosis using NIRS and Aquaphotomics.

## Pathogenicity and identification of host adaptation genes of the avian pathogenic Escherichia coli O145 in duck

date: 2024-11-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAvian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is a critical bacterial pathogen that causes severe infections in poultry. Diverse serotypes increase the complexity of treatment and controlling APEC infections. Recent epidemiological investigations indicate O145 is emerging as a predominant serogroup of APEC in China. However, limited information is known about this newly emerged serogroup.MethodsA virulent strain, NC22, was selected to elucidate the mechanisms underlying APEC O145-related pathogenicity and host adaptation. Whole-genome sequencing and pathogenicity assays was conducted on this strain. We further performed a transcriptional analysis of the bacteria during the early colonization stage in the duck liver and compared them with those in liquid cultures in vitro.ResultsSubcutaneous inoculation of NC22 induced typical symptoms in ducks. The bacterial loads in the blood and various tissues peaked at 2 and 3 days post infection, respectively. The affected tissues included the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, bursa of Fabricius, duodenum, jejunum, and cecum. We then analyzed the transcriptome profiles of NC22 during growth in duck liver versus lysogeny broth and identified 87 genes with differential expression levels.These included key metabolic enzymes and recognized host adaptation factors. Analysis of the metabolic pathways revealed an inhibition of the metabolic shift from glycolysis towards pentose phosphate pathway and an interference of the citrate cycle. Moreover, significantly differentially expressed small regulatory RNAs were examined, such as SroC, CsrC, and GadY.DiscussionThese findings enhance our understanding of the pathogenicity of APEC O145 and the molecular mechanisms underlying APEC-related pathogen−host interactions.

## The mammalian Ire1 inhibitor, 4µ8C, exhibits broad anti-Aspergillus activity in vitro and in a treatment model of fungal keratitis

date: 2024-11-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe fungal unfolded protein response consists of a two-component relay in which the ER-bound sensor, IreA, splices and activates the mRNA of the transcription factor, HacA. Previously, we demonstrated that hacA is essential for Aspergillus fumigatus virulence in a murine model of fungal keratitis (FK), suggesting the pathway could serve as a therapeutic target. Here we investigate the antifungal properties of known inhibitors of the mammalian Ire1 protein both in vitro and in a treatment model of FK.MethodsThe antifungal activity of Ire1 inhibitors was tested against conidia of several A. fumigatus isolates by a broth microdilution assay and against fungal biofilm by XTT reduction. The influence of 4μ8C on hacA mRNA splicing in A. fumigatus was assessed through gel electrophoresis and qRT-PCR of UPR regulatory genes. The toxicity and antifungal profile of 4μ8C in the cornea was assessed by applying drops to uninfected or A. fumigatus-infected corneas 3 times daily starting 4 hours post-inoculation. Corneas were evaluated daily through slit-lamp imaging and optical coherence tomography, or at endpoint through histology or fungal burden quantification via colony forming units.ResultsAmong six Ire1 inhibitors screened, the endonuclease inhibitor 4μ8C displayed the strongest antifungal profile with an apparent fungicidal action. The compound both blocked conidial germination and hyphal metabolism of A. fumigatus Af293 in the same concentration range that blocked hacA splicing and UPR gene induction (60-120 µM). Topical treatment of sham-inoculated corneas with 0.5 and 2.5 mM 4μ8C did not impact corneal clarity, but did transiently inhibit epithelialization of corneal ulcers. Relative to vehicle-treated Af293-infected corneas, treatment with 0.5 and 2.5 mM drug resulted in a 50% and >90% reduction in fungal load, respectively, the latter of which corresponded to an absence of clinical signs of infection or corneal pathology.ConclusionThe in vitro data suggest that 4μ8C displays antifungal activity against A. fumigatus through the specific inhibition of IreA. Topical application of the compound to the murine cornea can furthermore block the establishment of infection, suggesting this class of drugs can be developed as novel antifungals that improve visual outcomes in FK patients.

## Genomic characterization of a blaKPC-2–producing IncM2 plasmid harboring transposon ΔTn6296 in Klebsiella michiganensis

date: 2024-11-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Klebsiella michiganensis is an emerging hospital-acquired bacterial pathogen, particularly strains harboring plasmid-mediated carbapenemase genes. Here, we recovered and characterized a multidrug-resistant strain, blaKPC-2–producing Klebsiella michiganensis LS81, which was isolated from the abdominal drainage fluid of a clinical patient in China, and further characterized the co-harboring plasmid. K. michiganensis LS81 tested positive for the blaKPC-2 genes by PCR sequencing, with blaKPC-2 located on a plasmid as confirmed by S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis combined with Southern blotting. In the transconjugants, the blaKPC-2 genes were successfully transferred to the recipient strain E. coli EC600. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis confirmed that this strain belongs to sequence type 196 (ST196), with a complete genome comprising a 5,926,662bp circular chromosome and an 81,451bp IncM2 plasmid encoding blaKPC-2 (designated pLS81-KPC). The IncM2 plasmid carried multiple β-lactamase genes such as blaTEM-1B, blaCTX-M-3, and blaKPC-2 inserted in truncated Tn6296 with the distinctive core structure ISKpn27–blaKPC-2–ISKpn6. A comparison with 46 K. michiganensis genomes available in the NCBI database revealed that the closest phylogenetic relative of K. michiganensis LS81 is a clinical isolate from a wound swab in the United Kingdom. Ultimately, the pan-genomic analysis unveiled a substantial accessory genome within the strain, alongside significant genomic plasticity within the K. michiganensis species, emphasizing the necessity for continuous surveillance of this pathogen in clinical environments.

## Assessment of Babesia ovis pathogenicity in goats: implications for transmission dynamics and host resistant

date: 2024-11-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Babesia ovis, commonly associated with ovine babesiosis, poses a significant threat to sheep health, often resulting in severe clinical manifestations and high mortality rates. However, the impact of B. ovis on goats has remained uncertain, prompting us to investigate its pathogenicity in caprine hosts. Experimental infections using B. ovis-infected blood inoculation and infected tick infestation, were conducted on spleen-intact (n=5) and splenectomized (n=5) goats. The experimental infection was performed using fresh blood obtained from a B. ovis-infected splenectomized sheep. One spleen-intact sheep served as a control for the experimental infection with B. ovis-infected Rhipicephalus bursa ticks. While all experimentally infected sheep (#501, #575) displayed severe clinical symptoms and high parasitemia, goats exhibited resistance, showing no significant clinical manifestations or sustained parasitemia. Notably, B. ovis was detected in two spleen-intact goats via nested PCR, prompting further investigation into their role as reservoirs for tick-borne transmission. These goats were then infested with Babesia spp.-free R. bursa larvae (0.1 gr) and adults (50 females and 50 males) for transstadial and transovarial transmission experiments respectively. Results indicated that chronically B. ovis-infected spleen-intact goats are not significant sources for maintaining the tick-borne transmission cycle of the parasite. These findings highlight the differential susceptibility of goats to B. ovis infection compared to sheep and their limited role as reservoirs for parasite transmission. Understanding the role of goats in B. ovis transmission and their resistance mechanisms can inform effective control measures and reduce economic losses in affected regions. Further research into caprine babesiosis and host immunological responses is essential to fully elucidate their possible role as reservoirs of the parasite, and underlying mechanisms of host susceptibility and parasite pathogenesis.

## Advances in the study of oral microbiota and metabolism associated fatty liver disease: a systematic review

date: 2024-11-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe oral microbiota is the second largest microbiota in the human body and has a significant impact on human health. Recent evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the oral microbiota may be associated with the development of metabolism-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This review aimed to validate the relationship between oral microbial diversity and the development of MAFLD.MethodsA systematic evaluation was performed based on PRISMA guidelines. Three independent reviewers searched for relevant literature in several databases, including PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus, with a search date ranging from the establishment of the databases to June 2024.ResultsA total of 1278 publications were initially screened, including five cross-sectional studies, seven case-control studies, one cohort study, and one retrospective study. These studies included a total of 3335 patients with MAFLD, 254 patients with MASH, and 105 patients with liver cirrhosis. All 14 included studies concluded that there was a correlation or potential correlation between oral microbiota and MAFLD. Seven studies found that the composition of the oral microbiota in MAFLD patients differed from that of healthy controls, and specific oral bacteria may be associated with an increased incidence of MAFLD. At the phylum level, several studies found differences in the abundance of the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Clostridia compared to healthy controls. Additionally, a study on oral fungi found significant differences in the phyla Proteobacteria and in the genus Staphylococcus between patients with MAFLD and healthy controls. At the genus level, Porphyromonas was studied most frequently, with all 8 studies identifying infection with Porphyromonas as a significant risk factor for pathological progression in MAFLD. Furthermore, a dysbiosis in the ratio of Porphyromonas gingivalis./Porphyromonas anomalies may be an important marker of MAFLD progression.ConclusionThere is an important association between the diversity of oral microbiota composition and MAFLD. This finding suggests the importance of oral health assessment and monitoring for the prevention or intervention of MAFLD.

## Intestinal microbiome changes and mechanisms of maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundConstipation is a common symptom in maintenance hemodialysis patients and greatly affects the quality of survival of hemodialysis patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics are feasible treatments for functional constipation, but there is still a gap in the research on the characteristics of gut flora in patients with maintenance hemodialysis combined with constipation. The aim of this study is to clarify the characteristics of the intestinal flora and its changes in maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation.MethodsFecal samples were collected from 45 participants, containing 15 in the maintenance hemodialysis constipation group,15 in the maintenance hemodialysis non-constipation group and 15 in the healthy control group. These samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The feature of the intestinal microbiome of maintenance hemodialysis constipation group and the microbiome differences among the three groups were elucidated by species annotation analysis, α-diversity analysis, β-diversity analysis, species difference analysis, and predictive functional analysis.ResultsThe alpha diversity analysis indicated that maintenance hemodialysis constipation group was less diverse and homogeneous than maintenance hemodialysis non-constipation group and healthy control group. At the genus level, the top ten dominant genera in maintenance hemodialysis constipation group patients were Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia and UCG-002. Compared with non-constipation group, the Enterococcus, Rhizobiales_unclassified, Filomicrobium, Eggerthella, Allobaculum, Prevotella_7, Gordonibacter, Mitochondria_unclassified, Lachnoanaerobaculum were significantly higher in constipation group (p<0.05). Compared with non-constipation group, the Kineothrix, Rhodopirellula, Weissella were significantly lower in constipation group (p<0.05). The predictive functional analysis revealed that compared with non-constipation group, constipation group was significantly enriched in pathways associated with pyruate metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis.ConclusionsThis study describes for the first time the intestinal microbiome characteristics of maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation. The results of this study suggest that there is a difference in the intestinal flora between maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation and maintenance hemodialysis patients without constipation.

## Apigeninidin chloride disrupts Toxoplasma gondii Mitochondrial membrane potential and induce reactive oxygen species and metabolites production

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionApigeninidin chloride (APi) is a form of 3-deoxyanthrocyanidins (3-DAs) abundantly produced by the red Sorghum bicolor plant. It has been previously reported to be effective against Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) tachyzoites grown in vitro with less cytotoxic effect. However, its possible mechanism(s) of action has not been elucidated. Biochemically, we discovered that APi induced high reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria superoxide (MitoSOX) productions in tachyzoites, leading to mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption in vitro.MethodsTo confirm our biochemical results at the molecular level, we performed a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis on APi-treated parasites to assess any metabolite and lipid alterations often associated with high ROS/MitoSOX production in cells. ResultsNoteworthy is that we detected several important oxidative stress-induced metabolites such as hexanal, aldehydes, methyl undeo10-enoate, butadiynyl phenyl ketone, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (16-OH, 16:0), 2-hydroxytricosanoic acid (C23:0; O), 3-oxodecanosanoic acid (C22:1; O), 2-hydroxypropylsterate, and furan fatty acids F6 (19FU-FA). DiscussionThese metabolites are associated with lipid, protein, and nucleic acid disruptions. Using atovaquone (Atov) as a control, we observed that it disrupted intracellular tachyzoites’ mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS and MitoSOX production, and altered metabolite and lipid production similar to what was observed with our experimental compound APi. Overall, our results indicated that APi targets T. gondii tachyzoite growth through inducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually parasite death.

## A novel, rapid, ultrasensitive diagnosis platform for detecting Candida albicans using restriction endonuclease‐mediated real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCandida albicans (C. albicans, CA) is an essential invasive fungus in clinical diagnosis. Although several detection methods exist, none meet the need for early diagnosis. A rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool is crucial for effective prevention and control of C. albicans infections.MethodsThis study aimed to develop a new, rapid, and ultrasensitive diagnostic tool for C. albicans detection based on restriction endonuclease-mediated real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (ERT-LAMP-CA). The ERT-LAMP-CA technology combines LAMP amplification, restriction endonuclease cleavage, and real-time fluorescence detection in a single reaction tube, which can complete a diagnosis of C. albicans in a short time (approximately 1 h).ResultsHerein, we developed the primer sequences required for ERT-LAMP-CA based on the ITS2 gene of C. albicans and found that ERT-LAMP-CA limit of detection was approximately 500 ag/μL genomic DNA and can present negative results for non-C. albicans templates. We tested sputum samples from 64 patients with suspected C. albicans infections to validate ERT-LAMP-CA applicability in clinical sample testing and found that ERT-LAMP-CA was consistent with multiplex PCR-capillary electrophoresis.DiscussionIn conclusion, ERT-LAMP-CA is a rapid, accurate, and sensitive assay with excellent potential for clinical and basic laboratory diagnosis and an efficient screening strategy.

## Impact of endogenous viral elements on glioma clinical phenotypes by inducing OCT4 in the host

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionEndogenous viral elements (EVEs) are viral sequences integrated within the host genome that can influence gene regulation and tumor development. While EVEs have been implicated in cancer, their role in regulating key transcription factors in glioblastoma (GBM) remains underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between EVEs and the activation of OCT4, a critical transcription factor in GBM progression.MethodsWe utilized CancerHERVdb and HervD Atlas databases to identify potential interactions between EVEs and key genes involved in GBM. Data from 273 GBM patient samples in the TCGA database were analyzed to examine the correlation between OCT4 expression and mutations in glioma-related genes. Furthermore, glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) were assessed for the expression levels of OCT4 and SOX2, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed.ResultsOur analysis revealed that OCT4 is a pivotal gene activated by EVEs in GBM. OCT4 expression was significantly correlated with mutations in key glioma-associated genes. Higher OCT4 levels were associated with poorer patient prognosis, higher tumor grades, and older age. Additionally, GSCs exhibited elevated expression of both OCT4 and SOX2, with a positive correlation observed between these two genes in GBM patients.DiscussionThis study highlights the potential role of EVEs in driving GBM progression through the activation of OCT4. The findings emphasize the importance of OCT4 in GBM malignancy and suggest that targeting EVE-mediated pathways may provide new therapeutic approaches for GBM treatment.
