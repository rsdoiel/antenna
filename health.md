## Non-classical roles of bacterial siderophores in pathogenesis

date: 2024-09-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Within host environments, iron availability is limited, which instigates competition for this essential trace element. In response, bacteria produce siderophores, secondary metabolites that scavenge iron and deliver it to bacterial cells via specific receptors. This role in iron acquisition contributes significantly to bacterial pathogenesis, thereby designating siderophores as virulence factors. While prior research has primarily focused on unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying siderophore biosynthesis, uptake, and iron sequestration, recent investigations have unveiled additional non-iron chelating functions of siderophores. These emerging roles are being consistently shown to support bacterial pathogenesis. In this review, we present the current understanding of siderophores in various roles: acquiring non-iron metal ions, supporting tolerance to metal-induced and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stresses, mediating siderophore signalling, inducing ROS formation, and functioning in class IIb microcins. By integrating recent findings, this review aims to provide an overview of the diverse roles of siderophores in bacterial pathogenesis.

## The emerging roles of microbiome and short-chain fatty acids in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia

date: 2024-09-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects premature infants and leads to long-term pulmonary complications. The pathogenesis of BPD has not been fully elucidated yet. In recent years, the microbiome and its metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in the gut and lungs have been demonstrated to be involved in the development and progression of the disease. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the potential involvement of the microbiome and SCFAs, especially the latter, in the development and progression of BPD. First, we introduce the gut-lung axis, the production and functions of SCFAs, and the role of SCFAs in lung health and diseases. We then discuss the evidence supporting the involvement of the microbiome and SCFAs in BPD. Finally, we elaborate on the potential mechanisms of the microbiome and SCFAs in BPD, including immune modulation, epigenetic regulation, enhancement of barrier function, and modulation of surfactant production and the gut microbiome. This review could advance our understanding of the microbiome and SCFAs in the pathogenesis of BPD, which also helps identify new therapeutic targets and facilitate new drug development.

## Safety and immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (SYS6006) in minks, cats, blue foxes, and raccoon dogs

date: 2024-09-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Minks, cats, and some other species of carnivores are susceptible of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have a high risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. The development of animal vaccines can be an effective measure to protect animals against SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the potential risk of human infection. We previously developed a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine SYS6006 that has been proven to be an efficient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine widely used in humans. Here, we further evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of SYS6006 as an animal COVID-19 vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 susceptible animals or wild animals. SYS6006 was safe and immunogenic in mice and completely protected mice against mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. SYS6006 was able to induce neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Delta, and Omicron BA.2 strain on day 7 after prime immunization, and two doses of immunization could enhance the neutralizing antibody responses and produce long-lasting potent antibodies for more than 8 months in minks and cats, blue foxes, and raccoon dogs, while all immunized animals had no abnormal clinical signs during immunization. These results provided here warrant further development of this safe and efficacious mRNA vaccine platform against animal COVID-19.

## A CT-based radiomics predictive nomogram to identify pulmonary tuberculosis from community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter cohort study

date: 2024-09-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeTo develop a predictive nomogram based on computed tomography (CT) radiomics to distinguish pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).MethodsA total of 195 PTB patients and 163 CAP patients were enrolled from three hospitals. It is divided into a training cohort, a testing cohort and validation cohort. Clinical models were established by using significantly correlated clinical features. Radiomics features were screened by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. Radiomics scores (Radscore) were calculated from the formula of radiomics features. Clinical radiomics conjoint nomogram was established according to Radscore and clinical features, and the diagnostic performance of the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsTwo clinical features and 12 radiomic features were selected as optimal predictors for the establishment of clinical radiomics conjoint nomogram. The results showed that the predictive nomogram had an outstanding ability to discriminate between the two diseases, and the AUC of the training cohort was 0.947 (95% CI, 0.916-0.979), testing cohort was 0.888 (95% CI, 0.814-0.961) and that of the validation cohort was 0.850 (95% CI, 0.778-0.922). Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the nomogram has outstanding clinical value.ConclusionsThis study developed a clinical radiomics model that uses radiomics features to identify PTB from CAP. This model provides valuable guidance to clinicians in identifying PTB.

## Genetically predicted blood metabolites mediate relationships between gut microbiota and ovarian cancer: a Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-09-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background and purposeWhile there is evidence that gut microbiota (GM) and blood metabolites are associated with ovarian cancer (OC), the precise mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unclear. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate the causal connections between GM, blood metabolite biomarkers, and OC.MethodsIn this study, we leveraged summary data for GM (5,959 individuals with genotype-matched GM), blood metabolites (233 circulating metabolic traits with 136,016 participants), and OC (63,702 participants with 23,564 cases and 40,138 controls) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We performed MR analysis to explore the causal relationship between GM and OC. Further, we harnessed univariable MR (UVMR) analysis to evaluate the causal associations between GM and circulating metabolites. Finally, we employed a two-step approach based on multivariable MR (MVMR) to evaluate the total genetic prediction effect of metabolites mediating the GM on the risk of OC to discover a potential causal relationship.ResultsIn the MR analysis, 24 gut bacteria were causally associated with the pathogenesis of OC, including 10 gut bacteria (Dorea phocaeense, Succinivibrionaceae, Raoultella, Phascolarctobacterium sp003150755, Paenibacillus J, NK4A144, K10, UCG-010 sp003150215, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Planococcaceae) that were risk factors, and 14 gut bacteria (CAG-177 sp002438685, GCA-900066135 sp900066135, Enorma massiliensis, Odoribacter laneus, Ruminococcus E sp003521625, Streptococcus sanguinis, Turicibacter sp001543345, Bacillus velezensis, CAG-977, CyanobacteriaStaphylococcus A fleurettii, Caloranaerobacteraceae, RUG472 sp900319345, and CAG-269 sp001915995) that were protective factors. The UVMR analysis showed that these 24 positive gut bacteria were causally related to lipoproteins, lipids, and amino acids. According to the MVMR analysis, Enorma massiliensis could reduce the risk of OC by raising the total cholesterol to total lipids ratio in large low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesteryl esters to total lipids ratio in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). Turicibacter sp001543345, however, could reduce the risk of OC by lowering free cholesterol in small high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and increasing the ratios of saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids, total cholesterol to total lipids ratio in very small very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and cholesteryl esters to total lipids ratio in very small VLDL.ConclusionThe current MR study provides evidence that genetically predicted blood metabolites can mediate relationships between GM and OC.

## Investigation on the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance among the non-carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae

date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIn Malaysia, an increase in non-carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (NC-CRKP) has been observed over the years. Previously, four NC-CRKP with increased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in the presence of phenylalanine-arginine β-naphthylamide (PAβN) were identified. However, no contribution of the PAβN-inhibited efflux pump to carbapenem resistance was observed. All four NC-CRKP harboured non-carbapenemase β-lactamase, with two also exhibiting porin loss. In this study, we further investigated the genomic features and resistance mechanisms of these four isolates.MethodsAll four NC-CRKP were subjected to whole-genome sequencing, followed by comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses.ResultsMulti-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis divided the four NC-CRKP into different sequence types: ST392, ST45, ST14, and ST5947. Neither major nor rare carbapenemase genes were detected. Given the presence of non-carbapenemase β-lactamase in all isolates, we further investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance by identifying related chromosomal mutations. Deletion mutation was detected in the cation efflux system protein CusF. Insertion mutation was identified in the nickel/cobalt efflux protein RcnA. Missense mutation of ompK36 porin was detected in two isolates, while the loss of ompK36 porin was observed in another two isolates.ConclusionsThis study revealed that NC-CRKP may confer carbapenem resistance through a combination of non-carbapenemase β-lactamase and potential chromosomal mutations including missense mutation or loss of ompK36 porin and/or a frameshift missense mutation in efflux pump systems, such as cation efflux system protein CusF and nickel/cobalt efflux protein RcnA. Our findings highlighted the significance of implementing whole-genome sequencing into clinical practice to promote the surveillance of carbapenem resistance mechanisms among NC-CRKP.

## Precise location of three novel linear epitopes using the generated monoclonal antibodies against the Knob domain of FAdV-4 surface structural protein, fiber1

date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundFowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the main pathogen of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), which brings huge economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Fiber-1 protein plays an important role in viral infection and pathogenesis by binding directly to cellular receptors of FAdV-4. In particular, the knob domain of fiber-1 protein has been reported to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies and arouse protection against the lethal challenge of chickens with FAdV-4.MethodsThe fiber-1 knob (F1K) protein was expressed in a prokaryotic expression system and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against FAdV-4 were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with the purified F1K protein and screened using a series of immunoassays. Potential B cell epitopes on the knob domain of fiber-1 protein were mapped using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dot-blot. Precious location and crucial amino acids of the identified epitopes were determined using peptide array scanning, truncations and alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The epitopes were analyzed and visualized on the knob trimer of FAdV-4 fiber-1 protein using the PyMOL software.ResultsWater-soluble recombinant fiber-1 knob (F1K) protein was obtained with the assistance of chaperone. Four monoclonal antibodies (5C10, 6F8, 8D8, and 8E8) against FAdV-4 were generated and characterized using indirect ELISA, Western blot, dot-blot, and immunological fluorescence assay (IFA). The mAbs were demonstrated to be from different hybridoma cell lines based on the sequences of the variable regions. Meanwhile, three distinct novel linear B-cell epitopes (319SDVGYLGLPPH329, 328PHTRDNWYV336, and 407VTTGPIPFSYQ417) on the knob domain of fiber-1 protein were identified and the key amino acid residues in the epitopes were determined. Structural analysis showed that the two adjacent epitopes 319SDVGYLGLPPH329 and 328PHTRDNWYV336 were exposed on the surface of the fiber-1 knob trimer, whereas the epitope 407VTTGPIPFSYQ417 was located inside of the spatial structure.ConclusionThis was the first identification of B-cell epitopes on the knob domain of fiber-1 protein and these findings provided a sound basis for the development of subunit vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic methods to control FAdV infections.

## Probiotics in the management of radiation-induced oral mucositis

date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Oral mucositis is a common and debilitating oral complication in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, resulting in diminished quality of life and potential treatment disruptions. Oral microbiota has long been recognized as a contributing factor in the initiation and progression of radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM). Numerous studies have indicated that the radiation-induced oral microbial dysbiosis promotes the occurrence and severity of oral mucositis. Therefore, approaches that modulate oral microbial ecology are promising for the management of RIOM. Probiotics as a relatively predicable and safe measure that modulates microecology have garnered significant interest. In this review, we discussed the correlation between RIOM and oral microbiota, with a particular focus on the efficacy of probiotics in the control of RIOM, in order to provide novel paradigm for the management of this disease.

## Emerging fatal gout disease in Chinese goslings linked to acute kidney injury induced by novel goose astrovirus infection

date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

A novel goose astrovirus (GAstV) has broken out across China in recent years, causing widespread damage to the poultry industry. In goslings infected with GAstV, the leading cause of death is visceral gout. However, our understanding of the mechanism of gout formation in GAstV infection is largely inadequate. The aim of this study was to examine the pathogenicity of a GAstV strain and explore the molecular mechanisms of visceral gout caused by viral infection in goslings. The virulent GAstV strain HR2105/1 was effectively isolated from the visceral tissue of goslings in gout-affected areas. The whole genome of the HR2105/1 strain was sequenced and analyzed. Subsequently, we established a gosling gout models with experimental GAstV infection. Finally, we conducted a study on the mechanism of GAstV induced acute kidney injury. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequence showed that it was closely related to the strain circulating in China since 2016, and it was grouped within the GAstV-1 cluster. The clinical signs were reproduced by experimental infection of healthy goslings with the isolated strain and were found to be similar to those reported in clinical cases. Moreover, the virus exhibits strong renal tropism. Infection with the GAstV strain HR2105/1 was found to cause acute kidney injury, as evidenced by increased levels of uric acid and creatinine as well as severe pathological damage. Mechanistic experiments with Masson and Picrosirius Red staining revealed fibrosis in renal tissues after GAstV infection. Furthermore, TUNEL staining revealed that GAstV infection triggered renal cell apoptosis. Additionally, RT-qPCR revealed that GAstV infection caused an excessive inflammatory response by upregulating the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, and iNOS in renal tissues. Overall, our findings demonstrate that GAstV infection causes renal damage by inducing renal cell apoptosis, fibrosis, and excessive inflammatory response, which subsequently leads to hyperuricemia and lethal visceral gout formation. This is the first systematic study on the etiology of lethal gout in goslings caused by GAstV infection, and we believe that the findings can guide vaccine development and therapeutic targets for GAstV-associated renal diseases.

## SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1-mediated early endosomal tubulation impacts cytomegalovirus replication

date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCytomegaloviruses (CMVs) extensively reorganize the membrane system of the cell and establish a new structure as large as the cell nucleus called the assembly compartment (AC). Our previous studies on murine CMV (MCMV)-infected fibroblasts indicated that the inner part of the AC contains rearranged early endosomes, recycling endosomes, endosomal recycling compartments and trans-Golgi membrane structures that are extensively tubulated, including the expansion and retention of tubular Rab10 elements. An essential process that initiates Rab10-associated tubulation is cargo sorting and retrieval mediated by SNX27, Retromer, and ESCPE-1 (endosomal SNX-BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1) complexes.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the role of SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1 complexes in the biogenesis of pre-AC in MCMV-infected cells and subsequently their role in secondary envelopment and release of infectious virions.ResultsHere we show that SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE1-mediated tubulation is essential for the establishment of a Rab10-decorated subset of membranes within the pre-AC, a function that requires an intact F3 subdomain of the SNX27 FERM domain. Suppression of SNX27-mediated functions resulted in an almost tenfold decrease in the release of infectious virions. However, these effects cannot be directly linked to the contribution of SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1-dependent tubulation to the secondary envelopment, as suppression of these components, including the F3-FERM domain, led to a decrease in MCMV protein expression and inhibited the progression of the replication cycle.ConclusionThis study demonstrates a novel and important function of membrane tubulation within the pre-AC associated with the control of viral protein expression.

## Recent advancement of novel marine fungi derived secondary metabolite fibrinolytic compound FGFC in biomedical applications: a review

date: 2024-09-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

For several decades, products derived from marine natural sources (PMN) have been widely identified for several therapeutic applications due to their rich sources of bioactive sub-stances, unique chemical diversity, biocompatibility and excellent biological activity. For the past 15 years, our research team explored several PMNs, especially fungi fibrinolytic compounds (FGFCs). FGFC is an isoindolone alkaloid derived from marine fungi, also known as staplabin analogs or Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol (SMTP). For instance, our previous studies explored different types of FGFCs such as FGFC 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the marine fungi Stachybotrys longispora FG216 derived metabolites. The derivatives of FGFC are potentially employed in several disease treatments, mainly for stroke, cancer, ischemia, acute kidney injury, inflammation, cerebral infarction, thrombolysis and hemorrhagic activities, etc. Due to the increasing use of FGFCs in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, it is important to understand the fundamental signaling concept of FGFCs. Hence, for the first time, this review collectively summarizes the background, types, mode of action and biological applications of FGFCs and their current endeavors for future therapies.

## Revealing the association between East Asian oral microbiome and colorectal cancer through Mendelian randomization and multi-omics analysis

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) poses a global health threat, with the oral microbiome increasingly implicated in its pathogenesis. This study leverages Mendelian Randomization (MR) to explore causal links between oral microbiota and CRC using data from the China National GeneBank and Biobank Japan. By integrating multi-omics approaches, we aim to uncover mechanisms by which the microbiome influences cellular metabolism and cancer development.MethodsWe analyzed microbiome profiles from 2017 tongue and 1915 saliva samples, and GWAS data for 6692 CRC cases and 27178 controls. Significant bacterial taxa were identified via MR analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and enrichment analyses elucidated underlying pathways, and drug predictions identified potential therapeutics.ResultsMR identified 19 bacterial taxa significantly associated with CRC. Protective effects were observed in taxa like RUG343 and Streptococcus_umgs_2425, while HOT-345_umgs_976 and W5053_sp000467935_mgs_712 increased CRC risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed key pathways, including JAK-STAT signaling and tyrosine metabolism. Drug prediction highlighted potential therapeutics like Menadione Sodium Bisulfite and Raloxifene.ConclusionThis study establishes the critical role of the oral microbiome in colorectal cancer development, identifying specific microbial taxa linked to CRC risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing and drug prediction analyses further elucidate key pathways and potential therapeutics, providing novel insights and personalized treatment strategies for CRC.

## RfaH contributes to maximal colonization and full virulence of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) have emerged as clinically important pathogens, posing a serious threat to human health. RfaH, a transcriptional elongation factor, has been regarded as implicated in facilitating the transcription of long virulence operons in certain bacterial species. In K. pneumoniae, RfaH plays a vital role in promoting CPS synthesis and hypermucoviscosity, as well as mediating bacterial fitness during lung infection. In this study, we aim to conduct a systematic investigation of the roles of rfaH in the survival, dissemination, and colonization of hvKp through in vitro and in vivo assays. We found that bacterial cells and colonies displayed capsule -deficient phenotypes subsequent to the deletion of rfaH in K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044. We confirmed that rfaH is required for the synthesis of capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by positively regulating the expression of CPS and LPS gene clusters. We found that the ΔrfaH mutant led to a significantly decreased mortality of K. pneumoniae in a mouse intraperitoneal infection model. We further demonstrated that the absence of rfaH was associated with slower bacterial growth under conditions of low nutrition or iron limitation. ΔrfaH displayed reduced survival rates in the presence of human serum. Besides, the engulfment of the ΔrfaH mutant was significantly higher than that of NTUH-K2044 by macrophages in vivo, indicating an indispensable role of RfaH in the phagocytosis resistance of hvKp in mice. Both mouse intranasal and intraperitoneal infection models revealed a higher bacterial clearance rate of ΔrfaH in lungs, livers, and spleens of mice compared to its wild type, suggesting an important role of RfaH in the bacterial survival, dissemination, and colonization of hvKp in vivo. Histopathological results supported that RfaH contributes to the pathogenicity of hvKp in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrates crucial roles of RfaH in the survival, colonization and full virulence of hvKp, which provides several implications for the development of RfaH as an antibacterial target.

## Gut microbiota and metabolomic profile changes play critical roles in tacrolimus-induced diabetes in rats

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

AimsHyperglycemia is one of the adverse effects of tacrolimus (TAC), but the underlying mechanism is not fully identified. We used multi-omics analysis to evaluate the changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic profile of rats with TAC-induced diabetes.MethodsTo establish a diabetic animal model, Sprague Dawley rats were divided randomly into two groups. Those in the TAC group received intraperitoneal injections of TAC (3 mg/kg) for 8 weeks, and those in the CON group served as the control. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze fecal microbiota. The metabolites of the two groups were detected and analyzed by nontargeted and targeted metabolomics, including amino acids (AAs), bile acids (BAs), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).ResultsThe rats treated with TAC exhibited hyperglycemia as well as changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites. Specifically, their gut microbiota had significantly higher abundances of Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, and Allobaculum, and significantly lower abundances of Ruminococcus, Akkermansia, and Roseburia. In addition, they had significantly reduced serum levels of AAs including asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and methionine. With respect to BAs, they had significantly higher serum levels of taurocholic acid (TCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), but significantly lower levels of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). There were no differences in the levels of SCFAs between the two groups. Correlations existed among glucose metabolism indexes (fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin), gut microbiota (Ruminococcus and Akkermansia), and metabolites (glutamic acid, hydroxyproline, GCDCA, TDCA, and TUDCA).ConclusionsBoth AAs and BAs may play crucial roles as signaling molecules in the regulation of TAC-induced diabetes.

## Intratumoral and fecal microbiota reveals microbial markers associated with gastric carcinogenesis

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe relationship between dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota and gastric cancer (GC) has been extensively studied. However, microbiota alterations in GC patients vary widely across studies, and reproducible diagnostic biomarkers for early GC are still lacking in multiple populations. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the gastrointestinal microbial communities involved in gastric carcinogenesis through a meta-analysis of multiple published and open datasets.MethodsWe analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data from 1,642 gastric biopsy samples and 394 stool samples across 11 independent studies. VSEARCH, QIIME and R packages such as vegan, phyloseq, cooccur, and random forest were used for data processing and analysis. PICRUSt software was employed to predict functions.ResultsThe α-diversity results indicated significant differences in the intratumoral microbiota of cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients, while no significant differences were observed in the fecal microbiota. Network analysis showed that the positive correlation with GC-enriched bacteria increased, and the positive correlation with GC-depleted bacteria decreased compared to healthy individuals. Functional analyses indicated that pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were significantly enriched in GC, while biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was diminished. Additionally, we investigated non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) commensals, which are crucial in both HP-negative and HP-positive GC. Random forest models, constructed using specific taxa associated with GC identified from the LEfSe analysis, revealed that the combination of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus included alone could effectively discriminate between GC patients and healthy individuals in fecal samples (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.7949). This finding was also validated in an independent cohort (AUC = 0.7712).ConclusionsThis study examined the intratumoral and fecal microbiota of GC patients from a dual microecological perspective and identified Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium as intratumoral and intestinal-specific co-differential bacteria. Furthermore, it confirmed the validity of the combination of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus as GC-specific microbial markers across multiple populations, which may aid in the early non-invasive diagnosis of GC.
