## Genomic and phenotypic inconsistencies in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistome among intensive care patients

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivePseudomonas aeruginosa, a difficult-to-manage nosocomial pathogen, poses a serious threat to clinical outcomes in intensive care (ICU) patients due to its high antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To promote effective management, it is essential to investigate the genomic and phenotypic differences in AMR expression of the isolates.MethodsA prospective observational study was conducted from July 2022 to April 2023 at Liepaja Regional Hospital in Latvia. The study included all adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and had a documented infection with P. aeruginosa, as confirmed by standard laboratory microbiological testing and short-read sequencing. Since ResFinder is the only sequencing-based database offering antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) data for each antibiotic, we conducted a comparison of the resistance profile with the results of phenotypic testing, evaluating if ResFinder met the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for approval as a new AMR diagnostic test. Next, to improve precision, AST data from ResFinder was compared with two other databases – AMRFinderPlus and RGI. Additionally, data was gathered from environmental samples to inform the implementation of appropriate infection control measures in real time.ResultsOur cohort consisted of 33 samples from 29 ICU patients and 34 environmental samples. The presence of P. aeruginosa infection was found to be associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes. A third of the patient samples were identified as multi-drug resistant isolates. Apart from resistance against colistin, significant discrepancies were observed when phenotypic data were compared to genotypic data. For example, the aminoglycoside resistance prediction of ResFinder yielded a major errors value of 3.03% for amikacin, which was marginally above the FDA threshold. Among the three positive environmental samples, one sample exhibited multiple AMR genes similar to the patient samples in its cluster.ConclusionOur findings underscore the importance of utilizing a combination of diagnostic methods for the identification of resistance mechanisms, clusters, and environmental reservoirs in ICUs.

## Enhanced immune reconstitution with albuvirtide in HIV-infected immunological non-responders

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIncomplete immune recovery in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) remains an important clinical challenge with the lack of an effective strategy currently available to restore their T-cell immune response. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Albuvirtide (ABT) on immune recovery in immunological non-responders (INRs) and attempted to explore potential mechanisms of ABT on the functionality of immune cells.MethodsIn this prospective, open-label, controlled clinical study, participants with incomplete immune reconstitution (continuous ART over 5 years and CD4+T lymphocyte absolute count of <500 cells/µl or ART for 2–5 years and CD4+T cell count of <200 cells/µl with undetectable viral load) were received intensive treatment with ABT or maintained on the original ART regimen at a ratio of 1:1. Immune response and safety were examined within 24 weeks. In the cytological study, T subsets, cell apoptosis and cell autophagy were analyzed using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry from 25 blood specimens.ResultsBoth groups (n=25 each) were comparable in age, gender, and ART duration. At week 12, CD4+T cell count increased significantly in the intensive ABT group compared with control group (the change from baseline in CD4+T cell count: 45 vs. -5 cells/µL, p<0.001). After ABT discontinuation, CD4+T cell counts remained significantly higher in the intensive ABT group at week 24 (55 vs. -5 cells/µL, p=0.012). In laboratory analysis, naïve CD4+ T cell amounts were lowest among participants with unsatisfactory immune response (uIR) to ABT (p=0.001). The proportion of caspase 3+CD45RA+CD31+CD4+ T cells was significantly lower in participants with satisfactory immune response (sIR) to ABT (p<0.05).ConclusionSignificant CD4+T cell count increase suggests ABT enhances immune function in INRs which may be attributed to its antiviral properties as well as its ability to increase thymic cell output and decrease cell apoptosis.

## High-performing cross-dataset machine learning reveals robust microbiota alteration in secondary apical periodontitis

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Multiple research groups have consistently underscored the intricate interplay between the microbiome and apical periodontitis. However, the presence of variability in experimental design and quantitative assessment have added a layer of complexity, making it challenging to comprehensively assess the relationship. Through an unbiased methodological refinement analysis, we re-analyzed 4 microbiota studies including 120 apical samples from infected teeth (with/without root canal treatment), healthy teeth, using meta-analysis and machine learning. With high-performing machine-learning models, we discover disease signatures of related species and enriched metabolic pathways, expanded understanding of apical periodontitis with potential therapeutic implications. Our approach employs uniform computational tools across datasets to leverage statistical power and define a reproducible signal potentially linked to the development of secondary apical periodontitis (SAP).

## No evidence on infectious DNA-based agents in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia using whole metagenome shotgun sequencing

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The etiology of pediatric acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) is still unclear. Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of bone marrow samples in patients with treatment-naïve ALL (n=6) was performed for untargeted investigation of bacterial and viral DNA. The control group consisted of healthy children (n=4) and children with non-oncologic diseases (n=2) undergoing bone marrow sampling. Peripheral blood of all participants was investigated at the same time. After bioinformatical elimination of potential contaminants by comparison with the employed controls, no significant amounts of microbial or viral DNA were identified.

## Assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic progression in Ecuador through seroprevalence analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies in blood donors

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory illness caused by the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2. Globally, there have been over 759.4 million cases and 6.74 million deaths, while Ecuador has reported more than 1.06 million cases and 35.9 thousand deaths. To describe the COVID-19 pandemic impact and the vaccinations effectiveness in a low-income country like Ecuador, we aim to assess the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a sample from healthy blood donors at the Cruz Roja Ecuatoriana.MethodsThe present seroprevalence study used a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in months with the highest confirmed case rates (May 2020; January, April 2021; January, February, June, July 2022) and months with the highest vaccination rates (May, June, July, August, December 2021) in Quito, Ecuador. The IgG and IgM seroprevalence were also assessed based on sex, age range, blood type and RhD antigen type. The sample size was 8,159, and sampling was performed based on the availability of each blood type.ResultsThe results showed an overall IgG and IgM seroprevalence of 47.76% and 3.44%, respectively. There were no differences in IgG and IgM seroprevalences between blood groups and sex, whereas statistical differences were found based on months, age range groups, and RhD antigen type. For instance, the highest IgG seroprevalence was observed in February 2022 and within the 17-26 years age range group, while the highest IgM seroprevalence was in April 2021 and within the 47-56 years age range group. Lastly, only IgG seroprevalence was higher in RhD+ individuals while IgM seroprevalence was similar across RhD types.DiscussionThis project contributes to limited data on IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Ecuador. It suggests that herd immunity may have been achieved in the last evaluated months, and highlights a potential link between the RhD antigen type and COVID-19 susceptibility. These findings have implications for public health strategies and vaccine distribution not only in Ecuador but also in regions with similar characteristics.

## TaqMan-quantitative PCR assays applied in Neospora caninum knock-outs generated through CRISPR-Cas9 allow to determine the copy numbers of integrated dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase drug selectable markers

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

As for many other organisms, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic modification has gained increasing importance for the identification of vaccine candidates and drug targets in Neospora caninum, an apicomplexan parasite causing abortion in cattle and neuromuscular disease in dogs. A widely used approach for generating knock-out (KO) strains devoid of virulence factors is the integration of a drug selectable marker such as mutated dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (mdhfr-ts) into the target gene, thus preventing the synthesis of respective protein and mediating resistance to pyrimethamine. However, CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis is not free of off-target effects, which can lead to integration of multiple mdhfr-ts copies into other sites of the genome. To determine the number of integrated mdhfr-ts in N. caninum, a duplex quantitative TaqMan PCR was developed. For this purpose, primers were designed that amplifies a 106 bp fragment from wild-type (WT) parasites corresponding to the single copy wtdhfrs-ts gene, as well as the mutated mdhfrs-ts present in KO parasites that confers resistance and were used simultaneously with primers amplifying the diagnostic NC5 gene. Thus, the dhfr-ts to NC5 ratio should be approximately 1 in WT parasites, while in KO parasites with a single integrated mdhrf-ts gene this ratio is doubled, and in case of multiple integration events even higher. This approach was applied to the Neospora KO strains NcΔGRA7 and NcΔROP40. For NcΔGRA7, the number of tachyzoites determined by dhfr-ts quantification was twice the number of tachyzoites determined by NC5 quantification, thus indicating that only one mdhfr-ts copy was integrated. The results obtained with the NcΔROP40 strain, however, showed that the number of dhfr-ts copies per genome was substantially higher, indicating that at least three copies of the selectable mdhfr-ts marker were integrated into the genomic DNA during gene editing by CRISPR-Cas9. This duplex TaqMan-qPCR provides a reliable and easy-to-use tool for assessing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis in WT N. caninum strains.

## Research progress on the relationship between chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and the microbiota of the reproductive system

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common pelvic pain syndrome in males, seriously affecting patients’ quality of life. For a long time, CP/CPPS has been considered a complex and variable disease, and its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Currently, CP/CPPS is believed to be a group of diseases characterized by pelvic pain or discomfort, urinary abnormalities, and other symptoms, each with its unique etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes, likely resulting from the action of pathogens or (and) certain non-infectious factors. Traditionally, CP/CPPS was thought to be unrelated to bacterial infections. However, in recent years, with the development of microbiology and the advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology, an increasing number of studies have suggested that microorganisms in the reproductive system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CP/CPPS. The unique characteristics of CP/CPPS, such as its refractory nature and tendency to recur, may be closely related to the microbiota and their biological functions in the reproductive system. The relationship between CP/CPPS and reproductive system microorganisms is one of the current hot topics in microbiology and urology, receiving considerable attention from scholars in recent years and making a series of new advances. Through this review, we will comprehensively explore the relationship between CP/CPPS and reproductive system microorganisms, and look forward to future research directions, aiming to provide new ideas and methods for clinical diagnosis and treatment, thereby improving the treatment outcomes and quality of life of CP/CPPS patients.

## Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pathology and cell tropism in tongue tissues of COVID-19 autopsies

date: 2024-06-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Since 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) has affected millions of people worldwide. Except for acute respiratory distress syndrome, dysgeusis is also a common symptom of COVID-19 that burdens patients for weeks or permanently. However, the mechanisms underlying taste dysfunctions remain unclear. Here, we performed complete autopsies of five patients who died of COVID-19. Integrated tongue samples, including numerous taste buds, salivary glands, vessels, and nerves were collected to map the pathology, distribution, cell tropism, and receptor distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the tongue. Our results revealed that all patients had moderate lymphocyte infiltration around the salivary glands and in the lamina propria adjacent to the mucosa, and pyknosis in the epithelia of taste buds and salivary glands. This may be because the serous acini, salivary gland ducts, and taste buds are the primary sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multicolor immunofluorescence showed that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects Keratin (KRT)7+ taste receptor cells in taste buds, secretory cells in serous acini, and inner epithelial cells in the ducts. The major receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2), were both abundantly expressed in these cells. Viral antigens and receptor were both rarely detected in vessels and nerves. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers pathological injury in the tongue, and that dysgeusis may be directly related to viral infection and cellular damage.

## Prevalence, socio-economic, and associated risk factors of oral cavity parasites in children with intellectual disability from Lorestan province, Iran

date: 2024-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionChildren with intellectual disability (ID) often face challenges in maintaining proper oral hygiene due to their motor, sensory, and intellectual impairments, which can lead to compromised oral health; therefore, there is a need to enhance the oral health status of these populations and establish an effective system for administering preventive interventions. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Entamoeba gingivalis and Trichomonas tenax among children with ID in Lorestan province, in Western Iran through parasitological and molecular methods.MethodsThe current descriptive investigation involved 215 in children with ID and 215 healthy children (non-ID) who were referred to health facilities in Lorestan province, Iran between October 2022 and March 2024. The prevalence of protozoa in the oral cavity was found through the utilization of both microscopic analysis and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.ResultsThe total prevalence of the E. gingivalis and T. tenax in children with ID was found to be 87 (40.5%) and 92 (42.8%) through microscopic and PCR methods, respectively. Among the positive samples, 57 (61.9%) and 35 (38.1%) children tested positive for E. gingivalis and T. tenax, respectively. In contrast, among the 215 non-ID children in the control group, 39 (18.1%) and 42 (19.5%) tested positive by microscopic and PCR methods, respectively. Among positive samples in non-ID children, 23 (54.7%) and 19 (45.3%) children were positive for E. gingivalis and T. tenax, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that residing in urban areas, parental education, monthly family income, and tooth brushing p<0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for oral cavity parasites.ConclusionThis study identified a notable prevalence of oral cavity parasites in children with ID in Lorestan province, Western Iran. It is imperative to recognize the primary risk factors associated with these parasites, particularly inadequate teeth brushing, in order to enhance public and oral health strategies for children with ID. Therefore, pediatric dental professionals should remain vigilant regarding these risk factors to effectively recognize and address oral health issues in this population, thereby mitigating the occurrence of oral diseases and infections.

## Aneuploidy underlies brefeldin A-induced antifungal drug resistance in Cryptococcus neoformans

date: 2024-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cryptococcus neoformans is at the top of the list of “most wanted” human pathogens. Only three classes of antifungal drugs are available for the treatment of cryptococcosis. Studies on antifungal resistance mechanisms are limited to the investigation of how a particular antifungal drug induces resistance to a particular drug, and the impact of stresses other than antifungals on the development of antifungal resistance and even cross-resistance is largely unexplored. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a ubiquitous subcellular organelle of eukaryotic cells. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a widely used chemical inducer of ER stress. Here, we found that both weak and strong selection by BFA caused aneuploidy formation in C. neoformans, mainly disomy of chromosome 1, chromosome 3, and chromosome 7. Disomy of chromosome 1 conferred cross-resistance to two classes of antifungal drugs: fluconazole and 5-flucytosine, as well as hypersensitivity to amphotericin B. However, drug resistance was unstable, due to the intrinsic instability of aneuploidy. We found overexpression of AFR1 on Chr1 and GEA2 on Chr3 phenocopied BFA resistance conferred by chromosome disomy. Overexpression of AFR1 also caused resistance to fluconazole and hypersensitivity to amphotericin B. Furthermore, a strain with a deletion of AFR1 failed to form chromosome 1 disomy upon BFA treatment. Transcriptome analysis indicated that chromosome 1 disomy simultaneously upregulated AFR1, ERG11, and other efflux and ERG genes. Thus, we posit that BFA has the potential to drive the rapid development of drug resistance and even cross-resistance in C. neoformans, with genome plasticity as the accomplice.

## Molecular characterization of carbapenem and ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant Enterobacterales and horizontal spread of blaNDM-5 gene at a Lebanese medical center

date: 2024-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionIn the battle against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, ceftazidime- avibactam (CZA) stands as a pivotal defense, particularly against carbapenemresistant (CR) Gram-negative pathogens. However, the rise in resistance against this drug poses a significant threat to its effectiveness, highlighting the critical need for in-depth studies about its resistance mechanisms. MethodsThis research focuses on the genomic characterization of CR- and CZA-resistant Escherichia coli (n=26) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=34) strains, harboring the blaNDM and/or blaOXA-48-like genes, at a major Lebanese tertiary care medical center, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). ResultsOur findings revealed a notable prevalence of blaNDM in all K. pneumoniae strains isolates, with 27 of these also harboring blaOXA-48. On the other hand, E. coli strains predominantly carried the blaNDM-5 gene. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified a predominance of ST383 among K. pneumoniae strains, which possessed a multi-replicon IncFIB-IncHI1B plasmid harboring the blaNDM-5. Additionally, various Inc group plasmids in K. pneumoniae across multiple sequence types were found to carry the blaNDM. Similarly, diverse STs of E. coli were observed to carry blaNDM-5 on different plasmids. DiscussionThe study underscores NDM carbapenemases as a paramount resistance mechanism in Lebanon,jeopardizing critical last-resort treatments. It also illuminates the role of varied sequence types and mobile genetic elements in the spread of NDM resistance,stressing the urgent need for strategies to mitigate this threat, especially in nosocomial infections.

## Epidemiological investigation on diseases of Larimichthys crocea in Ningbo culture area

date: 2024-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDue to the high-density farming of Larimichthys crocea over the years, diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites frequently occur in Ningbo, posing a huge threat and challenge to the sustainable and healthy development of the L. crocea’s bay farming industry. In order to understand the diseases occurrence in L. crocea farming in Ningbo area, an epidemiological investigation of L. crocea diseases was carried out through regular sampling in 2023.  MethodsFrom April to October 2023, routine sampling of L. crocea was conducted monthly in various farming areas in Ningbo. Each time, live or dying L. crocea with obvious clinical symptoms were sampled, with a total number of 55 L. crocea collected. The samples were preserved in ice bags and transported to the laboratory for pathogen detection(including bacterial isolation and identification,virus identification, and parasites detection).ResultsA total of fifty-five fish dying L. crocea with obvious clinical symptoms were collected in this study, of which 78.18% (43/55) were detected with symptoms caused by pathogenic infection, while 21.82% (12/55) did not have identified pathogens, which were presumed to be breeding abrasions, nutritional metabolic disorders, unconventional pathogens infection or other reasons. A total of twenty-five pathogenic bacteria strains were isolated, which mainly were Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and Vibrio harveyi, accounting for 52% (13/25) and 32% (8/25) of the pathogenic bacteria strains, respectively. Among them, both V. harveyi and Streptococcus. iniae co-infected one fish. Additionally, three other bacterial strains including Nocardia seriolae, Staphylococcus Saprophyticus, and Photobacterium damselae subsp.damselae were isolated. Microscopic examination mainly observed two parasites, Cryptocaryon irritans and Neobenedenia girellae. In virus detection, the red sea bream iridovirus (RSIV) was mainly detected in L. crocea. Statistical analysis showed that among the fish with detected pathogens, 55.81% (24/43) had bacterial infections, 37.21% (16/43) had parasitic infections, and 37.21% (16/43) had RSIV infections. Among them, five fish had mixed infections of bacteria and parasites, three had mixed infections of bacteria and viruses, three had mixed infections of parasites and viruses, and one L. crocea had mixed infections of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. DiscussionThese findings indicate that these three major types of diseases are very common in the L. crocea farming area in Ningbo, implying the complexity of mixed infections of multiple diseases.

## Overexpression of LAG-3: a potential indicator of low immune function in tuberculosis

date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) persists as a global health challenge, with its treatment hampered by the side effects of long-term combination drug therapies and the growing issue of drug resistance. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is critical. This study focuses on the role of immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) and functions of CD8+ T cells in the search for new potential targets against TB.MethodsWe conducted differential expression genes analysis and CD8+ T cell functional gene analysis on 92 TB samples and 61 healthy individual (HI) samples from TB database GSE83456, which contains data on 34,603 genes. The GSE54992 dataset was used to validated the findings. Additionally, a cluster analysis on single-cell data from primates infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and those vaccinated with BCG was performed.ResultsThe overexpression of LAG-3 gene was found as a potentially important characteristic of both pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Further correlation analysis showed that LAG-3 gene was correlated with GZMB, perforin, IL-2 and IL-12. A significant temporal and spatial variation in LAG-3 expression was observed in T cells and macrophages during TB infection and after BCG vaccination.ConclusionLAG-3 was overexpressed in TB samples. Targeting LAG-3 may represent a potential therapeutic target for tuberculosis.

## Host specificity and zoonotic Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in wild rodents from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province of China

date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionWild rodents can serve as reservoirs or carriers of E. bieneusi, thereby enabling parasite transmission to domestic animals and humans. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of E. bieneusi in wild rodents from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province of China. Moreover, to evaluate the potential for zoonotic transmission at the genotype level, a genetic analysis of the isolates was performed.MethodsA total of 486 wild rodents were captured from two provinces in China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the vertebrate cytochrome b (cytb) gene in the fecal DNA of the rodents to detect their species. The genotype of E. bieneusi was determined via PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. The examination of genetic characteristics and zoonotic potential requires the application of similarity and phylogenetic analysis.ResultsThe infection rates of E. bieneusi in the four identified rodent species were 5.2% for Apodemus agrarius (n = 89), 4.5% for Cricetulus barabensis (n = 96), 11.3% for Mus musculus (n = 106), and 38.5% for Rattus norvegicus (n = 195). Infection was detected at an average rate of 17.4% among 486 rodents. Of the 11 identified genotypes, nine were known: SHR1 (detected in 32 samples), D (30 samples), EbpA (9 samples), PigEbITS7 (8 samples), HNR-IV (6 samples), Type IV (5 samples), HNR-VII (2 samples), HNH7 (1 sample), and HNPL-V (1 sample). Two novel genotypes were also discovered, NMR-I and NMR-II, each comprising one sample. The genotypes were classified into group 1 and group 13 via phylogenetic analysis.DiscussionBased on the initial report, E. bieneusi is highly prevalent and genetically diverse in wild rodents residing in the respective province and region. This indicates that these animals are crucial for the dissemination of E. bieneusi. Zoonotic E. bieneusi-carrying animals present a significant hazard to local inhabitants. Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness regarding the dangers presented by these rodents and reduce their population to prevent environmental contamination.

## The role of bacterial genital infections in spontaneous preterm delivery: a case-control study

date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSpontaneous preterm delivery is defined as the beginning of the birth process before the 37th week of pregnancy. The presence of microorganisms in the fetal membranes is accompanied by an increase in the production of prostaglandin, one of the important factors associated with the prevalence of preterm birth. The invasion of microorganisms leads to the production of protease, coagulase, and elastase, which directly stimulate the onset of childbirth. We investigated the role of genital infections in women with preterm birth.MethodsThe present case-control study was conducted in the west of Iran on 100 women with spontaneous preterm delivery (following 24 weeks of gestation and before 36 weeks and 6 days) as the case group and 100 women with normal delivery as controls. A questionnaire was applied to collect the data. Polymerase chain reaction and pathological examination of the placenta were performed.ResultsThe average age in women with normal delivery (30.92 ± 5.10) in women with spontaneous preterm delivery (30.27 ± 4.93). The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycoplasma genitalium infections was zero in both groups. The highest prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis was 19 (19%) in the case group and Ureaplasma parvum 15 (15%) in the control group. Also, Placental inflammation was zero in controls and 7(7%) in the patient group. There was a significant relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria and spontaneous preterm delivery.ConclusionThe results of our study showed that except for Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria, there is no significant relationship between the above bacterial infections and spontaneous preterm birth. Moreover, despite the significant reduction in the prevalence of many sexually transmitted infections in this research, it is still suggested to increase the awareness of people, including pregnant women, about the ways it can be transmitted by gynecologists and health and treatment centers.
