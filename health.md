## Causal associations between Helicobacter pylori infection and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-03-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Observational studies have reported that <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) infection is associated with a series of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. However, the results have been inconsistent, and the causal effect is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed using summary-level statistics for anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> IgG levels from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Cohort. Outcome data for pregnancy (miscarriage, preeclampsia-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, postpartum hemorrhage) and neonates (birthweight, gestational age, and preterm birth) were sourced from genome-wide association meta-analysis as well as the FinnGen and Early Growth Genetics Consortium. Causal estimates were calculated by five methods including inverse variance weighted (IVW). The heterogeneity of instrumental variables was quantified by Cochran’s Q test, while sensitivity analyses were performed via MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>IVW estimates suggested that genetically predicted anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> IgG levels were significantly associated with increased risks of preeclampsia-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.24, <italic>P</italic> = 0.026) and premature rupture of membranes (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.30, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). Similar results were obtained for preeclampsia-eclampsia from the MR-Egger method (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.06–1.64, <italic>P</italic> = 0.027) and for premature rupture of membranes from the weighted median method (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.06–1.41, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). No significant causal effects were found for other outcomes. There was no obvious heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy across the MR analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our two-sample MR study demonstrated a causal relationship of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection with preeclampsia-eclampsia and premature rupture of membranes. The findings confirm the epidemiological evidence on the adverse impact of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in pregnancy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and assess the effectiveness of pre-pregnancy screening and preventive eradication.</p></sec>

## Plasma metabolomic profile is near-normal in people with HIV on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy

date: 2024-03-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in people with HIV (PWH). However, a chronic state of immune activation and inflammation is maintained despite achieving HIV suppression and satisfactory immunological recovery. We aimed to determine whether the plasma metabolomic profile of PWH on long-term suppressive ART and immunologically recovered approximates the normality by comparison with healthy controls with similar age and gender.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We carried out a cross-sectional study in 17 PWH on long-term ART (HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL, CD4<sup>+</sup> ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ≥1) and 19 healthy controls with similar age and gender. Metabolomics analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The statistical association analysis was performed by principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with a gamma distribution (log-link). Significance levels (p-value) were corrected for multiple testing (q-value).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PCA and PLS-DA analyses found no relevant differences between groups. Adjusted GLM showed 14 significant features (q-value&lt;0.20), of which only three could be identified: lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) (22:6) (q-value=0.148), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE) (22:6) (q-value=0.050) and hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid (HpOTrE)/dihydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid (DiHOTrE)/epoxy-octadecadienoic acid (EpODE) (q-value=0.136). These significant identified metabolites were directly correlated to plasma inflammatory biomarkers in PWH and negatively correlated in healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PWH on long-term ART have a metabolomic profile that is almost normal compared to healthy controls. Nevertheless, residual metabolic alterations linked to inflammatory biomarkers persist, which could favor the development of age-related comorbidities among this population.</p></sec>

## Small RNA-modulated anaerobic respiration allows bacteria to survive under antibiotic stress conditions

date: 2024-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Despite extensive knowledge of antibiotic-targeted bacterial cell death, deeper understanding of antibiotic tolerance mechanisms is necessary to combat multi-drug resistance in the global healthcare settings. Regulatory RNAs in bacteria control important cellular processes such as cell division, cellular respiration, metabolism, and virulence. Here, we investigated how exposing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to the moderately effective first-generation antibiotic cephalothin alters transcriptional and post-transcriptional dynamics. Bacteria switched from active aerobic respiration to anaerobic adaptation via an FnrS and Tp2 small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory circuit. From the early hours of antibiotic exposure, FnrS was involved in regulating reactive oxygen species levels, and delayed oxygen consumption in bacteria. We demonstrated that bacteria strive to maintain cellular homeostasis via sRNA-mediated sudden respiratory changes upon sublethal antibiotic exposure.</p>

## Adaptation to an amoeba host drives selection of virulence-associated traits and genetic variation in saprotrophic Candida albicans

date: 2024-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Amoebae are micropredators that play an important role in controlling fungal populations in ecosystems. However, the interaction between fungi and their amoebic predators suggests that the pressure from predatory selection can significantly influence the development of fungal virulence and evolutionary processes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the adaptation of saprotrophic <italic>Candida albicans</italic> strains during their interactions with <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic>. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of survival after co-culture by colony counting of the yeast cells and examining yeast cell phenotypic and genetic characteristics. Our results indicated that exposure to amoebae enhanced the survival capacity of environmental <italic>C. albicans</italic> and induced visible morphological alterations in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, particularly by an increase in filamentation. These observed phenotypic changes were closely related to concurrent genetic variations. Notably, mutations in genes encoding transcriptional repressors (<italic>TUP1</italic> and <italic>SSN6</italic>), recognized for their negative regulation of filamentous growth, were exclusively identified in amoeba-passaged isolates, and absent in unexposed isolates. Furthermore, these adaptations increased the exposed isolates’ fitness against various stressors, simultaneously enhancing virulence factors and demonstrating an increased ability to invade A549 lung human epithelial cells. These observations indicate that the sustained survival of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under ongoing amoebic predation involved a key role of mutation events in microevolution to modulate the ability of these isolates to change phenotype and increase their virulence factors, demonstrating an enhanced potential to survive in diverse environmental niches.</p>

## Vaginal dysbiosis seems associated with hrHPV infection in women attending the Dutch Cervical Cancer Screening Program

date: 2024-03-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus, which infects approximately 80% of all men and women at some time in their lives. Usually, the infection is resolved successfully by the body’s immune system. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV (hrHPV) is necessary but not sufficient for cervical cancer development, and additional factors, such as the vaginal microbiome (vaginome), are thought to be involved. The aim of this study is to investigate whether either vaginal dysbiosis (imbalance in vaginal bacterial composition) or sexually transmitted pathogens, e.g., <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT), are possible cofactors for hrHPV infection and HPV-induced cervical dysplasia in asymptomatic women attending the Dutch Cervical Cancer Screening Program. In this study, 492 hrHPV-positive and 500 hrHPV-negative cervical smears from women attending the Screening Program were included. Age and cytology were known for the hrHPV-positive samples. All cervical smears were diluted in Aptima<sup>®</sup> specimen transfer medium and tested with Aptima<sup>®</sup> transcription-mediated amplification assays targeting CT<italic>, Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (NG)<italic>, Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> (MG)<italic>, Candida</italic> spp. (CS), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (CG)<italic>, Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (TV), and bacterial vaginosis (BV). The prevalences of CT, NG, MG, CS, CG, TV, and BV in this cohort were found to be 1.9%, 0.0%, 1.7%, 5.4%, 1.4%, 0.1%, and 27.2%, respectively. When comparing HPV groups, it was found that CT, MG, and BV had a significantly higher prevalence in hrHPV-positive smears as compared with hrHPV-negative samples (for all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found when comparing different age groups and cytology outcomes. In conclusion, vaginal dysbiosis seems associated with hrHPV infection in women attending the Dutch Cervical Cancer Screening Program.</p>

## The interplay between HPV, other Sexually Transmissible Infections and genital microbiome on cervical microenvironment (MicroCervixHPV study)

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>The importance of Cervicovaginal Microbiota in protecting against infections (such as HPV) is already well established, namely through Lactobacillus spp., as well as the mechanism through which HPV leads to Cervical Neoplasia. However, it is not possible to classify HPV as a complete carcinogen. Thus, the importance of exploring Cervicovaginal dysbiosis with the intention of deciphering this interaction with HPV, takes on greater relevance. The main objectives of this study were: 1) Comparison of the MCV composition of women with or without HPV and women with ASCUS or LSIL; 2) Characterization of cytokines present in the vaginal microenvironment; 3) Evaluation of the blood count ratios as prognostic systemic inflammatory biomarkers; 4) Correlation between MCV, HPV serotypes and cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter, cross-sectional study. CVM analysis was performed by isolation RNA and sequencing on a NGS platform. Cytokine concentrations of CVM were obtained through Multiplex platform. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS v 26.0. An α of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Highlighting the core of the study, CVM types of CST I and CST IV were found to influence the emergence of cervical lesions. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio was found to impact the prognosis of ASCUS. Within CVM, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> prevent the growth of other CST IV species, while the latter express symbiotic relationships with each other and show affinity for specific HPV serotypes. At last, RANTES chemokine is significantly elevated in cervicovaginal infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The importance of using vaginal cytokine profiles and CVM is highlighted in the hypothesis of prevention of Cervical Neoplasia development, as well as in its use as a prognostic biomarker. Taken together, these insights are one step closer to personalized medicine.</p></sec>

## Brucella infection and Toll-like receptors

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Brucella</italic> consists of gram-negative bacteria that have the ability to invade and replicate in professional and non-professional phagocytes, and its prolonged persistence in the host leads to brucellosis, a serious zoonosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-known sensors of microorganisms implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In particular, TLRs are transmembrane proteins with a typical structure of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. In this review, we discuss <italic>Brucella</italic> infection and the aspects of host immune responses induced by pathogens. Furthermore, we summarize the roles of TLRs in <italic>Brucella</italic> infection, with substantial emphasis on the molecular insights into its mechanisms of action.</p>

## Genotyping of ticks: first molecular report of Hyalomma asiaticum and molecular detection of tick-borne bacteria in ticks and blood from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Multiple ticks (Acari: Ixodoidea) carrying Rickettsiales bacteria have significant importance for both human and animal health. Thus, the purpose of this work was to genetically analyze tick species and their associated Rickettsiales bacteria in animal hosts. In order to achieve these objectives, various animals (including camels, cattle, goats, sheep, dogs, and mice) were inspected in four districts (Mardan, Peshawar, Kohat, and Karak) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to collect ticks, while blood samples were collected from all the symptomatic and asymptomatic cattle in all four districts. A total of 234 ticks were obtained from 86 out of 143 (60.14%) host animals, which were morphologically identified as <italic>Rhipicephalus turanicus</italic>, <italic>Rhipicephalus microplus</italic>, <italic>Haemaphysalis cornupunctata</italic>, and <italic>Hyalomma asiaticum</italic>. Among these, their representative ticks (126/234, 53.85%) were processed for molecular confirmation using cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<italic>cox1</italic>) gene. Obtained <italic>cox1</italic> sequences of four different tick species showed 99.72%–100% maximum identity with their corresponding species reported from Pakistan, China, India, and Kazakhstan and clustered phylogenetically. This study presented the first genetic report of <italic>Hy. asiaticum</italic> ticks in Pakistan. Moreover, genetically confirmed tick species were molecularly analyzed by PCR for detection of Rickettsiales DNA using partial fragments of <italic>16S rDNA</italic>, 190-kDa outer membrane protein A (<italic>ompA</italic>), and 120-kDa outer membrane protein B (<italic>ompB</italic>) genes. In addition, blood samples were analyzed to identify Rickettsiales bacteria using the aforementioned genes. Rickettsiales bacteria were found in 24/126 (19.05%) ticks and 4/16 (25.00%) in symptomatic cattle’s blood. The obtained <italic>ompA</italic> and <italic>ompB</italic> sequences from <italic>Hy. asiaticum</italic> ticks showed 99.73%–99.87% with <italic>Candidatus Rickettsia</italic> shennongii and unidentified <italic>Rickettsia</italic> sp., whereas the obtained <italic>16S rDNA</italic> sequences from cattle’s blood and ticks (<italic>Hae. cornupunctata</italic>) showed 99.67% highest identity with <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>. The <italic>16S rDNA</italic> sequence of Rickettsiales DNA from <italic>Rh. turanicus</italic> ticks showed 100% identity with <italic>Ehrlichia canis</italic> and unidentified <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> sp. Obtained sequences of Rickettsiales bacteria were grouped along with their respective species in phylogenetic trees, which were previously reported in Greece, Cuba, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, South Korea, and China (mainland and Taiwan). This extensive study explores the wide range of damaging ticks and their corresponding tick-borne bacteria in the area, suggesting a possible danger to both livestock and human communities.</p>

## Differential responses to avian pathogenic E. coli and the regulatory role of splenic miRNAs in APEC infection in Silkie chickens

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Avian pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (APEC) is a bacterial disease that harms the poultry industry worldwide, but its effect on Chinese Silkie has not been reported. Studies on whether there are differences in Silkie individual resistance to APEC and the regulatory role of spleen miRNAs lay the foundation for strategies against APEC. Therefore, 270 Silkie chickens were infected with the median lethal dose of an <italic>E. coli</italic> O1, O2, and O78 mixture. These chickens were divided into a susceptible group (Group S) and a recovery group (Group R) according to whether they survived 15 days postinfection (dpi). Moreover, 90 uninfected APEC Silkie served as controls (Group C). The splenic miRNA expression profile was examined to evaluate the role of miRNAs in the APEC infection response. Of the 270 Silkies infected with APEC, 144 were alive at 15 dpi. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) of splenic miRNAs revealed that the four Group R replicates were clustered with the three Group C replicates and were far from the three Group S replicates. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, especially gga-miR-146b-5p, play essential roles in immune and inflammatory responses to APEC. Functional enrichment analyses of DEmiRNAs suggested that suppression of immune system processes (biological processes) might contribute to susceptibility to APEC and that FoxO signaling pathways might be closely associated with the APEC infection response and postinfection repair. This study paves the way for screening anti-APEC Silkies and provides novel insights into the regulatory role of miRNAs in APEC infection.</p>

## Alteration in gut microbiota is associated with immune imbalance in Graves’ disease

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Graves’ disease (GD), characterized by immune aberration, is associated with gut dysbiosis. Despite the growing interest, substantial evidence detailing the precise impact of gut microbiota on GD’s autoimmune processes remains exceedingly rare.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study was designed to investigate the influence of gut microbiota on immune dysregulation in GD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>It encompassed 52 GD patients and 45 healthy controls (HCs), employing flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine lymphocyte and cytokine profiles, alongside lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. Gut microbiota profiles and metabolic features were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and targeted metabolomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our observations revealed a disturbed B-cell distribution and elevated LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines in GD patients compared to HCs. Significant differences in gut microbiota composition and a marked deficit in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, including ASV263(<italic>Bacteroides</italic>), ASV1451(<italic>Dialister</italic>), and ASV503(<italic>Coprococcus</italic>), were observed in GD patients. These specific bacteria and SCFAs showed correlations with thyroid autoantibodies, B-cell subsets, and cytokine levels. In vitro studies further showed that LPS notably caused B-cell subsets imbalance, reducing conventional memory B cells while increasing naïve B cells. Additionally, acetate combined with propionate and butyrate showcased immunoregulatory functions, diminishing cytokine production in LPS-stimulated cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, our results highlight the role of gut dysbiosis in contributing to immune dysregulation in GD by affecting lymphocyte status and cytokine production.</p></sec>

## Clinical efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objective</title><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a liver damage disease caused by long-term heavy drinking. Currently, there is no targeted pharmaceutical intervention available for the treatment of this disease. To address this, this paper evaluates the efficacy and safety of probiotic preparation in treating ALD through conducting a meta-analysis, and provides a valuable insight for clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic search was conducted across databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM from the inception dates to October 15, 2023, to identify clinical randomized controlled trials on probiotic preparations in the treatment of ALD. After the literature underwent screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.2 were employed for data analysis and processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 9 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotic preparation could significantly improve the liver function of patients with alcoholic liver disease compared with the control group.

## Altered ocular surface microbiota in obesity: a case-control study

date: 2024-03-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Purpose</title><p>This study aimed to investigate the composition of ocular surface microbiota in patients with obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This case-control study, spanning from November 2020 to March 2021 at Henan Provincial People’s Hospital, involved 35 patients with obesity and an equivalent number of age and gender-matched healthy controls. By employing 16S rRNA sequencing, this study analyzed the differences in ocular surface microbiota between the two groups. The functional prediction analysis of the ocular surface microbiota was conducted using PICRUSt2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The alpha diversity showed no notable differences in the richness or evenness of the ocular surface microbiota when comparing patients with obesity to healthy controls (Shannon index, <italic>P</italic>=0.1003). However, beta diversity highlighted significant variances in the microbiota composition of these two groups (ANOSIM, <italic>P</italic>=0.005). LEfSe analysis revealed that the relative abundances of <italic>Delftia</italic>, <italic>Cutibacterium</italic>, <italic>Aquabacterium</italic>, <italic>Acidovorax</italic>, <italic>Caulobacteraceae unclassified</italic>, <italic>Comamonas</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> in patients with obesity were significantly increased (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Predictive analysis using PICRUSt2 highlighted a significant enhancement in certain metabolic pathways in patients with obesity, notably xenobiotics metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP450), lipid metabolism, and the oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients with obesity exhibit a distinct ocular surface core microbiome. The observed variations in this microbiome may correlate with increased activity in CYP450, changes in lipid metabolism, and alterations in NOD-like receptor signaling pathways.</p></sec>

## Gallbladder microbial species and host bile acids biosynthesis linked to cholesterol gallstone comparing to pigment individuals

date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Gallstones are crystalline deposits in the gallbladder that are traditionally classified as cholesterol, pigment, or mixed stones based on their composition. Microbiota and host metabolism variances among the different types of gallstones remain largely unclear. Here, the bile and gallstone microbial species spectra of 29 subjects with gallstone disease (GSD, 24 cholesterol and 5 pigment) were revealed by type IIB restriction site-associated DNA microbiome sequencing (2bRAD-M). Among them (21 subjects: 18 cholesterol and 3 pigment), plasma samples were subjected to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) untargeted metabolomics. The microbiome yielded 896 species comprising 882 bacteria, 13 fungi, and 1 archaeon. Microbial profiling revealed significant enrichment of <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> and <italic>Microbacterium</italic> sp005774735 in gallstone and <italic>Agrobacterium pusense</italic> and <italic>Enterovirga</italic> sp013044135 in the bile of cholesterol GSD subjects. The metabolome revealed 2296 metabolites, in which malvidin 3-(6’’-malonylglucoside), 2-Methylpropyl glucosinolate, and ergothioneine were markedly enriched in cholesterol GSD subjects. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) demonstrated enriched bile acids biosynthesis in individuals with cholesterol GSD. Overall, the multi-omics analysis revealed that microbiota and host metabolism interaction perturbations differ depending on the disease type. Perturbed gallstone type-related microbiota may contribute to unbalanced bile acids metabolism in the gallbladder and host, representing a potential early diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for GSD.</p>

## Talaromycosis from Wuhan: two-case report and literature review

date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Talaromycosis is a serious opportunistic infectious disease caused by <italic>Talaromyces marneffei</italic>, which mostly occurs in immunocompromised patients. The disease is mainly prevalent in tropical countries and regions of Southeast Asia and South Asia, but non-endemic areas also have patients with Talaromycosis. The disease has no characteristic clinical manifestations and is difficult to diagnose. Delayed diagnosis often leads to death.</p></sec><sec><title>Case presentation</title><p>Both patients had cellular immunodeficiency. Case 1 had a history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and case 2 had a history of renal transplantation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. They all had fever, anemia, fatigue, and skin lesions. Case 1 had gastrointestinal bleeding, enlarged lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Case 2 had cough and dyspnea. Both patients had thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia; an increased neutrophil ratio, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein; and abnormal liver function and coagulation dysfunction. Case 1 sputum culture, blood culture, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were positive for <italic>T. marneffei</italic>. <italic>T. marneffei</italic> was detected in the blood culture of case 2, with infection of <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> and <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic>. Chest computed tomography scan mainly showed pulmonary exudative lesions. Although these two patients were actively treated, they died of poor efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Talaromycosis has an insidious onset, long course, atypical clinical symptoms, imaging performance and laboratory results, difficult diagnosis, and high mortality. Therefore, it is important to promptly consider and treat Talaromycosis in immunocompromised patients upon infection in order to reduce mortality.</p></sec>

## The role of transcriptional regulators in metal ion homeostasis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Metal ions are essential trace elements for all living organisms and play critical catalytic, structural, and allosteric roles in many enzymes and transcription factors. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), as an intracellular pathogen, is usually found in host macrophages, where the bacterium can survive and replicate. One of the reasons why Tuberculosis (TB) is so difficult to eradicate is the continuous adaptation of its pathogen. It is capable of adapting to a wide range of harsh environmental stresses, including metal ion toxicity in the host macrophages. Altering the concentration of metal ions is the common host strategy to limit MTB replication and persistence. This review mainly focuses on transcriptional regulatory proteins in MTB that are involved in the regulation of metal ions such as iron, copper and zinc. The aim is to offer novel insights and strategies for screening targets for TB treatment, as well as for the development and design of new therapeutic interventions.</p>

## Spectrum and antibiotic sensitivity of bacterial keratitis: a retrospective analysis of eight years in a Tertiary Referral Hospital in Southwest China

date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Purpose</title><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiological characteristics, distribution of isolates, prevailing patterns, and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial keratitis (BK) in a Tertiary Referral Hospital located in Southwest China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A retrospective analysis was conducted on 660 cases of bacterial keratitis occurring between January 2015 and December 2022. The demographic data, predisposing factors, microbial findings, and antibiotic sensitivity profiles were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Corneal trauma emerged as the most prevalent predisposing factor, accounting for 37.1% of cases. Among these cases, bacterial culture results were positive in 318 cases, 68 species of bacteria were identified. The most common Gram-Positive bacteria isolated overall was the <italic>staphylococcus epidermis</italic> and the most common Gram-Negative bacteria isolated was <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Methicillin-Resistant <italic>Staphylococci</italic> accounted for 18.1% of all Gram-Positive bacteria. The detection rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed an increasing trend over time (<italic>Rs=0.738, P=0.037</italic>). There was a significant decrease in the percentage of Gram-Negative microorganisms over time (<italic>Rs=0.743, P=0.035</italic>). The sensitivity of Gram-Positive bacteria to linezolid, vancomycin, tigecycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and rifampicin was over 98%. The sensitivity rates of Gram-Negative bacteria to amikacin, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone sodium/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefepime were all above 85%. In patients with a history of vegetative trauma, the possibility of BK should be taken into account in addition to the focus on fungal keratitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The microbial composition primarily consists of Gram-Positive cocci and Gram-Negative bacilli. Among the Gram-Positive bacteria, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> are the most frequently encountered, while <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is the predominant Gram-Negative bacteria. To combat Gram-Positive bacteria, vancomycin, linezolid, and rifampicin are considered excellent antimicrobial agents. When targeting Gram-Negative pathogens, third-generation cephalosporins exhibit superior sensitivity compared to first and second-generation counterparts. As an initial empirical treatment for severe cases of bacterial keratitis and those unresponsive to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones in community settings, the combination therapy of vancomycin and tobramycin is a justifiable approach. Bacterial keratitis can be better managed by understanding the local etiology and antibacterial drug susceptibility patterns.</p></sec>

## PAD-mediated citrullination is a novel candidate diagnostic marker and druggable target for HPV-associated cervical cancer

date: 2024-03-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Citrullination is an emerging post-translational modification catalyzed by peptidyl-arginine deiminases (PADs) that convert peptidyl-arginine into peptidyl-citrulline. In humans, the PAD family consists of five isozymes (PADs 1-4, 6) involved in multiple diseases, including cancer. Given that high-risk (hr) human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agents of cervical cancer, in this study, we sought to determine whether PAD-mediated protein citrullination would play a functional role in the HPV-driven transformation of epithelial cells. Here we show that both total protein citrullination and PAD4 expression levels are significantly associated with cervical cancer progression. Specifically, epithelial immunostaining for PAD4 revealed an increasingly higher histoscore from low-grade (CIN1) to high-grade (CIN2, CIN3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions, raising the attractive possibility that PAD4 may be used as tumor staging markers. Furthermore, taking advantage of the epidermoid cervical cancer cell line CaSki, which harbors multiple copies of the integrated HPV16 genome, we show that the expression of E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins is impaired by treatment with the pharmacological pan-PAD inhibitor BB-Cl-amidine. Consistently, p53 and p21, two targets of HPV oncoproteins, are upregulated by the PAD inhibitor, which undergoes cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Altogether, these findings highlight a novel mechanism by which hrHPVs alter host regulatory pathways involved in cell cycle and survival to gain viral fitness, raising the possibility that PADs may represent an attractive target for developing novel host-targeting antivirals effective in preventing cervical cancer progression.</p>
