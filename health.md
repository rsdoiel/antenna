## Pneumococcal carriage in a large Sicilian sample population: impact on the current epidemiological scenario and implications for future vaccination strategies

date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionStreptococcus pneumoniae is a prevalent and virulent global pathogen, with colonization being considered a precondition for pneumococcal disease. Understanding colonization is critical for gaining insights into transmission dynamics and developing effective interventions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization and serotype distribution in the Sicilian population.MethodsObservational study randomly selecting samples belonging to Sicilian individuals whose nasopharyngeal swabs were collected between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022. Pneumococcal colonization was determined using PCR for the pneumococcal autolysin (LytA) gene, and positive samples were serotyped.ResultsThe study sample consisted of 1,196 individuals, with 17.4% testing positive for the LytA gene. Pneumococcal colonization rates fell from birth to 24 years, with a peak in 0-4-year-olds (aOR=6.9; p<0.001). Colonization was higher in colder months, particularly in December (aOR=2.9, p<0.05) and February (aOR=4, p<0.05). Serotypes 22F and 24ABF exhibited strong colonization and an invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) risk, whereas serotypes 4, 6AB, 9VA, and 13 had high colonization but a low IPD risk. Serotypes 3 and 8 exhibited considerable IPD risk but low colonization.ConclusionOur findings provide insights into pneumococcal colonization mechanisms, influencing serotype prevalence, colonization risk variables, and serotype comparisons for colonization and pathogenicity propensity.

## Genomic characterization and tissue tropism variations of two porcine delta coronavirus strains isolated in China

date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) is a member of the Delta coronavirus genus, which can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in piglets. First detected in Hong Kong in 2012, PDCoV has since spread globally. In January 2024, two strains, CHN-ANHZ-2024 and CHN-JSSQ-2024, were isolated from diarrheal piglets in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. Immunofluorescence assays, electron microscopy, and genome sequencing were performed. Genome analysis revealed that both PDCoV strains belonged to the Chinese lineage, exhibiting amino acid mutations in the S1 region compared to other strains within the lineage. Amino acid mutation at position 530L is uniquely associated with the Thai strain. Notably, CHN-JSSQ-2024 was identified as a recombinant strain of DH1 and CHN-AHHN-2024, with the recombination occurring in the S2 subunit. CHN-ANHZ-2024 caused severe diarrhea with an 80% mortality rate, whereas CHN-JSSQ-2024 resulted in mild diarrhea without mortality. Viral load analysis showed CHN-ANHZ-2024 primarily infecting the brain and kidneys, while CHN-JSSQ-2024 targeted the lungs, revealing notable differences in tissue tropism. We designed the RNA scope Probe-PDCoV-N to visualize viral RNA in the positively detected organs, viral RNA was detected in the brain, cerebellum, kidneys, and lungs of the infected piglets. This study highlights significant differences in the pathogenicity and organ tropism of two PDCoV strains. The CHN-ANHZ-2024 strain caused severe diarrhea and high mortality in piglets, while the CHN-JSSQ-2024 strain exhibited much milder symptoms. Additionally, the study elucidated notable differences in organ tropism between the strains, offering valuable insights into the epidemiological characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of PDCoV. These findings provide a foundation for the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies tailored to specific strains in the future.

## Assessing the impact of gut microbiota and metabolic products on acute lung injury following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury: harmful or helpful?

date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common and clinically significant form of tissue damage encountered in medical practice. This pathological process has been thoroughly investigated across a variety of clinical settings, including, but not limited to, sepsis, organ transplantation, shock, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemia, and stroke. Intestinal IRI, in particular, is increasingly recognized as a significant clinical entity due to marked changes in the gut microbiota and their metabolic products, often described as the body’s “second genome.” These changes in intestinal IRI lead to profound alterations in the gut microbiota and their metabolic outputs, impacting not only the pathology of intestinal IRI itself but also influencing the function of other organs through various mechanisms. Notable among these are brain, liver, and kidney injuries, with acute lung injury being especially significant. This review seeks to explore in depth the roles and mechanisms of the gut microbiota and their metabolic products in the progression of acute lung injury initiated by intestinal IRI, aiming to provide a theoretical basis and directions for future research into the treatment of related conditions.
