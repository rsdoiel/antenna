## Exploring blood transcriptomic signatures in patients with herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, severe, and hard-to-treat chronic pain condition in clinics. Although PHN is developed from herpes zoster (HZ), the developing mechanism is unknown. A previous study investigated blood metabolomic and proteomic profiling in patients with PHN and HZ. The current study aims to explore the blood transcriptomic signature of PHN compared to HZ patients. Whole blood from eight PHN and 15 HZ patients was used for RNA-Seq analysis. There were 82 and 1,788 genes detected specifically in the PHN and HZ groups, respectively. PHN-specific genes are involved in viral infection, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and immune response. For genes coexpressed in PHN and HZ patients, there were 407 differential expression genes (DEGs), including 205 upregulated (UP DEGs) and 202 downregulated (DOWN DEGs) in PHN compared to HZ groups. DEGs are involved in viral infection, type I interferon (IFN), and hemoglobin and oxygen carrier activity. UP DEGs are associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs), activated NK cells, and neutrophils, while DOWN DEGs are associated with Tregs, resting NK cells, and monocytes. The results suggest that the metabolism of lipid, glycan, and nucleotides, type I IFN signaling, and altered neutrophil activation are associated with and might contribute to the development of PHN in HZ. It is also suggested that persistent or altered activation of nonspecific immunity may contribute to the development of PHN from HZ.

## Analysis of in vitro expression of virulence genes related to antibiotic and disinfectant resistance in Escherichia coli as an emerging periodontal pathogen

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The collective involvement of virulence markers of Escherichia coli as an emerging pathogen associated with periodontitis remains unexplained. This study aimed to implement an in vitro model of infection using a human epithelial cell line to determine the virulome expression related to the antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genotype and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type in E. coli strains isolated from patients with periodontal diseases. We studied 100 strains of E. coli isolated from patients with gingivitis (n = 12), moderate periodontitis (n = 59), and chronic periodontitis (n = 29). The identification of E. coli and antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genes was performed through PCR. To promote the expression of virulence genes in the strains, an in vitro infection model was used in the human epithelial cell line A549. RNA was extracted using the QIAcube robotic equipment and reverse transcription to cDNA was performed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). The determination of virulence gene expression was performed through real-time PCR. Overall, the most frequently expressed adhesion genes among the isolated strains of gingivitis, moderate periodontitis, and chronic periodontitis were fimH (48%), iha (37%), and papA (18%); those for toxins were usp (33%); those for iron acquisition were feoB (84%), fyuA (62%), irp-2 (61%), and iroN (35%); those for protectins were traT (50%), KpsMT (35%), and ompT (28%); and those for pathogenicity islands were malX (45%). The most common antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genes among gingivitis, moderate periodontitis, and chronic periodontitis strains were sul-2 (43%), blaSHV (47%), blaTEM (45%), tet(A) (41%), dfrA1 (32%), marR-marO (57%), and qacEA1 (79%). The findings revealed the existence of a wide distribution of virulome expression profiles related to the antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genotype and PFGE type in periodontal strains of E. coli. These findings may contribute toward improving the prevention and treatment measures for periodontal diseases associated with E. coli.

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Arthritogenic alphaviruses pose a significant public health concern due to their ability to cause joint inflammation, with emerging evidence of potential neurological consequences. In this review, we examine the immunopathology and immune evasion strategies employed by these viruses, highlighting their complex mechanisms of pathogenesis and neurological implications. We delve into how these viruses manipulate host immune responses, modulate inflammatory pathways, and potentially establish persistent infections. Further, we explore their ability to breach the blood-brain barrier, triggering neurological complications, and how co-infections exacerbate neurological outcomes. This review synthesizes current research to provide a comprehensive overview of the immunopathological mechanisms driving arthritogenic alphavirus infections and their impact on neurological health. By highlighting knowledge gaps, it underscores the need for research to unravel the complexities of virus-host interactions. This deeper understanding is crucial for developing targeted therapies to address both joint and neurological manifestations of these infections.

## A Toxoplasma gondii thioredoxin with cell adhesion and antioxidant function

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundToxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a widespread, zoonotic protozoan intracellular parasite with a complex life cycle, which can cause toxoplasmosis, a potentially serious disease. During the invasion process, T. gondii proteins first bind to the relevant host cell receptors, such as glycosaminoglycan molecule (GAG-binding motif), which is one of the main receptors for parasites or virus to infect host cells. However, research on TGME49_216510 (T. gondii Trx21), a protein from Toxoplasma gondii, is limited.MethodsBioinformatics analysis of the Trx21 protein was performed firstly. And specific primers were then designed using the conserved domain and GAG-binding motif to amplify, express, and purify a fragment of the Trx21 protein. The purified Trx21-GST protein was used for antioxidant and cell adhesion experiments. Simultaneously, mice were immunized with Trx21-His to generate specific polyclonal antibodies for subcellular localization analysis.ResultsThe Trx21 protein, consisting of 774 amino acids, included a transmembrane region, three GAG-binding motifs, and a Thioredoxin-like domain. The recombinant Trx21-His protein had a molecular mass of about 31 kDa, while the Trx21-GST protein had a molecular mass of about 55 kDa, which was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Subcellular localization analysis by IFA revealed that Trx21 is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm of T. gondii. Furthermore, Trx21 exhibited a protective effect on supercoiled DNA against metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) and demonstrated adhesion abilities to Vero cells.ConclusionsThese results indicate that Trx21 plays an important role in host cell interaction and oxidative damage.

## An in-depth study on survival mechanism of bacterial isolates in disinfectants within the hospital environment

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe emergence of disinfectant resistance has become a severe threat due to reduced effectiveness. This study was undertaken to determine how bacteria adapt to survive exposure to disinfectants in the busiest section of a tertiary care hospital in Varanasi, India.MethodsFour isolates (two Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kp1 and Kp2; two Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pa1 and Pa2) were obtained from chlorhexidine (CHX)–based handwash during microbiological surveillance of “in-use disinfectants” in hospital. Six disinfectants [4% CHX, 2% glutaraldehyde, 7.5% hydrogen peroxide, 1% sodium hypochlorite and 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and 70% ethyl alcohol] were tested against these four isolates to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Antibiotic profile, change in MIC on exposure to disinfectants and biofilm formation in the presence and absence of disinfectants was studied. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was done to identify the resistance mechanisms.ResultThe isolates showed the highest MBC/MIC ratio (4) against glutaraldehyde. Exposure to supra-inhibitory concentration of BAC for 21 days resulted in doubling of MIC/MBC. The majority (75%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant. All the isolates were strong biofilm producers. The reduction rate of biofilm formation decreased with an increase in the concentration of disinfectants (p = 0.05 for BAC). WGS revealed multiple AMR genes including blaDIM-1, disinfectant-resistant gene and efflux pump genes.ConclusionThe study emphasized the various adaptation strategies of these isolates for survival in disinfectant environment, thus posing a huge challenge for their control in the hospital environment.

## Molecular characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of KPC-3 producing hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST23-K1)

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aimed to comprehensively investigate hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKP) in the Ningbo region. Importantly, we sought to elucidate its molecular characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms. This information will provide evidence-based insights for preventing and controlling nosocomial infections and facilitate improved clinical diagnosis and treatment in this region. Methods96 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were collected from the Ningbo region between January 2021 and December 2022. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic methods were employed to identify and characterize CR-hvKP strains at the molecular level. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of common clinical antibiotics were determined using the VITEK-2 Compact automatic microbiological analyzer. Plasmid conjugation experiments evaluated the transferability of resistance plasmids. Finally, mouse virulence assays were conducted to explore the pathogenic mechanisms.ResultsAmong the 96 strains, a single CR-hvKP strain, designated CR-hvKP57, was identified, with an isolation frequency of 1.04%. Whole-genome sequencing revealed the strain to be ST23 serotype with a K1 capsule. This strain harbored three plasmids. Plasmid 1, a pLVPK-like virulence plasmid, carried multiple virulence genes, including rmpA, rmpA2, iroB, iucA, and terB. Plasmid 2 contained transposable element sequences such as IS15 and IS26. Plasmid 3, classified as a resistance plasmid, harbored the blaKPC-3 carbapenem resistance gene. Mouse virulence assays demonstrated a high mortality rate associated with CR-hvKP57 infection. Additionally, there was a significant increase in IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in response to CR-hvKP57 infection, indicating varying degrees of inflammatory response. Western blot experiments further suggested that the pathogenic mechanism involves activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.ConclusionThis study confirms the emergence of hypervirulent CR-hvKP in the Ningbo region, which likely resulted from the acquisition of a pLVPK-like virulence plasmid and a blaKPC-3 resistance plasmid by the ST23-K1 type Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more judicious use of antibiotics to limit the emergence of resistance. Additionally, strengthening infection prevention and control measures is crucial to minimize the spread of virulence and resistance plasmids.

## Research progress on the pattern recognition receptors involved in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating infectious diseases of pigs globally. The pathogen, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus, which is considered to be the key triggers for the activation of effective innate immunity through pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-dependent signaling pathways. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and Cytoplasmic DNA receptors (CDRs) are used as PRRs to identify distinct but overlapping microbial components. The innate immune system has evolved to recognize RNA or DNA molecules from microbes through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and to induce defense response against infections, including the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and inflammatory cytokines. However, PRRSV is capable of continuous evolution through gene mutation and recombination to evade host immune defenses and exploit host cell mechanisms to synthesize and transport its components, thereby facilitating successful infection and replication. This review presents the research progress made in recent years in the study of these PRRs and their associated adapters during PRRSV infection.

## Effect of anti-biofilm peptide CRAMP-34 on the biofilms of Acinetobacter lwoffii derived from dairy cows

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Dairy mastitis is one of the most common diseases in dairy farming, and the formation of pathogenic bacteria biofilms may be an important reason why traditional antibiotic therapy fails to resolve some cases of dairy mastitis. We isolated and identified three strains of A. lwoffii were with strong biofilm forming ability from dairy cow mastitis samples from Chongqing dairy farms in China. In order to investigate the effect of novel anti-biofilm peptide CRAMP-34 on A.lwoffii biofilms, the anti-biofilm effect was evaluated by crystal violet staining, biofilms viable bacteria counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In addition, transcriptome sequencing analysis, qRT-PCR and phenotypic verification were used to explore the mechanism of its action. The results showed that CRAMP-34 had a dose-dependent eradicating effect on A. lwoffii biofilms. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that 36 differentially expressed genes (11 up-regulated and 25 down-regulated) were detected after the intervention with the sub-inhibitory concentration of CRAMP-34. These differentially expressed genes may be related to enzyme synthesis, fimbriae, iron uptake system, capsular polysaccharide and other virulence factors through the functional analysis of differential genes. The results of subsequent bacterial motility and adhesion tests showed that the motility of A.lwoffii were enhanced after the intervention of CRAMP-34, but there was no significant change in adhesion. It was speculated that CRAMP-34 may promote the dispersion of biofilm bacteria by enhancing the motility of biofilm bacteria, thereby achieving the effect of eradicating biofilms. Therefore, these results, along with our other previous findings, suggest that CRAMP-34 holds promise as a new biofilm eradicator and deserves further research and development.

## Clinical features and outcomes in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a single center retrospective cohort study

date: 2024-08-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the clinical features, treatment outcomes, and short-term prognosis in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with concurrent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.MethodsKTRs with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to our hospital from December 28, 2022, to March 28, 2023 were included in the study. Their clinical symptoms, responses to antiviral medications, and short-term prognosis were analyzed.ResultsA total of 64 KTRs with initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this study. The primary symptoms were fever, cough, and myalgia, with an incidence of 79.7%, 89.1%, and 46.9%, respectively. The administration of antiviral drugs (paxlovid or molnupiravir) within 1–5 days and for over 5 days demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral shedding time compared to the group without antiviral medication (P=0.002). Both the paxlovid and molnupiravir treatment groups exhibited a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding time in comparison to the group without antiviral drugs (P=0.002). After 6 months of recovery, there was no significantly negative impact on transplant kidney function (P=0.294).ConclusionFever, cough, and myalgia remain common initial symptoms of concurrent COVID-19 pneumonia in KTRs. Early use of antiviral drugs (paxlovid or molnupiravir) is associated with better therapeutic outcomes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a limited impact on the short-term renal function of the KTRs with concurrent moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

## The gut microbiota intervenes in glucose tolerance and inflammation by regulating the biosynthesis of taurodeoxycholic acid and carnosine

date: 2024-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia and its associated vasculopathy using multiomics analyses in diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, and validate the mechanism using the cell experiments.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the metagenomic sequencing data of diabetes to explore the key genera related to its occurrence. Subsequently, participants diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and healthy subjects, were recruited for fecal and blood sample collection. The dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (GM) and its associated metabolites were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry, respectively. The regulation of gene and protein expression was evaluated through mRNA sequencing and data-independent acquisition technology, respectively. The specific mechanism by which GM dysbiosis affects hyperglycemia and its related vasculopathy was investigated using real-time qPCR, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques in HepG2 cells and neutrophils.ResultsBased on the published data, the key alterable genera in the GM associated with diabetes were identified as Blautia, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Lachnoclostridium. The related metabolic pathways were identified as cholate degradation and L-histidine biosynthesis. Noteworthy, Blautia and Faecalibacterium displayed similar alterations in patients with IGT compared to those observed in patients with diabetes, and the GM  metabolites, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and carnosine (CARN, a downstream metabolite of histidine and alanine) were both found to be decreased, which in turn regulated the expression of proteins in plasma and mRNAs in neutrophils. Subsequent experiments focused on insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and interleukin-6 due to their impact on blood glucose regulation and associated vascular inflammation. Both proteins were found to be suppressed by TUDCA and CARN in HepG2 cells and neutrophils.ConclusionDysbiosis of the GM occurred throughout the entire progression from IGT to diabetes, characterized by an increase in Blautia and a decrease in Faecalibacterium, leading to reduced levels of TUDCA and CARN, which alleviated their inhibition on the expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 and interleukin-6, contributing to the development of hyperglycemia and associated vasculopathy.

## Viral infections in etiology of mental disorders: a broad analysis of cytokine profile similarities – a narrative review

date: 2024-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The recent pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the associated mental health complications have renewed scholarly interest in the relationship between viral infections and the development of mental illnesses, a topic that was extensively discussed in the previous century in the context of other viruses, such as influenza. The most probable and analyzable mechanism through which viruses influence the onset of mental illnesses is the inflammation they provoke. Both infections and mental illnesses share a common characteristic: an imbalance in inflammatory factors. In this study, we sought to analyze and compare cytokine profiles in individuals infected with viruses and those suffering from mental illnesses. The objective was to determine whether specific viral diseases can increase the risk of specific mental disorders and whether this risk can be predicted based on the cytokine profile of the viral disease. To this end, we reviewed existing literature, constructed cytokine profiles for various mental and viral diseases, and conducted comparative analyses. The collected data indicate that the risk of developing a specific mental illness cannot be determined solely based on cytokine profiles. However, it was observed that the combination of IL-8 and IL-10 is frequently associated with psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to assess the risk of mental disorders in infected patients, it is imperative to consider the type of virus, the mental complications commonly associated with it, the predominant cytokines to evaluate the risk of psychotic symptoms, and additional patient-specific risk factors.

## Clinical features and prognostic factors of cryptococcal infections in HIV-infected patients: a 10-year study from an infectious disease specialist hospital

date: 2024-08-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundCryptococcosis is an invasive infection that commonly affects immunosuppressed individuals, especially patients with HIV infection. Cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients should be considered a major health concern because it is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of cryptococcal infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients to facilitate effective clinical management and improve patient outcomes.MethodsWe reviewed and analyzed the clinical data and relevant laboratory test results of HIV-infected patients with positive cryptococcal cultures and reserved strains between 2013 and 2023 from Beijing Youan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University. The clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of the patients were compared, and the correlation between parameters and the prognoses of the patients at different observation timepoints (3, 6, 9, and 12 months) was analyzed.ResultsA total of 76 patients (70 males and six females; median age, 37 years) were included in this study. The results indicated that the later the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) after the diagnosis of HIV infection (> 6 months), the higher the probability of death. Analysis of the correlation between the time of ART initiation and the timing of treatment for cryptococcal infections showed that the time of ART initiation was strongly related to survival at different timepoints. Initiation of ART time within 0-4 weeks, 4-6 weeks and more than 6weeks of starting treatment for Cryptococcus infection was associated with a lower mortality rate at 12-month, the 3-month, 6- and 9-month follow-up timepoint separately.ConclusionsAlthough cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected patients continues to be a challenging and intricate issue, ART is a key factor that affects its prognosis. The later ART is started, the worse the prognosis of the infection. The time of ART initiation and the timing of treatment for cryptococcal infections should be further refined and balanced based on different clinical courses. Thus, clinicians should pay closer attention to cryptococcal infections in patients with HIV infection and initiate ART based on the patient’s clinical condition.

## The immune factors involved in the rapid clearance of bacteria from the midgut of the tick Ixodes ricinus

date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Ticks are obligate hematophagous arthropods that transmit a wide range of pathogens to humans as well as wild and domestic animals. They also harbor a non-pathogenic microbiota, although our previous study has shown that the diverse bacterial microbiome in the midgut of Ixodes ricinus is quantitatively poor and lacks a core. In artificial infections by capillary feeding of ticks with two model bacteria (Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative Pantoea sp.), rapid clearance of these microbes from the midgut was observed, indicating the presence of active immune mechanisms in this organ. In the current study, RNA-seq analysis was performed on the midgut of I. ricinus females inoculated with either M. luteus or Pantoea sp. or with sterile water as a control. While no immune-related transcripts were upregulated by microbial inoculation compared to that of the sterile control, capillary feeding itself triggered dramatic transcriptional changes in the tick midgut. Manual curation of the transcriptome from the midgut of unfed I. ricinus females, complemented by the proteomic analysis, revealed the presence of several constitutively expressed putative antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are independent of microbial stimulation and are referred to here as ‘guard’ AMPs. These included two types of midgut-specific defensins, two different domesticated amidase effector 2 (Dae2), microplusin/ricinusin-related molecules, two lysozymes, and two gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductases (GILTs). The in vitro antimicrobial activity assays of two synthetic mature defensins, defensin 1 and defensin 8, confirmed their specificity against Gram-positive bacteria showing exceptional potency to inhibit the growth of M. luteus at nanomolar concentrations. The antimicrobial activity of midgut defensins is likely part of a multicomponent system responsible for the rapid clearance of bacteria in the tick midgut. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of other identified ‘guard’ AMPs in controlling microorganisms entering the tick midgut.

## Postoperative delayed gastric emptying: may gut microbiota play a role?

date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Postoperative delayed gastric emptying is a prevalent complication following surgical procedures, imposing heavy physical and financial burdens on patients. However, current treatment options remain suboptimal. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have highlighted that the gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely associated with postoperative complications. Various factors can disrupt the gut microbiome after surgery. This review discusses the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and their metabolites may contribute to the pathogenesis of postoperative delayed gastric emptying. However, the current knowledge base is limited in terms of fully understanding the exact mechanisms involved. It is therefore evident that further research is required to fully elucidate the role of the gut microbiome in postoperative delayed gastric emptying, with the aim of uncovering new possibilities for preventive measures and therapeutic treatments.

## The potential role of heparin-binding protein in neonatal sepsis: research progress

date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Neonatal sepsis is a major global health challenge, leading to significant morbidity and mortality in newborns. The search for precise biomarkers for its early prediction in clinical settings has been ongoing, with heparin-binding protein (HBP) emerging as a promising candidate. Originating from granules in neutrophils, HBP is released into the bloodstream in response to infection and plays a pivotal role in the body’s inflammatory response. Its significance extends beyond its inflammatory origins; research indicates dynamic changes in HBP levels are strongly linked to reduce in-hospital mortality, offering a prognostic advantage over existing biomarkers. Furthermore, HBP has demonstrated considerable clinical utility in the early diagnosis and stratification of neonatal sepsis, suggesting its potential as a reliable blood marker for early prediction of the disease and its severity. Its application may extend to guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in treating newborns, addressing a critical aspect of neonatal care. Despite these encouraging results, the precise clinical utility of HBP for diagnosing and treating sepsis in neonates still demands further clarification through extensive research. This review delves into the current scientific understanding of HBP’s contribution to diagnosing, prognosticating, and treating neonatal sepsis, while considering its future clinical applications.

## Loss of Opi3 causes a lipid imbalance that influences the virulence traits of Cryptococcus neoformans but not cryptococcosis

date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a useful model for investigating mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis in mammalian hosts. This pathogen is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised patients and is in the critical priority group of the World Health Organization fungal priority pathogens list. In this study, we employed a mutant lacking the OPI3 gene encoding a methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase to characterize the role of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lipid homeostasis in the virulence of C. neoformans. We first confirmed that OPI3 was required for growth in nutrient limiting conditions, a phenotype that could be rescued with exogenous choline and PC. Additionally, we established that loss of Opi3 and the lack of PC lead to an accumulation of neutral lipids in lipid droplets and alterations in major lipid classes. The growth defect of the opi3Δ mutant was also rescued by sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG), a result consistent with protection of ER function from the stress caused by lipid imbalance. We then examined the impact of Opi3 on virulence and found that the dependence of PC synthesis on Opi3 caused reduced capsule size and this was accompanied by an increase in shed capsule polysaccharide and changes in cell wall composition. Further tests of virulence demonstrated that survival in alveolar macrophages and the ability to cause disease in mice were not impacted by loss of Opi3 despite the choline auxotrophy of the mutant in vitro. Overall, this work establishes the contribution of lipid balance to virulence factor elaboration by C. neoformans and suggests that host choline is sufficient to support proliferation during disease.

## Potential treatment of glutathione in bullfrogs with abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism revealed by hepatic lipid metabolism and serum metabolomics analysis

date: 2024-08-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionWith the continuous growth of bullfrog supply, it has become an important aquaculture species. Due to the lack of actionable industry standards and regulation, the misuse of anti-disease drugs and abnormal liver lipid metabolism in bullfrogs have become a major obstacle to the development of bullfrog aquaculture industry. Glutathione is a natural tripeptide that can be synthesized intracellularly, and its physiological functions mainly include the treatment of liver diseases, antioxidant, detoxification, anti-tumor, enhancement of immunity, and delaying aging.MethodsIn this study, the therapeutic effect of glutathione on bullfrogs with abnormal liver lipid metabolism was revealed from hepatic lipid metabolism and serum metabolomics analysis. The survival rate, liver histomorphology, serum antioxidant enzyme activity, liver lipase activity and serum metabolomics, liver metabolomics were studied and analyzed by feeding the bullfrogs with abnormal lipid metabolism with glutathione for 20 days in the NC, FI and GSH groups.ResultsThe results of the study showed that glutathione was able to repair the liver and improve the survival rate of bullfrogs with abnormal lipid metabolism; the activity of serum SOD enzymes was significantly increased; the activities of ACP and AKP were significantly decreased; the activities of HDL-C and T-CHO were significantly increased; and the activities of LDL-C, TBA, and TG were significantly decreased in the liver; the contents of metabolites, such as PC, PS, and PE were significantly up-regulated, and the levels of up-regulated Autophagy - other, Necroptosis and ErbB signaling pathway, and down-regulated Sphingolipid metabolism, D-Amino acid metabolism metabolic pathway, to some extent The metabolic pathways of Sphingolipid metabolism and D-Amino acid metabolism were down-regulated to alleviate the disorders of glycerophospholipid and amino acid metabolism to a certain extent, thus alleviating the abnormalities of liver lipid metabolism.DiscussionThe results showed that glutathione could effectively treat the liver lipid metabolism disorder of bullfrogs, promote the growth and development of bullfrogs, repair the liver function, reduce the inflammation, and promote the healthy and green development of bullfrog industry.

IntroductionThe Burkholderia cepacia complex encompasses a group of gram-negative opportunistic pathogens that cause chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. Distinct from other respiratory pathogens, Burkholderia causes a unique clinical disease in a subset of patients known as ‘cepacia syndrome’, fulminant pneumonia accompanied by bacteraemia and sepsis with a mortality rate of up to 75%. Due to the bacteraemia associated with this disease, the mechanisms that allow Burkholderia to resist the bactericidal effects of serum complement-depending killing are vital. Antibodies usually promote serum killing; however, we have described ‘cloaking antibodies’, specific for lipopolysaccharides that paradoxically protect serum-sensitive bacteria from complement-mediated lysis. Cloaking antibodies that protect Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in 24%–41% of patients with chronic lung diseases. The presence of these antibodies is also associated with worse clinical outcomes. Here, we sought to determine the relevance of cloaking antibodies in patients with Burkholderia infection.MethodsTwelve Burkholderia spp. were isolated from nine pwCF and characterised for susceptibility to healthy control serum. Patient serum was analysed for the titre of the cloaking antibody. The ability of the patient serum to prevent healthy control serum (HCS) killing of its cognate isolates was determined.ResultsWe found that several of the Burkholderia strains were shared between patients. Ten of the 12 isolates were highly susceptible to HCS killing. Four of nine (44%) patients had cloaking antibodies that protected their cognate strain from serum killing. Depleting cloaking antibodies from patient serum restored HCS killing of Burkholderia isolates.DiscussionCloaking antibodies are prevalent in patients with Burkholderia pulmonary infection and protect these strains from serum killing. Removal of cloaking antibodies via plasmapheresis, as previously described for individuals with life-threatening Pseudomonas infection, may be a useful new strategy for those with serious and life-threatening Burkholderia infection.

## Exploring the gut microbiota’s effect on temporomandibular joint disorder: a two−sample Mendelian randomization analysis

date: 2024-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTemporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are highly prevalent among people. Numerous investigations have revealed the impact of gut microbiota in many diseases. However, the causal relationship between Temporomandibular joint disorders and gut microbiota remains unclear.MethodsGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) refer to the identification of sequence variations, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), existing across the entire human genome. GWAS data were collected on gut microbiota and TMD. Then, instrumental variables were screened through F-values and removal of linkage disequilibrium. These SNPs underwent mendelian analysis using five mathematical models. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to further verify the stability of the results. Pathogenic factors of TMD mediate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and TMD were explored through a two-step Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, reverse mendelian analysis was conducted to account for potential reverse effects.ResultsThe analysis of the data in this article suggests that some gut microbiota, including Coprobacter, Ruminococcus torques group, Catenibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Turicibacter, Victivallis, MollicutesRF9, Methanobacteriales, Methanobacteriaceae, FamilyXI, Methanobacteria were identified as risk factors, while Peptococcaceae provides protection for TMD.ConclusionThe research reveals the relation of gut microbiota in TMD. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and suggest potential therapeutic strategy.
