## Antifungal, anti-biofilm, and anti-hyphal properties of N-substituted phthalimide derivatives against Candida species

date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Candida species comprise a ubiquitous pathogenic fungal genus responsible for causing candidiasis. They are one of the primary causatives of several mucosal and systemic infections in humans and can survive in various environments. In this study, we investigated the antifungal, anti-biofilm, and anti-hyphal effects of six N-substituted phthalimides against three Candida species. Of the derivatives, N-butylphthalimide (NBP) was the most potent, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 µg/ml and which dose-dependently inhibited biofilm at sub-inhibitory concentrations (10–50 µg/ml) in both the fluconazole-resistant and fluconazole-sensitive Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. NBP also effectively inhibited biofilm formation in other pathogens including uropathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, along with the polymicrobial biofilms of S. epidermidis and C. albicans. NBP markedly inhibited the hyphal formation and cell aggregation of C. albicans and altered its colony morphology in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression analysis showed that NBP significantly downregulated the expression of important hyphal- and biofilm-associated genes, i.e., ECE1, HWP1, and UME6, upon treatment. NBP also exhibited mild toxicity at concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 µg/ml in a nematode model. Therefore, this study suggests that NBP has anti-biofilm and antifungal potential against various Candida strains.

## Gut microbes improve prognosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary infection through the lung-gut axis

date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe gut microbiota plays a vital role in the development of sepsis and in protecting against pneumonia. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of the gut-lung axis and the interaction between the gut and the lung, which is related to the prognosis of critically ill patients; however, most of these studies focused on chronic lung diseases and influenza virus infections. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on Klebsiella pneumoniae-related pulmonary infection via the gut-lung axis and to compare the effects of FMT with those of traditional antibiotics to identify new therapeutic strategies.MethodsWe divided the mice into six groups: the blank control (PBS), pneumonia-derived sepsis (KP), pneumonia-derived sepsis + antibiotic (KP + PIP), pneumonia-derived sepsis + faecal microbiota transplantation(KP + FMT), antibiotic treatment control (KP+PIP+PBS), and pneumonia-derived sepsis+ antibiotic + faecal microbiota transplantation (KP + PIP + FMT) groups to compare the survival of mice, lung injury, inflammation response, airway barrier function and the intestinal flora, metabolites and drug resistance genes in each group.ResultsAlterations in specific intestinal flora can occur in the gut of patients with pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Compared with those in the faecal microbiota transplantation group, the antibiotic treatment group had lower levels of proinflammatory factors and higher levels of anti-inflammatory factors but less amelioration of lung pathology and improvement of airway epithelial barrier function. Additionally, the increase in opportunistic pathogens and drug resistance-related genes in the gut of mice was accompanied by decreased production of favourable fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, decanoic acid, and secondary bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid 3-sulfate, isodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and 3-dehydrocholic acid; the levels of these metabolites were restored by faecal microbiota transplantation. Faecal microbiota transplantation after antibiotic treatment can gradually ameliorate gut microbiota disorder caused by antibiotic treatment and reduce the number of drug resistance genes induced by antibiotics.ConclusionIn contrast to direct antibiotic treatment, faecal microbiota transplantation improves the prognosis of mice with pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae by improving the structure of the intestinal flora and increasing the level of beneficial metabolites, fatty acids and secondary bile acids, thereby reducing systemic inflammation, repairing the barrier function of alveolar epithelial cells, and alleviating pathological damage to the lungs. The combination of antibiotics with faecal microbiota transplantation significantly alleviates intestinal microbiota disorder, reduces the selection for drug resistance genes caused by antibiotics, and mitigates lung lesions; these effects are superior to those following antibiotic monotherapy.

## Beyond the double helix: the multifaceted landscape of extracellular DNA in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms

date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Staphylococcus aureus forms biofilms consisting of cells embedded in a matrix made of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Biofilm-associated infections are difficult to treat and can promote antibiotic resistance, resulting in negative healthcare outcomes. eDNA within the matrix contributes to the stability, growth, and immune-evasive properties of S. aureus biofilms. eDNA is released by autolysis, which is mediated by murein hydrolases that access the cell wall via membrane pores formed by holin-like proteins. The eDNA content of S. aureus biofilms varies among individual strains and is influenced by environmental conditions, including the presence of antibiotics. eDNA plays an important role in biofilm development and structure by acting as an electrostatic net that facilitates protein-cell and cell-cell interactions. Because of eDNA’s structural importance in biofilms and its ubiquitous presence among S. aureus isolates, it is a potential target for therapeutics. Treatment of biofilms with DNase can eradicate or drastically reduce them in size. Additionally, antibodies that target DNABII proteins, which bind to and stabilize eDNA, can also disperse biofilms. This review discusses the recent literature on the release, structure, and function of eDNA in S. aureus biofilms, in addition to a discussion of potential avenues for targeting eDNA for biofilm eradication.

## Ceftazidime/avibactam resistance is associated with PER-3-producing ST309 lineage in Chilean clinical isolates of non-carbapenemase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCeftazidime/avibactam (CZA) is indicated against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly those that are carbapenem resistant. CZA resistance in P. aeruginosa producing PER, a class A extended-spectrum β-lactamase, has been well documented in vitro. However, data regarding clinical isolates are scarce. Our aim was to analyze the contribution of PER to CZA resistance in non-carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates that were ceftazidime and/or carbapenem non-susceptible.MethodsAntimicrobial susceptibility was determined through agar dilution and broth microdilution, while blaPER gene was screened through PCR. All PER-positive isolates and five PER-negative isolates were analyzed through Whole Genome Sequencing. The mutational resistome associated to CZA resistance was determined through sequence analysis of genes coding for PBPs 1b, 3 and 4, MexAB-OprM regulators MexZ, MexR, NalC and NalD, AmpC regulators AmpD and AmpR, and OprD porin. Loss of blaPER-3 gene was induced in a PER-positive isolate by successive passages at 43°C without antibiotics. ResultsTwenty-six of 287 isolates studied (9.1%) were CZA-resistant. Thirteen of 26 CZA-resistant isolates (50%) carried blaPER. One isolate carried blaPER but was CZA-susceptible. PER-producing isolates had significantly higher MICs for CZA, amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, meropenem and ciprofloxacin than non-PER-producing isolates. All PER-producing isolates were ST309 and their blaPER-3 gene was associated to ISCR1, an insertion sequence known to mobilize adjacent DNA. PER-negative isolates were classified as ST41, ST235 (two isolates), ST395 and ST253. PER-negative isolates carried genes for narrow-spectrum β-lactamases and the mutational resistome showed that all isolates had one major alteration in at least one of the genes analyzed. Loss of blaPER-3 gene restored susceptibility to CZA, ceftolozane/tazobactam and other β-lactamsin the in vitro evolved isolate. DiscussionPER-3-producing ST309 P. aeruginosa is a successful multidrug-resistant clone with blaPER-3 gene implicated in resistance to CZA and other β-lactams.

## A novel pathogenic species of genus Stenotrophomonas: Stenotrophomonas pigmentata sp. nov

date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionStenotrophomonas is a prominent genus owing to its dual nature. Species of this genus have many applications in industry and agriculture as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and microbial biological control agents, whereas species such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are considered one of the leading gram-negative multi-drug-resistant bacterial pathogens because of their high contribution to the increase in crude mortality and significant clinical challenge. Pathogenic Stenotrophomonas species and most clinical isolates belong to the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia complex (SMc). However, a strain highly homologous to S. terrae was isolated from a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which aroused our interest, as S. terrae belongs to a relatively distant clade from SMc and there have been no human association reports.MethodsThe pathogenicity, immunological and biochemical characteristics of 610A2T were systematically evaluated.Results610A2T is a new species of genus Stenotrophomonas, which is named as Stenotrophomonas pigmentata sp. nov. for its obvious brown water-soluble pigment. 610A2T is pathogenic and caused significant weight loss, pulmonary congestion, and blood transmission in mice because it has multiple virulence factors, haemolysis, and strong biofilm formation abilities. In addition, the cytokine response induced by this strain was similar to that observed in patients with TB, and the strain was resistant to half of the anti-TB drugs.ConclusionsThe pathogenicity of 610A2T may not be weaker than that of S. maltophilia. Its isolation extended the opportunistic pathogenic species to all 3 major clades of the genus Stenotrophomonas, indicating that the clinical importance of species of Stenotrophomonas other than S. maltophilia and potential risks to biological safety associated with the use of Stenotrophomonas require more attention.

## Probiotic bacteria can modulate immune responses to paratuberculosis vaccination

date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the etiological agent of paratuberculosis (PTB), a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease that causes high economical losses in dairy livestock worldwide. Due to the absence of widely available preventive or therapeutical treatments, new alternative therapies are needed. In this study, the effect of a probiotic alone or in combination with a commercial vaccine has been evaluated in a rabbit model. Vaccination enhanced the humoral response, exerted a training effect of peripheral polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) against homologous and heterologous stimuli, stimulated the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) macrophages, and reduced the bacterial burden in GALT as well. However, the administration of the probiotic after vaccination did not affect the PMN activity, increased metabolic demand, and supressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, although humoral response and bacterial burden decrease in GALT was maintained similar to vaccination alone. The administration of the probiotic alone did not enhance the humoral response or PMN activity, and the bacterial burden in GALT was further increased compared to the only challenged group. In conclusion, the probiotic was able to modulate the immune response hampering the clearance of the infection and was also able to affect the response of innate immune cells after vaccination. This study shows that the administration of a probiotic can modulate the immune response pathways triggered by vaccination and/or infection and even exacerbate the outcome of the disease, bringing forward the importance of verifying treatment combinations in the context of each particular infectious agent.

## Clinical evaluation of droplet digital PCR in the early identification of suspected sepsis patients in the emergency department: a prospective observational study

date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRapid and accurate diagnosis of the causative agents is essential for clinical management of bloodstream infections (BSIs) that might induce sepsis/septic shock. A considerable number of suspected sepsis patients initially enter the health-care system through an emergency department (ED), hence it is vital to establish an early strategy to recognize sepsis and initiate prompt care in ED. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical value of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay in suspected sepsis patients in the ED.MethodsThis was a prospective single-centered observational study including patients admitted to the ED from 25 October 2022 to 3 June 2023 with suspected BSIs screened by Modified Shapiro Score (MSS) score. The comparison between ddPCR and blood culture (BC) was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ddPCR for BSIs. Meanwhile, correlative analysis between ddPCR and the inflammatory and prognostic-related biomarkers were conducted to explore the relevance. Further, the health economic evaluation of the ddPCR was analyzed.Results258 samples from 228 patients, with BC and ddPCR performed simultaneously, were included in this study. We found that ddPCR results were positive in 48.13% (103 of 214) of episodes, with identification of 132 pathogens. In contrast, BC only detected 18 positives, 88.89% of which were identified by ddPCR. When considering culture-proven BSIs, ddPCR shows an overall sensitivity of 88.89% and specificity of 55.61%, the optimal diagnostic power for quantifying BSI through ddPCR is achieved with a copy cutoff of 155.5. We further found that ddPCR exhibited a high accuracy especially in liver abscess patients. Among all the identified virus by ddPCR, EBV has a substantially higher positive rate with a link to immunosuppression. Moreover, the copies of pathogens in ddPCR were positively correlated with various markers of inflammation, coagulation, immunity as well as prognosis. With high sensitivity and specificity, ddPCR facilitates precision antimicrobial stewardship and reduces health care costs.ConclusionsThe multiplexed ddPCR delivers precise and quantitative load data on the causal pathogen, offers the ability to monitor the patient’s condition and may serve as early warning of sepsis in time-urgent clinical situations as ED.ImportanceEarly detection and effective administration of antibiotics are essential to improve clinical outcomes for those with life-threatening infection in the emergency department. ddPCR, an emerging tool for rapid and sensitive pathogen identification used as a precise bedside test, has developed to address the current challenges of BSI diagnosis and precise treatment. It characterizes sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and absolute quantifications without a standard curve. ddPCR can detect causative pathogens and related resistance genes in patients with suspected BSIs within a span of three hours. In addition, it can identify polymicrobial BSIs and dynamically monitor changes in pathogenic microorganisms in the blood and can be used to evaluate antibiotic efficacy and survival prognosis. Moreover, the copies of pathogens in ddPCR were positively correlated with various markers of inflammation, coagulation, immunity. With high sensitivity and specificity, ddPCR facilitates precision antimicrobial stewardship and reduces health care costs.

## Antifungal and antibiofilm effects of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius, zinc nanoparticles, and zinc nanocomposites against Candida albicans from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), water and humans

date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCandida albicans (C. albicans) can form biofilms; a critical virulence factor that provides effective protection from commercial antifungals and contributes to public health issues. The development of new antifungal therapies, particularly those targeting biofilms, is imperative. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the antifungal and antibiofilm effects of Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius), zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) and nanocomposites (ZnNCs) on C. albicans isolates from Nile tilapia, fish wash water and human fish sellers in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt.MethodsA cross-sectional study collected 300 samples from tilapia, fish wash water, and fish sellers (100 each). Probiotic L. salivarius was immobilized with ZnNPs to synthesize ZnNCs. The study assessed the antifungal and antibiofilm activities of ZnNPs, L. salivarius, and ZnNCs compared to amphotericin (AMB).ResultsCandida spp. were detected in 38 samples, which included C. albicans (42.1%), C. glabrata (26.3%), C. krusei (21.1%), and C. parapsilosis (10.5%). A total of 62.5% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antifungal agent, with the highest resistance to nystatin (62.5%). However, 75% of the isolates were highly susceptible to AMB. All C. albicans isolates exhibited biofilm-forming capabilities, with 4 (25%) isolates showing strong biofilm formation. At least one virulence-associated gene (RAS1, HWP1, ALS3, or SAP4) was identified among the C. albicans isolates. Probiotics L. salivarius, ZnNPs, and ZnNCs displayed antibiofilm and antifungal effects against C. albicans, with ZnNCs showing significantly higher inhibitory activity. ZnNCs, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 10 µg/mL, completely reduced C. albicans biofilm gene expression. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy images of C. albicans biofilms treated with ZnNCs revealed asymmetric, wrinkled surfaces, cell deformations, and reduced cell numbers.ConclusionThis study identified virulent, resistant C. albicans isolates with strong biofilm-forming abilities in tilapia, water, and humans, that pose significant risks to public health and food safety.

## The association between hepatitis C virus infection status and blood pressure in adults in the United States: NHANES 1999–2012

date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors, but the relationship with blood pressure (BP) remains unclear.ObjectivesTo assess the association between HCV infection status and BP in US adults.MethodsData for the study were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2012. The association of HCV infection status (including HCV infection, current HCV infection, and past HCV infection) with hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were explored using logistic or linear regression analyses respectively.ResultsA total of 25,850 participants (age≥18 years) were enrolled in the current study, including 14,162 participants with hypertension. After adjusting for all covariates, HCV infection/current HCV infection was not associated with hypertension and SBP compared to participants with non-HCV infection (OR: 1.34,95% CI 0.96–1.87/1.31 95% CI 0.91,1.91, β: -0.92, 95% CI -2.7–0.86/-0.35 95% CI -2.51,1.81, respectively). HCV infection/current HCV infection was only associated with elevated DBP (β: 4.1,95% CI 2.57–5.63/4.24,95% CI 2.27–6.21). However, there was no correlation with past HCV infection in participants with hypertension, SBP, and DBP compared to those with non-HCV infection (OR: 1.23,95% CI 0.59–2.54; β: -3.79, 95% CI -7.67–0.08 and 2.28 95% CI -0.36–4.92, respectively).ConclusionIn a representative sample of US adults, it was found that both HCV infection and current HCV infection were independently linked to higher DBP. However, there was no association between past HCV infection and DBP.

## Lung microbiome: new insights into bronchiectasis’ outcome

date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The present treatments for bronchiectasis, which is defined by pathological dilatation of the airways, are confined to symptom relief and minimizing exacerbations. The condition is becoming more common worldwide. Since the disease’s pathophysiology is not entirely well understood, developing novel treatments is critically important. The interplay of chronic infection, inflammation, and compromised mucociliary clearance, which results in structural alterations and the emergence of new infection, is most likely responsible for the progression of bronchiectasis. Other than treating bronchiectasis caused by cystic fibrosis, there are no approved treatments. Understanding the involvement of the microbiome in this disease is crucial, the microbiome is defined as the collective genetic material of all bacteria in an environment. In clinical practice, bacteria in the lungs have been studied using cultures; however, in recent years, researchers use next-generation sequencing methods, such as 16S rRNA sequencing. Although the microbiome in bronchiectasis has not been entirely investigated, what is known about it suggests that Haemophilus, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus dominate the lung bacterial ecosystems, they present significant intraindividual stability and interindividual heterogeneity. Pseudomonas and Haemophilus-dominated microbiomes have been linked to more severe diseases and frequent exacerbations, however additional research is required to fully comprehend the role of microbiome in the evolution of bronchiectasis. This review discusses recent findings on the lung microbiota and its association with bronchiectasis.

## Explorations on the antiviral potential of zinc and magnesium salts against chikungunya virus: implications for therapeutics

date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundChikungunya virus (CHIKV), which causes chikungunya fever, is an arbovirus of public health concern with no approved antiviral therapies. A significant proportion of patients develop chronic arthritis after an infection. Zinc and magnesium salts help the immune system respond effectively against viral infections. This study explored the antiviral potential of zinc sulphate, zinc acetate, and magnesium sulphate against CHIKV infection.MethodsThe highest non-toxic concentration of the salts (100 µM) was used to assess the prophylactic, virucidal, and therapeutic anti-CHIKV activities. Dose-dependent antiviral effects were investigated to find out the 50% inhibitory concentration of the salts. Entry bypass assay was conducted to find out whether the salts affect virus entry or post entry stages. Virus output in all these experiments was estimated using a focus-forming unit assay, real-time RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assay.ResultsDifferent time- and temperature-dependent assays revealed the therapeutic antiviral activity of zinc and magnesium salts against CHIKV. A minimum exposure of 4 hours and treatment initiation within 1 to 2 hours of infection are required for inhibition of CHIKV. Entry assays revealed that zinc salt affected virus-entry. Entry bypass assays suggested that both salts affected post-entry stages of CHIKV. In infected C57BL6 mice orally fed with zinc and magnesium salts, a reduction in viral RNA copy number was observed.ConclusionThe study results suggest zinc salts exert anti-CHIKV activity at entry and post entry stages of the virus life cycle, while magnesium salt affect CHIKV at post entry stages. Overall, the study highlights the significant antiviral potential of zinc sulphate, zinc acetate, and magnesium sulphate against CHIKV, which can be exploited in designing potential therapeutic strategies for early treatment of chikungunya patients, thereby reducing the virus-associated persistent arthritis.

## Clinical differences between Raoultella spp. and Klebsiella oxytoca

date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeRaoultella spp. is a genus of bacteria that is known to be closely related to Klebsiella. It has been debated whether Raoultella should be reclassified as a subgroup of Klebsiella. The aim of this study is to compare clinical aspects of Raoultella and Klebsiella oxytoca, a species of Klebsiella that is known to be bacteriologically similar to Raoultella spp.MethodsUsing data collected at a tertiary care hospital in the United States, we identified 43 patients with Raoultella infection and 1173 patients with Klebsiella oxytoca infection. We compared patient demographics (age and sex), hospitalization status, isolation sites and antibiotic resistance profiles between the two species.ResultsThere was no significant difference in patient demographics between the two bacteria species. The proportions of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were higher among patients with Raoultella infection (p=0.008). The most common site of isolation was urine for both species (39.5% of all patients with Raoultella spp. vs. 59.3% for K. oxytoca). The second most common site of isolation was blood stream for Raoultella spp. (23.3%) and respiratory tract for K. oxytoca (10.8%). Except for the high proportion of resistant isolates of Raoultella spp. for Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, the antibiotic susceptibility profiles were similar between the two bacteria species. Both were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and meropenem.ConclusionWhile there are no significant differences in the patient demographics and antibiotic susceptibility profiles between Raoultella spp. and K. oxytoca, Raoultella may cause more serious infection requiring ICU admissions. Also, Raoultella may cause blood stream infection more frequently than K. oxytoca.

## Investigating gut microbiota–blood and urine metabolite correlations in early sepsis-induced acute kidney injury: insights from targeted KEGG analyses

date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe interplay between gut microbiota and metabolites in the early stages of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is not yet clearly understood. This study explores the characteristics and interactions of gut microbiota, and blood and urinary metabolites in patients with SA-AKI.MethodsUtilizing a prospective observational approach, we conducted comparative analyses of gut microbiota and metabolites via metabolomics and metagenomics in individuals diagnosed with SA-AKI compared to those without AKI (NCT06197828). Pearson correlations were used to identify associations between microbiota, metabolites, and clinical indicators. The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database was employed to detect antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways informed on metabolic processes and microbial resistance patterns.ResultsOur study included analysis of four patients with SA-AKI and five without AKI. Significant disparities in bacterial composition were observed, illustrated by diversity indices (Shannon index: 2.0 ± 0.4 vs. 1.4 ± 0.6, P = 0.230; Simpson index: 0.8 ± 0.1 vs. 0.6 ± 0.2, P = 0.494) between the SA-AKI group and the non-AKI group. N6, N6, N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine was detected in both blood and urine metabolites, and also showed significant correlations with specific gut microbiota (Campylobacter hominis and Bacteroides caccae, R > 0, P < 0.05). Both blood and urine metabolites were enriched in the lysine degradation pathway. We also identified the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) as a KEGG pathway enriched in sets of differentially expressed ARGs in the gut microbiota, which exhibits an association with lysine degradation.ConclusionsSignificant differences in gut microbiota and metabolites were observed between the SA-AKI and non-AKI groups, uncovering potential biomarkers and metabolic changes linked to SA-AKI. The lysine degradation pathway may serve as a crucial link connecting gut microbiota and metabolites.

## Presence of Group A streptococcus frequently assayed virulence genes in invasive disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis

date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionIt is currently unclear what the role of Group A streptococcus (GAS) virulence factors (VFs) is in contributing to the invasive potential of GAS. This work investigated the evidence for the association of GAS VFs with invasive disease.MethodsWe employed a broad search strategy for studies reporting the presence of GAS VFs in invasive and non-invasive GAS disease. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers, quality assessed, and meta-analyzed using Stata®.ResultsA total of 32 studies reported on 45 putative virulence factors [invasive (n = 3,236); non-invasive (n = 5,218)], characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (n = 30) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (n = 2). The risk of bias was rated as low and moderate, in 23 and 9 studies, respectively. Meta-,analyses of high-quality studies (n = 23) revealed a significant association of speM [OR, 1.64 (95%CI, 1.06; 2.52)] with invasive infection. Meta-analysis of WGS studies demonstrated a significant association of hasA [OR, 1.91 (95%CI, 1.36; 2.67)] and speG [OR, 2.83 (95%CI, 1.63; 4.92)] with invasive GAS (iGAS). Meta-analysis of PCR studies indicated a significant association of speA [OR, 1.59 (95%CI, 1.10; 2.30)] and speK [OR, 2.95 (95%CI, 1.81; 4.80)] with invasive infection. A significant inverse association was observed between prtf1 [OR, 0.42 (95%CI, 0.20; 0.87)] and invasive infection.ConclusionThis systematic review and genomic meta-analysis provides evidence of a statistically significant association with invasive infection for the hasA gene, while smeZ, ssa, pnga3, sda1, sic, and NaDase show statistically significantly inverse associations with invasive infection. SpeA, speK, and speG are associated with GAS virulence; however, it is unclear if they are markers of invasive infection. This work could possibly aid in developing preventative strategies.

## Exploring the role of brain-derived extracellular vesicles in viral infections: from pathological insights to biomarker potential

date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles secreted by all cell types that play a central role in cell-to-cell communication. Since these vesicles serve as vehicles of cellular content (nucleic acids, proteins and lipids) with the potential to cross biological barriers, they represent a novel attractive window into an otherwise inaccessible organ, such as the brain. The composition of EVs is cell-type specific and mirrors the physiological condition of the cell-of-origin. Consequently, during viral infection, EVs undergo significant changes in their content and morphology, thereby reflecting alterations in the cellular state. Here, we briefly summarize the potential of brain-derived EVs as a lens into viral infection in the central nervous system, thereby: 1) uncovering underlying pathophysiological processes at play and 2) serving as liquid biopsies of the brain, representing a non-invasive source of biomarkers for monitoring disease activity. Although translating the potential of EVs from research to diagnosis poses complexities, characterizing brain-derived EVs in the context of viral infections holds promise to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, offering new avenues for managing infectious neurological diseases.
