## Evaluation of MAGLUMI syphilis test for accurate detection of syphilis antibodies in blood donors and suspected syphilis cases

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe diagnosis of syphilis is critical to initiate treatment at an early stage and control the syphilis epidemic. The serological detection of treponemal antibodies is recommended in the reverse sequence screening algorithm as the first screening test.Study designSerum samples from 5,081 unselected blood donors and 213 hospitalized patients were collected to evaluate the diagnostic specificity. To assess the diagnostic sensitivity, 487 positive samples were collected. 405 cross-interference samples were tested to evaluate analytical specificity. All samples were tested with the MAGLUMI Syphilis (Chemiluminescence immunoassay, CLIA) Test and the obtained results were compared with the Abbott ARCHITECT Syphilis TP reference test.ResultsThe diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the MAGLUMI Syphilis (CLIA) Test was 99.96% (95% CI, 99.87-99.99%) and 100.00% (95% CI, 99.22-100.00%), respectively. The analytical specificity and the analytical sensitivity of the Test was 100.00% and 2.529 mIU/ml, respectively. No significant interference and cross-reactivity were observed in a number of potential factors.ConclusionsThe performance of the MAGLUMI Syphilis (CLIA) Test makes it suited for identification of treponemal antibodies in screening populations as well as patients presenting with suspicion of syphilitic infection.

## Exploiting haem-iron dependence of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae: an avenue for future therapeutic development

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major respiratory pathogen that imposes a substantial disease burden, globally. Further amplifying the burden of NTHi-associated infections is the rapidly expanding spectrum and prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and the lack of an effective vaccination strategy. In 2017, the World Health Organization list of “priority pathogens”, highlighted the urgent need for new therapeutic agents against NTHi. Consequently, alternative preventative or treatment approaches that do not rely on antibiotic susceptibility or stable vaccine targets are becoming more attractive. The nutritional dependency for haem/iron at all stages of NTHi pathogenesis exposes a vulnerability that may be exploited for the development of such therapies. This review explores the role of haem/iron in all facets of NTHi pathogenesis, the host-bacterial competition for this vital nutrient, and the therapeutic potential of strategies that interfere with its acquisition.

## Protein lysine acetylation regulates oral microorganisms

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are integral to the regulation of protein function, stability, and cellular processes. Lysine acetylation, a widespread PTM, has been extensively characterized for its role in eukaryotic cellular functions, particularly in metabolism, gene expression, and disease progression. However, its involvement in oral microbiota remains inadequately explored. This review examines the emerging significance of lysine acetylation in modulating oral microbial communities. The oral cavity, characterized by its unique anatomical and environmental conditions, serves as a dynamic habitat where microbiota interact with host factors such as diet, immune response, pH, and the level of oxygen. Lysine acetylation enables bacterial adaptation to these fluctuating conditions, influencing microbial metabolism, virulence, and stress responses. For example, acetylation of lactate dehydrogenase in Streptococcus mutans reduces its acidogenicity and aciduricity, which decreases its cariogenic potential. In diverse environmental conditions, including hypoxic or anaerobic environments, acetylation regulates energy utilization pathways and enzyme activities, supporting bacterial survival and adaptation. Additionally, acetylation controls the production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), which are essential for biofilm formation and bacterial colonization. The acetylation of virulence factors can modulate the pathogenic potential of oral bacteria, either enhancing or inhibiting their activity depending on the specific context and regulatory mechanisms involved. This review also explores the interactions between acetylation and other PTMs, highlighting their synergistic or antagonistic effects on protein function. A deeper understanding of lysine acetylation mechanisms in oral microbiota could provide valuable insights into microbial adaptation and pathogenesis, revealing potential therapeutic targets for oral diseases.

## The Porphyromonas gingivalis RNA-binding protein is required for growth in high levels of zinc and persistence with host cells

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The oral periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis must adapt to an ever-changing environment to survive and cause disease. So far, most of the efforts concerning the regulatory mechanisms employed by the bacterium centered on DNA-binding regulators. Although global regulatory mechanisms employing RNA-binding proteins (RBP) are reported in most forms of life so far, such mechanism of regulation remains unknown in the oral Bacteroidetes group. Examination of the genome of P. gingivalis led to the discovery of a putative RBP with the RNA recognition motif 1 (RRM-1) designated here RbpPg1 (RNA-binding protein Porphyromonas gingivalis 1). The recombinant form of the protein-bound RNA and RNA-pull down identified a zinc exporter transcript as the most enriched one in agreement with the higher levels of zinc in the absence of the protein. Deletion of RbpPg1 reduced the ability of the bacterium to grow with 0.5 mM zinc. The RgpB protein level and the Arg-X protease activity was reduced in both iron replete and iron deplete conditions in the mutant strain when compared to the wild type. Lys-X protease activity was reduced, although Kgp protein levels were not altered by deletion of RbpPg1. The mutant grew better in hemin-deplete conditions when compared to the wild type. Finally, RbpPg1 was indispensable for the bacterium to survive with host cells. We have determined that both the transcriptome and proteome are affected by the deletion of RbpPg1 and found that the major group of proteins with elevated expression were the ones associated with response to environmental stress changes, while proteins mediating metabolic processes were downregulated. Overall, the first RBP characterized in P. gingivalis plays a significant role in the biology of the bacterium and differs from RBPs in other Gram-negative bacteria. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD034144 and via the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and under accession number GSE168570.

## Application of an organoid-based model to explore Helicobacter pylori–human gastric epithelium interaction in vitro

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Helicobacter pylori infection causes histopathologic changes in gastric epithelial cells, resulting in conditions such as gastritis, gastric ulcers, and ultimately, gastric cancer. To date, various experimental models, including cell lines and animal studies, have been employed to investigate these pathological processes. However, each model presents its limitations. This study compared the re-cultured three-dimensional organoids from infected single cells, apical-out, and two-dimensional (2D) organoids models to better understand the mechanisms underlying the epithelial changes caused by H. pylori infection in the human stomach. Thus, we analyzed the epithelial cell responses, inflammatory mediator expressions, apical-junctional complex alterations, and H. pylori infection interactions in these organoid models. Moreover, we revealed that the high accessibility and experimental efficiency of the apical-out and 2D models enable easier manipulation and faster analysis of H. pylori infection compared to the single-cell infection model. These results indicate the potential of various organoid models in H. pylori infection studies to provide essential data that help in understanding the mechanisms of epithelial changes and in developing new therapeutic strategies for gastric pathology.

## Advances in sRNA-mediated regulation of Salmonella infection in the host

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Salmonella is a foodborne pathogen that enters the host’s body through contaminated food and water, leading to gastroenteritis and systemic diseases. It is a significant veterinary and human pathogen capable of infecting both humans and animals, with substantial impacts on public health, human well-being, and the economic development of the livestock and poultry farming industry. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), typically 50–500 nucleotides (nt) in length, have been identified in various bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Brucella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. These sRNAs play crucial roles in regulating diverse physiological processes within bacteria. This review emphasizes recent advances in understanding how sRNAs regulate the virulence of Salmonella spp, such as the discovery of novel sRNAs like SaaS and new regulatory mechanisms of known sRNAs like RyhB-1/RyhB-2 and SdsR/Spot 42. It also outlines critical future directions, including exploring the multifaceted functions of sRNAs in lifestyle or infection phase transitions, fully elucidating their roles in regulating the host immune response, studying the combined actions of multiple sRNAs on host pathogenesis and expanding research to more Salmonella serotypes and diverse animal models. Through these efforts, this review aims to enhance our understanding of Salmonella sRNAs and their infection mechanisms.

## West Nile virus - a re-emerging global threat: recent advances in vaccines and drug discovery

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen and is posing significant global health challenge through climate change. WNV, transmitted between birds and Culex mosquitoes, has significantly expanded northward in recent years, leading to outbreaks across Europe and North America. This review explores the recent advancements and therapeutic strategies targeting WNV’s structural and non-structural (NS) proteins, which play critical roles in viral replication and pathogenesis. Promising candidates include peptide-based inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecules that disrupt protein-protein interactions. Most of current findings are derived from in silico methods or in vitro assays, with limited validation through in vivo studies. Although no vaccines are currently available for humans, several have been approved for horses, and development efforts are ongoing. The growing threat of WNV underscores the urgent need for validated antiviral therapies and scalable vaccines, especially considering its increasing geographic range and public health impact.

## Characteristics and prognosis of patients with pathogenic microorganism-positive sepsis AKI from ICU: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) carries a disproportionately high morbidity and mortality rate. While the synergism between dysregulated host response and renal vulnerability is increasingly recognized, the multifactorial drivers of poor prognosis remain poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognosis and clinical characteristics of patients with pathogenic microorganism-positive SA-AKI.MethodUsing a retrospective analysis approach, we extracted populations from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for confirmed sepsis with microbiological evidence of pathogenic organisms, and patients were divided into two cohorts according to with or without AKI. The severity of the disease in the two groups was collected for evaluation, and the clinical indicators and prognostic results of the patients were evaluated. The objective of this study was to explore the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with pathogenic microorganism-positive SA-AKI.OutcomeThe hospital mortality rate of AKI in patients with pathogenic microbial-positive sepsis was 18.96%. Further analysis showed that the use of vasoactive drug therapy, high lactate level, SAPS II score, SAPS III score, LODS score, and clinical indicators of prolonged hospital stay were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients with pathogenic microorganism-positive SA-AKI. Among them, SAPS III score plays an important role in predicting the prognosis of sepsis patients with AKI. Further studies found that lactate level was positively correlated with SAPS II score, SAPS III score, and LODS score.ConclusionThe use of vasoactive drug therapy, high lactate level, SAPS II score, SAPS III score, and LODS score plays an important role in assessing the prognosis of patients with pathogenic microorganism-positive SA-AKI, and multivariate comprehensive assessment is significant in predicting the prognosis of sepsis AKI patients.

## First contact: an interdisciplinary guide into decoding H5N1 influenza virus interactions with glycosaminoglycans in 3D respiratory cell models

date: 2025-05-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The human respiratory system is vulnerable to viral infections. The influenza virus family alone accounts for one billion reported cases annually, some of which are severe and can be fatal. Among these, Influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause the most severe symptoms and course of disease. IAV has been a major health concern, especially since the emergence of the potentially pandemic avian H5N1 strain. However, despite the knowledge that IAVs recognize terminally attached sialic acids on the host cell surface for cell entry, the involvement of other glycans during early infection remains to be elucidated. In particular, the involvement of the alveolar epithelial glycocalyx as a last line of defense is often overlooked. Studying early infection of any virus in real time remains a challenge due to the currently available model systems and imaging techniques. Therefore, we extensively compare the use of different 3D cell systems and provide an overview of currently available scaffold-based and scaffold-free air-liquid interface (ALI) models. In addition, we discuss in detail the preferred use of a recently developed 3D organ tissue equivalent (OTE) model incorporating solubilized extracellular matrix components (sECM) to study viral interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) during the early stages of IAV infection. We further discuss and recommend the use of various synthetic virus models over IAV virions to reduce complexity by focusing only on surface protein interactions while simultaneously lowering the required biosafety levels, including, but not limited to virus-like particles (VLPs) or DNA origami. Finally, we delve into potential labeling strategies for IAV or IAV-like particles by reviewing internal and external labeling strategies with quantum dots (QDs) and potential GAG labeling, combined with a recommendation to combine high spatial resolution imaging techniques with high temporal resolution tracking, such as single virus tracking.

## Virulence factors released by extracellular vesicles from Cryptococcus neoformans

date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cryptococcus neoformans, a prominent opportunistic pathogen, is equipped with unique mechanisms to evade host immune defenses, notably through its capsule and the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Despite significant understanding of its pathogenesis, the precise role of EVs in virulence and their molecular components remain underexplored. This review synthesizes current research on the virulence factors encapsulated within EVs of Cryptococcus, highlighting their contribution to fungal survival and pathogenicity. By analyzing the biochemical composition of these vesicles, we found the presence of enzymes (e.g., Urease, laccase), toxins (e.g. Melanin), and genes (e.g. Ssa1) associated with pathogenicity factors. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for developing therapeutic interventions. This work advances the field by providing a comprehensive overview of EV-mediated mechanisms in Cryptococcus, offering new insights into potential targets for antifungal strategies.

## Analysing the integrated quorum sensing system its potential role in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis

date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Since its discovery, Quorum Sensing (QS), a form of bacterial communication, has been the focus of numerous studies aimed at unravelling the mechanisms behind this intricate process. Bacterial QS relies on releasing low molecular weight signals known as autoinducers (AIs). When these AIs reach a threshold concentration, they activate coordinated genetic expression of pathogenic and bacterial survival mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s QS has been extensively studied due to its incidence and clinical significance in a wide range of human infections. Several decades ago, three QS systems, named Las, Rhl, and Pqs, were identified and have since then become the focus of numerous research studies and the target of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, a fourth QS-related system was more recently proposed that it has been the subject of debate. Named “integrated quorum sensing” (Iqs), interconnects the previously mentioned systems with the phosphate stress response. The associated AI has been identified as 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-thiazole-4-carbaldehyde, also known as IQS. This discovery has sparked a controversial discussion about its biosynthetic origin and whether it truly functions as an intercellular communication system. In this review, we critically discuss the different hypotheses, and its biological relevance while presenting key findings of the Iqs system.

## A “proto” type galectin expressed in striped bass (Morone saxatilis) tissues is released to epidermal mucus and binds to bacterial and mucus glycans

date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Like all aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, teleost fish are subject to the constant pressure of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms present in the environmental interface that can potentially cause disease. Numerous defense molecules, including galectins, have been isolated from the skin and gut tissues of several marine and freshwater fish species. To provide new insights into the potential role(s) of galectins in the teleost fish innate immune system, we carried out studies on the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), a keystone fish species in Chesapeake Bay. We purified from epidermal skin mucus, and skin and muscle tissue, a 15-kDa galectin that we designated Msgal1-L1 (M. saxatilis galectin1-like protein 1). Both the transcript sequence and gene organization of Msgal1-L1 suggested a close relationship to the zebrafish galectin Drgal1-L2 and other proto type galectins from vertebrates, including the mammalian galectin-1. Glycan microarray analysis of Msgal1-L1 revealed a binding preference for Galβ1,4GlcNAc, and a homology structural model identified the amino acids involved in ligand recognition, both observations consistent with proto type galectins. Immunohistological examination localized Msgal1-L1 to epithelial and macrophage-/fibroblast-like cells in mucosal tissues, including skin and gill. The preliminary localization of Msgal1-L1 in free macrophage-like cells in epidermal mucus was corroborated by immunofluorescence analysis of macrophages isolated from head kidney. Msgal1-L1 binds in a carbohydrate-specific manner to O-glycosylated components of epidermal mucus. Msgal1-L1 agglutinated environmental bacterial species and strains, some of which are recognized fish pathogens, such as Vibrio and Edwardsiella spp. A microbial microarray analysis revealed that it preferentially binds to bacterial exopolysaccharides (e.g., Streptococcus and Shigella spp.) as well as various lipopolysaccharide O-antigen serotypes of Proteus spp. A preliminary solid-phase assay showed that Msgal1-L1 strongly bound Streptococcus sp., but very weakly to Mycobacterium marinum, an endemic pathogen of striped bass in Chesapeake Bay. Taken together, this evidence suggests that Msgal1-L1 may function in defense recognition against environmental bacteria by agglutinating and/or cross-linking them to mucus oligosaccharides to immobilize them within the epidermal mucus film and prevent their access to the fish epithelial cell surface. M. marinum would evade this defense mechanism to reach and infect the fish skin epithelial layer.

## Deciphering tuberculosis: lysosome-centric insights into pathogenesis and therapies

date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Tuberculosis is a widely spread disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The pathogenicity of the pathogen is closely associated with the immune defense mechanisms of the host cells. As key cellular degradation and metabolic centers, lysosomes critically regulate tuberculosis infection. When Mtb invades the host, it is taken up by macrophages and enters phagosomes. Subsequently, the phagosomes fuse with lysosomes and form phagolysosomes, which eliminate the pathogenic bacteria through the acidic environment and hydrolytic enzymes within lysosomes. However, Mtb can interfere with the normal functions of lysosomes through various strategies. It can secrete specific factors (such as ESAT-6, ppk-1, and AcpM) to inhibit the acidification of lysosomes, enzyme activity, and the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes, thereby enabling Mtb proliferation within host cells. An in-depth exploration of the mechanism of the interaction between Mtb and lysosomes will both uncover bacterial immune evasion strategies and identify novel anti-tuberculosis therapeutic targets.

## A critical review on In Vivo and Ex Vivo models for the investigation of Helicobacter pylori infection

date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Helicobacter pylori is a stomach-dwelling bacterium with a crude global prevalence of nearly 45% in adults and 35% in children and adolescents. Chronic H. pylori infection and the resulting inflammation are major causes of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Since its discovery in 1982, various animal models have been proposed to recreate the specific pathophysiological interactions between H. pylori and the human host. These infection models have been instrumental in dissecting the key drivers of H. pylori colonization, persistence and mediators of host immune responses. However, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular triggers for malignant transformation of the gastric mucosa is still lacking. Vaccine development in this area has stalled, as promising candidates identified through animal studies have failed in advanced human clinical trials. Currently, H. pylori eradication is heavily reliant on different antimicrobial agents. As with other bacterial pathogens, the growing antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori remains a major challenge, making eradication therapy increasingly complex and prolonged, over time. Recent drug approvals have mostly been for newer combinations of conventional antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors. Thus, the development of novel treatments and innovative models are crucial for advancing the drug development pipeline. This review encompasses the development and recent advances in animal and non-animal models of H. pylori gastric infection and its applications in investigating novel therapeutics and vaccine candidates.

## Development of a rapid point-of-care dengue virus type 2 infection diagnostic assay using recombinase polymerase amplification and lateral flow device

date: 2025-05-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDengue virus (DENV) is the most rapidly spreading arbovirus globally, with over half of the world’s population at risk of infection. Early and rapid detection is crucial to ensure timely patient care, reduce healthcare burden, and prevent severe disease progression. However, conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques are often unsuitable for low-resource settings due to their equipment and procedural demands.MethodsWe evaluated a real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the sensitive and specific detection of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2). The assay was tested using both Twista fluorometer and lateral flow detection (LFD) formats. Analytical sensitivity was determined by probit regression, while specificity was assessed against unrelated viruses and other flaviviruses. Clinical validation was performed using serum, cell culture, and FTA® card samples. Assay robustness was evaluated under varying temperatures and after freeze-thaw cycles.ResultsThe RT-RPA assay reliably amplified DENV2 at concentrations as low as 50 copies per reaction, with LOD₉₅ estimated at 38.48 copies (Twista) and 50.37 copies (LFD). No cross-reactivity was observed with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, rabbit herpes virus, West Nile virus, or other DENV serotypes (DENV1, DENV3, DENV4). The assay successfully detected multiple DENV2 strains and maintained performance across 33°C–40°C and after repeated freeze-thaw cycles. RNA extracted from FTA® cards was successfully amplified. Clinical validation confirmed accurate detection in serum and cell culture samples, while DENV3-positive blood samples tested negative, reinforcing specificity.DiscussionThe RT-RPA/LFD assay offers a rapid, sensitive, and specific tool for DENV2 detection, compatible with low-resource and field-based settings. Its simplicity, robustness, and portability make it a promising approach for point-of-care diagnostics and outbreak surveillance in endemic regions.

## The intratumoral microbiota heterogenicity is related to the prognosis and tumorigenesis of cervical cancer

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe intratumoral microbe-host interaction plays crucial role in the development of cancer. The microbiome can influence cancer development by modulating inflammation, immune responses and metabolic pathways. Therefore, we aim to delineate the landscape and role of intratumoral microbiota in cervical cancer (CC).MethodsThe presence of bacterial community in CC tissues was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Then 16s rRNA and RNA-Seq were used to characterize the composition of intratumoral microbiota. Combined with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) data from the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the clinical signatures of intratumoral microbiota and DEGs were further analyzed. Finally, the effect of the up-regulated Fibrinogen beta chain (FGB) expressed fragment peptide on the biological behavior of cancer was verified in vitro.ResultsWe found the composition heterogeneity of bacteria in CC tumors. Pseudomonas was most highly enriched in CC tissues and grouped according to the relative abundance level. The clinical characteristics of patients with relatively high abundance of Pseudomonas had the higher levels of fibrinogen and lower levels of white blood cell (WBC) and albumin (ALB) expression. Combining transcriptome data from the two our collective CC and TCGA-CESC cohorts, we found that Pseudomonas abundance was significantly associated with fibrinogen beta peptide expression and worse overall survival in CC patients. In vitro experiment revealed that Pseudomonas could promote the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells through overexpression of FGB.ConclusionsWe characterized the composition of the intratumoral microbiota in CC tissues and identified the most significantly differentially abundant bacteria between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. Our findings provide novel insights into the relationship between intratumoral Pseudomonas and the tumorigenesis of CC. A deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its associated microbiota may reveal new potential therapeutic targets and improve clinical outcomes.

## Involvement of the blaCTX-M-3 gene in emergence of a peculiar resistance phenotype in Klebsiella pneumoniae

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThis study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying a peculiar resistance phenotype in Klebsiella pneumoniae, characterized by reduced susceptibility to cefepime compared to ceftazidime.MethodsAntimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid conjugation experiments, whole-genome sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to characterize the resistance phenotype and identify genetic determinants.ResultsA total of 20 K. pneumoniae strains exhibiting peculiar resistance phenotypes were collected and analyzed. Ten distinct sequence types (STs) were identified, including ST25 (4/20), ST967 (3/20), ST65 (2/20), ST133 (2/20), ST48 (2/20), ST353 (1/20), ST628 (1/20), ST753 (1/20), ST792 (1/20), and ST254 (1/20). All strains were resistant to FEP (MIC50 = 128 µg/mL) but not to CAZ (MIC50 = 8 µg/mL). This resistance was primarily attributed to the presence of the blaCTX-M-3 (14/20) and blaOXA-10 (3/20). Conjugation experiments demonstrated that 5 out of 14 blaCTX-M-3-positive K. pneumoniae strains successfully acquired transconjugants, which exhibited the same peculiar resistance phenotype. PCR analysis confirmed that the conjugates contained the IncFII plasmid. To further elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance phenotype, whole-genome long-read sequencing was performed on three blaCTX-M-3-positive K. pneumoniae strains. The sequencing results confirmed that blaCTX-M-3 was located on the IncFII plasmid, and analysis of its genetic environment revealed a frequent association with mobile genetic elements such as IS26, ISEcp1, and Tn3.DiscussionThe primary driver of this phenotype in K. pneumoniae is the presence of the IncFII plasmid carrying blaCTX-M-3, which contrasts with the resistance mechanisms often reported in Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibiting similar phenotypes. This study emphasizes the critical role of plasmid-mediated resistance in the spread of multidrug resistance in K. pneumoniae and provides insights into strategies for combating resistance in these pathogens.

## Study on the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and agent disease risk simulation model based on individual factors in Xi’an City

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSince the first discovery and reporting of the COVID - 19 pandemic towards the end of 2019, the virus has rapidly propagated across the world. This has led to a remarkable spike in the number of infections. Even now, doubt lingers over whether it has completely disappeared. Moreover, the issue of restoring normal life while ensuring safety continues to be a crucial challenge that public health agencies and people globally are eager to tackle.MethodsTo thoroughly understand the epidemic’s outbreak and transmission traits and formulate timely prevention measures to fully safeguard human lives and property, this paper presents an agent - based model incorporating individual - level factors.ResultsThe model designates Xi'an—where a characteristic disease outbreak occurred—as the research area. The simulation results demonstrate substantial consistency with official records, effectively validating the model’s applicability, adaptability, and generalizability. This validated capacity enables accurate prediction of epidemic trends and comprehensive assessment of disease risks.DiscussionFrom late 2021 to early 2022, it employs a one - to - one population simulation approach and simulates epidemic impacts and disease risks. Initially, using building statistical data in the study area, the model reconstructs the local real - world geographical environment. Leveraging data from the seventh national population census, it also replicates the study area’s population characteristics. Next, the model takes into account population mobility, contact tracing, patient treatment, and the diagnostic burden of COVID - 19 - like influenza symptoms. It integrates epidemic transmission impact parameters into the model framework. Eventually, the model’s results are compared with official data for validation, and it’s applied to hypothetical scenarios. It provides scientific theoretical tools to support the implementation of government - driven prevention and control measures.  Additionally, it facilitates the adjustment of individual behavioral guidelines, promoting more effective epidemic management.

## Overexpression in Plasmodium falciparum of an intrinsically disordered protein segment of PfUT impairs the parasite’s proteostasis and reduces its growth rate

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The proteome of Plasmodium falciparum exhibits a marked propensity for aggregation. This characteristic results from the parasite’s AT-rich genome, which encodes numerous proteins with long asparagine-rich stretches and low structural complexity, which lead to abundant intrinsically disordered regions. While this poses challenges for the parasite, the propensity for protein aggregation may also serve functional roles, such as stress adaptation, and could therefore be exploited by targeting it as a potential vulnerable spot in the pathogen. Here, we overexpressed an aggregation-prone segment of the P. falciparum ubiquitin transferase (PfUTf), an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein that has been previously demonstrated to regulate the stability of parasite proteins involved in invasion, development and drug metabolism. Overexpression of PfUTf in P. falciparum had evident phenotypic effects observed by transmission electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy, increased endogenous protein aggregation, disrupted proteostasis, and caused significant growth impairment in the parasite. Combined with dihydroartemisinin treatment, PfUTf overexpression had a synergistic effect that further compromised the parasite´s viability, linking protein aggregation to proteasome dysfunction. Changes in the distribution of aggregation-prone proteins, shown by the altered subcellular fluorescent pattern of the new investigational aggregated protein dye and antiplasmodial compound YAT2150 in the overexpressing P. falciparum line, highlighted the critical balance between protein aggregation, stress responses, and parasite viability, suggesting proteostasis-targeting therapies as a good antimalarial strategy.

## Visual detection of Coxsackievirus A6 using a reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction method

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) ranks as a primary enterovirus associated with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (HA). Given its significant role in these diseases, there is an urgent need for an efficient identification method. This study presents a novel visual approach based on the reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) for the rapid detection of CVA6. We designed an RT-PSR assay that targets and amplifies a segment of the VP1 gene. Hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB) is incorporated as the detection agent in this assay. To evaluate the performance of the RT-PSR assay, we analyzed 142 clinical throat swab samples. The results were benchmarked against those obtained using quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (qRT - PCR). The RT-PSR assay operates at 65°C for 60 minutes and exhibits a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. When tested against other viruses, it consistently yielded negative results, demonstrating its high specificity. Moreover, the RT - PSR assay showed excellent agreement with a commercial qRT - PCR kit. In conclusion, by using HNB as an indicator, the RT - PSR assay emerges as a straightforward and highly sensitive method for detecting CVA6 in symptomatic throat samples. This approach holds great potential for improving the diagnosis and surveillance of CVA6 - related diseases.

## Unveiling the role of the upper respiratory tract microbiome in susceptibility and severity to COVID-19

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

It is argued that commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory tract (URT) protect against pathogen colonization and infection, including respiratory viruses. Given that the microbiome can mediate immune modulation, a link between the URT microbiome (URTM) and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity is expected. This 16S metagenomics cross-sectional study assessed URTM composition, metabolic prediction, and association with laboratory biomarkers in non-COVID-19 pneumonia (NO-CoV), moderate (M-CoV), severe (S-CoV) COVID-19 patients, as well as COVID-19-negative, asymptomatic (NC) patients. The S-CoV group exhibited reduced URTM diversity, primarily due to a decreased abundance of eubiotic taxa. Some of these taxa (e.g., Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp.) were also associated with inflammatory biomarkers. Multiple metabolic pathways (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, vitamin B12) linked to immune response, antiviral activity, and host susceptibility showed decreased abundance in S-CoV. These pathways could suggest potential alternatives for the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19, providing reassurance about the progress in understanding and treating this disease.

## Chlamydia muridarum mutant CM-pGP3S as a novel attenuated live rectal vaccine protects against genital tract infection

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionChlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a major sexually transmitted pathogen with severe complications. Using Chlamydia muridarum (CM) as a model, this study evaluates the attenuated mutant Chlamydia muridarum (CM-pGP3S) as a novel rectal vaccine to protect against genital tract infection and pathology.MethodsFemale C57BL/6 mice were rectally immunized with low (1×103), middle (1×105), or high (1×107) doses of CM-pGP3S. Mice were challenged intravaginally with wild-type Chlamydia muridarum 63 days post-immunization. Protection was assessed via genital Chlamydia shedding, hydrosalpinx incidence (gross/histopathology), serum IgG, fecal IgA, and T cell responses. Gut microbiota stability was analyzed using qPCR.ResultsCM-pGP3S immunization significantly reduced CM-WT genital shedding duration (3–7 days vs. 21 days in controls, p < 0.01) and hydrosalpinx incidence (0% vs. 80% in controls, p < 0.01). Elevated systemic and mucosal immunity were observed, including higher serum IgG (1:100–1:1600 dilutions, p < 0.05–0.01) and fecal IgA (p < 0.05–0.01). CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibited increased IFN-γ (p < 0.01), while CD8+ T cells showed elevated TNF-α and IL-2 (p < 0.05). No colitis or significant gut microbiota disruption occurred post-immunization.DiscussionRectal CM-pGP3S vaccination induces robust transmucosal immunity, protecting against genital Chlamydia infection and pathology without gastrointestinal adverse effects. This highlights its potential as a safe and effective mucosal vaccine strategy to combat CT genital tract infections.

## The role of periostin (OSF-2) in the cytoadherence phenomena mediated by malaria parasites

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe pathogenesis of severe malaria is primarily attributed to the cytoadherence properties of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes (IRBC), which include rosetting and IRBC-endothelial cytoadherence. These cytoadherence events are influenced by various parasite- and host-derived factors. Previously, antibodies against human periostin (OSF-2), an inflammation-associated protein, were reported to inhibit rosetting. In this study, we aimed to characterize the OSF-2-mediated cytoadherence in infections caused by Plasmodium falciparum (the most fatal human malaria parasite) and P. knowlesi (an emerging, potentially fatal zoonotic malaria parasite).MethodsLaboratory-adapted P. falciparum and P. knowlesi isolates were cultured, and the late-stage parasites were purified for experiments using recombinant human OSF-2.ResultsWe found that OSF-2 at a concentration of 200 ng/ml induced rosette-stimulation in both parasite species. Furthermore, we demonstrated the serum dependency of OSF-2-mediated rosetting. The rosette-stimulating effect of OSF-2 was completely abolished when IRBC were treated with a low concentration of trypsin. This suggests a role for P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) in OSF-2-mediated rosetting by P. falciparum, and reveals the trypsin-sensitive nature of the P. knowlesi-derived ligands involved in OSF-2-mediated rosetting. We also found that OSF-2-mediated rosetting was independent of the ABO blood group. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability of OSF-2 to disrupt the IRBC-endothelial binding.DiscussionThis work contributes to our understanding of the host-parasite interactions in malaria pathobiology.

## The progress of the microbe-gut-brain axis in sepsis-associated encephalopathy

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a diffuse brain dysfunction that is caused by sepsis without direct brain injury or central nervous system infection and is manifested as anxiety-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, on the other hand, is a bidirectional communication network between the gut and the brain that modulates host behavior and cognitive function in many ways and is of central importance in the preservation of general health and homeostasis. Given the functional roles attributed to the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), contemporary research is progressively focused on elucidating relationships between SAE and alterations in compositional and quantitative intestinal microbiota profiles. This review consolidates interdisciplinary insights from immunology, microbiology, neuroendocrine signaling, and neural pathophysiology to evaluate the mechanistic contribution of the MGBA to the relief of cognitive impairments in SAE. By unifying these perspectives, with the aim of preventing or enhancing SAE-related neurological dysfunction for the formulation of MGBA-targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Association between oral dysbiosis and Parkinson’s disease: a systematic review

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The oral cavity serves as the gateway to the human organism, hosting a diverse community of microorganisms that coexist in a state of symbiosis. Disruption of this balance leads to oral dysbiosis, a condition associated with infections and oral pathologies, which may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of systemic disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. While oral dysbiosis is recognized as a risk factor and an aggravating element for Parkinson’s disease, it is not regarded as a direct cause. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing research exploring the potential relationship between oral dysbiosis and the development of Parkinson’s disease. Following a comprehensive analysis, 12 studies were selected, comprising 11 case-control studies and one observational analytical study. These studies investigated the composition of oral microbiota in different sample groups, revealing a higher abundance of pathogenic oral bacteria in individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The findings suggest that oral dysbiosis may influence both the onset of Parkinson’s disease and the progression of symptoms such as cognitive decline. These results pave the way for future research, particularly regarding alterations in oral microbiota as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42024540056.

## Screening and identification of protein interacting with goose astrovirus

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGoose Astrovirus (GoAstV), a recently identified member of the Astroviridae family in China, predominantly affects goslings, resulting in substantial economic losses to the goose farming industry due to its high infection and mortality rates. Currently, the infection mechanism and pathogenesis of GoAstV remain unknown.MethodsGiven this, the Viral Overlay Protein Blot Assay was utilized to identify and characterize proteins on the LMH (Leghorn Male Hepatoma) cell membrane that interact with Goose Astrovirus. The identities of the candidate proteins were determined via LC-MS mass spectrometry analysis, bioinformatics analysis, and UniProt database search. The interaction between HSPA5 and the astrovirus protein was further validated in vitro through Western blot and Coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Finally, bioinformatics tools such as SWISSMODEL, AlphaFold, and ZDOCK were employed to construct and analyze the docking complex model between the candidate protein and GoAstV protein, including their key binding residue sites.ResultsWe successfully identified a 70 kDa protein in the plasma membrane protein extracts of LMH cells and confirmed the identity of this candidate protein as HSPA5. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments further validated the interaction between HSPA5 and astrovirus proteins. Subsequently, we successfully predicted the docking complex model of HSPA5 protein with GoAstV protein. Further prediction of the binding residue sites revealed that seven residues of the GoAstV-P2 protein (THR124, ILE22, VAL24, TRP51, PRO66, GLN100, and VAL125) and twelve residues of the HSPA5 protein (ARG2, HIS3, LEU4, LEU6, ALA7, LEU8, LEU9, LEU10, LEU11, ASP411, VAL413, and LEU415) may be involved in the interaction between these two proteins.DiscussionOur research results have preliminarily elucidated the interaction mechanisms between viral proteins and receptors, facilitating exploration from multiple angles of the roles of candidate protein in the process of GoAstV infecting host cells. This provides a theoretical basis for further identification of GoAstV receptors and clarification of its infection mechanisms.

## HmuY proteins of the Porphyromonas genus show diversity in heme-binding properties

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionBacteria of the Porphyromonas genus, belonging to the Bacteroidota phylum, colonize various host niches in health and disease. As heme auxotrophs, they rely on heme uptake for iron and protoporphyrin IX. A key heme acquisition system in Porphyromonas gingivalis is the Hmu system, where the hemophore-like HmuYPg protein plays a major role. HmuYPg coordinates heme-iron using two histidines, whereas other known HmuY proteins produced by other Bacteroidota members prefer a pair of histidine-methionine or two methionines. Some of them bind heme via the protoporphyrin ring without heme-iron coordination, similar to the P. gingivalis HusA protein.MethodsThis study used bioinformatics, spectroscopic, and electrophoretic methods to compare the genomic organization of the Hmu system and the structural and functional properties of HmuY proteins within the Porphyromonas genus.Results and DiscussionWe revealed variations in the heme-binding properties of proteins belonging to the HmuY family and susceptibility to modifications in their heme-binding pockets. These findings suggest that HmuY proteins may have undergone evolutionary adaptations to enhance bacterial survival in the human microbiome, contributing to dysbiosis and disease development. These evolutionary changes may explain the superior heme-binding ability of P. gingivalis HmuYPg compared to HmuY homologs produced by other Porphyromonas species.

## A pharmacovigilance study on probiotic preparations based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System from 2005 to 2023

date: 2025-05-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundProbiotics are recognized as beneficial foods, but adverse reactions reported by individuals still exist. This study aims to analysis adverse events (AE) related to probiotics from the FAERS database from the first quarter (Q1) of 2005 to the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023.MethodsThe AE data related to probiotic from the 2005 Q1 to the 2023 Q4 were collected. R language was applied to analyze the standardized AE data and three algorithms including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) were used to identify AE signals.ResultsIn this study, 10,698,312 reports were collected from the FAERS database, of which 74 probiotic-related adverse events were reported. About one third of the reported cases were older than 60 years.36.36% of the reported cases required Hospitalization. A total of 285 preference terms (PTS) and 15 system organ classes (SOC) were identified. In the overall analysis, only 9 PTs and 2 SOCs met significant disproportionality for all three algorithms simultaneously. SOCs included Gastrointestinal disorders (N=97, ROR=5.3, PRR=3.84, EBGM=3.84) and Hepatobiliary disorders (N=9, ROR =3.39, PRR=3.32, EBGM=3.32). PTs included Gastrointestinal pain (ROR=77.76, PRR=76.69, EBGM=76.63), Hypophagia (ROR=24.13, PRR=23.88, EBGM=28.88), and Hepatobiliary disorders (N=97, ROR=5.3, PRR=3.84, EBGM=3.84) and Flatulence (ROR=23.75, PRR=23.28, EBGM=23.27) were the top four highest. Meanwhile, s found new unique adverse signals such as Agitation (ROR=12.48, PRR=12.32, EBGM=12.32) and Anxiety (ROR=4.10, PRR=4.04, EBGM=4.04). Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed to identify AE signals based on gender and age. Metabolism and nutrition disorders (N=6, ROR=3.21, PRR=3.04, EBGM=3.04) and Asthenia (N=3, ROR=5.9, PRR=5.71, EBGM=5.71) were unique AE signal for the male group.ConclusionAlthough, the risk of adverse reactions arising from the application of probiotics cannot be ignored. However, However, the results of this FAERS-based study continue to support the overall safety of probiotic preparations. It is necessary to pay attention to the potential influence of factors such as gender and age on the effects and adverse reactions of probiotic application in basic research and clinical application.

Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, defined by their conserved RBCC domain architecture, play key roles in various cellular processes and virus-host interactions. In this review, we focus on Class VI TRIM proteins, including TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33, highlighting the distinct functional attributes of their RING, B-BOX1, B-BOX2, COILED COIL, PHD, and BRD domains in viral infection. Through multiple sequence alignment, we delineate both the conserved and divergent features within this subclass, underscoring the uniqueness of Class VI TRIM protein. Additionally, we explore the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Class VI TRIM proteins including their functional differences in modulating viral infection. Moreover, we examine the C-VI TRIM protein complexes and their significant contributions to the antiviral response. Furthermore, we discuss small molecule ligands targeting Class VI TRIM domains, with a focus on druggable structural motifs. Understanding the multi-domain features of TRIM proteins is crucial for developing effective antiviral strategies and the therapeutic modulation of their activity.

## Antibiotic resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group and genetic diversity of Escherichia coli isolated from Tibetan pig farms in Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China

date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionTo investigate the correlations among antibiotic resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group, and genetic diversity, providing essential data for Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection prevention and control in Tibetan pigs.MethodsA total of 244 E. coli isolates were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using the microdilution method. PCR was used to detect antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes, and phylogenetic groups. Genetic diversity was analyzed using enterobacterial repetitive element sequence-based PCR. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 5-12, a representative strain with multidrug resistance and strong biofilm-forming ability, harboring abundant virulence genes, was selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to validate PCR results.ResultsAmong the 244 isolates, 84.43% showed multidrug resistance (MDR), with the highest resistance rates for chloramphenicol (99.59%), sulfadiazine (96.31%), and sulfamethoxazole (93.85%). Twenty-five ARGs were detected, with ant(3’)-Ia, blaTEM, aac(3’)-II, floR, and qnrS exceeding 80% detection rates. Integrase genes intl1 and intl2 were found in 90.16% and 15.16% of isolates, respectively. Seventeen virulence genes were detected; bcsA (98.77%), fimC (89.75%), and agn43 (59.43%) were the most prevalent. A total of 106 virulence patterns were identified, with agn43/bcsA/fimC being predominant (17.92%). Most strains belonged to phylogenetic group A (45.90%), followed by B1 (34.43%), while 29 strains were unclassified. Sixty-four isolates were identified as diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC), predominantly enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 90.63%). Biofilm-forming ability was categorized as strong (4.69%), moderate (21.88%), weak (59.38%), or absent (14.06%). Clustering based on 61.2% similarity grouped the 64 DEC into five clusters, with 84.38% in cluster II, which contained all strong biofilm producers.DiscussionAntimicrobial resistance profiles of EAEC 5–12 confirmed that primarily confer resistance through antibiotic efflux, target alteration, and reduced permeability. These findings will contribute to further understanding the positive correlation between antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in E. coli from Tibetan pig farms, shedding light on the rational use of antimicrobial agents and tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis in Tibetan pig breeding in Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China.

## Predicting ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infection outcomes using sequencing-based early microbiological response: a proof-of-concept prospective study

date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesVentilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTIs) cause significant mortality. This study was assigned to explore the association between early microbiological responses defined by quantitative targeted amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (QtNGS) and clinical outcomes in patients with Acinetobacter baumannii-dominant VA-LRTI.Measurements and main resultsA prospective observational study including 34 participants was conducted to assess the probability of predicting clinical outcomes using sequencing-based early microbiological response. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected at admission and 3 days post-treatment from these patients for QtNGS to determine the relative quantification ratio (RQR) of A. baumannii. Patients were categorized into survival (n=26) and non-survival (n=8) groups. The RQR was calculated as the quantification of A. baumannii determined by QtNGS after treatment to pretreatment. RQR significantly increased on day 4 in the non-survival group (median 5.285), and decreased in the survival group (median 0.1864). Receiver’s operation characteristic curves revealed that an RQR ≥1.41 was predictive of poor outcomes, with an area under the curve of 0.9471 (0.8759-1). The accuracy of the RQR determined by QtNGS was further evaluated by retesting the same specimen using digital droplet PCR, and the linear correlation was confirmed in the RQR calculated by two methods. The 23 patients with RQR<1.41 all survived for 28 days, whereas the survival rate for the 11 patients with RQR ≥1.41 was 27.27%. RQR was significantly and positively correlated with the length of ICU stay in survivors.ConclusionsThe RQR of A. baumannii detected by QtNGS correlates with the prognosis of VA-LRTI patients.
