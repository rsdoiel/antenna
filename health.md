## Gram-negative bacterial sRNAs encapsulated in OMVs: an emerging class of therapeutic targets in diseases

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) encapsulated in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. OMVs are small spherical structures released by Gram-negative bacteria that serve as important vehicles for intercellular communication and can also play an important role in bacterial virulence and host-pathogen interactions. These molecules can interact with mRNAs or proteins and affect various cellular functions and physiological processes in the producing bacteria. This review aims to provide insight into the current understanding of sRNA localization to OMVs in Gram-negative bacteria and highlights the identification, characterization and functional implications of these encapsulated sRNAs. By examining the research gaps in this field, we aim to inspire further exploration and progress in investigating the potential therapeutic applications of OMV-encapsulated sRNAs in various diseases.</p>

## Questionnaire survey of risk factors for recurrence of ocular inflammation in patients with uveitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the proportion of patients with uveitis who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 increased greatly. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with uveitis has not been fully described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 infection was sent to patients with uveitis to assess ocular and systemic conditions before and after infection. Chi-square analysis and multifactorial regression analysis were used to investigate the associations between each risk factor and the recurrence of uveitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred thirty-nine patients with noninfectious uveitis completed the questionnaire; 114 (82.0%) had COVID-19, and 27 (23.7%) had recurrent or exacerbated uveitis after COVID-19. There was a higher rate of recurrence or aggravation of ocular inflammation in patients who developed severe COVID-19 symptoms (severe group 8/20 vs. nonsevere group 19/94). There were significant differences in the rates of recurrence and aggravation between the two groups of patients who differed in terms of ocular inflammatory activity within 3 months prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection (χ2 = 10.701, <italic>P</italic>=0.001), as well as in the rates of recurrence and aggravation after cessation of systemic immunomodulatory therapy. After multifactorial regression analysis, patients with active ocular inflammation within 3 months prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection had a greater risk of recurrence or exacerbation of uveitis after COVID-19 (OR=4.298, <italic>P</italic>=0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The degree of ocular inflammatory activity within 3 months prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a major factor influencing the recurrence or exacerbation of uveitis after infection. Interruption of medication should be minimized in patients with unstable inflammatory control.</p></sec>

## Nanopore sequencing of infectious fluid is a promising supplement for gold-standard culture in real-world clinical scenario

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Infectious diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the rapid identification and accurate diagnosis of pathogens. While unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been extensively utilized in clinical pathogen identification and scientific microbiome detection, there is limited research about the application of nanopore platform-based mNGS in the diagnostic performance of various infectious fluid samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, we collected 297 suspected infectious fluids from 10 clinical centers and detected them with conventional microbiology culture and nanopore platform–based mNGS. The objective was to assess detective and diagnostic performance of nanopore-sequencing technology (NST) in real-world scenarios.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Combined with gold-standard culture and clinical adjudication, nanopore sequencing demonstrated nearly 100% positive predictive agreements in microbial-colonized sites, such as the respiratory and urinary tracts. For samples collected from initially sterile body sites, the detected microorganisms were highly suspected pathogens, and the negative predictive agreements were relatively higher than those in the microbial-colonized sites, particularly with 100% in abscess and 95.7% in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, consistent performance was also observed in the identification of antimicrobial resistance genes and drug susceptibility testing of pathogenic strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Rapid NST is a promising clinical tool to supplement gold-standard culture, and it has the potential improve patient prognosis and facilitate clinical treatment of infectious diseases.</p></sec>

## MEK1/2 inhibition decreases pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages from people with cystic fibrosis and mitigates severity of illness in experimental murine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Chronic pulmonary bacterial infections and associated inflammation remain a cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) despite new modulator therapies. Therapies targeting host factors that dampen detrimental inflammation without suppressing immune responses critical for controlling infections remain limited, while the development of lung infections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacteria is an increasing global problem, and a significant challenge in CF. Pharmacological compounds targeting the mammalian MAPK proteins MEK1 and MEK2, referred to as MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds, have potential combined anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. Here we examined the immunomodulatory properties of MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds PD0325901, trametinib, and CI-1040 on CF innate immune cells. Human CF macrophage and neutrophil phagocytic functions were assessed by quantifying phagocytosis of serum opsonized pHrodo red <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and zymosan bioparticles. MEK1/2 inhibitor compounds reduced CF macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine production without impairing CF macrophage or neutrophil phagocytic abilities. Wild-type C57BL6/J and <italic>Cftr</italic><sup>tm1kth</sup> (F508del homozygous) mice were used to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic potential of PD0325901 compared to vehicle treatment in an intranasal methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) infection with the community-acquired MRSA strain USA300. In both wild-type and CF mice, PD0325901 reduced inflammation associated body mass loss. Wild-type mice treated with PD0325901 had significant reduction in neutrophil-mediated inflammation compared to vehicle treatment groups, with preserved clearance of bacteria in lung, liver, or spleen 1 day after infection in either wild-type or CF mouse models. In summary, this study provides the first data evaluating the therapeutic potential of MEK1/2 inhibitor to modulate CF immune cells and demonstrates that MEK1/2 inhibitors diminish pro-inflammatory responses without impairing host defense mechanisms required for acute pathogen clearance.</p>

## From drugs to biomaterials: a review of emerging therapeutic strategies for intervertebral disc inflammation

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Chronic low back pain (LBP) is an increasingly prevalent issue, especially among aging populations. A major underlying cause of LBP is intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), often triggered by intervertebral disc (IVD) inflammation. Inflammation of the IVD is divided into Septic and Aseptic inflammation. Conservative therapy and surgical treatment often fail to address the root cause of IDD. Recent advances in the treatment of IVD infection and inflammation range from antibiotics and small-molecule drugs to cellular therapies, biological agents, and innovative biomaterials. This review sheds light on the complex mechanisms of IVD inflammation and physiological and biochemical processes of IDD. Furthermore, it provides an overview of recent research developments in this area, intending to identify novel therapeutic targets and guide future clinical strategies for effectively treating IVD-related conditions.</p>

## Role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in chronic brucellosis

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Human brucellosis, a <italic>Brucella</italic> infection caused most common zoonosis in the world, remains a serious public health burden in China. <italic>Brucella</italic> chronic infection always causes immunosuppressive status and results in severe organ or tissue damages. The aim of this work was to study the role of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in human chronic brucellosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifty cases of chronic brucellosis and 40 healthy individual controls were enrolled in this study. We analyzed the frequency and subsets of MDSCs in PBMC between the chronic brucellosis and healthy control groups by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we also measured the inflammatory-related cytokines in serum samples and the MDSCs inhibition ability to the proliferation of T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that the frequency of MDSCs in peripheral blood and the level of IL-6 and IL-10 Th2 cytokines and Arginase-1 were significantly increased in chronic brucellosis patients. In addition, we also found that the T cell function was suppressed in vitro by co-culturing with MDSCs from brucellosis patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study described an increase of immunosuppressive MDSCs in peripheral blood of chronic brucellosis patients. These results contribute to the understanding of <italic>Brucella</italic> persistent infection, which may provide an insight for effective treatment of chronic brucellosis patients in clinical practice.</p></sec>

## Oral administration of lysozyme protects against injury of ileum via modulating gut microbiota dysbiosis after severe traumatic brain injury

date: 2024-01-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objective</title><p>The current study sought to clarify the role of lysozyme-regulated gut microbiota and explored the potential therapeutic effects of lysozyme on ileum injury induced by severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and bacterial pneumonia <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Male 6–8-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into Normal group (N), Sham group (S), sTBI group (T), sTBI + or Lysozyme-treated group (L), Normal + Lysozyme group (NL) and Sham group + Lysozyme group (SL). At the day 7 after establishment of the model, mice were anesthetized and the samples were collected. The microbiota in lungs and fresh contents of the ileocecum were analyzed. Lungs and distal ileum were used to detect the degree of injury. The number of Paneth cells and the expression level of lysozyme were assessed. The bacterial translocation was determined. Intestinal organoids culture and co-coculture system was used to test whether lysozyme remodels the intestinal barrier through the gut microbiota.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After oral administration of lysozyme, the intestinal microbiota is rebalanced, the composition of lung microbiota is restored, and translocation of intestinal bacteria is mitigated. Lysozyme administration reinstates lysozyme expression in Paneth cells, thereby reducing intestinal permeability, pathological score, apoptosis rate, and inflammation levels. The gut microbiota, including <italic>Oscillospira</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>, <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Butyricicoccus</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, play a crucial role in regulating and improving intestinal barrier damage and modulating Paneth cells in lysozyme-treated mice. A co-culture system comprising intestinal organoids and brain-derived proteins (BP), which demonstrated that the BP effectively downregulated the expression of lysozyme in intestinal organoids. However, supplementation of lysozyme to this co-culture system failed to restore its expression in intestinal organoids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study unveiled a virtuous cycle whereby oral administration of lysozyme restores Paneth cell’s function, mitigates intestinal injury and bacterial translocation through the remodeling of gut microbiota.</p></sec>

## Prevalence of virulence- and antibiotic resistance-associated genotypes and phenotypes in Staphylococcus aureus strains from the food sector compared to clinical and cow mastitis isolates

date: 2024-01-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Infections by the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> currently represent one of the most  serious threats to human health worldwide, especially due to the production of enterotoxins and the  ability to form biofilms. These structures and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance limit the  action of antibiotics and disinfectants used to combat this microorganism in the industry and the  clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This work reports a comparative phenotypic and genotypic study of 18 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains from  different origins: clinical samples, milk from mastitic cows and food industry surfaces, most of which  were isolated in Northern Spain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Genetically, the strains were very diverse but, in most cases, a closer proximity was  observed for those from the same source. Notably, the average number of virulence genes was not  significantly different in strains from the food sector. Of the 18 strains, 10 coded for at least one  enterotoxin, and four of them carried 6 or 7 enterotoxin genes. The latter were all veterinary or  clinical isolates. Most strains carried prophages, plasmids and/or pathogenicity islands. Regarding  antibiotic resistance, although phenotypically all strains showed resistance to at least one  antibiotic, resistance genes were only identified in 44.5% of strains, being mastitis isolates those  with the lowest prevalence. Virulence-related phenotypic properties such as haemolytic activity,  staphyloxanthin production, biofilm-forming capacity and spreading ability were widely distributed  amongst the isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that production of virulence factors, antibiotic resistance and  biofilm formation can be found in <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from diverse environments, including the food  industry, although some of these traits are more prevalent in strains isolated from infections in cows  or humans. This emphasizes on the importance of monitoring the spread of these determinants not only  in samples from the clinical environment, but also along the food chain, a strategy that falls under  the prism of a one-health approach.</p></sec>
