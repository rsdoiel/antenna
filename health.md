## Intestinal microbiome changes and mechanisms of maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundConstipation is a common symptom in maintenance hemodialysis patients and greatly affects the quality of survival of hemodialysis patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics are feasible treatments for functional constipation, but there is still a gap in the research on the characteristics of gut flora in patients with maintenance hemodialysis combined with constipation. The aim of this study is to clarify the characteristics of the intestinal flora and its changes in maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation.MethodsFecal samples were collected from 45 participants, containing 15 in the maintenance hemodialysis constipation group,15 in the maintenance hemodialysis non-constipation group and 15 in the healthy control group. These samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The feature of the intestinal microbiome of maintenance hemodialysis constipation group and the microbiome differences among the three groups were elucidated by species annotation analysis, α-diversity analysis, β-diversity analysis, species difference analysis, and predictive functional analysis.ResultsThe alpha diversity analysis indicated that maintenance hemodialysis constipation group was less diverse and homogeneous than maintenance hemodialysis non-constipation group and healthy control group. At the genus level, the top ten dominant genera in maintenance hemodialysis constipation group patients were Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia and UCG-002. Compared with non-constipation group, the Enterococcus, Rhizobiales_unclassified, Filomicrobium, Eggerthella, Allobaculum, Prevotella_7, Gordonibacter, Mitochondria_unclassified, Lachnoanaerobaculum were significantly higher in constipation group (p<0.05). Compared with non-constipation group, the Kineothrix, Rhodopirellula, Weissella were significantly lower in constipation group (p<0.05). The predictive functional analysis revealed that compared with non-constipation group, constipation group was significantly enriched in pathways associated with pyruate metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis.ConclusionsThis study describes for the first time the intestinal microbiome characteristics of maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation. The results of this study suggest that there is a difference in the intestinal flora between maintenance hemodialysis patients with constipation and maintenance hemodialysis patients without constipation.

## Apigeninidin chloride disrupts Toxoplasma gondii Mitochondrial membrane potential and induce reactive oxygen species and metabolites production

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionApigeninidin chloride (APi) is a form of 3-deoxyanthrocyanidins (3-DAs) abundantly produced by the red Sorghum bicolor plant. It has been previously reported to be effective against Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) tachyzoites grown in vitro with less cytotoxic effect. However, its possible mechanism(s) of action has not been elucidated. Biochemically, we discovered that APi induced high reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria superoxide (MitoSOX) productions in tachyzoites, leading to mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption in vitro.MethodsTo confirm our biochemical results at the molecular level, we performed a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis on APi-treated parasites to assess any metabolite and lipid alterations often associated with high ROS/MitoSOX production in cells. ResultsNoteworthy is that we detected several important oxidative stress-induced metabolites such as hexanal, aldehydes, methyl undeo10-enoate, butadiynyl phenyl ketone, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (16-OH, 16:0), 2-hydroxytricosanoic acid (C23:0; O), 3-oxodecanosanoic acid (C22:1; O), 2-hydroxypropylsterate, and furan fatty acids F6 (19FU-FA). DiscussionThese metabolites are associated with lipid, protein, and nucleic acid disruptions. Using atovaquone (Atov) as a control, we observed that it disrupted intracellular tachyzoites’ mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS and MitoSOX production, and altered metabolite and lipid production similar to what was observed with our experimental compound APi. Overall, our results indicated that APi targets T. gondii tachyzoite growth through inducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually parasite death.

## A novel, rapid, ultrasensitive diagnosis platform for detecting Candida albicans using restriction endonuclease‐mediated real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCandida albicans (C. albicans, CA) is an essential invasive fungus in clinical diagnosis. Although several detection methods exist, none meet the need for early diagnosis. A rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool is crucial for effective prevention and control of C. albicans infections.MethodsThis study aimed to develop a new, rapid, and ultrasensitive diagnostic tool for C. albicans detection based on restriction endonuclease-mediated real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (ERT-LAMP-CA). The ERT-LAMP-CA technology combines LAMP amplification, restriction endonuclease cleavage, and real-time fluorescence detection in a single reaction tube, which can complete a diagnosis of C. albicans in a short time (approximately 1 h).ResultsHerein, we developed the primer sequences required for ERT-LAMP-CA based on the ITS2 gene of C. albicans and found that ERT-LAMP-CA limit of detection was approximately 500 ag/μL genomic DNA and can present negative results for non-C. albicans templates. We tested sputum samples from 64 patients with suspected C. albicans infections to validate ERT-LAMP-CA applicability in clinical sample testing and found that ERT-LAMP-CA was consistent with multiplex PCR-capillary electrophoresis.DiscussionIn conclusion, ERT-LAMP-CA is a rapid, accurate, and sensitive assay with excellent potential for clinical and basic laboratory diagnosis and an efficient screening strategy.

## Impact of endogenous viral elements on glioma clinical phenotypes by inducing OCT4 in the host

date: 2024-11-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionEndogenous viral elements (EVEs) are viral sequences integrated within the host genome that can influence gene regulation and tumor development. While EVEs have been implicated in cancer, their role in regulating key transcription factors in glioblastoma (GBM) remains underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between EVEs and the activation of OCT4, a critical transcription factor in GBM progression.MethodsWe utilized CancerHERVdb and HervD Atlas databases to identify potential interactions between EVEs and key genes involved in GBM. Data from 273 GBM patient samples in the TCGA database were analyzed to examine the correlation between OCT4 expression and mutations in glioma-related genes. Furthermore, glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) were assessed for the expression levels of OCT4 and SOX2, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed.ResultsOur analysis revealed that OCT4 is a pivotal gene activated by EVEs in GBM. OCT4 expression was significantly correlated with mutations in key glioma-associated genes. Higher OCT4 levels were associated with poorer patient prognosis, higher tumor grades, and older age. Additionally, GSCs exhibited elevated expression of both OCT4 and SOX2, with a positive correlation observed between these two genes in GBM patients.DiscussionThis study highlights the potential role of EVEs in driving GBM progression through the activation of OCT4. The findings emphasize the importance of OCT4 in GBM malignancy and suggest that targeting EVE-mediated pathways may provide new therapeutic approaches for GBM treatment.
