## Exploring the gut microbiota’s effect on temporomandibular joint disorder: a two−sample Mendelian randomization analysis

date: 2024-08-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTemporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are highly prevalent among people. Numerous investigations have revealed the impact of gut microbiota in many diseases. However, the causal relationship between Temporomandibular joint disorders and gut microbiota remains unclear.MethodsGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) refer to the identification of sequence variations, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), existing across the entire human genome. GWAS data were collected on gut microbiota and TMD. Then, instrumental variables were screened through F-values and removal of linkage disequilibrium. These SNPs underwent mendelian analysis using five mathematical models. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to further verify the stability of the results. Pathogenic factors of TMD mediate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and TMD were explored through a two-step Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, reverse mendelian analysis was conducted to account for potential reverse effects.ResultsThe analysis of the data in this article suggests that some gut microbiota, including Coprobacter, Ruminococcus torques group, Catenibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Turicibacter, Victivallis, MollicutesRF9, Methanobacteriales, Methanobacteriaceae, FamilyXI, Methanobacteria were identified as risk factors, while Peptococcaceae provides protection for TMD.ConclusionThe research reveals the relation of gut microbiota in TMD. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and suggest potential therapeutic strategy.
