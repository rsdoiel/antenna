## Ectopic USP15 expression inhibits HIV-1 transcription involving changes in YY1 deubiquitination and stability

date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionProtein homeostasis is maintained by the opposing action of ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase, two important components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and contributes to both normal physiological and pathophysiological processes. The current study aims to delineate the roles of ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15), a member of the largest deubiquitinase family, in HIV-1 gene expression and replication.MethodsWe took advantage of highly selective and specific ubiquitin variants (UbV), which were recently designed and developed for USP15, and ascertained the inhibitory effects of USP15 on HIV-1 gene expression and production by transfection and Western blotting. We also used real-time RT-PCR, transcription factor profiling, subcellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting to determine the transcription factors involved and the underlying molecular mechanisms.ResultsWe first confirmed the specificity of USP15-mediated HIV-1 gene expression and virus production. We then showed that the inhibition of HIV-1 production by USP15 occurred at the transcription level, associated with an increased protein level of YY1, a known HIV-1 transcription repressor. Moreover, we demonstrated that USP15 regulated YY1 deubiquitination and stability. Lastly, we demonstrated that YY1 siRNA knockdown significantly diminished the inhibition of USP15 on HIV-1 gene expression and virus production.ConclusionThese findings together demonstrate that stabilization of YY1 protein by USP15 deubiquitinating activity contributes to USP15-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription and may help the development of USP15-specific UbV inhibitors as an anti-HIV strategy.

## Application of recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow assay to pathogen point-of-care diagnosis

date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, point-of-care diagnostics based on nucleic acid testing have become a requirement for the development of pathogen diagnostics, which require the ability to accurately, rapidly, and conveniently detect pathogens. Conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques no longer meet the requirements for pathogen detection in low-resource, low-skill environments because they require specialist equipment, complex operations, and long detection times. Therefore, recombinant polymerase amplification (RPA) is becoming an increasingly important method in today’s nucleic acid detection technology because it can amplify nucleic acids in 20–30 minutes at a constant temperature, greatly reducing the dependence on specialist equipment and technicians. RPA products are primarily detected through methods such as real-time fluorescence, gel electrophoresis, lateral flow assays (LFAs), and other techniques. Among these, LFAs allow for the rapid detection of amplification products within minutes through the visualization of results, offering convenient operation and low cost. Therefore, the combination of RPA with LFA technology has significant advantages and holds broad application prospects in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, particularly in low-resource settings. Here, we focus on the principles of RPA combined with LFAs, their application to pathogen diagnosis, their main advantages and limitations, and some improvements in the methods.

date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Macrocybe is a well-studied genus in the family Callistosporiaceae (Basidiomycota). Currently, the genus comprises eight species with worldwide distribution. All species in this genus are relatively large compared to other edible mushrooms and are commonly consumed by locals. Cultivation methodologies have been developed for several species of the genus, including M. gigantea, M. crassa, M. titans, and M. lobayensis. These mushrooms can be cultivated in lignocellulosic wastes such as sawdust, straw, and other agro-industrial wastes. The nutritional compositions have been identified for M. gigantea, M. crassa, and M. lobayensis, revealing that they are rich in fibers, proteins, and various vitamins. Although these mushrooms are of culinary significance, precautions should be taken when consuming them due to their potential cyanic toxicity. In addition to being rich in different nutrients, Macrocybe species possess medicinal properties such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and several other beneficial effects. Several species are commercially available in countries like China and Thailand, and the commercial potential is high due to the large size, taste, and long shelf life of these mushrooms. There is significant potential for cultivating species of this genus and introducing their artificial cultivation practices to various counties worldwide. Diverse value-added products can also be produced using Macrocybe species.

## KIF20A activated by transcription factor GATA2 promotes cell growth in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma

date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundElevated evidence suggests that KIF20A plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism by which KIF20A promotes HCC cell growth are not well understood.MethodsUsing TCGA-LIHC RNAseq and GEO datasets, we assessed the KIF20A expression and patient survival in HCC and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Mutant and CNV analysis were performed to evaluate the genetic alteration of KIF20A in HCC. PPI network and GSEA enrichment was utilized for analyzing the KIF20A-related genes and involved pathways in HCC. To further explore regulatory mechanism in HBV-related HCC, PROMO prediction and luciferase reporter system was utilized for verifying HBx/GATA2/KIF20A binding sites. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were carried out to determine the regulation of GATA2-KIF20A on HBV-related HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis.ResultsKIF20A was significantly upregulated in pan-cancer (including HCC). KIF20A mRNA level was a significant independent predictor of overall survival in HBV-related HCC patients. Genetic alterations analysis revealed the copy number gain and amplification triggered KIF20A upregulation in HCC. In addition, the genes associated with KIF20A expression in HCC was enriched in PLK1 pathway and cell cycle in HCC. HBx might indirectly binds to KIF20A promoter via regulating GATA2. Additionally, transcription factor GATA2 directly binds to the promoter region of KIF20A. Overexpression of GATA2 promotes HepG2.2.15 cell growth and inhibits cell apoptosis via modulating KIF20A.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrated that HBx contributed to cell proliferation by interacting with GATA2 and KIF20A in HBV-related HCC.

## Ticks without borders: microbiome of immature neotropical tick species parasitizing migratory songbirds along northern Gulf of Mexico

date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe long-distance, seasonal migrations of birds make them an effective ecological bridge for the movement of ticks. The introduction of exotic tick species to new geographical regions can cause the emergence of novel tick-borne pathogens. This study examined the prevalence of exotic tick species parasitizing migratory songbirds at stopover sites along the northern Gulf of Mexico using the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene.MethodsOverall, 421 individual ticks in the genera Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes were recorded from 28 songbird species, of which Amblyomma and Amblyomma longirostre were the most abundant tick genera and species, respectively. A high throughput 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing approach characterized the microbial communities and identified pathogenic microbes in all tick samples.Results and discussionMicrobial profiles showed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The most abundant pathogens were Rickettsia and endosymbiont Francisella, Candidatus Midichloria, and Spiroplasma. Permutation multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the relative abundance of Francisella and Rickettsia drives microbial patterns across the tick genera. We also noted a higher percentage of positive correlations in microbe-microbe interactions among members of the microbial communities. Network analysis suggested a negative correlation between a) Francisella and Rickettsia and, b) Francisella and Cutibacterium. Lastly, mapping the distributions of bird species parasitized during spring migrations highlighted geographic hotspots where migratory songbirds could disperse ticks and their pathogens at stopover sites or upon arrival to their breeding grounds, the latter showing mean dispersal distances from 421–5003 kilometers. These findings spotlight the potential role of migratory birds in the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.

## Development and application of a quadruplex TaqMan fluorescence quantitative PCR typing method for Streptococcus suis generalis, type 2, type 7 and type 9

date: 2024-11-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionStreptococcus suis (SS) is one of the most important pathogens causing major economic losses in the global pig farming industry and is a serious threat to public health safety. It has multiple serotypes, with poor cross-protection between serotypes, and effective typing methods are lacking.MethodsIn this study, a quadruplex TaqMan fluorescence quantitative PCR assay that can differentiate between Streptococcus suis types 2, 7 and 9 was developed using the gdh gene, a generic gene for Streptococcus suis, and cps2J, cps7H and cps9J, genes encoding podocarp-associated genes for types 2, 7 and 9, respectively, as targets.ResultsThe method is specific enough to accurately type Streptococcus suis pigmentosus without detecting non-target pathogens (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and et al). The sensitivity was high, with a minimum lower detection line of 10 copies for P-SS and P-SS9, and 100 copies for P-SS2 and P-SS7. The standard curves generated showed good linearity with R2 of 0.999, 0.999, 0.997 and 0.998 respectively. The repeatability was good, with coefficients of variation between batch to batch and batch to batch tests ranging from 0.21% to 1.10%. Testing of 156 samples yielded 68 positive and 88 negative samples, of which the positive rate of SS was 5.77% (9/156), SS2 was 20.51% (32/156), SS7 was 8.33% (13/156) and SS9 was 9.6% (15/156), which was in line with the existing fluorescent quantitative PCR assay of 93.75%~100%, which was higher than the detection rate of conventional PCR.DiscussionThe quadruplex TaqMan fluorescence quantitative PCR method of Streptococcus suis generic, type 2, 7 and 9 established in this study can accurately differentiate the three serotypes of Streptococcus suis that currently have high prevalence and pathogenicity, which is of great importance for accurate clinical prevention and treatment, epidemiological investigation and vaccine development.
