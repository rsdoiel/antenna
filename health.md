## Sirtuin 2 inhibitor AGK2 exerts antiviral effects by inducing epigenetic suppression of hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA through recruitment of repressive histone lysine methyltransferases and reduction of cccDNA

date: 2025-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to be a global health concern because current treatments such as interferon-α and nucleos(t)ide analogs cannot fully eliminate the virus due to persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and integrated HBV DNA. Earlier research suggests that AGK2, a selective SIRT2 inhibitor, suppresses HBV replication by modifying key signaling pathways. This study aimed to further explore the anti-HBV effects of AKG2, particularly its effects on the epigenetic landscape of cccDNA. HBV-transfected and -infected cells were used to assess the impact of AGK2 on viral replication. Changes in SIRT2 expression and α-tubulin acetylation (SDS-PAGE-immunoblotting), core particle formation (native agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting), HBV RNA (northern blotting) and DNA (Southern blotting) synthesis, and cccDNA levels (Southern blotting) were measured. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to examine deposition of transcriptionally repressive epigenetic markers on cccDNA. AGK2 reduced expression of SIRT2, increased acetylated α-tubulin levels, and reduced synthesis of HBV RNA and DNA. Importantly, AGK2 also reduced cccDNA levels and increased deposition of repressive histone markers H4K20me1, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 on cccDNA, mediated by histone lysine methyltransferases such as PR-Set7, EZH2, SETDB1, and SUV39H1. Additionally, there was a reduction in recruitment of RNA polymerase II and acetylated H3 to cccDNA, indicating that AGK2 enhances transcriptional repression. AGK2 suppresses HBV replication through direct antiviral actions, and by epigenetic modulation of cccDNA, indicating that using AGK2 to target SIRT2 and associated epigenetic regulators shows promise as a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B.

## Self-assembled epitope-based nanoparticles targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein enhanced the immune response and induced potential broad neutralizing activity

date: 2025-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe ongoing COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic, resulting in millions of infections and deaths. While current vaccines target the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, its high mutation rate significantly compromises vaccine efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the potential of epitope-based nanoparticles (NPs) to induce broad cross-protection and durable immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.MethodsFour conserved epitopes derived from the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 subunit of the spike protein were integrated into Helicobacter pylori ferritin to create epitope-based NPs named S18-F, RBM-F, UH-F, and HR2-F. The immunogenicity of the epitope-based NPs was evaluated through animal experiments to measure epitope-specific antibody titers and assess neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. To characterize cellular immune responses, splenic lymphocyte proliferation following epitope stimulation was measured, and cytokine secretion profiles including IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were analyzed to determine Th1/Th2 immune polarization. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays were performed to evaluate NP-enhanced recognition and elimination of infected target cells.ResultsThese NPs induced high titers of epitope-specific antibodies lasting three months post-immunization. Sera from the RBM-F, UH-F, and HR2-F groups exhibited neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus WH-1 in vitro. Splenic lymphocytes from the S18-F, RBM-F, and UH-F groups showed significantly increased proliferation. Lymphocytes from the RBM-F group demonstrated increased secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 cytokines, indicating a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune response. Immune sera from the S18-F and mixed-immunized groups exhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.DiscussionThe results indicate that these NPs induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses, potentially offering a promising strategy for effective vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.

## Gut microbiota and intestinal immunity interaction in ulcerative colitis and its application in treatment

date: 2025-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, non-specific inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and injury of the colonic mucosa, exhibiting an increasing global incidence. Although research into UC pathogenesis is ongoing, the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Studies indicate that UC development results from a complex interplay of factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, gut microbial dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation. Specifically, UC pathogenesis involves aberrant immune responses triggered by interactions between the host and gut microbiota. A complex, dynamic relationship exists between the microbial community and the host immune system throughout UC pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that changes in microbiota composition significantly impact gut immunity. This review will examine the intricate balance between the gut microbiota and mucosal immunity in UC progression and discuss potential therapeutic applications, providing a reference for further clinical treatment of this patient population.

## A retrospective analysis comparing metagenomic next-generation sequencing with conventional microbiology testing for the identification of pathogens in patients with severe infections

date: 2025-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe application value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogenic bacteria was evaluated to promote the rational and accurate use of antibiotics. A total of 180 patients with severe infections were included in this study.MethodsBased on their different symptoms, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or blood samples were collected for conventional microbiological testing (CMT) and mNGS.ResultsThe results indicated that the etiological diagnosis rate of mNGS (78.89%) was significantly higher than that of CMT (20%) (p<0.001). Notably, mNGS exhibited greater sensitivity towards rare pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and Legionella pneumophila, which were undetectable by CMT. Additionally, 64 cases underwent blood culture, BALF culture, and mNGS testing. Analysis revealed that the positive rate of blood culture (3.1%) was lower than that of BALF (25%), and the positive rate of CMT from both types was significantly lower than that of mNGS (89.1%) (p<0.001). In this study, 168 mNGS results were accepted, and 116 patients had their antibiotic therapy adjustment based on mNGS. Paired analysis indicated that white blood cell count (WBC), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil (NEU) percentage provided valuable therapeutic guidance. The survival rate of patients was 55.36%, influenced by patient physical condition and age.DiscussionOur data indicated that mNGS had significant auxiliary value in the clinical diagnosis and treatment for critically ill patients, especially for those with negative CMT results and clinically undefined infections. mNGS could broaden the detection scope, especially for special pathogens, and improve the detection rate, providing powerful assistance for early clinical diagnosis and treatment.

## Changes in children respiratory infections pre and post COVID-19 pandemic

date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the prevalence of various acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pathogens.MethodsWe collected 337,310 real-time PCR results for 13 pathogens from clinical samples between January 2018 and January 2024 to assess the changes of ARIs among children before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultsA variety of ARIs pathogens, including Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B), Adenovirus (ADV), Rhinovirus (RhV), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), as well as co-infecting bacterial such as Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAE), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Haemophilus influenzae (HI), and Listeria monocytogenes (LP), reached a peak positive rate at the age of 3. The susceptible age of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) was from 3 to 7 years old. Compared to the pre-COVID pandemic period, the positive rates of Flu A, MP, ADV, SP, HI, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and KPN decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. And the positive rates of Flu B and PAE increased. Compared to the period during the COVID-19 pandemic, the positive rates of Flu A, ADV, RSV, RhV, SP, HI, KPN, PAE and SA were increased after the pandemic. Conversely, the positive rates of MP, Flu B, and Parainfluenza virus (PIV) decreased.ConclusionsThe implementation of NPIs interrupted the circulation of ARIs pathogens. However, release of NPIs and the reduced baseline of population immunity, may contribute to a resurgence of ARIs pathogens among children.

## Oral Fusobacterium nucleatum exacerbates ulcerative colitis via the oral-gut axis: mechanisms and therapeutic implications

date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundFusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is an anaerobic bacterium known for its association with periodontal disease and oral infections. It has been implicated in the development of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Ulcerative colitis (UC), which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon, is a condition of unknown etiology with a rising incidence rate, significantly affecting the quality of life for patients. The increased intestinal permeability during UC may facilitate the adherence or invasion of F. nucleatum into the damaged intestinal barrier, leading to exacerbated inflammation.MethodsThis article introduces the concept of the oral-gut axis, reviewing existing literature to analyze the role of F. nucleatum in the pathogenesis of UC and exploring its potential pathogenic mechanisms. It also summarizes the latest advances in treating patients with UC who have F. nucleatum and looks forward to prospective therapeutic strategies and the translational prospects of F. nucleatum within the oral-gut axis.ResultsF. nucleatum may be a key player in the pathogenesis of UC, likely due to its invasiveness during periods of increased intestinal permeability. The paper also discusses innovative approaches for the prevention and management of UC exacerbated by F. nucleatum, paving the way for more effective treatment of UC.ConclusionThe review offers new insights into the complex relationship between the oral microbiome and intestinal diseases, enhancing our understanding of their dynamic interactions. There is a paucity of literature on therapeutic approaches, indicating a need for further clinical research.

## Alcohol exposure alters the diversity and composition of oral microbiome

date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAlcohol exposure has been shown to have complex, and sometimes paradoxical, associations with various serious diseases. Currently, there is no knowledge about the effects of alcohol exposure on the dynamics of oral microbial communities.ObjectiveThe study aims to investigate the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the diversity and composition dynamics of the rat oral microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.MethodsIn our study, there were 2 groups, including a control group (C group) and an alcohol group (A group), with 10 rats in every group. For ten weeks, rats in the A group were treated with alcohol intragastrically every day, whereas rats in the C group got water. After 10 weeks, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Oral swabs were taken from both groups, and total DNA was extracted for high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.ResultsAccording to the results obtained from our study, significant differences were observed in the relative abundances of microbial communities. Alpha diversity measures were statistically significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the A group compared to the C group. At the genus level, alcohol exposure altered the relative abundance of several microbes, including increased relative abundance of unidentified_Chloroplast, Acinetobacter, Vibrio, Romboutsia, Pseudoalteromonas, Aeromonas, Ralstonia, Turicibacter, Shewanella, and Bacteroides. Conversely, Haemophilus and Streptococcus were significantly less abundant in the A group.ConclusionAlcohol exposure was associated with the diversity and composition of the oral microbiome. These findings contribute to our understanding of the potential role of oral bacteria in alcohol-related oral and systemic diseases, providing foundational work for future prevention and intervention studies.

## Targeted and untargeted metabolomics uncovering the effects of Jiawei Ermiao Granule on patients with persistent HPV infection

date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Jiawei Ermiao Granule (JWEMG) is a traditional Chinese herbal formulation widely used in China for the treatment of human papilloma virus (HPV) infections. However, the mechanisms underlying their efficacy in clearing HPV infections remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which JWEMG clears persistent HPV infections from a metabolomics perspective using modern analytical techniques. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics analyses were performed on vaginal lavage samples from 33 patients using liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Untargeted metabolomics identified 47 potential biomarkers through volcano plot analysis, among which 30 exhibited a reversal trend following JWEMG intervention. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested that JWEMG may exert therapeutic effects on patients with persistent HPV infections via pathways related to starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Targeted metabolomics revealed a significant increase in tyrosine levels in the vaginal/cervical microenvironment following JWEMG treatment. By integrating targeted and untargeted metabolomics, this study provides a comprehensive exploration of the holistic effects of JWEMG on HPV-infected patients, addressing the challenges of scientifically explaining the pharmacological mechanisms of multi-component, multi-target traditional Chinese medicines.

## Resistance phenotypes and genomic features of Mycobacterium seoulense isolates

date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMycobacterium seoulense (M. seoulense) is an emerging pathogen increasingly associated with infections; however, its resistance phenotypes and genomic characteristics remain largely unknown.MethodsSeven M. seoulense isolates were collected from clinical samples. Drug susceptibility testing was conducted using Sensititre™ SLOMYCO2 susceptibility plates. Whole genome sequencing and supporting bioinformatics analyses were performed to analyze the genomic features.ResultsAll M. seoulense isolates (n=7) exhibited growth on 7H10 agar medium containing thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazide or p-Nitrobenzoic acid, with marked diversity in growth rates in liquid culture. All strains exhibited high minimum inhibitor concentrations (MICs) for minocycline (>8 μg/mL), doxycycline (>8 μg/mL), and amikacin (16-32 μg/mL). The MICs for linezolid, rifabutin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, clarithromycin, and rifampicin varied among the isolates. High levels of genomic diversity were noted among these strains concerning genome-called single nucleotide polymorphisms and average nucleotide identity. In total, 4,282 genes were shared across all genomes, while 315 unique genes were restricted to one strain. Comparative genomic analysis identified two unique virulence genes encoding a catalase enzyme and a protein involved in capsule biosynthesis and transport. Additionally, all M. seoulense strains demonstrated the ability to survive within macrophages.ConclusionThe clinical M. seoulense isolates analyzed in this study exhibited varying levels of antibiotic susceptibility, suggesting the potential need for susceptibility testing to guide clinical treatment. Genomic features of these isolates indicated that they are likely pathogenic non-tuberculous mycobacterium, highlighting a need for closer epidemiological monitoring.

## Identification and characterization of bile microbiota in patients with biliary obstructive diseases using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS

date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundComparative studies of the bile microbiota in different biliary obstructive infections remain limited. This study aims to characterize bile microbiota and investigate differences in microbial profiles across various biliary obstructive diseases.MethodsThis study included patients with biliary obstructive diseases admitted to Jinling Hospital and Suqian First Hospital. The cohort consisted of individuals with benign biliary disorders, malignant biliary obstruction, and biliary obstruction secondary to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) or intestinal fistulas. A total of 133 bile samples were collected from 118 patients and analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene. Clinical data, including routine culture results, were extracted from electronic medical records.ResultsNGS targeting the 16S rRNA and ITS revealed a positive rate of 68.42% for bile samples, which was higher than the culture positivity rate of 60.15%, indicating a significant difference (Chi-square test, p < 0.05). The predominant bacteria identified in the bile samples through NGS were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli. Bacterial species varied among benign biliary diseases, malignant obstructive diseases, and biliary obstruction caused by SAP or intestinal fistulas. Fungi were detected in 7.52% (10/133) of the samples, with 4 samples obtained from patients with biliary obstructive diseases due to SAP. Microbial diversity and clustering analysis showed no significant differences among various biliary disorders. Based on the culture results, the sensitivity and specificity of NGS were 81.82% and 69.64%, respectively.ConclusionThe composition of bile microbes may be related to the etiology of biliary obstruction. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli are the predominant bacteria found in bile. NGS can be effectively applied for the identification and characterization of bile microbes associated with various biliary obstruction diseases.
