## Clinical characteristics and the role of IL-6 in acute-on-chronic liver failure patients with or without COVID-19: a multicenter paired cohort study

date: 2025-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background and AimsThe impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) remains unclear. To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with ACLF complicated with COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the precise treatment of this patient population.MethodsA total of 34 ACLF patients with COVID-19 admitted to these three hospitals from December 2022 to August 2023 were included as the ACLF+COVID-19 group. Additionally, 34 age-, gender-, etiology-, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) score-matched ACLF patients were screened from 286 ACLF patients as the ACLF group. From 382 COVID-19 patients, 34 were selected as the COVID-19 group, matching the ACLF+COVID-19 group in age, gender, and illness severity. Clinical features of these three groups were compared, with the primary measure being the 28-day mortality rate in the ACLF patients and the secondary measures including clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, comorbidities, and complications in three groups.ResultsCompared with the ACLF group, the ACLF+COVID-19 group had significantly higher incidence rates of fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, and hypoxemia (all p<0.01). Patients in the ACLF+COVID-19 group were more likely to have hepatic encephalopathy (p=0.015), lower platelet count (p=0.016) and elevated IL-6 level (p=0.026), and higher MELD-Na score (p=0.041) one week after admission, but without a significant increase in 28-day mortality rate (p=0.16).ConclusionsACLF patients with COVID-19 have increased risk for thrombocytopenia, more obvious inflammatory response, and rapid disease progression 1 week after admission, but the 28-day mortality rate is similar to that of ACLF patients without COVID-19.

## Investigating the biological significance of the TCM principle “promoting urination to regulate bowel movements” through the influence of the intestinal microbiota and their metabolites on the renal-intestinal axis

date: 2025-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Treatment methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are foundational to their theoretical, methodological, formulaic, and pharmacological systems, significantly contributing to syndrome differentiation and therapy. The principle of “promoting urination to regulate bowel movements” is a common therapeutic approach in TCM. The core concept is “promoting the dispersion and drainage of water dampness, regulating urination to relieve diarrhea,” yet its scientific underpinning remains unclear. Modern medical treatment for watery diarrhea primarily focuses on electrolyte replenishment, as diuretics may lead to dehydration and other side effects. Some reports suggest that this TCM approach lacks scientific validity. Microecology, an area associated with the origins of TCM, is closely related to the development, diagnosis, and treatment of diarrhea. The renal-intestinal axis offers a molecular biological basis for examining associated pathological mechanisms, advancing therapeutic targets such as “treating the intestine to address kidney issues” and highlighting the interactions within the “renal-intestinal microbiota-liquid metabolism” framework, thus providing an endogenous mechanism to support “treating the intestine through the kidney.” An increasing number of studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites, as unique mediators, are involved in the physiological and pathological changes of the body. Therefore, this study explores the relationship between fluid metabolism and diarrhea from the perspective of the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites, aiming to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the “promoting urination to regulate bowel movements” therapeutic approach and to clarify the scientific basis for treating diarrhea via the renal-intestinal axis. This research provides new insights for the study of TCM microbiology.

## The independent predictive value of admission serum ferritin concentration for prognosis in elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department

date: 2025-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) poses a significant health threat to the elderly population, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Serum ferritin, a critical indicator of iron metabolism, plays a pivotal role in inflammation and immune regulation. Nevertheless, its specific prognostic relevance in elderly patients with CAP remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive capacity of serum ferritin in determining the prognosis of elderly patients with CAP and to investigate its effectiveness when combined with the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) or CURB-65 (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, blood pressure, aged ≥65 years) scores.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included 451 elderly patients (aged ≥65 years) diagnosed with CAP according to established criteria. Serum ferritin concentrations were measured upon admission and various prognostic indicators such as 28-day mortality, mechanical ventilation requirement, and vasopressor administration were analyzed in conjunction with white blood count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate (Lac), SOFA scores, and CURB-65 scores. The independent predictive value of ferritin was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression.ResultsAmong the 451 patients, 99 (22%) died within 28 days. The area under the curve (AUC) of serum ferritin for predicting 28-day mortality was 0.75 (95%CI: 0.695-0.805). Ferritin outperformed WBC, CRP, and PCT in predictive performance, and its performance was comparable to Lac. When combined with SOFA or CURB-65 scores, the AUC of ferritin for predicting 28-day mortality increased to 0.84 and 0.847, respectively (P<0.001). Moreover, the AUC of ferritin for predicting vasopressor administration was 0.707, which increased to 0.864 and 0.822 when combined with SOFA or CURB-65 scores, respectively (P<0.001). Ferritin could predict mechanical ventilation requirement with an AUC of 0.618, but it was not an independent risk factor, and its predictive ability was not significantly different from other indicators.ConclusionAdmission serum ferritin is an independent predictor for the prognosis of elderly patients with CAP, and it exhibits a strong ability to predict the 28-day mortality and vasopressor administration. The combination of ferritin with SOFA and CURB-65 scores significantly improves the prognostic predictive potency.

## Exploring mosquito virome dynamics within São Paulo Zoo: insights into mosquito-virus-environment interactions

date: 2025-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMosquito-borne diseases have a significant public health threat worldwide, with arboviruses accounting for a high proportion of infectious diseases and mortality annually. Brazil, in particular, has been suffering outbreaks of diseases transmitted by mosquito viruses, notably those of the Aedes genus, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Against this background, the São Paulo Zoo is an intriguing ecological niche to explore the virome of mosquitoes, potentially shedding light on the dynamics of arbovirus transmission within a confined setting.MethodsIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive metagenomic analysis of mosquitoes collected from diverse habitats within the zoo, focusing on the Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex genera. From 1,039 contigs of viral origin, we identified 229 viral species infecting mosquitoes, with the orders Picornavirales, Nodamuvirales and Sobelivirales being the most prevalent and abundant. The difference in virome composition was primarily driven by mosquito host species rather than specific collection sites or trap height.ResultsDespite environmental disparities, the virome remained remarkably uniform across different areas of the zoo, emphasizing the strong association between mosquito species and their viral communities. Furthermore, we identified a core virome shared among mosquito species, highlighting potential cross-species transmission events and underscoring the need for targeted surveillance and control measures.ConclusionThese results contribute to our understanding of the interplay between mosquitoes, the environment, and viruses, providing valuable insights for disease intervention strategies in mosquito-borne diseases.

## Genomic analysis of the main epidemiological lineages of Acinetobacter baumannii in Mexico

date: 2025-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a critical global health threat due to its exceptional survival skills in adverse environment and its ability to acquire antibiotic resistance, presenting significant challenges for infection treatment and control. The World Health Organization has classified carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii as a “Critical Priority” pathogen to guide research and the development of control and prevention strategies. Epidemiological surveillance methodologies provide the tools necessary for classifying A. baumannii into international clonal lineages, facilitating the analysis of molecular characteristics, global dissemination, and evolution. This study provides a detailed analysis of the molecular epidemiology of A. baumannii in Mexico, focusing on identifying the main international clonal lineages. Genomic analyses of 146 genomes, along with information from previous studies, identified 24 different sequence types according to the Oxford Scheme. The major international clone IC2 (CC208) was identified and harbors β-lactamases OXA-66, ADC-30, OXA-72, and is predicted to possess the OCL1 locus. The international clone IC5 (CC205) carries β-lactamase OXA-65, along with ADC-214 and OXA-239, with OCL10 predicted in 82.2% of the genomes. The international clone IC7 (CC229) harbors β-lactamase OXA-64, as well as ADC-174 and ADC-214, with OCL6 and OCL7 loci predicted. These international clones were identified in different periods and regions of Mexico and are likely to be widely distributed throughout the country. The analysis of each lineage reveals distinct molecular characteristics, including sequence types, capsule typing, outer core loci, and specific antibiotic resistance profiles. Understanding these features is crucial for elucidating their roles in infection dynamics, resistance mechanisms, and their impact on clinical outcomes.

## Impact of co-infections and immune responses on clinical severity of human adenovirus 3 and 7 infections in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections: a comparative study

date: 2025-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe pathogenic distribution of co-infections and immunological status of patients infected with human adenovirus serotypes 3 or 7 (HAdV-3 or HAdV-7) were poorly understood.MethodsThis study involved a retrospective analysis of respiratory specimens collected from enrolled children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), positive for HAdV-3 or HAdV-7 from January 2017 to December 2019. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory and radiographic findings were compared to delineate the impact of co-infections, and immune responses on clinical severity of HAdV-3 or HAdV-7 infections.ResultsAmong 1311cases enrolled, there were 66 infected with HAdV-3 and 58 with HAdV-7. HAdV-7-infected patients exhibited more prolonged fever (100% vs 89.4%, p=0.014), pneumonia (100% vs 89.4%, p=0.014), hypoxia (34.5% vs 12.1%, p=0.003), higher propensity for aspartate aminotransferase exceeding 80U/L (21.1% vs 4.7%, p=0.006), D-Dimer exceeding 1.65mg/L (64.9% vs 12.5%, p<0.001), consolidation (50.0% vs 27.4%, p=0.011), and pleural effusion (32.8% vs 6.5%, p<0.001), co-infections with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (77.1% vs 32.6%, p<0.001), and multiple infections (56.8% vs 41.3%, p=0.007), compared to those with HAdV-3 infections. Immune cell analysis indicated that HAdV-7 infections led to a more pronounced decrease in CD3+ T cells (1596.8 vs 2444.8 cells/𝛍l, p=0.042), CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (668.6 vs 774.0 cells/µl, p=0.045), and increased NK cell percentages (11.5% vs 9.0%, p=0.044) compared to HAdV-3 infections.ConclusionsHospitalized children with HAdV-7-associated LRTIs exhibit greater severity, multiple infections, and significant potential for greater cellular immune dysregulation compared to those with HAdV-3 infection, indicating a more severe clinical course and distinct pathogenic profiles.

## Exploring the microbiome-gut-testis axis in testicular germ cell tumors

date: 2025-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The microbiome-gut-testis axis has emerged as a significant area of interest in understanding testicular cancer, particularly testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), which represent the most common malignancy in young men. The interplay between the gut and testicular microbiomes is hypothesized to influence tumorigenesis and reproductive health, underscoring the complex role of microbial ecosystems in disease pathology. The microbiome-gut-testis axis encompasses complex interactions between the gut microbiome, systemic immune modulation, and the local microenvironment of the testis. Dysbiosis in the gut or testicular microbiomes may contribute to altered immune responses, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances, potentially playing a role in the pathogenesis of TGCTs. Concurrently, seminal microbiomes have been linked to variations in sperm quality, fertility potential, and possibly cancer susceptibility, underscoring the need for further evaluation. This review explores the emerging role of the microbiome-gut-testis axis in the context of testicular cancer, highlighting its implications for disease onset, progression, treatment efficacy, and toxicity. Identifying potential microbial biomarkers, followed by microbiota modulation to restore a balanced microbial community, might offer a novel supportive strategy for improving treatment efficacy in refractory TGCT patients while reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity. We suggest a better understanding of the association between dysregulated microbial environments and TGCTs emphasizes potential pathways by which the gut microbiome might influence testicular cancer.

## Exosomes derived from syncytia induced by SARS-2-S promote the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea, mild pneumonia and acute lung injury (ALI), which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and SARS-CoV-2 can accelerate tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanism for the increased mortality in cancer patients infected with COVID-19 is unclear.MethodsColony formation and wound healing assays were performed on Huh-7 cells cocultured with syncytia. Exosomes were purified from the cell supernatant and verified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot (WB) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differentially expressed proteins in syncytia-derived exosomes (Syn-Exos) and their functions was analyzed by Proteomic sequencing. Syn-Exo-mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was measured by CCK-8 and Transwell migration assays. The mechanism by which Syn-Exos promote tumor growth was analyzed by Western blotting. A patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) mouse model was constructed to evaluate the pathological role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S). The number of syncytia in the tumor tissue sections was determined by immunofluorescence analysis.ResultsSyncytium formation promoted the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Proteomic sequencing revealed that proteins that regulate cell proliferation and metastasis in Syn-Exos were significantly upregulated. Syn-Exos promote the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Animal experiments showed that a pseudotyped lentivirus bearing SARS-2-S (SARS-2-Spp) promoted tumor development in PDX mice. More syncytia were found in tumor tissue from SARS-2-Spp mice than from VSV-Gpp mice.ConclusionsSyn-Exos induced by SARS-2-S can promote the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

## Interpretable machine learning-based prediction of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with sepsis: a multicenter retrospective study

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSepsis is a major cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and continues to pose a significant global health challenge, with sepsis-related deaths contributing substantially to the overall burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The primary objective was to construct and evaluate a machine learning (ML) model for forecasting 28-day all-cause mortality among ICU sepsis patients.MethodsData for the study was sourced from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) (version 2.0). The main outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Predictor selection for the final model was conducted using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and the Boruta feature selection algorithm. Five machine learning algorithms including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and light gradient boosting machine (lightGBM) were employed to construct models using 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, we performed an interpretability analysis on the model that showed the most stable performance.ResultsThe final study cohort comprised 4564 patients, among whom 568 (12.4%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. The XGBoost algorithm demonstrated the most reliable performance, achieving an AUC of 0.821, balancing sensitivity (0.703) and specificity (0.798). The top three risk predictors of mortality included APACHE score, serum lactate levels, and AST.ConclusionML models reliably predicted 28-day mortality in critically ill sepsis patients. Of the models evaluated, the XGBoost algorithm exhibited the most stable performance in identifying patients at elevated mortality risk. Model interpretability analysis identified crucial predictors, potentially informing clinical decisions for sepsis patients in the ICU.

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Endophytic fungi associated with selected aquatic plants, Eichhornia crassipes, Nymphaea nouchali, Salvinia minima and S. molesta were evaluated. Ectophoma salviniae sp. nov. and Neottiosporina mihintaleensis sp. nov. are introduced as novel taxa from Salvinia spp. from Sri Lanka. Chaetomella raphigera is reported as a new geographical record, Colletotrichum siamense and C. truncatum are reported as novel host records in aquatic plants, while Phyllosticta capitalensis has been identified on the same host (Nymphaea nouchali) in the North-Central Province of Sri Lanka. Identification of the fungi was based on morphological characteristics and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses using ITS, LSU, SSU, ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, tub2, rpb2, and tef1-α molecular markers. The identified fungi were analysed for extracellular enzymatic properties. According to the qualitative analysis, Ectophoma salviniae sp. nov. exhibited the highest amylase production, Chaetomella raphigera exhibited the highest cellulase enzyme production, and Neottiosporina mihintaleensis sp. nov. exhibited the highest laccase production. The results demonstrate the aquatic fungal diversity in this region and their extracellular enzymatic potentials, providing valuable insights for future biotechnological approaches.

## Genetic insights into MIS-C Post-COVID-19 in Kuwaiti children: investigating monogenic factors

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe complication arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with indications that rare inborn errors of immunity may play a role in its pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that genetic predispositions, particularly monogenic forms, could significantly influence the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in MIS-C.MethodsWe analysed 24 children under 12 years old, all of whom met the criteria provided by the World Health Organization, 2020 for MIS-C diagnosis, from the Paediatric COVID-19 Registry in Kuwait (PCR-Q8). Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records, and exome sequencing was performed on the children and their parents to identify rare exonic variants. These variants were prioritized using two approaches: a candidate genes approach employing trio segregation analysis, and a candidate variants approach using a gene panel informed by previous studies on MIS-C-related genetic variants and datasets of differentially expressed genes in MIS-C patients.ResultsThe candidate genes approach identified 53 unique genes in 20 of the 24 probands, including DDX60 and TMEM154, which were also differentially expressed between MIS-C and control groups. The candidate variants approach identified 33 rare, predicted deleterious heterozygous variants across 19 unique genes in 19 of the 24 probands, including both previously described and novel candidate variants for MIS-C. Pathway analysis of the identified genes from both approaches revealed significant involvement in immune response, viral defence, and inflammatory pathways.ConclusionThis study underscores the monogenic susceptibility to MIS-C, enhancing the evidence base through comprehensive genetic analysis. The findings highlight the critical role of genetic predispositions in MIS-C and suggest that further functional genomics work is necessary to explore the mechanistic contributions of these genes, facilitating the development of targeted diagnostic strategies.

## Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with the vitamin D pathway related to clinical and therapeutic outcomes of American tegumentary leishmaniasis

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe vitamin D pathway contributes to the microbicidal activity of macrophages against Leishmania infection. In addition to induction of this pathway, interferon-gamma (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)-15, and IL32γ are part of a network of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of this study was to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the components of the vitamin D pathway and associated cytokine genes that could be related to resistance or susceptibility to American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL).MethodsThe expressions of IFNG, IL15, IL32, CYP27B1, VDR, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL6, and IL17 genes were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in lesions of patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) or mucosal leishmaniasis (ML). SNP genotypes/alleles (in IL15, IL32, CYP27B1, and VDR) were evaluated by TaqMan PCR assays using DNA from the blood of patients and healthy individuals. Serum vitamin D levels were determined by chemiluminescence.ResultsVitamin D pathway-associated genes were expressed in cutaneous as well as mucosal lesions. IFNG, IL6, and IL17 were more highly expressed in ML than in LCL. In contrast, IL32γ/CYP27B1/VDR mRNAs were mainly correlated in LCL, and IL32γ in ML makes strong connections with all cytokines. The SNP IL32 rs1555001 was less frequent in patients with ML. In addition, some SNPs appear to influence the VDR and CYP27B1 (IL15 rs10519613 and IL15 rs3775597) and IL6 (VDR rs7975232) expressions in LCL and the IL17 expression in ML (IL15 rs3775597). Gene expression was also correlated with clinical parameters, such as number of lesions (CYP27B1 mRNA) and treatment failure (VDR mRNA). In addition, one SNP was associated with treatment failure in ML (VDR rs7975232).ConclusionsOur findings suggested that some SNPs in the vitamin D pathway-associated genes can be related to resistance and therapeutic outcomes of ATL. They are promising candidates that need to be further evaluated to understand their biological effects in the control or immunopathogenesis of ATL.

## Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of post-stroke infections: a case series study using multiple sample types

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMetagenomic high-throughput sequencing (mNGS) represents a powerful tool for detecting nucleic acids from various pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites, in clinical samples. Despite its extensively employed in the pathogen diagnosis for various infectious diseases, its application in diagnosing stroke-related infection, and its potential impact on clinical decision-making, anti-infection treatment, clinical intervention, and patient prognosis remain insufficiently explored. Additionally, while mNGS offers promising potential, it facts limitations related to sensitivity, specificity, cost, and standardization, which could influence its integration into routine clinical practice.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 18 stroke patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Shantou University from January to February 2023, comparing culture-based methods with mNGS detection, and assessing its significance in etiological diagnosis. Additionally, we evaluated the performance differences among various sequencing platforms.ResultsAmong the 18 stroke patients enrolled, pulmonary infections were identified in 7 cases, urinary tract infections in 1 case, central nervous system infections in 10 cases, and combined pulmonary and central nervous system infections in 2 cases, with 2 cases yielding negative results. mNGS detected pathogens in 13 cases, aligning with clinical diagnoses (75% concordance), whereas culture-based methods yielded positive results in only 6 cases (22% concordance). Importantly, for 9 of the 18 patients, adjustments to anti-infective treatment regimens based on mNGS results led to improved symptomatic relief and infection control. This suggests that mNGS can contribute to more timely and precise treatment modifications, particularly for infections with low pathogen loads, potentially enhancing clinical outcomes.ConclusionOur findings highlights the utility of mNGS in diagnosing stroke-associated infections by providing a more comprehensive etiological diagnosis compared to traditional method. While mNGS shows promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical treatment, it high cost and technical challenges need addressing before widespread clinical adoption. Future research should focus on optimizing mNGS protocols, integration it with convertional diagnostic tools, and evaluating its cost-effectiveness and clinical impact through larger, multicentric studies.

## Dynamics of coagulation proteins upon ICU admission and after one year of recovery from COVID-19: a preliminary study

date: 2025-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the association of baseline coagulation proteins with hospitalization variables in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, as well as coagulation system changes after one-year post-discharge, taking into account gender-specific bias in the coagulation profile.MethodsWe conducted a prospective longitudinal study on 49 ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients. Proteins were measured using a Luminex 200™. The association between coagulation protein levels and hospitalization variables was carried out by generalized linear models adjusted by the most relevant covariates.ResultsAt ICU admission, lower factor XII, antithrombin, and protein C levels were linked to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or its duration (p=0.028; p=0.047 and p=0.015, respectively). Likewise, lower factor XII, antithrombin, and prothrombin levels were associated with longer ICU length of stay (ICU LOS) (p=0.045; p=0.022; p=0.036, respectively). From baseline to the end of the follow-up, factor XII, antithrombin, prothrombin, and protein C levels notably increased in patients with longer ICU LOS. One-year post-discharge, differences were found for factor IX, aPTT, and INR. Gender-stratified analysis showed sustained alterations in males.ConclusionsDepleted specific coagulation factors on ICU admission are associated with increased severity in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Most coagulation alterations recover one-year post-discharge, except for factor IX, aPTT and INR, which remain reduced.

## Metagenomic next-generation sequencing for the clinical identification of spinal infection-associated pathogens

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology for identifying pathogens associated with spinal infection (SI).MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 193 patients with suspected SI between August 2020 and September 2024. Based on histopathological results, the patients were divided into the SI group (n=162) and the non-SI group (n=31). The diagnostic performance of mNGS technology was compared with that of laboratory examination, imaging examination, and microbial culture.ResultsAmong SI group, mNGS detected 135 pathogens in 77.78% (126/162) of the cases, including nine cases of multiple infections. One or more pathogens were detected using mNGS in 86 patients with SI and negative microbial cultures. Staphylococcus aureus (22.22%, n=30) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (22.22%, n=30) were the major pathogens, while various rare pathogens such as anaerobes, Brucella, and Coxiella burnetii were also detected. For the 40 cases with positive results for both culture- and mNGS-based identification, high consistency (77.50%) was observed. Antibiotic use did not significantly affect the mNGS detection rate (P = 0.45). There was no significant difference in the positivity rate of mNGS between CT-guided needle biopsy (80.00%) and surgical sampling (77.17%) (P = 0.72). The sensitivity of mNGS (77.78%) was significantly higher than that of traditional microbial culture (27.16%), and the specificity was similar (90.32% vs. 96.77%). Although the sensitivities of erythrocyte sedimentation rate-based assay (91.36%), magnetic resonance imaging (88.27%), and C-reactive protein-based assay (87.65%) were better than those of mNGS, their specificities were generally low (20%-40%).ConclusionThe pathogens responsible for SI are complex and diverse. As a novel diagnostic method, mNGS exhibits a high sensitivity and extensive pathogen coverage for SI diagnosis. When combined with imaging and laboratory indicators, mNGS can significantly improve the accuracy of SI diagnosis and provide strong support for clinical treatment.

## The role of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in diagnosing and managing post-kidney transplantation infections

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Kidney transplantation (KT) is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease, but post-transplant infections remain one of the most significant challenges. These infections, caused by a variety of pathogens, can lead to prolonged hospitalization, graft dysfunction, and even mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Traditional diagnostic methods often fail to identify the causative organisms in a timely manner, leading to delays in treatment and poorer patient outcomes. This review explores the application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the diagnosis of post-KT infections. mNGS allows for the rapid, comprehensive detection of a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, without the need for culture-based techniques. We discuss the advantages of mNGS in early and accurate pathogen identification, its role in improving patient management, and the potential challenges in its clinical implementation. Additionally, we consider the future prospects of mNGS in overcoming current diagnostic limitations and its potential for guiding targeted therapies, particularly in detecting antimicrobial resistance and emerging pathogens. This review emphasizes the promise of mNGS as an essential tool in improving the diagnosis and treatment of infections in KT recipients.

## Antibodies directed against bacterial antigens in sera of Polish patients with primary biliary cholangitis

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPrimary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a cholestatic, autoimmune liver disease with the presence of characteristic autoantibodies. The aim of the work was to determine the level of antibodies directed against bacterial antigens: Chlamydia pneumoniae (anti-Cpn), Yersinia enterolitica (anti-Y.e), Helicobacter pylori (anti-Hp), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (anti- Mp.) and Escherichia coli (E.coli) in sera of PBC patients. We also performed in vitro studies on the impact of the bacterial peptides on the specific antigen-antibody binding.MethodWe screened 92 Polish PBC patients and sera samples from healthy donors and pathological controls. Autoantibodies and anti-bacterial antibodies were determined by commercially available ELISA kits. Specific inhibition of antibody binding was also detected by the in house ELISA method.ResultsAnti-Cpn, anti-Y. enterolitica, anti-Hp, anti-M. pneumoniae and anti-E. coli antibodies were significantly more common in the group of PBC patients than in the pathological and healthy control groups: 74%, 40%, 84%, 39% and 69% respectively. The mean level of anti-Cpn, anti- Y.e, anti-Hp and anti- M.p in the PBC group was significantly higher than those in the healthy group (p < 0.001). and in patients with other liver diseases. In sera of patients with the presence of positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), specific for PBC, anti-bacterial antibodies have been found in 80% vs. 50% in sera with AMA negative. We observed inhibition of specific antigen-antibody binding by the bacterial peptide: EClpP (E. coli caseinolytic protease) and adenine glycosylase from E. coli caseinolytic protease P, ClpP Y.e from peptide of Y. enterolitica, Mp PDC from M. pneumonia peptide and adenine glycosylase of E. coli. Bacterial factors influence the specific binding of antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC-E2), gp210 and KLHL12 (kelch-like peptide 12) antigens.ConclusionMicrobial mimics may be the major targets of cross-reactivity with human pyruvate dehydrogenase, gp210, and KLHL12 in PBC.

## Study on the effects of Massa Medicata Fermentata with different formulations on the intestinal microbiota and enzyme activities in mice with spleen deficiency constipation

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the therapeutic mechanism of Massa Medicata Fermentata (MMF) with different formulations on spleen deficiency constipation in mice by analyzing gastrointestinal hormones, D-xylose, intestinal microbiota, and intestinal enzyme activities.MethodsA spleen deficiency constipation model was established using an oral administration of Sennae Folium decoction combined with controlled diet and water intake. After successful model establishment, the mice with spleen deficiency constipation were treated with MMF S1, S2, S3. Following the intervention, serum samples from each group of mice were collected to measure VIP, 5-HT, and D-xylose. Additionally, small intestine contents were analyzed for intestinal enzyme activity and subjected to 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing.ResultsMice with spleen deficiency constipation showed significant decreases in body weight and fecal water content. In contrast, the body weight of the CS2 and CS3 groups returned to normal levels, and fecal water content in the CS2 and CS3 groups also returned to normal. The MMF S2 and S3 significantly increased protease and sucrase enzymes levels compared with CM group. Serum D-xylose levels were significantly reduced in the CM and CS2 group. VIP levels increased significantly in the CM group but decreased in the CS2 and CS3 groups. Additionally, 5-HT levels in the CM and CS1 groups decreased significantly, with the CS2 group returning to normal and the CS3 group showing significant increases. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that all three MMF formulations effectively restored the intestinal microbiota composition in mice. LEfSe analysis identified characteristic microbiota linked to different intervention groups. The CS3 group significantly upregulated the chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation and vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle pathways compared to the CM group. Candidatus_Arthromitus in the CS3 group and Psychrobacter in the CS2 group were positive and negative correlations with 5-HT and VIP, respectively.ConclusionThe three formulations of MMF significantly alleviated spleen deficiency constipation symptoms by modulating intestinal enzyme activities, D-xylose, VIP, and 5-HT levels, and restoring intestinal microbiota balance. Psychrobacter and Candidatus_Arthromitus were identified as potential biomarkers for the treatment of spleen deficiency constipation. Different formulations of MMF have different mechanisms of regulating constipation through intestinal microbiota.

## Rising prevalence and drug resistance of Corynebacterium striatum in lower respiratory tract infections

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Corynebacterium striatum (C. striatum) is a Gram-positive bacterium commonly colonizing the skin and mucosa in healthy individuals and hospitalized patients. Traditionally regarded as a contaminant, C. striatum is now increasingly recognized as a potential cause of clinical infections, especially after the coronavirus disease pandemic. It has emerged as a pathogen implicated in severe infections, including pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, artificial joint infections, abdominal infections, and endocarditis. C. striatum has been reported in lower respiratory tract infections, mostly as a conditioned pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in those with chronic structural lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leading to severe pneumonia or exacerbation of the existing disease and high mortality. Additionally, C striatum has been implicated in the community-acquired pneumonia among immunocompetent individuals and nosocomial lung infections, with evidence of person-to-person transmission through caregivers. C. striatum may exhibit multidrug resistance. Vancomycin, alone or in combination, is currently considered the most effective treatment for C. striatum. This review highlights the epidemiological characteristics, drug resistance mechanisms, diagnostics approaches, and treatment options for C. striatum lower respiratory tract infections to enhance clinician awareness and improve patient management strategies.

## Exploring the mediating role of blood metabolites in the relationship between gut microbiota and gastric cancer risk: a Mendelian randomization study

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPrior studies have established correlations between gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis, circulating metabolite alterations, and gastric cancer (GC) risk. However, the causal nature of these associations remains uncertain.MethodsWe utilized summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on GM (European, n=8,956), blood metabolites (European, n=120,241; East Asian, n=4,435), and GC (European, n=476,116; East Asian, n=167,122) to perform a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, investigating the causal effects of GM and metabolites on GC risk. Additionally, we conducted mediation analysis (two-step MR) to identify potential metabolite mediators in the GM-GC relationship.ResultsWe identified twelve negative and seven positive associations between specific GM taxa and GC risk. For blood metabolites, seven traits were found to be significantly associated with reduced GC risk in the European population, with these findings subsequently validated in the East Asian cohort. Three GM taxa showed potential causal associations with five metabolic traits: the Bacteroidia class and Bacteroidales order were positively correlated with five metabolites (all P < 0.013), while Bacteroides OTU97_27 exhibited a negative correlation with one metabolite (P = 0.007). Two-step MR analysis indicated that total lipids in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), IDL particle concentration, phospholipids in medium low-density lipoprotein (LDL), phospholipids in small LDL, and free cholesterol in small LDL indirectly influenced the association between Bacteroidia class/Bacteroidales order and GC, with mediation proportions of 1.71% (P = 0.048), 1.69% (P = 0.048), 2.05% (P = 0.045), 1.85% (P = 0.048), and 1.99% (P = 0.045), respectively.ConclusionThe present study provides suggestive evidence of a causal relationship between specific GM, blood metabolites, and GC risk, potentially offering new insights into GC etiology.

## Identifying subgroup of severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical metagenomics, a multicenter retrospective cohort study

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveSevere community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) is one of the major diseases within the ICU. We hypothesize that subtyping sCAP based on simple inflammatory markers, organ dysfunction, and clinical metagenomics results is feasible.MethodIn this study, we retrospectively enrolled immunocompetent sCAP patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, who underwent clinical metagenomics from 17 medical centers. We collected data on potentially pathogenic species reported by clinical metagenomics and clinical information for all patients. Latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to routine clinical parameters such as gender, age, white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Procalcitonin (PCT), identifying two optimally fitting models.ResultsA total of 569 patients were enrolled. Compared to class B, class A was characterized by a younger age, higher CRP and PCT levels, and a higher incidence of coagulation dysfunction, liver failure, circulatory failure, and renal failure. However, the mortality rates were similar between the two groups. In class A, more cases of Streptococcus spp. and fewer cases of HSV-1 and Candida spp. were detected. Among the patients in the two phenotypes, 48.7% and 57.5% received corticosteroid treatment, respectively. In the class A, corticosteroid treatment was not associated with patient mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.988; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.634–1.541; p=0.959). In contrast, in the class B group, the use of corticosteroids was associated with a reduced mortality rate (adjusted HR=0.719; 95% CI, 0.525–0.986; p=0.04). Additional analysis showed that in class B, methylprednisolone was associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.44–0.86; p=0.005), while dexamethasone was not associated with mortality (adjusted HR=1.4; 95% CI, 0.89–2.22; p=0.148). In addition, after dose conversion, the results showed that higher doses of corticosteroids in class B were associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR=1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01; p=0.005).ConclusionWe identified two classes based on clinical metagenomics and clinical features. Class B exhibited a better response to corticosteroid compared to class A. The rapid identification of these phenotypes could facilitate the screening of sCAP patients responsive to corticosteroid in future prospective clinical trials.

## Diagnostic value of third-generation nanopore sequencing in extrapulmonary tuberculosis

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aimed to explore the accuracy of third-generation nanopore sequencing to diagnose extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB).MethodsSamples were collected from the lesions of 67 patients with suspected EPTB admitted between April 2022 and August 2023. Nanopore sequencing, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining, DNA testing, and X-pert and mycobacterial cultures were performed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for different diagnostic methods, and their diagnostic accuracies were compared.ResultsNanopore sequencing demonstrated the highest correct diagnosis rate among 50 positive EPTB cases, independently diagnosing 19 positive cases missed by conventional methods. Its sensitivity (62.00%), specificity (94.10%), PPV (96.90%), NPV (45.70%) and AUC (0.781, 95% CI: 0.67–0.89) were superior to those of conventional methods, such as AFB staining, DNA testing, X-pert, and solid culture, indicating its significantly efficient advantage in EPTB detection.ConclusionNanopore sequencing technology significantly outperforms conventional methods such as AFB staining, DNA testing, X-pert, and mycobacterial culture to diagnose EPTB, promising to improve the diagnosis of EPTB.

## Plasma Epstein-Barr Virus DNA load for diagnostic and prognostic assessment in intestinal Epstein-Barr Virus infection

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe prospective application of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load as a noninvasive measure of intestinal EBV infection remains unexplored. This study aims to identify ideal threshold levels for plasma EBV DNA loads in the diagnosis and outcome prediction of intestinal EBV infection, particularly in cases of primary intestinal lymphoproliferative diseases and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).MethodsReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were examined to determine suitable thresholds for plasma EBV DNA load in diagnosing intestinal EBV infection and predicting its prognosis.Results108 patients were retrospectively assigned to the test group, while 56 patients were included in the validation group. Plasma EBV DNA loads were significantly higher in the intestinal EBV infection group compared to the non-intestinal EBV infection group (Median: 2.02 × 102 copies/mL, interquartile range [IQR]: 5.49 × 101-6.34×103 copies/mL versus 4.2×101 copies/mL, IQR: 1.07 ×101-6.08×101 copies/mL; P < 0.0001). Plasma EBV DNA levels at 9.21×101 and 6.77×101 copies/mL proved beneficial for the identification and prognostication in intestinal EBV infection, respectively. Values of 0.82 and 0.71 were yielded by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the test cohort, corresponding to sensitivities of 84.38% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 68.25%-93.14%) and 87.5% (95%CI: 69%-95.66%), specificities of 83.33% (95%CI: 64.15%-93.32%) and 68.09% (95%CI: 53.83%-79.6%), positive predictive values (PPV) of 87.1% (95%CI: 71.15%-94.87%) and 58.33% (95%CI: 42.2%-72.86%), and positive likelihood ratios (LR+) of 5.06 and 2.74 in the validation cohort, respectively. Furthermore, a plasma EBV DNA load of 5.4×102 copies/mL helped differentiate IBD with intestinal EBV infection from primary intestinal EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders (PIEBV+LPDs), achieving an AUC of 0.85 within the test cohort, as well as 85% sensitivity (95%CI: 63.96%-94.76%), 91.67% specificity (95%CI: 64.61%-99.57%), 94.44% PPV (95%CI: 74.24%-99.72%), and an LR+ of 10.2 in the validation cohort.ConclusionsPlasma EBV DNA load demonstrates notable potential in distinguishing between different patient cohorts with intestinal EBV infection, although its sensitivity requires further optimization for clinical application.

## Clinical features and risk factors of HIV-infected patients with intracerebral hemorrhage: a retrospective study with propensity score matching analysis

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeTo investigate the clinical features and risk factors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).Patients and methodsThe patients with HIV-infected without ICH group were matched to the group of HIV-infected ICH patients. Logistic regression analysis using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to investigate the independent risk factors for ICH in HIV-infected patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was configured to calculate the optimal predictors of ICH in HIV-infected patients.ResultsA total of 59 HIV-infected patients with ICH and 180 HIV-infected patients without ICH were included. A cohort of 118 patients was ascertained utilizing PSM. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that drug abuse-related HIV-infected, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and elevated triglyceride (TG) levels were independent risk factors of ICH in HIV-infected patients. The ROC curve demonstrated that the combined predictor, composed of drug abuse-related HIV-infected, prolonged PT, and elevated TG levels, exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC), with a cut-off point at 0.426, sensitivity of 78%, and specificity of 81.4%.ConclusionThe present study revealed that a valuable factor combined with drug abuse-related HIV-infected, prolonged PT, and elevated serum TG levels could serve as predictors of ICH in HIV-infected patients.

## Effects of fermented Artemisia annua on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites of Hu lambs with naturally infected with Eimeria spp.

date: 2025-01-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSheep coccidiosis could disturb the balance of intestinal microbiota, causing diarrhea, and even death in lambs. Chemical drugs are the primary method of treating sheep coccidiosis, but their use will bring drug resistance, toxic side effects, drug residues, and other problems. Chinese herbal medicines are investigated as alternative methods for controlling coccidian infections.MethodsIn this study, the effect of fermented Artemisia annua (FA) on oocysts per gram (OPG), average daily gain (ADG), and expression of inflammatory factors were investigated in lambs that were naturally infected with coccidia.ResultsThe results showed that the FA had similar anti-coccidiosis effect to the original drug, while the FA demonstrated a more significant effect on weight gain, and a better ability to reduce the inflammatory response compared to the unfermented drug during the treatment period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, High-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the effects of FA on intestinal microbiota, and fecal metabolites of naturally infected lambs. The species richness of intestinal microbiota of lambs was significantly improved by FA. The abundance of bacteria unclassified_Muribaculaceae, and UCG_005 were increased by fermentation of A. annua. The abundance of bacteria Escherichia_Shigella, unclassified_Clostridia_UCG_014, and Alistipes was reduced. The prevention, and treatment of coccidiosis by fermentation of A. annua may also be related to a series of metabolites affected by intestinal microbiota, including artemisinin, Lysyl-Proline, and TRP-tyrosine.ConclusionFA was found to have superior anti-coccidiosis, anti-inflammatory, and weight gain effects compared to the original Artemisia annua. Intestinal microbes and metabolites such as unclassified_Muribaculaceae, UCG-005, and Artemisinin were identified, suggesting their potential significance. Alistipes was proposed as a biomarker for predicting intestinal coccidia outbreak risk in lambs, pending further validation. The correlation between microbiota, and metabolites may provide new insights into pathogenic changes associated with Eimeria spp.

## Human milk oligosaccharides: bridging the gap in intestinal microbiota between mothers and infants

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Breast milk is an essential source of infant nutrition. It is also a vital determinant of the structure and function of the infant intestinal microbial community, and it connects the mother and infant intestinal microbiota. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a critical component in breast milk. HMOs can reach the baby’s colon entirely from milk and become a fermentable substrate for some intestinal microorganisms. HMOs can enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function and affect the intestinal function of the host through immune function, which has a therapeutic effect on specific infant intestinal diseases, such as necrotizing enterocolitis. In addition, changes in infant intestinal microbiota can reflect the maternal intestinal microbiota. HMOs are a link between the maternal intestinal microbiota and infant intestinal microbiota. HMOs affect the intestinal microbiota of infants and are related to the maternal milk microbiota. Through breastfeeding, maternal microbiota and HMOs jointly affect infant intestinal bacteria. Therefore, HMOs positively influence the establishment and balance of the infant microbial community, which is vital to ensure infant intestinal function. Therefore, HMOs can be used as a supplement and alternative therapy for infant intestinal diseases.

## Plasmodium falciparum transcription factor AP2-06B is mutated at high frequency in Southeast Asia but does not associate with drug resistance

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionA continuing challenge for malaria control is the ability of Plasmodium falciparum to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs. Members within the Plasmodium transcription factor family AP2 regulate the growth and development of the parasite, and are also thought to be involved in unclear aspects of drug resistance. Here we screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the AP2 family and identified 6 non-synonymous mutations within AP2-06B (PF3D7_0613800), with allele frequencies greater than 0.05. One mutation, K3124R, was located in a PfAP2-06B AP2 domain.MethodsTo investigate transcriptional regulation by PfAP2-06B, ChIP-seq assays were performed on 3D7/PfAP2-06B-GFP schizonts using antibodies against GFP. The DNA sequences of the artemisinin-resistant CWX and the quinoline-resistant strains PfDd2 and Pf7G8 were analyzed for the genetic diversity of AP2-06B, compared with the Pf3D7 strain as a reference sequence. To determine whether AP2-06B can alter the expression of pfk13 and pfcrt, as well as cause artemisinin and quinoline resistance in Plasmodium, we generated both a K3124R mutation and conditional knockdown of AP2-06B in Pf3D7 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.ResultsChIP-Seq analysis showed that AP2-06B can bind to the loci of the Plasmodium genes pfk13 and pfcrt. The AP2-06B K3124R mutation was also found in the artemisinin-resistant parasite strain CWX and the chloroquine-resistant strains Dd2 and 7G8. Contrary to expectation, Pf3D7 Plasmodium lines modified by either K3124R mutation of AP2-06B or conditional knockdown of AP2-06B did not have altered sensitivity to artemisinin or quinolines by modulating pfk13 or pfcrt expression.DiscussionAP2-06B was predicted to be associated with artemisinin and quinoline resistance, but no change in resistance was observed after mutation or conditional knockdown. Given the multigenic nature of resistance, it might be difficult to recreate a resistance phenotype. In conclusion, whether AP2-06B regulates the development of artemisinin or quinoline resistance remains to be studied.

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has intensified the search for novel antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to isolate Streptomyces kanamyceticus from local soil samples and evaluate its antimicrobial properties, along with optimizing the production of bioactive compounds.MethodsSoil samples were collected from local regions, processed, and analysed for Streptomyces strains isolation using morphological characteristics and molecular identification through 16S rRNA gene PCR assay. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans using the double-layer method, while Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were determined. The extracted compounds underwent Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for functional group identification. Optimization of bioactive compound production was performed using a Central Composite Design (CCD) coupled with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR).ResultsA total of 25 distinct Streptomyces strains were isolated, with seven confirmed as S. kanamyceticus. These strains exhibited antimicrobial activity, with inhibition zones reaching 30 mm and MIC values between 20 and 70 µg/mL. The extraction yielded 150-200 mL of bioactive compounds. Optimization studies revealed that a medium containing 10 g/L glucose and 10 g/L glycine max meal maximized antibiotic production.ConclusionThis study confirmed that S. kanamyceticus is a promising source of novel antibiotics. The combination of microbial isolation, antimicrobial testing, and statistical optimization successfully enhanced the production of bioactive compounds, contributing to the search for effective antimicrobial agents against resistant pathogens.

## Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide - new insights into gut microbiota and male infertility through meta-analysis

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAmmonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are produced during digestion in the human gut, yet the impact of these internally generated gases on male reproduction have received limited attention in scientific research.MethodsWe systematically reviewed 935 scientific publications, spanning from 1947 to 2023, focusing on external or internal NH3 and/or H2S, male infertility, and gut microbiota. Meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of combined studies.ResultsOur findings revealed that the internal NH3 and/or H2S were negatively related to the Lactobacillus, which is beneficial to male fertility, whereas NH3 and H2S were positively related to Bacteroides, which showed negative effects on male fertility. The meta-analysis comparing Lactobacillus and Bacteroides levels with NH3 showed statistically significant results (p<0.001).ConclusionsThe meta-analysis is the first to confirm these facts and explored the potential existence of a gut microbiota-inner gases-male fertility axis in the human gut.

## Increased rate of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections in hospitalized immunocompromised pediatric patients

date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMultidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are considered a major public health threat. Immunocompromised pediatric patients are at a great risk of severe or overwhelming infections. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of infections with multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in immunocompromised pediatric patients and to determine the risk factors. In addition, we aimed to identify the antimicrobial resistance patterns of these isolates.Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective observational study conducted at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) from 2009 to 2017. The study included immunocompromised patients 18 years of age or younger with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria isolated from a sterile site, or nonsterile site in the setting of clinical infection.ResultsA total of 381 episodes of infection with GNB in 242 immunocompromised pediatric patients were identified. The mean age was 7.7 years. The most common pathogens were Enterobacterales followed by Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. MDR GNB infections predominated causing 72% of the episodes, with alarming MDR rates among Escherichia coli (95.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (82.7%). The overall rate of MDR GNB isolated increased from 62.7% in 2015 to 90% in 2017. Thrombocytopenia, chemotherapy and previous colonization or infection with the same organism during the past 12 months were found to be independent risk factors for infection with MDR GNB.ConclusionThis study provides data on the epidemiology of infections with MDR GNB in immunocompromised pediatric patients and illustrates the alarmingly high prevalence of these infections. This necessitates the frequent revisiting of treatment guidelines in these high-risk patients and the implementation of judicious antimicrobial stewardship programs and infection control policies to stabilize or decrease the prevalence of these infections.
