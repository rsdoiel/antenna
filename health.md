## Gut microbiota and its metabolites in non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastasis: from alteration to potential microbial markers and drug targets

date: 2024-01-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>The elevated mortality rate associated with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a well-established global concern. Considerable attention has been directed toward exploring the association between gut microbiota and various malignant tumors. We herein investigated the associations between the intestinal microbiome and its metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in patients with NSCLC at different stages, including early and brain metastasis (BM) stages. The findings aim to offer a fresh perspective on the diagnosis and management of NSCLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fecal samples were collected from 115 participants, comprising healthy controls (n = 35) and patients with treatment-naive NSCLC at the early stage (ELC, n = 40) and the BM stage (n = 40). Characterization of the intestinal microbiome and fecal SCFA levels was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The microbial diversity in patients with NSCLC was found to be less abundant and uniform, particularly in the BM stage. Significant alterations in the community structure of the gut microbiota were observed in patients with NSCLC, with an increase in pathogens in Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria and a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, particularly in the BM stage. Meanwhile, microbial communities displayed intricate associations in patients with NSCLC. A biomarker panel (<italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Butyricicoccus</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Blautia</italic>) successfully distinguished patients in the ELC and BM stages from healthy controls (area under the curve: 0.884). The overall concentration of fecal SCFAs was significantly lower in patients with BM compared to patients with ELC and healthy controls. Subgroup analysis of acetate and butyrate yielded similar results. Moreover, multiple disrupted pathways in the NSCLC group were identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation, including lipid metabolism and genetic information processing, specifically in the BM stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with healthy controls, distinct host-microbe interactions were evident in different phases of patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, specific forms of the gut microbiome and SCFAs may serve as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC.</p></sec>

## Characterization of viral infections in children with influenza-like-illness during December 2018–January 2019

date: 2024-01-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Respiratory viral infection (RVI) is of very concern after the outbreak of COVID-19, especially in pediatric departments. Learning pathogen spectrum of RVI in children previous the epidemic of COVID-19 could provide another perspective for understanding RVI under current situation and help to prepare for the post COVID-19 infection control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay, with 19 pairs of primers targeting various respiratory viruses, was used for multi-pathogen screening of viral infections in children presenting influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Children with ILI at the outpatient department of Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital during the influenza epidemic from 12/2018 to 01/2019 were included. Throat swabs were obtained for both the influenza rapid diagnostic test (IRDT) based on the colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay and the NASBA assay, targeting various respiratory viruses with an integrated chip technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Of 519 patients, 430 (82.9%) were positive in the NASBA assay. The predominant viral pathogens were influenza A H1N1 pdm1/2009 (pH1N1) (48.4%) and influenza A (H3N2) (18.1%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (8.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (6.1%). Of the 320 cases identified with influenza A by NASBA, only 128 (40.0%) were positive in the IRDT. The IRDT missed pH1N1 significantly more frequently than A (H3N2) (P&lt;0.01). Influenza A pH1N1 and A (H3N2) were the major pathogens in &lt;6 years and 6-15 years old individuals respectively (P&lt;0.05). In summary, influenza viruses were the major pathogens in children with ILI during the 2018-2019 winter influenza epidemic, while hMPV and RSV were non-negligible. The coexistence of multiple pathogen leading to respiratory infections is the normalcy in winter ILI cases.</p></sec>

## Resistance against two lytic phage variants attenuates virulence and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Bacteriophage therapy is becoming part of mainstream Western medicine since antibiotics of clinical use tend to fail. It involves applying lytic bacteriophages that self-replicate and induce cell lysis, thus killing their hosts. Nevertheless, bacterial killing promotes the selection of resistant clones which sometimes may exhibit a decrease in bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this work, we studied the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> lytic phage φDCL-PA6 and its variant φDCL-PA6α. Additionally, we characterized and evaluated the production of virulence factors and the virulence in a Galleria mellonella model of resistant mutants against each phage for PA14 and two clinical strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Phage φDCL-PA6α differs from the original by only two amino acids: one in the baseplate wedge subunit and another in the tail fiber protein. According to genomic data and cross-resistance experiments, these changes may promote the change of the phage receptor from the O-antigen to the core lipopolysaccharide. Interestingly, the host range of the two phages differs as determined against the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> reference strains PA14 and PAO1 and against nine multidrug-resistant isolates from ventilator associated pneumonia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show as well that phage resistance impacts virulence factor production. Specifically, phage resistance led to decreased biofilm formation, swarming, and type III secretion; therefore, the virulence towards Galleria mellonella was dramatically attenuated. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance decreased for one clinical strain. Our study highlights important potential advantages of phage therapy’s evolutionary impact that may be exploited to generate robust therapy schemes.</p></sec>

## Microbiota signatures associated with invasive Candida albicans infection in the gastrointestinal tract of immunodeficient mice

date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a commensal microorganism in the human gut but occasionally causes invasive <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection (ICA), especially in immunocompromised individuals. Early initiation of antifungal therapy is associated with reduced mortality of ICA, but rapid diagnosis remains a challenge. The ICA-associated changes in the gut microbiota can be used as diagnostic and therapeutic targets but have been poorly investigated. In this study, we utilized an immunodeficient Rag2γc (<italic>Rag2</italic>-/-<italic>il2γc</italic>-/-) mouse model to investigate the gut microbiota alterations caused by <italic>C. albicans</italic> throughout its cycle, from its introduction into the gastrointestinal tract to invasion, in the absence of antibiotics. We observed a significant increase in the abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, particularly <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, as well as a significant decrease in the abundance of <italic>Candidatus Arthromitus</italic> in mice exposed to either the wild-type SC5314 strain or the filamentation-defective mutant (<italic>cph1/cph1 efg1/efg1</italic>) HLC54 strain of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. However, only the SC5314-infected mice developed ICA. A linear discriminate analysis of the temporal changes in the gut bacterial composition revealed <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> as a discriminative biomarker associated with SC5314-infected mice with ICA. Additionally, a positive correlation between the <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> abundance and fungal load was found, and the negative correlation between the <italic>Candidatus Arthromitus</italic> abundance and fungal load after exposure to <italic>C. albicans</italic> suggested that <italic>C. albicans</italic> might affect the differentiation of intestinal Th17 cells. Our findings reveal the influence of pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> on the gut microbiota and identify the abundance of <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> as a microbiota signature associated with ICA in an immunodeficient mouse model.</p>

## Pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial community changes in dental unit waterlines after chlorogenic acid treatment

date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The contamination of dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) poses a significant risk of cross-infection in dentistry. Although chemical disinfectants have been effective in reducing number of bacteria, they do have limitations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study aimed to investigate the potential of chlorogenic acid, a natural substance with broadspectrum antibacterial properties, for treating DUWLs. Over a period of three months, we analyzed the microbial communities in 149 DUWLs samples collected from 5 dental units using high-throughput pyrophosphate sequencing. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results revealed that chlorogenic acid treatment had a significant impact on the microbial community profile in the DUWLs, with the most significant changes occurring within the first 15 days and stabilization observed in the last 30 days. The predominant genera detected in the samples were Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Methylobacterium, and Phreatobacter. Additionally, the relative abundance of certain beneficial bacteria, such as Alloprevotella, Roseburia, and Blautia, increased, while the presence of opportunistic pathogens like Mycobacteria significantly decreased. The functional prediction analysis using the KEGG database indicated a decrease in the pathogenicity of the bacterial community in the DUWLs following chlorogenic acid treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study introduces a novel approach for the prevention and treatment of infections associated with dental care.</p></sec>

## In vitro interactions of proton pump inhibitors and azoles against pathogenic fungi

date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Azole resistance has been increasingly reported and become an issue for clinical managements of invasive mycoses. New strategy with combination therapy arises as a valuable and promising alternative option. The aim of the present study is to investigate the <italic>in vitro</italic> combinational effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and azoles against pathogenic fungi.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> interactions of PPIs including omeprazole (OME), lansoprazole (LAN), pantoprazole (PAN), and rabeprazole (RAB), and commonly used azoles including itraconazole (ITC), posaconazole (POS), voriconazole (VRC) and fluconazole (FLC), were investigated via broth microdilution chequerboard procedure adapted from the CLSI M27-A3 and M38-A2. A total of 67 clinically isolated strains, namely 27 strains of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 16 strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp., and 24 strains of dematiaceous fungi, were studied. <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (ATCC 22019) and <italic>A. flavus</italic> (ATCC 204304) was included to ensure quality control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PPIs individually did not exert any significant antifungal activity. The combination of OME with ITC, POS, or VRC showed synergism against 77.6%, 86.6%, and 4% strains of tested pathogenic fungi, respectively, while synergism of OME/FLC was observed in 50% strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergism between PAN and ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 47.8%, 77.6% and 1.5% strains of tested fungi, respectively, while synergism of PNA/FLC was observed in 50% strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergism of LAN with ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 86.6%, 86.6%, and 3% of tested strains, respectively, while synergism of LAN/FLC was observed in 31.3% strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergy of the combination of RAB with ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 25.4%, 64.2%, and 4.5% of tested strains, respectively, while synergism of RAB/FLC was observed in 12.5% of <italic>Candida</italic> spp.. Among PPIs, synergism was least observed between RAB and triazoles, while among triazoles, synergism was least observed between VRC and PPIs. Among species, synergy was much more frequently observed in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and dematiaceous fungi as compared to <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Antagonism between PPIs with ITC or VRC was occasionally observed in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and dematiaceous fungi. It is notable that PPIs combined with azoles showed synergy against azole resistant <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, and resulted in category change of susceptibility of ITC and POS against <italic>Candida</italic> spp.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results suggested that PPIs combined with azoles has the potential to enhance the susceptibilities of azoles against multiple pathogenic fungi and could be a promising strategy to overcome azole resistance issues. However, further investigations are warranted to study the combinational efficacy in more isolates and more species, to investigate the underlying mechanism of interaction and to evaluate the potential for concomitant use of these agents in human.</p></sec>

## A review of neuro-ophthalmic sequelae following COVID-19 infection and vaccination

date: 2024-01-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>It has become increasingly clear that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can affect most organs in the human body, including the neurologic and ophthalmic systems. Vaccination campaigns have been developed at rapid pace around the world to protect the population from the fast-mutating virus. This review seeks to summarise current knowledge of the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of both COVID-19 infection and vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence acquisition</title><p>Electronic searches for published literature were conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE on the 30<sup>th</sup> of July 2023. The search strategy comprised of controlled vocabulary and free-text synonyms for the following terms in various combinations: “coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, vaccination, vaccine, immunisation and neuro-ophthalmology”. No time range limits were set for the literature search. Published English abstracts for articles written in a different language were screened if available.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 54 case reports and case series were selected for use in the final report. 34 articles documenting neuro-ophthalmic manifestations following COVID-19 infection and 20 articles with neuro-ophthalmic complications following COVID-19 vaccination were included, comprising of 79 patients in total. The most commonly occurring condition was optic neuritis, with 25 cases following COVID-19 infection and 27 cases following vaccination against COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The various COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available are part of the global effort to protect the most vulnerable of the human population. The incidence of neuro-ophthalmic consequences following infection with COVID-19 is hundred-folds higher and associated with more harrowing systemic effects than vaccination against the virus.</p></sec>

## Altering the interfacial rheology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with N-acetyl cysteine and cysteamine

date: 2024-01-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic lung infection due to bacterial biofilms is one of the leading causes of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Among many species colonizing the lung airways, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are two virulent pathogens involved in mechanically robust biofilms that are difficult to eradicate using airway clearance techniques like lung lavage. To remove such biological materials, glycoside hydrolase-based compounds are commonly employed for targeting and breaking down the biofilm matrix, and subsequently increasing cell susceptibility to antibiotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this study, we evaluate the effects of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and Cysteamine (CYST) in disrupting interfacial bacterial films, targeting different components of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). We characterize the mechanics and structural integrity of the interfacial bacterial films using pendant drop elastometry and scanning electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Our results show that the film architectures are compromised by treatment with disrupting agents for 6 h, which reduces film elasticity significantly. These effects are profound in the wild type and mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, compared to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We further assess the effects of competition and cooperation between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on the mechanics of composite interfacial films. Films of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cocultures lose mechanical strength while those of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exhibit improved storage modulus. Treatment with NAC and CYST reduces the elastic property of both composite films, owing to the drugs’ ability to disintegrate their EPS matrix. Overall, our results provide new insights into methods for assessing the efficacy of mucolytic agents against interfacial biofilms relevant to cystic fibrosis infection.</p></sec>

## Clinical cure induced by pegylated interferon α-2b in the advantaged population of chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2024-01-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Among the advantaged population with clinical cure of chronic hepatitis B, chronic inactive hepatitis B virus carriers (IHCs) and nucleoside analog-experienced patients have similar serological manifestations. This study established non-interferon-treated groups as controls to compare the efficacy of pegylated interferon α-2b (Peg-IFNα-2b) in achieving clinical cure between IHCs and nucleoside analog (NA)-experienced patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>A total of 270 patients were enrolled in this observational study. The IHC cohort comprised 55 patients who received Peg-IFNα-2b (Peg-IFN group), and the other 70 patients did not receive any antiviral treatment (untreated group). Patients treated with NAs were divided into two groups: one group (70 patients) receiving NA add-on Peg-IFNα-2b therapy regimen (NA add-on Peg-IFN group) and another group (75 patients) receiving continuous NA monotherapy (NA group). The primary endpoints were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance and HBsAg seroconversion at 48 weeks and 72 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 48 weeks, 65.5% (36/55) and 52.9% (37/70) patients achieved HBsAg clearance in the Peg-IFN group and NA add-on Peg-IFN group, respectively (p = 0.156). HBsAg seroconversion was achieved in 47.3% (26/55) of the Peg-IFN group and 34.3% (24/70) of the NA add-on Peg-IFN group (p = 0.141). At the follow-up of 72 weeks, 36 patients in the Peg-IFN group achieved HBsAg loss (65.5%, 36/55), and 33 patients in the NA add-on Peg-IFN group achieved HBsAg clearance (47.1%, 33/70), which were significantly higher than in the Peg-IFN group (p = 0.041). The HBsAg seroconversion rates in the Peg-IFN group and NA add-on Peg-IFN group at 72 weeks were 45.5% (25/55) and 32.9% (23/70), respectively (p = 0.151). No patient achieved HBsAg clearance or seroconversion in the NA group and untreated group. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve showed baseline HBsAg&lt; 72 IU/mL, and the decline of HBsAg of more than 80% and 98% from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks provided good predictions for HBsAg clearance. Meanwhile, 77% of patients with baseline HBsAg&lt; 100 IU/mL achieved a clinical cure at 48 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Peg-IFNα-2b results in a high rate of HBsAg clearance and seroconversion in both IHCs and NA-experienced patients, especially for those patients who have HBsAg below 100 IU/mL.</p></sec>

## Longitudinal dynamics of gut bacteriome and mycobiome interactions pre- and post-visceral surgery in Crohn’s disease

date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Alterations of the gut microbiome are involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD). The role of fungi in this context is unclear. This study aimed to determine postoperative changes in the bacterial and fungal gut communities of CD patients undergoing intestinal resection, and to evaluate interactions between the bacteriome and mycobiome and their impact on the patients’ outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We report a subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort study, focusing on 10 CD patients whose fecal samples were collected for bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 genes next-generation sequencing the day before surgery and on the 5th or 6th postoperative day.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No significant differences in bacterial and fungal diversity were observed between preoperative and postoperative stool samples. By in-depth analysis, significant postoperative abundance changes of bacteria and fungi and 17 interkingdom correlations were detected. Network analysis identified 13 microbial clusters in the perioperative gut communities, revealing symbiotic and competitive interactions. Relevant factors were gender, age, BMI, lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption) and surgical technique. Postoperative abundance changes and identified clusters were associated with clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, complications) and levels of inflammatory markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings highlight the importance of dissecting the interactions of gut bacterial and fungal communities in CD patients and their potential influence on postoperative and disease outcomes.</p></sec>

## A case report of diagnosis of cat-scratch disease using metagenomic next-generation sequencing

date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is an anthropozoonotic infection caused by <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic>, and it is one of the most common causes of lymph node infections in children and adolescents. <italic>B. henselae</italic>, belonging to the genus <italic>Bartonella</italic>, is a common human pathogen of human beings. CSD commonly develops as a result of cat scratches and bites or when injured skin comes into contact with cat saliva. The manifestation of CSD clinically differs for each patient based on their immune system. Individuals who have healthy immune systems generally manifest minimal clinical symptoms and do not necessitate any form of treatment. However, patients who have hypo-immunity require prompt medical attention due to the potential manifestation of severe symptoms that affect multiple systems of the body. Long latency and atypical clinical manifestations are characteristics of CSD. <italic>Bartonella</italic> isolation and identification are challenging procedures that require specialized equipment. There is no gold standard method for CSD diagnosis, and misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates are typically high. We present the case of a middle-aged male patient who developed fever, chills, anal distension, dizziness, and muscle pain for 10 days. The patient had a documented history of cat bites 1 month prior to the onset of symptoms. Following admission, he underwent an examination to determine superficial lymphadenopathy and hypoimmunity. Additionally, he had a fever during the disease. As the patient refused a needle biopsy of lymph nodes, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was employed and <italic>B. henselae</italic> was detected in the peripheral blood. The patient was diagnosed with CSD and treated with a combination of azithromycin and doxycycline. The fever symptoms were alleviated, and the patient was ultimately discharged. As a result of this case, we suggest that mNGS be used as a crucial supplementary diagnostic tool for individuals with compromised immune systems who may have CSD, especially when conventional diagnostic methods are inconclusive.</p>

## A novel mass cytometry protocol optimized for immunophenotyping of low-frequency antigen-specific T cells

date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Understanding antigen-specific T-cell responses, for example, following virus infections or allergen exposure, is of high relevance for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We aimed on optimizing immunophenotyping of T cells after antigen stimulation by improving staining procedures for flow and mass cytometry. Our method can be used for primary cells of both mouse and human origin for the detection of low-frequency T-cell response using a dual-barcoding system for individual samples and conditions. First, live-cell barcoding was performed using anti-CD45 antibodies prior to an <italic>in vitro</italic> T-cell stimulation assay. Second, to discriminate between stimulation conditions and prevent cell loss, sample barcoding was combined with a commercial barcoding solution. This dual-barcoding approach is cell sparing and, therefore, particularly relevant for samples with low cell numbers. To further reduce cell loss and to increase debarcoding efficiency of multiplexed samples, we combined our dual-barcoding approach with a new centrifugation-free washing system by laminar flow (Curiox™). Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of our established protocol, we assayed virus-specific T-cell response in SARS-CoV-2–vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2–infected patients and compared with healthy non-exposed individuals by a high-parameter CyTOF analysis. We could reveal a heterogeneity of phenotypes among responding CD4, CD8, and gd-T cells following antigen-specific stimulations. Our protocol allows to assay antigen-specific responses of minute populations of T cells to virus-derived peptides, allergens, or other antigens from the same donor sample, in order to investigate qualitative and quantitative differences.</p>

## Effect of palladium(II) complexes on NorA efflux pump inhibition and resensitization of fluoroquinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: in vitro and in silico approach

date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> leads to diverse infections, and their treatment relies on the use of antibiotics. Nevertheless, the rise of antibiotic resistance poses an escalating challenge and various mechanisms contribute to antibiotic resistance, including modifications to drug targets, enzymatic deactivation of drugs, and increased efflux of antibiotics. Hence, the quest for innovative antimicrobial solutions has intensified in the face of escalating antibiotic resistance and the looming threat of superbugs. The NorA protein of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, classified as an efflux pump within the major facilitator superfamily, when overexpressed, extrudes various substances, including fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) and quaternary ammonium. Addressing this, the unexplored realm of inorganic and organometallic compounds in medicinal chemistry holds promise. Notably, the study focused on investigating two different series of palladium-based metal complexes consisting of QSL_P<sup>A</sup> and QSL_P<sup>B</sup> ligands to identify a potent NorA efflux pump inhibitor that can restore the susceptibility to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> was identified as a potent efflux pump inhibitor from the real-time efflux assay. QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> also resensitized SA1199B to ciprofloxacin at a low concentration of 0.125 µg/mL without elucidating cytotoxicity on the NRK-62E cell line. The <italic>in vitro</italic> findings were substantiated by docking results, indicating favorable interactions between QSL_Pd<sup>5A</sup> and the NorA efflux pump.</p>

## Dynamic changes in the migratory microbial components of colon tissue during different periods of sepsis in an LPS-induced rat model

date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Previous studies have shown that bacterial translocation may play an important role in worsening gastrointestinal injury during sepsis. However, the dynamics of specific microbiota components in intestinal tissues at different sepsis stages remain unclear. Rats receiving intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were sacrificed at 12 h and 48 h post-injection. Routine blood, serum cytokines, and microbiota in colon tissue, colonic contents, and lung tissue at different time points were assessed. Migratory microbial components in colonic tissue at 12 h and 48 h post-LPS were identified using source tracking, characteristic component identification, and abundance difference analyses. Colonic tissue microbiota changed dynamically over time after LPS injection, involving translocation of microbial components from colon contents and lung tissue at different time points. Bacteria migrating to colon tissue at 12 h sepsis were mainly from colonic contents, while those at 48 h were predominantly from the lung tissue. The migratory microbial components in colon tissue were widely associated with blood indicators and colonizing genus abundance and microbiota functionality in colon tissue. In this study, the temporal dynamics of bacterial translocation from various sources into colon tissues at different sepsis progression stages were characterized for the first time, and the species composition of these migrating microbes was delineated. These bacterial migrants may contribute to the pathophysiological processes in sepsis through direct interactions or indirectly by modulating colonic microbiota community structure and function.</p>

## Obesity-related asthma and its relationship with microbiota

date: 2024-01-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>Obesity and asthma are global public health problems. Obesity-related asthma is a special phenotype of asthma with a complex pathogenesis. Its occurrence and development are related to mechanical compression, inflammatory response, metabolic regulation, gene regulation, and vitamin D deficiency. Different treatment strategies used in the process of weight loss have a beneficial impact on asthma. Alterations in gut and airway microbial community structure and their metabolites may also contribute to obesity-related asthma. The role of the Th17/Treg balance in the gut microbiota regulating the immune responses and host metabolism is important. Therapeutic measures associated with the gut microbiota variety may contribute to improving chronic inflammation associated with obesity by regulating the Th17/Treg balance. An early reduction in microbial diversity can predict the development of asthma and lead to allergy through an imbalance of Th2/Th1 responses. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate the differentiation and activation of regulatory T cells, thereby regulating immune homeostasis in the lung to suppress allergic inflammation and weight gain. Therefore, clarifying the microbial mechanism of obesity-related asthma has important guiding significance for clinical treatment. In this review, we used the following terms: “asthma and obesity” and “obesity-related asthma”, combining “phenotype”, “airway inflammation” and “lung function”, and reviewed the characteristics and pathogenesis of obesity-related asthma, the relationship between the gut and airway microbiota and obesity-related asthma, and the current treatment measures for the disease.</p>
