## Five new species, two new sexual morph reports, and one new geographical record of Apiospora (Amphisphaeriales, Sordariomycetes) isolated from bamboo in Yunnan, China

date: 2024-12-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Apiospora is an important genus in the Apiosporaceae family with a worldwide distribution. They exhibit different lifestyles including pathogenic, saprophytic, and endophytic. In this study, we aimed to explore the Apiospora associated with bamboo and  collected 14 apiospora-like taxa from the forests of Yunnan Province, China. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses (combined ITS, LSU, tef1-α, and tub2 sequence data) confirmed that these collections belong to Apiospora s. str. and reports five new species (viz., Ap. dehongensis, Ap. jinghongensis, Ap. shangrilaensis, Ap. zhaotongensis, and Ap. zhenxiongensis). New sexual morphs of asexually typified Ap. globose and Ap. guangdongensis species, and a new geographical record of Ap. subglobosa are also reported. The findings of this study not only enhance the diversity of bambusicolous fungi in the region of Yunnan, but also geographical distribution of some known Apiospora species.

## Functional role of the biofilm regulator CsgD in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhi

date: 2024-12-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionTyphoid fever is an infectious disease primarily caused by Salmonella enterica sv. Typhi (S. Typhi), a bacterium that causes as many as 20 million infections and 600,000 deaths annually. Asymptomatic chronic carriers of S. Typhi play a major role in the transmission of typhoid fever, as they intermittently shed the bacteria and can unknowingly infect humans in close proximity. An estimated 90% of chronic carriers have gallstones; biofilm formation on gallstones is a primary factor in the establishment and maintenance of gallbladder carriage. CsgD is a central biofilm regulator in Salmonella, but the S. Typhi csgD gene has a mutation that introduces an early stop codon, resulting in a protein truncated by 8 amino acids at the C-terminus. In this study, we investigate the role of role of CsgD in S. Typhi. MethodsWe introduced a fully functional copy of the csgD gene from S. Typhimurium into S. Typhi under both a native and a constitutive promoter and tested for red, dry, and rough (Rdar) colony morphology, curli fimbriae, cellulose, and biofilm formation. Results and discussionWe demonstrate that although CsgD-regulated curli and cellulose production were partially restored, the introduction of the S. Typhimurium csgD did not induce the Rdar colony morphology. Interestingly, we show that CsgD does not have a significant role in S. Typhi biofilm formation, as biofilm-forming capacities depend more on the isolate than the CsgD regulator. This data suggests the presence of an alternative biofilm regulatory process in this human-restricted pathogen.

## Advances in diagnostic assays for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults

date: 2024-12-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) was a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium in the gut, exhibiting clinical manifestations ranging from mild diarrhoea to fatal pseudomembranous colitis. C. difficile infection (CDI) remains a serious public health problem and accounted for an estimated 360,075 cases in the United States in 2021. It has attracted the utmost attention of the world health organization (WHO). Since publication of a review of the diagnosis of CDI in adults, new clinical diagnostic assays have become available and clinical practice guidelines were updated. This paper presents a comprehensive review of contemporary laboratory diagnostic approaches for CDI in adult patients, with a focus on the utilisation and potential advancements of five sophisticated methodologies, CRISPR in conjunction with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), gene sequencing technology, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and real-time cell analysis (RTCA). It can provide new perspectives and ideas for the early diagnosis of CDI in clinical settings.

## Memory stem CD8+T cells in HIV/Mtb mono- and co-infection: characteristics, implications, and clinical significance

date: 2024-12-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-infection presents a significant public health challenge worldwide. Comprehensive assessment of the immune response in HIV/Mtb co-infection is complex and challenging. CD8+T cells play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response to both HIV and Mtb. The differentiation of CD8+T cells follow a hierarchical pattern, with varying degrees of exhaustion throughout the process. Memory stem T cells (TSCM cells) is at the apex of the memory T lymphocyte system, which has recently emerged as a promising target in immunotherapy. In this context, we discuss the alterations of CD8+TSCM cells in HIV/Mtb mono- and co-infection, their implications and clinical significance, and potential for improving immunotherapy.

## Integrated analysis of proteome and transcriptome revealed changes in multiple signaling pathways involved in immunity in the northern snakehead (Channa argus) during Nocardia seriolae infection

date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a valuable aquaculture species across certain Asian countries, contributing significantly to economic prosperity and dietary needs. However, its productivity faces significant challenges, particularly from diseases such as nocardiosis, caused by Nocardia seriolae. To date, the majority of research efforts have focused on describing the observed phenomena related to N. seriolae infection. However, there remains a notable gap in knowledge concerning the infectivity of N. seriolae and the immune response it elicits. To better understand the modulation of the immune responses to N. seriolae infection in snakeheads, we investigated the splenic proteome profiles. Specifically, we compared the profiles between uninfected northern snakehead specimens and those infected with N. seriolae at 96 h using the label-free data-independent acquisition methodology. A total of 700 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were obtained. Of these, 353 proteins exhibited upregulation, whereas 347 proteins displayed downregulation after the infection. The DEPs were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, revealing several crucial pathways that were activated following N. seriolae infection. Noteworthy, among these were pathways such as ferroptosis, complement and coagulation cascades, chemokine signaling, tuberculosis, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Th17 cell differentiation. Furthermore, protein–protein interaction networks were constructed to elucidate the interplay between immune-related DEPs. These results revealed expression changes in multiple signaling pathways during the initial colonization phase of N. seriolae. This discovery offers novel insights into the infection mechanisms and host interaction dynamics associated with N. seriolae.

## The value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing with blood samples for the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis

date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to assess the clinical value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of blood samples for the identification of disseminated tuberculosis (DTB).MethodsA total of 48 individuals suspected of DTB were enrolled. All patients underwent mNGS of peripheral blood and conventional microbiological tests. Patient characteristics were collected from their medical records.ResultsA total of 28 patients were diagnosed with DTB, whereas 20 patients were confirmed as non-DTB cases. In the DTB groups, 19 (67.9%) contained TB sequences, with specific reads of TB ranging from 1 to 219. The TB sequence was more detectable by mNGS in male patients, those with elevated PCT levels, those who are HIV positive, and those with a decreased CD4 T-cell count. The HIV-positive group shows higher TB mNGS reads (p = 0.012) and TB mNGS sensitivity (p = 0.05). The sensitivity of TB mNGS in blood samples was 80% for HIV-infected patients and 44.4% for non-HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.05). The non-HIV group had a higher prevalence of miliary tuberculosis (p = 0.018), and extrapulmonary tuberculosis was more prevalent in the HIV-positive group.ConclusionOur research has shown that the mNGS of blood samples has excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of DTB. The TB sequence was more detectable by mNGS in patients with elevated PCT levels, those who are HIV positive, and those with a decreased CD4 T-cell count.

## Baicalin promotes β-1,3-glucan exposure in Candida albicans and enhances macrophage response

date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Among the diverse fungal opportunistic pathogens, Candida albicans garners significant attention due to its wide range of infections and high frequency of occurrence. The emergence of resistance and the limited number of antifungals drives the need to develop novel antifungal drugs. Although the natural product baicalin has been shown to trigger apoptosis in C. albicans in previous experiments, its influence on cell wall (CW) structure along with immune recognition remains elusive. In this work, baicalin showed a significant killing effect against C. albicans SC5314. Moreover, CW destruction, characterized by β-1,3-glucan unmasking and chitin deposition, was observed as a consequence of the treatment with baicalin. The RNA sequencing analysis revealed that treatment with baicalin resulted in eight hundred forty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Sixty-five genes, such as GSC1, ENG1, CHS3, GWT1, and MKC1, were associated with CW organization or biogenesis. Baicalin-pretreated C. albicans SC5314 was phagocytosed more efficiently by RAW264.7 macrophages, accompanied by increased TNF-α and IL-1β production. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that baicalin could stimulate β-1,3-glucan unmasking by governing CW-associated gene expression in C. albicans SC5314, which contributes to macrophage recognition and clearance.

## Dysfunction and regulatory interplay of T and B cells in chronic hepatitis B: immunotherapy and emerging antiviral strategies

date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In the context of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the continuous replication of HBV within host hepatocytes is a characteristic feature. Rather than directly causing hepatocyte destruction, this replication leads to immune dysfunction and establishes a state of T-B immune tolerance. Successful clearance of the HBV virus is dependent on the close collaboration between humoral and cellular immunity. Humoral immunity, mediated by B-cell subpopulations, and cellular immunity, dominated by T-cell subpopulations show varying degrees of dysfunction during chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Notably, not all T- and B-cells produce positive immune responses. This review examine the most recent developments in the mutual regulation of T-B cells during chronic HBV infection. Our focus is on the prevailing immunotherapeutic strategies, such as T cell engineering, HBV-related vaccines, PD-1 inhibitors, and Toll-like receptor agonists. While nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) and interferons have notable limitations, including inadequate viral suppression, drug resistance, and adverse reactions, several HBV entry inhibitors have shown promising clinical efficacy. To overcome the challenges posed by NUCs or monotherapy, the combination of immunotherapy and novel antiviral agents presents a promising avenue for future CHB treatment and potential cure.

## Development of a prediction nomogram for IgG levels among asymptomatic or mild patients with COVID-19

date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveCOVID-19 has evolved into a seasonal coronavirus disease, characterized by prolonged infection duration and repeated infections, significantly increasing the risk of patients developing long COVID. Our research focused on the immune responses in asymptomatic and mild cases, particularly the critical factors influencing serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and their predictive value.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis on data from 1939 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients hospitalized between September 2022 and June 2023. Spearman methods were used to test the correlation between serum IgG and age, immunoglobulin M (IgM), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nucleic acid conversion time, and BMI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified independent key factors influencing serum IgG levels, which were integrated and visualized in a nomogram. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to predict the model’s diagnostic performance by calculating the AUC.ResultsMild patients showed higher levels of IgG, IgM, and longer nucleic acid conversion times than asymptomatic patients, and a lower proportion of them had received ≥ 3 COVID-19 vaccine doses. Serum IgG was positively correlated with serum IgM and negatively correlated with age, PCT, IL-6, and BMI. Notably, it showed a moderate negative correlation with nucleic acid conversion time (r = -0.578, P < 0.001). Logistic regression results showed that younger age, lower IL-6 levels, ≥ 3 doses of vaccine, and no comorbidities were independent predictors of serum IgG levels ≥ 21.08 g/L. We used age, IL-6 levels, vaccine doses, and comorbidities to create a nomogram for predicting serum IgG levels, with the area under the ROC curve reaching 0.772.ConclusionAge, IL-6 levels, vaccination status, and comorbidities were independent predictors of serum IgG levels in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients, facilitating risk stratification and clinical decision-making. Notably, receiving ≥3 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine was the most beneficial factor for elevated serum IgG levels.

## Epidemiological, molecular, and evolutionary characteristics of G1P[8] rotavirus in China on the eve of RotaTeq application

date: 2024-12-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThis study, conducted in China prior to RotaTeq’s launch, examined the epidemiological, molecular, and evolutionary features of the G1P[8] genotype RVA in children admitted with diarrhea, to aid in evaluating its efficacy and impact on G1P[8] RVA in China.MethodsData from the Chinese viral diarrhea surveillance network were collected from January 2016 to December 2018. RVA strains identified as the G1P[8] genotype were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Neutralizing epitope, amino acid selection pressure, and evolution dynamics analyses on VP7 and VP4 were performed using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 and PyMOL v.2.5.2, four algorithms (MEME, SLAC, FEL, and FUBAR) in the Datamonkey online software, and the MCMC model in BEAST v. 1.10.4, respectively. Phylogenetic and identity features of 11 genes were assessed by DNAStar and MEGA v.7.ResultsResults showed that the detection rate of G1P[8] in China from 2016 to 2018 was generally low with significant seasonality. The whole genome of G1P[8] of four 2016 childhood diarrhea specimens was successfully sequenced. Phylogenetic and neutralizing epitope analysis showed that Rotavin-M1 might have better protection on G1P[8] prevalent in China than Rotarix and RotaTeq. Two conserved N-glycosylation sites on VP7 of Chinese G1P[8] might affect the protective effect of the vaccine. Evolution rate and selection pressure analysis identified the possibility of rapidly evolving and adapting to the new environment introduced by vaccines of G1P[8], whereas positive selection specific to VP4 indicated the potential tendency to select for dominant traits. Identity and phylogeny analysis showed that Chinese G1P[8] from before 2018 was generally stable with possible genetic recombination among local strains.DiscussionThese findings not only are of great significance for predicting the prevalence of G1P [8] in China, but also provide data reference for evaluating rotavirus vaccine efficacy.
