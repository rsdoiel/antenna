<p>
When it comes to greening up our transportation systems and reducing the
massive carbon footprint left by our daily commutes, there’s a much
better solution than trying to get everyone into an electric car.
Encouraging increased cycling, whether on electric bikes or good
old-fashioned acoustic bikes, has the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/05/30/its-national-e-bike-day-heres-how-an-electric-bike-can-benefit-you/">biggest
impact on reduced emissions</a> and the health and well-being of our
society. But with safety at the top of the list of concerns for those
switching to a two-wheeled commute, more studies are showing that the
best way to protect cyclists at the most dangerous point on their rides
is to simply let them blow through stop signs in what is commonly known
as an “Idaho stop”.

EV sales continue to rise, but the last year of headlines falsely
stating otherwise would leave you thinking they haven’t. After about
full year of these lies, it would be nice for journalists to stop
pushing this false narrative that they could find the truth behind by
simply looking up a single number for once.

Ted Cruz is obstructing a bipartisan bill to improve battery safety in
the US. Believe it or not, it largely comes down to a strange culture
war over gas stoves.
