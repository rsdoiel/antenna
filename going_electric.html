North American e-bike regulations allow a higher power limit of 750W,
which has resulted in an amazingly diverse field of super powerful
e-bikes. However, that also means there’s a push towards the extra heavy
end of the spectrum. But as a nice break from the race to more power,
now that I’ve been testing the lightweight Ride1Up Roadster V3 for
several weeks, I’m glad to finally be back on a lighter and more
efficient ride that reminds me of the simpler times.
