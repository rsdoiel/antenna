<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of October 2025. Fall sales are really kicking off and that means big savings for e-bike riders! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>The new new Super E cultivator from Tilmor isn’t just another pice of compact farm equipment – it’s a purpose-built electric cultivator that trades loud diesel clatter for quiet confidence and precision control. Made in the USA and ready to work, it’s proof that electric farming may be closer (and more practical) than you think.</p>

<p>A lot of EV charging apps can tell you where the plugs are, and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chargeway/">Chargeway</a> tells you that, too — <em>along with everything else</em>. From your EV’s state of charge, to the best charging strategy to get you from point A to point B, to real-time charger availability, and more, it’s simply the best tool I’ve found to help new EV drivers understand how an EV fits into their busy lives today. And as of today, in fact, Chargeway is adding another benefit to its platform: <strong>real-time kWh pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>The untimely demise of the $7,500 Federal EV tax credit has set off a price war in the EV space, with affordable new models from some corners, massive discounts and price cuts from others, and even some price hikes from unexpected brands. Now, even Mazda is getting into the mix, and it’s slashing the price of its XC-70 plug-in crossover.</p>

<p>Tesla is now selling its stripped-down, “more affordable” vehicle, the Model Y Standard, in Europe, just <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/tesla-releases-new-more-affordable-model-y-3-2k-more-than-last-week/">three days after releasing it in the US</a>. Its US release was widely panned as the massive number of missing features outweighed the relatively small price cut. But the new European release has fewer cut features <em>and</em> a larger price differential, making the calculus much different in a territory where Tesla sales have fallen rapidly.</p>

<p>We’ve got good news – EV lease prices look much better than expected, despite the end of the federal tax credit and 25% import tariff being in place. Prices have crept up compared to last month, but several automakers have stepped in to fill the gap by covering the $7,500 credit themselves or adding extra incentives – and the price of one EV even <em>dropped</em>. Here are October’s top EV lease deals, spotted by our friends at CarsDirect.</p>

<p>If that sounds appealing to you, here’s what it might cost to keep that OG Prius on the road for many more years to come.</p>

<p>Solar and storage prices are about to rise after a year and a half of record lows, according to new data from Wood Mackenzie.

That’s because China is changing the rules.</p>

<p>The $7,500 US federal EV tax credit is no more, having expired yesterday, a deadline which was set when republicans voted to <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/22/house-republicans-vote-to-send-us-ev-jobs-to-china-give-trillions-to-us-elites/">reverse climate progress and channel trillions of dollars from everyday Americans to wealthy elites</a>.</p>
<p>However, that’s not the end of subsidies for the American auto industry, as most gas cars continue to benefit from over $20k in subsidy for each vehicle over the course of their lifetime.</p>

The rant is doubly embarrassing for another reason: <strong>the company’s hydrogen trucks are more than 100 <em>million</em> miles behind Volvo’s electric semis</strong>.</p>

<p>Robot mowers have come a long way in recent years, but some still fall into two categories: the ones that need perimeter wires, and the ones that get scared of tall grass. The UBHOME M10 falls into neither, and after testing it over the past few weeks, I’ve come away genuinely impressed. It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.element3.io/">Element3</a> just raised a fresh round of funding to launch the first US commercial lithium extraction plants, and it’s sourcing the lithium from oil and gas wastewater in Texas. That’s a big deal because it means there will be a domestic lithium supply for EVs and battery storage within a few months.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced it will spend $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” the US coal industry, claiming it will boost energy production and help rural communities. Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised “beautiful, clean coal” as “essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p>A few years ago, it was basically a Tesla, Nissan Leaf, or <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chevy-bolt/">Chevy Bolt</a> if you were looking for a used electric vehicle. Nowadays, you can buy used Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, Chevy, or Honda EVs for about the same, or even less than, gas-powered cars.</p>
