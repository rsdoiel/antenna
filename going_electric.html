Car brands like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla have built up solid
reputations for safety, but their ultra-safe vehicles often come with a
premium price tag. The good news for car buyers looking for a deal, but
still prize safety, is that there’s an all-electric Hyundai for under
$40K that scores top marks on the IIHS’ toughest new safety tests.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of July 2025. Summer is peaking, making this a great
chance to enjoy this riding season with a fun and efficient electric
bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could
become your next electric bike.

Tesla is about to tumble off a familiar policy cliff. The $7,500 federal

been here before, but the ground underneath the company looks very

Machine’s</a> debut product looks like it was carved out of a steel
block in a dystopian future. The design is bold, brutalist, and
unapologetically industrial. As a first product offering, it does a
great job of catching people’s attention. Whether you like the look or
not is up to you, but there is no denying that it is a head-turner. So
when I had the opportunity to get some hands-on time with it, I knew I
had to jump at that chance.

<p>
And after just an hour of riding the P1 around NYC, I can confidently
say this thing turns heads for good reason. It’s fast, futuristic, and
fun. This is just a first impression, but I’ll have it for an extended
period soon — so stay tuned for a deeper dive and complete review. For
now, let’s talk about my experience.

On today’s test-acular episode
of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElectrekDaily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quick
Charge</a></em>, it’s a new day and a new Chinese ADAS test for Tesla to
conquer – but this one’s got a LOT more pedestrian carnage to parse
through! We’ve also got some great e-bike deals from Retrospec and a
bladder-busting Hyundai.

Chinese media outlet Dongchedi conducted another massive test of driver
assist systems, testing many of the same cars as it did in the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/26/a-chinese-real-world-self-driving-test-36-cars-216-crashes-with-tesla-on-top/">highway
test we we reported on this weekend</a>.
</p>
<p>
This time, the test covers various urban driving scenarios, where much
more human carnage is possible due to the presence of vulnerable road
users like pedestrians and two-wheelers. And given how poorly the cars
did on the last test, you can guess how they might have done on this one
– although, once again, Tesla fared rather well, but was not without
issue.

Velotric, one of several prolific e-bike makers in the US electric bike
market, has announced the launch of its first-ever electric trike. The
new <a href="https://velotricebike.pxf.io/LK1E4j">Velotric Trike</a>r
sees the brand enter the rapidly heating e-trike industry, with a
growing number of seniors and other riders flocking to the more stable
e-bike format. But unlike many e-trike makers, Velotric has ratcheted up
the performance and the technology in their e-trike, giving us more of
just about everything.

Tesla is again teasing the new Roadster, which is now five years late,
as “the last driver’s car” before self-driving takes over.

The chicken or the egg. Is Tesla delaying the Roadster to match the
development of self-driving technology, or is it delaying the
development of self-driving technology to match the delayed release of
the Roadster?

Electric bikes are booming in popularity across the US, and cities are
starting to take notice. From famous programs like those in Denver to
smaller initiatives around the country, local governments are rolling
out rebate and incentive programs to make e-bikes more affordable,
especially for lower-income residents. The goal? Get more people out of
cars and onto two wheels.

Musk.

But despite planning two generations ahead, the company still doesn’t
have a solution to bring the promised full autonomy to hardware that
it’s been promising that capability to since 2016.

Canadian startup Beachman has just unveiled its latest electric
two-wheeler, the ’64, a vintage-styled electric motorcycle that looks
like it rolled straight out of the 1960s. With throwback café racer
design and a respectable top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), it’s a slick
little ride with a curious twist: it calls itself an e-bike.
</p>
<p>
[Update: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the
Beachman ’64 E-bike did not have pedals. In fact, it does have small
cranks and pedals folded up against the bike, mounted to the swingarm.]
