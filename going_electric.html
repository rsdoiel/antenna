      <h1>Here are the best electric bikes you can buy at every price level in November 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)

      <p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/tern-quick-haul-taiwan-header.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of November 2025. For basically the entire month, e-bike companies are running their extended Black Friday (more like Black November) deals, and that means big savings for e-bike riders! While many companies are likely to toss in an extra lock or headlight or T-shirt on Black Friday/Cyber Monday itself, the real deals are pretty much already up and happening all month long. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>Starting this month, parking lots in South Korea with more than 80 spaces will be <em>required</em> to install solar canopies and carports.

<p>bp pulse has opened a new 40-bay EV fast charging hub near Houston’s William P. Hobby Airport, marking the company’s latest move to expand its US charging network. The Hobby Airport hub is bp pulse’s second in Houston, as it opened its first US hub in early 2024 at bp’s Houston headquarters.</p>

<p>Police in Colorado’s Columbine Valley recently tracked down a “porch pirate” who stole a package from a suburban home in Bow Mar, Colorado. The only problem: they <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/flock-cameras-lead-colorado-police-wrong-suspect/">got it completely wrong</a>, and the accused had to resort to footage from her Rivian truck to exonerate herself.</p>

<p>When it comes to electric bikes, the <a href="https://alnk.to/hsyfubF">JackRabbit OG2 Pro</a> barely qualifies as one – and that’s kind of the point. With no pedals, a seat barely higher than your hip, and a wheelbase shorter than some skateboards, this is less a traditional e-bike and more a bite-sized personal transporter that feels like a cross between a folding bike and an electric scooter.</p>
<p>But after riding it around for the past few months, I can confidently say: it’s an absolute blast. It’s more powerful than it looks, it’s easier to transport than you’d expect, and it’s simply more fun than you can imagine. It’s the small-format whip that I wish had existed years ago.</p>

<p>Elon Musk recently walked back his impossible extremely ambitious robotaxi goals, shifting from a target of reaching “ <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/23/elon-musk-with-straight-face-tesla-robotaxi-will-cover-half-us-population-end-year/">half the U.S. population by the end of 2025</a>” to a more “modest” goal of launching in “eight to 10 U.S. metro areas” within the next two months.</p>
<p>Now, in a development that should surprise no one, a new report suggests that even this heavily scaled-back timeline is facing significant obstacles.</p>

<p>It’s about 10% of the 63,619 Cybertrucks in existence, which we know about due to <em>another</em> recall from last week (though that one was fixed by a software update) – showing that the Cybertruck is selling a lot more poorly than initial estimates would have suggested.</p>

<p>Electricity demand is surging in Texas, and solar, wind, and battery storage are meeting it.</p>
<p>According to new data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), electricity demand across the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) hit record highs in the first nine months of 2025. ERCOT, which supplies power to about 90% of the state, saw demand jump 5% year-over-year to 372 terawatt hours (TWh) – a 23% increase since 2021. No other major US grid has grown faster over the past year.</p>

<p>We’ve long known that inside of <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/">Rivian</a>, the popular electric pickup and SUV maker, lived a tiny skunkworks of e-bike folks ready to reinvent the micromobility world with their own take on the future of rideables. After the company was spun off and brought to public attention last year, we finally know what they’ve been cooking up today. And it might just be the future of the electric bike.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of hand-wringing lately about electric bikes. You’ve probably seen the headlines – the ones about sidewalk conflicts, teenagers riding too fast, or policymakers scrambling to define what qualifies as an e-bike in the first place. And sure, it’s healthy for cities to ask questions about how new forms of mobility fit into the urban fabric. But let’s not lose sight of something much more important: e-bikes are still one of the best things to happen to cities in decades.</p>
<p>I’d argue they’re the best thing for urban life since flush toilets.</p>

Here are October’s top EV lease deals, spotted by our friends at CarsDirect.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of October 2025. Fall sales are really kicking off and that means big savings for e-bike riders! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>The new new Super E cultivator from Tilmor isn’t just another pice of compact farm equipment – it’s a purpose-built electric cultivator that trades loud diesel clatter for quiet confidence and precision control. Made in the USA and ready to work, it’s proof that electric farming may be closer (and more practical) than you think.</p>

<p>A lot of EV charging apps can tell you where the plugs are, and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chargeway/">Chargeway</a> tells you that, too — <em>along with everything else</em>. From your EV’s state of charge, to the best charging strategy to get you from point A to point B, to real-time charger availability, and more, it’s simply the best tool I’ve found to help new EV drivers understand how an EV fits into their busy lives today. And as of today, in fact, Chargeway is adding another benefit to its platform: <strong>real-time kWh pricing</strong>.</p>
