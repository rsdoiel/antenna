Gravity’s development closely, itching to get behind the wheel of a
full-fledged production version to test drive – and that day has finally
come, my friends. Last week, I took a trip to Lucid’s design studio,
where I had my most intimate encounter with the Gravity SUV to date,
including a brief but informative test drive around the Bay Area. There,
I also learned that the official range of the Lucid Gravity is an
impressive 450 miles. Check out images and a video of my experience

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of December 2024. It’s the last chance to grab some
great holiday deals on a new e-bike! And just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has turned
into a year of impressive e-bike sales not to be missed. So check out
the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next
electric bike.
