I drove the next-generation R1S and R1T electric vehicles from Rivian,

<p>
Not that it wasn’t good before, but it clearly needs to keep getting
better to get to profitability.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve learned these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and
front to back. That dedication to real-world e-bike testing has helped
me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any
budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of June 2024. Summer is upon us and it’s time to start
thinking about how we can make the most of the warm weather! Just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has become the

one of which could become your next electric bike.
