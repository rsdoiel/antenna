Whether it’s to keep the lights on after a natural disaster or just to
avoid peak energy rates, more people than ever are adding battery energy
storage to their home solar systems. With some 45% of home solar
customers saying yes to home batteries last year, the big question isn’t
whether or not to get one – it’s what kind to get.

<p>
Two options stand out: <strong>lithium ion</strong>, and
<strong>vanadium flow</strong>. Here’s the information you need to make
the right choice.

The e-bike industry in the West has long been a tale of two territories.
North Americans enjoy higher speeds and power limits for their electric
bicycles while Europeans are held to much stricter (i.e. slower and
lower) speed and power limits. However, things might change based on
current discussions on rewriting European e-bike regulations.

<p>
It’s not often we get to applaud a legacy motorcycle manufacturer for
doing what so many still haven’t: actually bringing an electric
motorcycle to market. So credit where credit is due – Kawasaki didn’t
just make one electric motorcycle, they made two:
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/27/closer-look-at-kawasakis-new-electric-motorcycles-ninja-e-1-and-z-e-1/">
Ninja e-1 and Z e-1.</a>
</p>
<p>
They’re sleek, affordable, and surprisingly refined machines that show
real promise in design and execution. But once you get past the glossy
panels and respected nameplate, there’s still one glaring issue that we
can’t ignore.

Rivian’s original R1S and R1T were quad-motor vehicles, but as of the
second generation of the R1 platform, only dual and tri-motor variants
existed. So why quad? Why now?

<p>
The new <a href="https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/Z6e6zR">Lectric XP
Trike2</a>, just unveiled today, is the hands-down winner in the
best-bang-for-your-buck category of electric trikes. And as perhaps the
longest-running electric bike reviewer in the industry, I can say that
with confidence. I’ve seen a lot of electric bikes in my time. I’ve
spent a lot of butt-in-saddle hours on e-trikes. But I’ve never before
seen a value like this roll by on three wheels.
</p>
<p>
As an able-bodied, mid-30s electric bike rider (and writer), I’ll be the
first to say that electric trikes aren’t just for older folks. They’re
fun e-bikes in their own right. But let’s face it – the vast majority of
the market for electric three-wheelers are those who just aren’t as
comfortable on two wheels due to age, accessibility, or other reasons.
And so if you’re a senior or otherwise on the hunt for a fun and
affordable electric trike, the Lectric XP Trike2 is probably the one
you’re going to end up getting, and deservingly so!

Hyundai flew us out to Savannah, Georgia, a few weeks ago to get our
first impressions of the much-anticipated Ioniq 9 three-row SUV.
Incidentally, Hyundai’s new factory, located just outside Savannah
(pictured below), has begun assembling the Ioniq 9 and offering a $
7,500 tax credit, available for a limited time.
</p>
<p>
The Ioniq 9 uses the same E-GMP platform as the Kia EV9 and some smaller
HMG EVs but the real question is: how is the Ioniq 9 different? Let’s
take a look…

Paris’ bike-share system,
<a href="https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en">Vélib</a> has long been
considered one of the shining success stories of urban micromobility.
With a massive fleet of over 20,000 pedal and electric-assist bicycles
around Paris, the service has helped millions of residents and tourists
get around the City of Light without needing a car or scooter. But
lately, a growing problem is threatening to knock the wheels off this
urban mobility marvel: theft and joyriding.

The Honda Ruckus has earned cult status thanks to its minimalist
styling, exposed frame, and seemingly endless customizability. The
scooter, also known in international markets as the Honda Zoomer, has
spent years being seen as a blank canvas for scooter tuners, urban
commuters, and anyone who just wanted something simple, small, and kind
of weird to zip around town. A few years ago, Honda finally answered the
call for an updated version by announcing and producing the “Zoomer e:”,
which was an electric version of the Honda Ruckus. So where is it?
