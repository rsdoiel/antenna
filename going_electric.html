<p>Electric vehicles are known for plugging in – but one startup wants them to simply soak up the sun instead. Bako Motors is building compact electric cars and cargo vans with solar panels on the roof, letting them charge directly from sunlight and cut their dependence on wall sockets altogether.</p>

<p>Electricity demand is surging in Texas, and solar, wind, and battery storage are meeting it.</p>
<p>According to new data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), electricity demand across the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) hit record highs in the first nine months of 2025. ERCOT, which supplies power to about 90% of the state, saw demand jump 5% year-over-year to 372 terawatt hours (TWh) – a 23% increase since 2021. No other major US grid has grown faster over the past year.</p>

<p>Tesla no longer promises that all of its cars have the hardware onboard for Full Self-Driving, instead now saying that its cars are “designed for autonomy.”</p>
<p>The change happens amidst a growing call for Tesla to upgrade old cars, sold with the promise of complete autonomous operation, but whose hardware is increasingly becoming incapable of running the latest versions of Tesla’s driver assist software.</p>

But let’s not lose sight of something much more important: e-bikes are still one of the best things to happen to cities in decades.</p>
<p>I’d argue they’re the best thing for urban life since flush toilets.</p>

<p>Uber gets it. The rideshare behemoth has observed the upward trend of EV adoption across its database of customers and drivers and is helping to support that transition. Beginning today, the “Uber Green” ride option is now called “Uber Electric,” visible to all app users worldwide. To celebrate the transition, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/uber/">Uber</a> is offering discounted rides for those opting for electric vehicles, and drivers may also qualify for a $4,000 grant.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of October 2025. Fall sales are really kicking off and that means big savings for e-bike riders! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>A lot of EV charging apps can tell you where the plugs are, and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chargeway/">Chargeway</a> tells you that, too — <em>along with everything else</em>.

And as of today, in fact, Chargeway is adding another benefit to its platform: <strong>real-time kWh pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>Utilities, state governments, and private developers are racing to roll out faster, more powerful EV chargers. At the same time, automakers and tech giants across the globe are pouring billions into R&amp;D to develop batteries that can take ever-higher levels of power. But what if there’s a better, easier, cheaper, and <em>more effective</em> way to cut emissions?</p>
<p>What if, instead of faster chargers, we pushed for SLOWER gas pumps?</p>

<p>The LEAF is back and upgraded in nearly every way possible. For the 2026 model year, the new <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/nissan-leaf/">Nissan LEAF</a> is all grown up and still one of the most affordable EVs, starting at under $30,000. However, lease prices are not so cheap.</p>

<p>Tesla is now selling its stripped-down, “more affordable” vehicle, the Model Y Standard, in Europe, just <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/tesla-releases-new-more-affordable-model-y-3-2k-more-than-last-week/">three days after releasing it in the US</a>. Its US release was widely panned as the massive number of missing features outweighed the relatively small price cut. But the new European release has fewer cut features <em>and</em> a larger price differential, making the calculus much different in a territory where Tesla sales have fallen rapidly.</p>

<p>Ferrari has released details about its approach to powertrain sounds with its first electric vehicle, the Elettrica, and I am intrigued. If well-executed, I even think it might convince some petrolheads to give EVs a try.</p>
