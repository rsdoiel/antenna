canceled its work on the $25,000 “Model 2” despite the project ending
weeks prior, Tesla executives were “alarmed” by Musk’s public lie,
according to a new report by Reuters.

<p>
The electric motorcycle market is a small and highly interconnected one,
with a limited amount of suppliers and an even smaller number of actual
honest-to-goodness motorcycle manufacturers. While Covid-era progress
led to a series of highly-funded
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/20/ryvid-anthem-electric-motorcycle-unveil/">rapid
advancements</a> and
<a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/18/damon-unveils-two-new-electric-motorcycles-based-on-novel-hyperdrive-platform/">flashy
announcements</a>, the last few years have been hard on the industry as
funding and excitement have both dwindled, resulting in a smaller number
of big releases. So it makes sense that people would jump at news that
Honda is now producing its first electric motorcycle and that you can
already buy it. The only problem is that none of that is true – finally
some <em>real</em> fake news.
