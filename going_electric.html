<p>
Portable power stations long ago became one of those “why didn’t I get
one sooner?” products for me. Whether it’s keeping a fridge running
during a power outage, charging cameras in the field, or juicing up my
growing fleet of electric bikes, a good battery box is worth its weight
in gold. Sometimes I use them simply when I’m too lazy to go find an
extension cord! I recently got my hands on the new
<a href="https://www.dabbsson.com/products/2000l-portable-power-station">Dabbsson
2000L</a> power station, and after putting it through its paces, I think
this one’s going to earn a permanent spot in my gear lineup – and yes,
probably a spot in my e-bike charging garage!
