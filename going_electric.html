<p>
A couple years ago, my wife started a new job as an elementary school
principal. It was an exciting milestone, but it also came with a
stressful commute. The school isn’t far – just a few kilometers across
the city – but during rush hour, taking the bus often meant sitting in
gridlock for 45 minutes. Not exactly the best way to start or end a
workday.
</p>
<p>
So we got her an electric bike.

Wagons don’t get a lot of love Stateside, with American buyers choosing
SUVs over – well, pretty much every other type of vehicle imaginable.
That’s our loss, as the latest plug in hybrid versions of the Volkswagen
Passat are here to prove.

Wirtgen Vögele recently revealed the battery-powered MINI 500e and the

Car brands like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla have built up solid
reputations for safety, but their ultra-safe vehicles often come with a
premium price tag. The good news for car buyers looking for a deal, but
still prize safety, is that there’s an all-electric Hyundai for under
$40K that scores top marks on the IIHS’ toughest new safety tests.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of July 2025. Summer is peaking, making this a great
chance to enjoy this riding season with a fun and efficient electric
bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could
become your next electric bike.
