I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of January 2025. It’s a brand new year, and that means
it’s a great chance to start it right on a fun and efficient electric
bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could
become your next electric bike.
