Instead, it will focus on hybrids, which get 100% of their energy from
fossil fuels, and which cause climate change and poison the air you

<p>
About one year after first catching wind that EV newcomer
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xiaomi/">Xiaomi Automobile</a> was
working on an SUV we’d come to know as the YU7, the company is finally
set to launch the new model in China. This will be a direct competitor
to the Tesla Model Y and has the potential to reimagine the all-electric
SUV market in China.
