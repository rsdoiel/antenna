      Fewer EV drivers have to deal with broken chargers, but owners aren’t thrilled with the costs, especially at Tesla Superchargers.

Instead, Bafang wants to make urban e‑biking smoother than ever with its all-new H730 hub motor, featuring its patented GVT (Gear Variable Transmission) technology. The idea is to combine the advantages of internally geared hubs with Bafang’s own hub motors to create an internally geared hub motor.</p>

There are thousands of public chargers already out there – and, in some places, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/21/california-50-percent-more-ev-chargers-than-gas-nozzles/">you’ll find more plugs than pumps</a>. But if you don’t drive electric, you’d never know it. That’s because gas stations don’t just exist, they announce themselves with giant, illuminated signs that can be seen for miles, while EV chargers tend to just sort of sit, nestled away in the back of the parking lot.</p>



<p>That’s why the new EV Totem from Blink Charging is such a big deal. It doesn’t just charge your car, it stands tall, lights up, and tells the world: <strong>electric fuel is here, now</strong>.</p>
