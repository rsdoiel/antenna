For years, Tesla has been the go-to EV recommendation for “normals”
looking for a painless, low-effort experience from their first electric
cars. In light of
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/03/tesla-cybertruck-recall-fix-joke-leaves-mark-gap/">questionable
recalls</a> and its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/23/tesla-ranks-under-unitedhealth-temu-bp-in-brand-reputation-poll-due-to-musk/">CEO’s
recent involvement in controversial politics</a>, however,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/03/tesla-owners-get-creative-to-distance-themselves-from-elon-with-new-car-logos-projectors/">people
are starting to distance themselves from the trailblazing company</a>.
</p>
<p>
All that begs the question: <strong>what should we recommend to EV noobs
now</strong>?

There’s no question that electric construction equipment is safer, more
precise, and generally better than the diesel equipment it’s replacing,
but getting power to that equipment remains a logistical challenge that
hasn’t been solved for. With this new mobile Megawatt charging station,
however, Komatsu think they’ve found a solution — <strong>with up to 6
MW of power</strong>!
