The US solar industry is still booming, but looming policy threats could
pull the plug on that momentum.
</p>
<p>
According to the new US Solar Market Insight report from SEIA and Wood
Mackenzie, the industry installed 10.8 gigawatts (GW) of new
electricity-generating solar in Q1 2025, with solar and storage making
up a whopping 82% of all new capacity added to the grid.

future, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia-pv5/" target="_blank">the

adva</span>nced technology, and a range of features. It’s offered in a
variety of different configurations, including an upcoming refrigerated
