We EV enthusiasts have heard it all from the haters before. “What are
you gonna do with all those batteries?” “There’s just not enough range,”
and, of course, “Charging takes so much longer than a gas station
visit.” As previously teased, Chinese auto conglomerate BYD has
introduced a new 1,000-volt EV platform that can enable charging rates
as fast (or perhaps faster) than a trip to the gas station. We’re
talking five minutes.

It was not only active, but it also disengaged itself less than a second
before the crash—a known shady behavior of Tesla’s Autopilot.

<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs. A rebate is a
powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like
negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest
rate objections so you can drive home in the car of your dreams today.

<p>
If you’re dealing with any of the above, pay attention: these EVs could
get you behind the wheel of a new electric ride sooner than you think!
