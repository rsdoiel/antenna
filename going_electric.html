Sleek, street-legal, and brimming with potential, it was a concept that
looked like the perfect entry point into urban electric mobility for
youthful riders and city commuters alike. With Harley’s branding, a
slick removable battery for easy charging, and design filings that
showed a nearly production-ready machine, this could’ve been a breakout
moment in light electric vehicles. But instead, it was shelved, leaving
a gaping hole in a market that’s now bursting with demand for just this
kind of ride.

NIU’s recent addition to its KQi line of electric scooters, the KQi
200F, delivers on its promise of being a smart, mid-range commuter

At that price, it’s as affordable as a cheaper scooter while offering
features and tech found in pricier models!
</p>
<p>
In fact, it looks like NIU has some pretty crazy Prime Day sales on just

Whether it’s to keep the lights on after a natural disaster or just to
avoid peak energy rates, more people than ever are adding battery energy
storage to their home solar systems. With some 45% of home solar

whether or not to get one – it’s what kind to get.

The e-bike industry in the West has long been a tale of two territories.
North Americans enjoy higher speeds and power limits for their electric

lower) speed and power limits. However, things might change based on
current discussions on rewriting European e-bike regulations.

<p>
It’s not often we get to applaud a legacy motorcycle manufacturer for
doing what so many still haven’t: actually bringing an electric
motorcycle to market. So credit where credit is due – Kawasaki didn’t
just make one electric motorcycle, they made two:
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/27/closer-look-at-kawasakis-new-electric-motorcycles-ninja-e-1-and-z-e-1/">
Ninja e-1 and Z e-1.</a>
</p>
<p>
They’re sleek, affordable, and surprisingly refined machines that show
real promise in design and execution. But once you get past the glossy
panels and respected nameplate, there’s still one glaring issue that we
can’t ignore.

Rivian’s original R1S and R1T were quad-motor vehicles, but as of the
second generation of the R1 platform, only dual and tri-motor variants
existed. So why quad? Why now?

American EV automaker
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/lucid-motors/">Lucid Motors</a> has
demonstrated another lesson in premium efficiency. Earlier this week,
Lucid took a Grand Touring version of its flagship Air sedan on a
Guinness World Record-setting trip from Switzerland to Germany,
showcasing the capabilities of its technology while providing more
evidence that all-electric models are the future of long-distance
travel.

XP Trike2 launched as the affordable new electric trike every senior
needs!</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Electrek Feed</p>

<p>
The new <a href="https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/Z6e6zR">Lectric XP
Trike2</a>, just unveiled today, is the hands-down winner in the
best-bang-for-your-buck category of electric trikes. And as perhaps the
longest-running electric bike reviewer in the industry, I can say that
with confidence. I’ve seen a lot of electric bikes in my time. I’ve
spent a lot of butt-in-saddle hours on e-trikes. But I’ve never before
seen a value like this roll by on three wheels.
</p>
<p>
As an able-bodied, mid-30s electric bike rider (and writer), I’ll be the
first to say that electric trikes aren’t just for older folks. They’re
fun e-bikes in their own right. But let’s face it – the vast majority of
the market for electric three-wheelers are those who just aren’t as
comfortable on two wheels due to age, accessibility, or other reasons.
And so if you’re a senior or otherwise on the hunt for a fun and
affordable electric trike, the Lectric XP Trike2 is probably the one
you’re going to end up getting, and deservingly so!

EV</a> proved its might by towing a 100-year-old classic car and trailer
weighing around 3 tons in public.

If you thought the horse and buggy was the end of the line for Amish
transportation, think again. Across many parts of Amish country,
including Iowa, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, electric bicycles are starting
to show up parked next to Amish barns or quietly zipping down country
roads underneath their Amish riders.

Hyundai flew us out to Savannah, Georgia, a few weeks ago to get our
first impressions of the much-anticipated Ioniq 9 three-row SUV.
Incidentally, Hyundai’s new factory, located just outside Savannah
(pictured below), has begun assembling the Ioniq 9 and offering a $
7,500 tax credit, available for a limited time.
</p>
<p>
The Ioniq 9 uses the same E-GMP platform as the Kia EV9 and some smaller
HMG EVs but the real question is: how is the Ioniq 9 different? Let’s
take a look…

Paris’ bike-share system,
<a href="https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en">Vélib</a> has long been
considered one of the shining success stories of urban micromobility.
With a massive fleet of over 20,000 pedal and electric-assist bicycles
around Paris, the service has helped millions of residents and tourists
get around the City of Light without needing a car or scooter. But
lately, a growing problem is threatening to knock the wheels off this
urban mobility marvel: theft and joyriding.

The Honda Ruckus has earned cult status thanks to its minimalist
styling, exposed frame, and seemingly endless customizability. The
scooter, also known in international markets as the Honda Zoomer, has
spent years being seen as a blank canvas for scooter tuners, urban
commuters, and anyone who just wanted something simple, small, and kind
of weird to zip around town. A few years ago, Honda finally answered the
call for an updated version by announcing and producing the “Zoomer e:”,
which was an electric version of the Honda Ruckus. So where is it?
