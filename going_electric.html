Elon Musk told us.

He is now lowering expectations.

electric cars on the road, it’s not just you. The company set a new EV
sales record in July as its first three-row electric SUV gains momentum.
With new electrified models like the EV9, Kia is “confident that
consumer interest in the Kia brand will continue to strengthen.”

<p>
Ever since the federal government
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/08/07/the-new-climate-bill-abandoned-the-type-of-electric-vehicle-that-can-make-the-biggest-difference/">gave
up on including electric bikes</a> in its broader electric vehicle
incentive programs, alternative incentives at the local and state levels
have been met largely with success—except, of course, in California. In
stark contrast to most other incentive programs around the US,
California’s partially developed program has spent years in shambles
with no apparent launch date in sight.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how California screwed the pooch so badly with its own
state-sponsored electric bicycle incentive program.

Americans purchase everything from EVs to solar and electrical
appliances to heat pumps. Check out this easy-to-use

Part of positive EV ownership is having a convenient home charging
solution. While public charging stations are great for travel, home
charging is both a time and cost savings. The
<a href="https://getneocharge.com/products/neocharge-smart-splitter">NeoCharge
Smart Splitter</a> has been key for making home EV charging smooth for
me.
</p>
<p>
Adding a second 240V outlet to my house as a renter is a tall order.
Continually swapping the dryer plug and mobile charging plug is
inconvenient and ill-advised. The Smart Splitter solves both those
problems easily and affordably.

I love getting the chance to see and test new and innovative designs in
the world of micromobility, especially since many of the repetitive
designs we so often see turn out to be cookie-cutter rehashes of other
models. But the designers of the

definitely went in a new direction, creating something innovative and
comfortable for all types of riding.

The Kandi Mini is unlike any other golf cart in the world in two key

And second, it’s a lot more compact than your average golf cart.

Both of these are key features for folks who have become golf cart
curious but don’t have the space in their garages or their wallets for a
new full-size cart.
