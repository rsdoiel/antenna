A new Tesla prototype was spotted again, reigniting speculation among
Tesla shareholders, even though it’s likely just a Model Y, potentially
a bit smaller, and the upcoming stripped-down, cheaper version.

While much of the Western world is still figuring out how to get more
people on electric bikes, China just flipped a switch, and the results
are staggering. Thanks to
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/01/29/china-urges-citizens-to-trade-in-old-lithium-e-bikes-for-newer-lead-acid-electric-bikes/">a
generous nationwide trade-in program</a> rolled out around six months
ago, China has seen an explosive surge in electric bicycle sales, with
over 8.47 million new e-bikes hitting the road in the first half of 2025
alone.

Today was the official start of racing at the Electrek
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/formula-sun-grand-prix/">Formula Sun
Grand Prix</a> 2025! There was a tremendous energy (and heat) on the
ground at NCM Motorsports Park as nearly a dozen teams took to the
track. Currently, as of writing, Stanford is ranked #1 in the SOV
(Single-Occupant Vehicle) class with 68 registered laps. However, the
fastest lap so far belongs to UC Berkeley, which clocked a 4:45 on the
3.15-mile track. That’s an average speed of just under 40 mph on nothing
but solar energy. Not bad!

compete with the Tesla Model Y and

to just 15 mph (24.1 km/h) from the previous e-bike speed limit of 25

Yorkers, but which experts have said will actually result in risking
more lives.

The sun has set on a frantic day of scrutineering at this year’s
Electrek
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/formula-sun-grand-prix/">Formula Sun
Grand Prix (FSGP)</a>, as teams scramble to qualify for a spot on the
starting line tomorrow morning. Electrek FSGP 2025 is shaping up to be
one of the event’s most attended ever, thanks to a strong showing of
first-time and returning schools. But that also means new and unproven
vehicles on the track.
</p>
<p>
Today, I walked through a couple of bays and talked with a few of the
teams able to spare a minute; almost all of them were debuting
completely new cars that were years in the making. Building a solar car
is no easy feat. It’s not just the engineering and technical know-how
that’s often a hurdle for them; it’s more often monetary. However, one
of the things that makes this event so special is the camaraderie and
collaboration that happen behind the scenes.

<p>
Every year, it seems like there’s a new headline about the world’s
lightest electric bike. Each year, engineers manage to shave a few more
grams off of an exotically designed frame built with even more exotic
materials. And each year, the continuously lower weight is balanced by
continuously higher prices – often exorbitantly high. But now Dahon has
bucked that trend, offering us an incredibly lightweight electric bike
at a price that normal e-bike riders can afford. Meet the Dahon
K-Feather.

sent me down one of the most enjoyable rabbit holes I’ve explored in
quite some time.

DJI may be best known for drones, but the company just launched a
ground-based product that has the power to keep all your tech airborne –
and then some. The new
<a href="https://www.dji.com/products/power-series?site=brandsite&amp;from=nav">DJI
Power 2000</a> is a 2,048 Wh portable power station with a 3,000 W
output that quietly muscles its way into the heavy-hitter end of the
mobile power world. I’ve been testing it for the past week in a wide
range of scenarios – from charging up my electric tractor in the field
to power my family’s chest freezer. And of course smaller jobs like
charging up my phone and drone are easy jobs too. From my experience so
far, I can tell you that this thing delivers.

House bill, and still kills a slew of tax credits to help working
families become more energy efficient, improve US air quality, and boost
US manufacturing – instead channeling that money to wealthy elites,

e-bikes are finding real-world tactical applications – from silent
scouting missions to quick-response patrols – proving that the humble

<p>
Police across the US are cracking down on illegal use of out-of-class
e-bikes or non-street-legal electric motorcycles used on public roads.
It used to be that if you sped off on an illegal electric dirt bike or
mini bike after a traffic stop in California, there was a good chance
you’d get away. Most police departments don’t want to engage in
high-speed chases over these types of violations, especially if the
rider isn’t wearing a helmet or is weaving through dense traffic. And
since these types of bikes almost never have license plates, merely
outrunning or outmaneuvering a police cruiser through some bushes or
over a sidewalk was usually enough to evade justice. But lately, a new
kind of chase is happening – from above.

delivered its 5,000th electric semi truck … and they’re just getting
started.

TQ, the German force behind some of the lightest and quietest e-bike
motors on the market, just took a leap forward – <em>again</em>. Barely
weeks after debuting the lightweight HPR60 e-bike drive system, the
company has introduced the HPR40, now claiming the title of the lightest
and most efficient mid-drive motor in the world.
