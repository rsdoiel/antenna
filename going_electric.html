<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/honda/">American Honda</a> shared a
business outlook for 2025 during a recent briefing with the media. In
terms of electrification, the next 12 months for Honda will be much of
the same: facelifting tried-and-true ICE models like the CR-V and
Passport. However, there was one exciting piece of news from Honda on
the BEV front—the automaker has confirmed it will begin US production of
an Acura RSX EV.

EVs need a place to charge, even in the most remote areas. Subaru helped
install a public EV charging station in the “remotest place in the
world.” To test it out, the

In 2024, the world sold 3.5 million more EVs than it did in the previous
year, according to a new report by Rho Motion. This increase is
<em>larger</em> than the 3.2 million increase in EV sales from the
previous year – meaning that EV sales aren’t just up, but that the rate
of growth is itself increasing.
</p>
<p>
However, an entire year of false political, media and industry
statements might have had you thinking otherwise.
