<p>The $7,500 US federal EV tax credit is no more, having expired yesterday, a deadline which was set when republicans voted to <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/22/house-republicans-vote-to-send-us-ev-jobs-to-china-give-trillions-to-us-elites/">reverse climate progress and channel trillions of dollars from everyday Americans to wealthy elites</a>.</p>
<p>However, that’s not the end of subsidies for the American auto industry, as most gas cars continue to benefit from over $20k in subsidy for each vehicle over the course of their lifetime.</p>

<p>The PNY Ponie P2, an electric cargo motorcycle built for serious utility work, has just completed a wide-ranging pilot program, and the results are in. After being put through the paces in everything from food delivery to mail service and even ambulance duty, the Ponie P2 seems more than ready for the demands of the modern urban fleet.</p>
<p>Now the bike is undergoing even further refinement ahead of a larger expected rollout.</p>

<p>Daimler Truck AG CEO Karin Rådström hopped on LinkedIn today and dropped some absolutely wild pro-hydrogen talking points, using words like “emotional” and “inspiring” while making some pretty heady claims about the viability and economics of hydrogen. The rant is doubly embarrassing for another reason: <strong>the company’s hydrogen trucks are more than 100 <em>million</em> miles behind Volvo’s electric semis</strong>.</p>

Could this be our first glimpse at Rivian’s version of home energy management technology, including vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities?</p>

The company’s remaining assets were recently auctioned off for a total of around $170,000 – barely a speed bump against the nearly $7 million it owed to creditors.</p>

<p>Robot mowers have come a long way in recent years, but some still fall into two categories: the ones that need perimeter wires, and the ones that get scared of tall grass. The UBHOME M10 falls into neither, and after testing it over the past few weeks, I’ve come away genuinely impressed. It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced it will spend $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” the US coal industry, claiming it will boost energy production and help rural communities. Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised “beautiful, clean coal” as “essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p>Government researchers in the US and abroad believe we could help decarbonize and electrify the transportation sector with hardy, fast-growing plants that collect the metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries in their roots, then harvest those metals later with a process that’s cleaner and cheaper than traditional mineral mining.</p>

<p>The latest automotive numbers in Europe were released for August, confirming that Tesla’s decline is continuing, but it has slowed down, with the company “only” being down 22%.</p>
