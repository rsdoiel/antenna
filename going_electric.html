<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs. A rebate is a
powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like
negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest
rate objections so you can drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
If you’re dealing with any of the above, pay attention: these EVs could
get you behind the wheel of a new electric ride sooner than you think!

What’s better than an

Spacruzzi made waves (but limited wake) last year with an electric hot
tub boat model showcased around the US, including Lake Tahoe and even on
the Chicago River. For 2025, Spacruzzi has introduced a sleeker and more
refined version of its electric boat and opened its waiting list for a
limited number of builds scheduled for this year.
