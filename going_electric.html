Last month, Tesla unveiled the new Model
Y<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/01/23/tesla-launches-new-model-y-in-north-america-and-europe/">
in the United States</a>, featuring an all-new light bar design, a
redesigned rear-end, and a refreshed interior. It’s currently available
as a “launch series” model, starting at $59,990 – with deliveries
beginning in March.
</p>
<p>
The new Model Y is currently in
<a href="https://x.com/tesla_na/status/1886500433356550213">19 Tesla
showrooms</a> across North America, 17 in the United States and 2 in
Canada. I took the opportunity to head to the one in New York’s
Meatpacking District to get some up close photos, as well as share some
thoughts.

<p>
Last month I was fortunate enough to take a trip to China and visit
seven different micromobility companies, each of which invited me to
tour their factory, test out their new products, or attend their major
events. The trip is something of a sequel to the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/15/i-went-to-china-to-witness-the-secrets-of-micromobility-factories-heres-whats-coming/">first
Chinese factory tour trip</a> I took last year (with the
<a href="https://youtu.be/xEixW-H1_WE?si=5i0vR0qSUuZSBbQH">documentary</a>
of that trip racking up millions of views on YouTube).

In the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing detailed articles and videos about
each of the following visits. But in the meantime, consider this as a
preview of what’s to come.

As we enter the second month of 2025,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/honda/">Honda</a> is inching closer
to commencing BEV production at its long-standing US plant in
Marysville, Ohio, later this year. That $1 billion transition will begin
with the assembly of the recently confirmed Acura RSX EV, followed by
the first two models in Honda’s 0 Series lineup. Before that happened,
however, Honda gave an exclusive tour of its new EV Hub in Ohio, which
included an innovative new approach to modular vehicle assembly, massive
mega press machines, and an insightful look into the positive impact
Honda has established amongst the residents of The Buckeye State. You
can view my whole tour expeirience in the video below.

With the flick of a Sharpie
marker,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-china-mexico-canada-inflation-753a09d56cd318f2eb1d2efe3c43b7d4">
new tariffs</a> on goods imported from Canada, Mexico, and China were
imposed this morning and will take effect next week on February 4, 2025.
According to President Trump, the tariffs are intended “to protect
Americans”, though nearly all economists agree that they will result in
higher prices for consumer goods and increased inflation, devaluing the
US dollar.
</p>
<p>
The Trump Administration’s new 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and
Mexico are larger than the 10% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, but
the latter will have the biggest impact on the electric bicycle industry
in the US.
