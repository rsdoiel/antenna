<p>GM has scrapped plans to build $55 million hydrogen fuel cell factory in Detroit, triggering a tsunami of headlines about the General’s future plans for hydrogen. The reality? GM isn’t scaling back its hydrogen efforts. It’s thinking bigger.</p>

<p>Baltimore County, Maryland, just brought its first large-scale ground-mounted solar farm online, and it sits on what used to be the Parkton Landfill. The 213-acre site, once a symbol of waste, is now generating clean power that will cut costs, slash emissions, and turn an underused piece of land into a long-term energy asset.</p>

<p>Tesla is now selling its stripped-down, “more affordable” vehicle, the Model Y Standard, in Europe, just <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/tesla-releases-new-more-affordable-model-y-3-2k-more-than-last-week/">three days after releasing it in the US</a>. Its US release was widely panned as the massive number of missing features outweighed the relatively small price cut. But the new European release has fewer cut features <em>and</em> a larger price differential, making the calculus much different in a territory where Tesla sales have fallen rapidly.</p>

<p>But that price is actually <em>more expensive</em> than the cars were a week ago in the US, due to the expiration of the US federal EV tax credit which Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed for.</p>

<p>Zero Motorcycles, one of the world’s leading Western electric motorcycle manufacturers, announced that it is relocating its global headquarters from California to the Netherlands. The move marks a major strategic shift for the company as it doubles down on Europe, which has long been its largest market for electric two-wheelers, despite the American company’s US base of operations.</p>

<p>Solar and wind power aren’t just keeping up with global electricity demand anymore – they’re pulling ahead. According to a <a href="https://ember-energy.org/page-not-found/">new analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember, solar and wind combined outpaced global electricity demand growth in the first half of 2025. That shift led to a drop in both coal and gas generation compared to the same period last year. For the first time ever, renewables generated more power than coal globally.</p>

<p>We’ve got good news – EV lease prices look much better than expected, despite the end of the federal tax credit and 25% import tariff being in place. Prices have crept up compared to last month, but several automakers have stepped in to fill the gap by covering the $7,500 credit themselves or adding extra incentives – and the price of one EV even <em>dropped</em>. Here are October’s top EV lease deals, spotted by our friends at CarsDirect.</p>

That means that, in many states, you can now get “antique” or “historic” plates for a modern hybrid.</p>
<p>If that sounds appealing to you, here’s what it might cost to keep that OG Prius on the road for many more years to come.</p>

That’s because China is changing the rules.</p>

      <h1>Review: UBHOME M10 Robotic Mower is the easiest way to mow your lawn</h1>

<p>Robot mowers have come a long way in recent years, but some still fall into two categories: the ones that need perimeter wires, and the ones that get scared of tall grass. The UBHOME M10 falls into neither, and after testing it over the past few weeks, I’ve come away genuinely impressed. It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

<p>Nothing makes the clueless anti-EV hysterics happier than the tired claim that electric vehicles “just move the emissions somewhere else,” but one landscaper is making those guys sound even dumber than usual by replacing his diesel excavator with an all-electric unit from JCB that runs <em>entirely</em> on solar.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced it will spend $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” the US coal industry, claiming it will boost energy production and help rural communities. Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised “beautiful, clean coal” as “essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>
