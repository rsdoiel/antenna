Velotric, one of several prolific e-bike makers in the US electric bike
market, has announced the launch of its first-ever electric trike. The
new <a href="https://velotricebike.pxf.io/LK1E4j">Velotric Trike</a>r
sees the brand enter the rapidly heating e-trike industry, with a
growing number of seniors and other riders flocking to the more stable
e-bike format. But unlike many e-trike makers, Velotric has ratcheted up
the performance and the technology in their e-trike, giving us more of
just about everything.

Electric bikes are booming in popularity in just about every demographic

getting back on a bicycle for the first time in years, electric bikes
are becoming ubiquitous. But as speeds and power levels have increased,
Connecticut is responding with new laws.

Tesla is again teasing the new Roadster, which is now five years late,
as “the last driver’s car” before self-driving takes over.

<p>
The chicken or the egg. Is Tesla delaying the Roadster to match the
development of self-driving technology, or is it delaying the
development of self-driving technology to match the delayed release of
the Roadster?

Electric bikes are booming in popularity across the US, and cities are
starting to take notice. From famous programs like those in Denver to
smaller initiatives around the country, local governments are rolling
out rebate and incentive programs to make e-bikes more affordable,
especially for lower-income residents. The goal? Get more people out of
cars and onto two wheels.

Musk.

But despite planning two generations ahead, the company still doesn’t
have a solution to bring the promised full autonomy to hardware that
it’s been promising that capability to since 2016.

Canadian startup Beachman has just unveiled its latest electric
two-wheeler, the ’64, a vintage-styled electric motorcycle that looks
like it rolled straight out of the 1960s. With throwback café racer
design and a respectable top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), it’s a slick
little ride with a curious twist: it calls itself an e-bike.
</p>
<p>
[Update: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the
Beachman ’64 E-bike did not have pedals. In fact, it does have small
cranks and pedals folded up against the bike, mounted to the swingarm.]
