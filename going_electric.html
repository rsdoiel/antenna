For years
<a href="https://electrek.co/2018/09/07/japanese-tilting-electric-cargo-tricycle/">I’ve
followed progress</a> of the STREEK cargo trike, a fascinating-looking
electric cargo carrier from Japan. This utility-focused electric bike
relies on a tilting-frame design with a rare tadpole trike setup, which
is a more stable design that we rarely see in the electric trike market.
And now this uniquely Japanese creation is making the long journey
across the Pacific to the US, thanks in part of to

can no longer use his car.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of November 2024. We’re in peak sale season with
holiday shopping cranking up, and that means there are likely some even
better sales than we’re used to! And just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has already
been a year of impressive e-bike sales. So check out the awesome e-bikes
below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.
