The e-bike market in the US, and the broader micromobility industry

impose sweeping new tariffs on global imports, only to swiftly reverse
course just days later.
</p>
<p>
The abrupt policy changes have sent shockwaves through the micromobility
industry, leaving companies scrambling to adjust and consumers uncertain
about future pricing.

The US wind industry installed just 5.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2024 – the
lowest level in a decade, according to Wood Mackenzie’s new US Wind
Energy Monitor
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/industry/power-and-renewables/us-wind-energy-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.
Installations are expected to rebound in 2025, but the real concern lies
in US wind’s sharply downgraded 5-year outlook. As for the reason behind
that bleak forecast, we’ll give you one guess as to why, and it starts
with a T.

designed to be a compact, fun-sized ride for urban zipping and off-road

tow a kayak… to the beach… and then paddled that kayak with the e-bike

Sometimes bad ideas turn into great stories. This was one of those.

As “extreme” weather events become more commonplace, the demand for
reliable and portable energy continues to rise. In response to that
growing demand for dependable off-grid power, Volvo has developed the
new PU500 Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) designed to take
electrical power when it’s needed most.

that could cause a seismic shift in the global EV space and provide a
cleaner, greener future for India’s capital.
