tested the world’s most affordable electric golf cart: The Kandi
Mini</h2>

</div>
<p>
The Kandi Mini is unlike any other golf cart in the world in two key
ways. First, it’s less than half the price of your average golf cart.
And second, it’s a lot more compact than your average golf cart.
</p>
<p>
Both of these are key features for folks who have become golf cart
curious but don’t have the space in their garages or their wallets for a
new full-size cart.
