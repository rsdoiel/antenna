Tesla’s third instance of its ‘one-time-only’ Full Self-Driving transfer
scheme is in full effect now, allowing owners to transfer their purchase
of FSD capability to a new vehicle on purchases before August 31.

<p>
Tesla is using this as an opportunity to boost demand, rather than doing
the right thing by letting owners transfer the still-unreleased software
they spent thousands of dollars on.
