Lucid’s electric minivan can outsprint the Chevy Corvette Z06, and it

That’s if it ever launches. After it was already delayed, the
Lamborghini EV may not even be fully electric when it arrives.

<p>
Let’s get one thing out of the way early: single-speed electric bikes
aren’t perfect. If you live in the hills of San Francisco, they’re not
going to be your best friend. But if you’re like the majority of city
riders around the world – rolling through mostly flat neighborhoods,
navigating stop-and-go traffic, and hopping on and off curbs – then a
single-speed e-bike might just be the smartest and most underrated
option on the market.

Nexamp just pulled off something that could speed up clean energy

Boston-based solar developer just finished building three new solar

Renewables continued to dominate fossil fuels on price in 2024,
according to a
<a href="https://www.irena.org/Publications/2025/Jun/Renewable-Power-Generation-Costs-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new
report</a> from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The
big takeaway: Clean energy is the cheapest power around – by a wide
margin. So it’s pretty bad business that the biggest grid upgrade
project in US history just got kneecapped by Trump’s Department of
Energy to stop the “green scam.”

Dodge Neon deserves a comeback – and Stellantis could do it
tomorrow</h2>

<p>
The first all-new compact Mopar since the malaise-era K-Car, the Dodge
Neon was a revelation. Its fun, approachable face, its “Hi.” marketing
campaign, all of it was pitch-perfect for the uncertain times it was
launched into. Now, a generation later, Stellantis faces similarly
uncertain times – and a new Neon could go a long way towards helping the
old Chrysler Co. do what it does best: <strong>come back from the
brink</strong>.
</p>
<p>
If they wanted to, Stellantis could make it happen tomorrow.

Which brings us to the question: is this how we might see more Chinese

Scooter here, back with another electric mobility review. This time, I
tested out the
<a href="https://tidd.ly/46MAdV2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meepo
Go</a> electric skateboard. It is a sturdy, smooth deck designed for
riders of all sizes, with some unique tech I had never encountered
before. Be sure to check out my full video review below.

Can-Am Origin test ride: a rugged, high-tech return to two-wheel

<p>
The 2025 Can-Am Origin electric motorcycle is the pinnacle of fun, just
as long as your good time can fit into 69 miles of riding between
charges. What it lacks in long-distance range, it makes up for in
versatility, rugged style, and instant torque that’s ready for the road
and trail. Each twist of the throttle delivers immediate electric
propulsion. Its futuristic design and stealthy motor hum make the Origin
a dual-sport machine pulled from tomorrow that wonderfully celebrates
Can-Am’s two-wheeled heritage of decades past. I also spent some time on
the road with the more approachable Can-Am Pulse, a standard street bike
with a slight range advantage.

There’s something about the joy of playing around with Tonka trucks in a
sandbox that men really never grow out of. Sure, we grow up, get real
jobs, and most of us never take the toys back out of the dusty,
long-forgotten box. But the <em>desire</em> is still there. And if you
gave just about any former boy and reluctant adult the option, I’d be
dollars to donuts they’d gladly play around with the life-sized version
of their childhood construction toys in a heartbeat.
</p>
<p>
If that sounds like fun, then I’ve got good news for you. I just found
the coolest grown-up toy construction vehicle and it’s unlike anything
you’ve seen before. I’d argue that it slots in nicely as a perfect
example of some of the coolest and weirdest things you can find from
China’s endless supply of innovative EVs. So, for your viewing pleasure,
I submit this week’s

<p>
Italian electric motorcycle manufacturer Energica has just been handed a
lifeline. Previously owned by US company Ideanomics, the famed
motorcycle brand entered insolvency
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/16/major-electric-motorcycle-maker-energica-files-for-bankruptcy/">late
last year after a period of financial duress prevented it from
making</a> payroll and continuing production.
</p>
<p>
Now, a new group of investors from Singapore has stepped in to take
over.
