No, Porsche’s electric sports cars will not have fake EV shifting. “Why
should we make something worse?”
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/porsche/">Porsche</a> development
driver Lars Kern said. After testing Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 N, Porsche
believes there’s “no reason to simulate what has been in the past.”
