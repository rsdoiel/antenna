Can <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/lucid-motors/">Lucid</a> (LCID)
make 1 million EVs a year? CEO Peter Rawlinson said this is his vision,
and Lucid has ambitious plans to achieve it. After launching its first
electric SUV, the Gravity, Lucid will enter the mass market with its
midsize platform starting at around $50,000. Rawlinson said this is
“finally when we compete directly with Tesla,” but the EV maker has even
bigger plans to drive growth.

Japanese eVTOL developer
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/skydrive/">SkyDrive</a> shared two
exciting developments today. First, it has officially received a G-1
certification in Japan for its flagship “SKYDRIVE” eVTOL. This is a step
forward for the aviation startup working toward commercial eVTOL
operations in Japan and the US. In the meantime, SkyDrive also shared
its first real-world images of its aircraft, including one in the air.

<p>
It’s a tale as old as time. A man takes a ride on an electric motorcycle
and thinks to himself, “This is great, but you know what it’s missing?
The ability to morph into an electric snowmobile, too.”
</p>
<p>
Ok, perhaps it’s not the most common thought among us. But that hasn’t
stopped it from apparently becoming a reality thanks to Canadian
designer Steven Foster, who has now spent three years developing and
testing that exact concept to bring the Avvenire Combat e-motorcycle to
life.
