With a 236-foot wingspan that’s wider than a 747’s, the battery and
solar-powered Skydweller Aero drone is pushing the boundaries of
aviation. And, after back-to-back three-day flights without recharging,
it’s pushing the boundaries of energy efficiency, too, begging the
question: <strong>is perpetual aviation really here</strong>?

technology. The idea is to combine the advantages of internally geared
hubs with Bafang’s own hub motors to create an internally geared hub
motor.

EV charging is everywhere now, and it’s reliable, accessible, and
affordable. There are thousands of public chargers already out there –
and, in some places,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/21/california-50-percent-more-ev-chargers-than-gas-nozzles/">you’ll
find more plugs than pumps</a>. But if you don’t drive electric, you’d
never know it. That’s because gas stations don’t just exist, they
announce themselves with giant, illuminated signs that can be seen for
miles, while EV chargers tend to just sort of sit, nestled away in the
back of the parking lot.
</p>
<p>
That’s why the new EV Totem from Blink Charging is such a big deal. It
doesn’t just charge your car, it stands tall, lights up, and tells the
world: <strong>electric fuel is here, now</strong>.

JackRabbit, the San Diego-based micromobility company that made its name

amount of ambition without the bulk of a full-size e-bike or the
limitations of a scooter.

Tesla is slowly starting to advertise, and it has now done a rare ad on

Portable power stations long ago became one of those “why didn’t I get
one sooner?” products for me. Whether it’s keeping a fridge running
during a power outage, charging cameras in the field, or juicing up my
growing fleet of electric bikes, a good battery box is worth its weight
in gold. Sometimes I use them simply when I’m too lazy to go find an
extension cord! I recently got my hands on the new
<a href="https://www.dabbsson.com/products/2000l-portable-power-station">Dabbsson
2000L</a> power station, and after putting it through its paces, I think
this one’s going to earn a permanent spot in my gear lineup – and yes,
probably a spot in my e-bike charging garage!
