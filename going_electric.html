Tesla has been spotted testing its Cybercab robotaxi on roads at

can test the steering-wheel-less vehicle.

Last year at the EICMA Milan Milan Motorcycle
Show,<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/08/cargo-electric-motorcycle-pny-ponie/">
I stumbled across </a>a novel-looking vehicle known as the
<a href="https://www.ridepny.com/">Ponie P2</a>. Described as a van
replacement, the 60 mph (100 km/h) electric motorbike sports a huge
cargo case below the seat and was prepping for production at the time.
Now a year later, I caught up with the company at the same show to learn
how the Ponie P2 is now preparing to hit the road.
