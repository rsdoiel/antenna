The Trump administration wants to pull the plug on ENERGY STAR, the
federal program behind those familiar blue labels on energy-efficient
appliances, homes, and buildings. Launched in 1992, ENERGY STAR has

greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>
To dig into what this means for everyday Americans, we spoke with
Rebecca Foster, CEO of clean energy nonprofit Vermont Energy Investment
Corporation (VEIC), which has spent decades working to make homes,
schools, and businesses more energy efficient.

hurdles that have cut down so many ambitious mobility startups lately.

Toyota USA has refreshed its RAV4 for 2026, and, in a significant step
forward for efficiency, Toyota has axed the non-hybrid version of the
vehicle. The RAV4 will now only be available in HEV and PHEV versions
starting in the 2026 model year.
</p>
<p>
However, in an act of greenwashing reminiscent of many things Toyota has
done before, it’s confusingly calling its vehicles “100% electrified” –
despite that every single RAV4 includes a gas engine.

The $5 billion Empire Wind is back in business. The Trump
administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has lifted its
stop-work order for Empire Wind, a major offshore wind project off the
coast of New York led by Empire Offshore Wind LLC, a subsidiary of
Equinor. Construction is now allowed to resume.

And, yes – it really should have been the new Chrysler 300. Meet the DS
