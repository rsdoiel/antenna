Will the <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/range-rover/">Range Rover
Electric</a> be “the most capable electric luxury SUV” to hit the

This year’s shopping holidays are set to reveal some of the best
electric bicycle and e-scooter sales we’ve ever seen thanks to the
perfect storm of overstocked models, meeting year-end sales targets, and
good ol’ relentless competition. The e-bike industry has been hammered
for a couple of years now, and while that has put many companies in a
squeeze, the upside is consumers are getting some of the best deals
we’ve ever seen. With countless electric bicycle brands operating now in
the US and even more models to choose from, here’s some help separating
the wheat from the chaff.

As one of the few people who can claim to now be in my third decade of
living an electric bike-focused life, I’ve tested a lot of gear over the
years. Between the gear I buy for myself and the piles of random stuff
that shows up on my doorstep from overzealous PR agencies, I’ve gone
through a wide range of tools, locks, clothing, accessories, and more.
Here are my favorites of all the stuff I’ve tested this year.

Early last month,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/10/tesla-unveils-cybercab-electric-robotaxi/">Tesla
unveiled the Cybercab</a>, a 2 door vehicle with no steering wheel and
pedals, fully reliant on the future of autonomy. Since then, they’ve put
the vehicle on display at a couple Tesla showrooms, most recently at the
Meatpacking District location in New York City. I went to go take a
look, and I have a few thoughts.

According to a leaked letter circulating on social media yesterday, BYD
has asked its suppliers to accept price cuts in the coming year – a
major signal that the Chinese EV maker is gearing up to intensify the
price war in China even further, all while pushing harder into Europe
and other markets.

This year’s shopping holidays are set to reveal some of the best
electric bicycle and e-scooter sales we’ve ever seen thanks to the
perfect storm of overstocked models, meeting year-end sales targets, and
good ol’ relentless competition. The e-bike industry has been hammered
for a couple of years now, and while that has put many companies in a
squeeze, the upside is consumers are getting some of the best deals
we’ve ever seen. With countless electric bicycle brands operating now in
the US and even more models to choose from, here’s some help separating
the wheat from the chaff.

Although President-Elect Donald Trump is promising to end the $7,500 EV
tax credit, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> is
confident it will continue growing in the US. The company just opened a
massive new $7.6 billion manufacturing plant in Georgia as it looks to

significantly spruce up the EX90’s older sibling, the PHEV XC90 – the
brand’s most popular vehicle since its debut and the de facto family car
for hordes of Americans and Europeans. This month, Volvo invited
<em>Electrek</em> to test-drive the revised XC90 on its home turf and
experience its new and improved “electrified” functionality. Here’s how
it went.
