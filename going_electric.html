<p>
Paris’ bike-share system,
<a href="https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en">Vélib</a> has long been
considered one of the shining success stories of urban micromobility.
With a massive fleet of over 20,000 pedal and electric-assist bicycles
around Paris, the service has helped millions of residents and tourists
get around the City of Light without needing a car or scooter. But
lately, a growing problem is threatening to knock the wheels off this
urban mobility marvel: theft and joyriding.

<p>
The Honda Ruckus has earned cult status thanks to its minimalist
styling, exposed frame, and seemingly endless customizability. The
scooter, also known in international markets as the Honda Zoomer, has
spent years being seen as a blank canvas for scooter tuners, urban
commuters, and anyone who just wanted something simple, small, and kind
of weird to zip around town. A few years ago, Honda finally answered the
call for an updated version by announcing and producing the “Zoomer e:”,
which was an electric version of the Honda Ruckus. So where is it?
