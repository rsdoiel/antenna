Of course, the first thing that stands out about the new Leaf is its design. Nissan says it’s adopting a subcompact crossover style instead of the hatchback style in the previous two iterations.</p>



<p>I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for the quirky design of the first-generation Leaf, but the design was polarizing to say the least. The second-generation Leaf was more widely palatable, but bland and almost forgettable. The design team at Nissan stepped up hugely with the 2026 Leaf, channeling looks from the Nissan Ariya, which shares the same EV platform.</p>

I also get about a dozen emails a day from people asking what type of e-bike would be best for them, so it’d probably be more efficient to simply tell everyone the correct answer all at once. </p>



<p>If you ask me, there’s one e-bike style that will work for more people than just about anything else on the market. I’m not saying it’s the perfect choice for <em>everyone</em> – there’s no such thing – but if you’re staring at a dozen browser tabs of e-bike specs and feeling decision fatigue, this is the style I’d point you toward.</p>

I’ve tried a<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/21/viribus-trio-plus-electric-tricycle-review-the-lowest-cost-e-trike-id-still-ride/"> Viribus e-trike before</a>, and while it got the job done, it was a fairly basic and entry level model. But this time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the SC5 delivers more than just the basics.</p>



<p>I’ve been testing it now for various errands, grocery runs, and casual rides around the neighborhood. After logging some decent miles on it, here’s what I’ve learned about this three-wheeled e-bike, and why I think it’s a strong contender in the growing world of electric trikes.</p>

The new concept, called the BMW Motorrad Vision CE, is the company’s latest attempt to answer a question that’s been bouncing around for a while now: <em>What should an electric BMW motorcycle actually look like?</em></p>

That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>



<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of September 2025. Summer may be in the rear view mirror (nooo!), but this is still a great chance to grab some end-of-summer sales on a new electric bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

Now golf carts are the new public enemy number one in suburbia, at least if you ask the growing number of online groups where residents complain about these small electric vehicles “clogging” their streets. </p>



<p>But beyond the hand-wringing, golf carts and their more sophisticated cousins known as Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs) or Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs), are quietly becoming a popular alternative to cars for short trips around US cities and suburbs.</p>

But, unfortunately for American fans of Swedish metal, it’s not available here. Yet.</p>

At the same time, it seems like Stellantis is giving up on its highly-publicized AutoDrive Level 3 ADAS.</p>



<p><strong>Is this the beginning of the end of self-driving hype</strong>?</p>

      <h1>Shift Key Classic: How to Hook Up More Power Plants</h1>

(date: 2025-08-27)
      <p>
      <p><em>Shift Key is off for Labor Day, so we’re re-running this classic episode.</em></p><br><p>For the first time in 15 years, American electricity demand is rising again as new data centers, factories, and electric vehicles come online. The easiest option is to meet that new demand with new supply — new power plants. But in many parts of the country, it can take years to hook up new wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The reason why is a clogged and broken system called the interconnection queue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, which first aired in 2024, Jesse and Rob speak with two experts about how to understand — and how to fix — what is perhaps the biggest obstacle to deploying more renewables on the U.S. power grid.&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/people/tyler-norris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tyler Norris</a> is a doctoral student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment.
