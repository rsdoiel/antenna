XPeng Motors celebrated its annual Tech Day event in China earlier
today, which was renamed “AI Day” for good reason. The topic of
artificial intelligence dominated the Chinese mobility company’s
incoming technologies, which were abundant. We got updates on a new
in-house AI computing chip, a new
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xpeng/">Xpeng</a> platform to
support Level 4 autonomous robotaxis, flying cars, and eVTOLs, a new
humanoid robot called “Iron,” complete with an existential launch video,
and a surprising adoption of combustion-powered extenders that deliver
up to 970 miles of additional range.

A few years back, General Motors had to recall 142,000 Bolts in a major
fiasco due to fire risk. This time around, however, just a small number
of Bolts are being recalled, only 107. But the risk of fire is deemed
high – according to the NHTSA – if these vehicles are charged to full or
nearly full capacity.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed

testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of

to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of November 2024. We’re in peak sale season with
holiday shopping cranking up, and that means there are likely some even
better sales than we’re used to! And just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has already

below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.
