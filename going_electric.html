<h2 id="how-wildfires-destroyed-californias-insurance-market">How
Wildfires Destroyed California’s Insurance Market</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: Shift Key</p>
<p>
The Los Angeles wildfires have killed at least 27 people, destroyed more
than 17,000 structures, and displaced tens of thousands. In the next few
months, the billions of costs in damage to homes and property will
ripple through the state’s insurance market — and likely cause its
insurer of last resort to run out of money.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<a href="https://real-estate.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/benkeys/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benjamin
Keys</a> has studied how natural disasters, rising sea levels, and
increasing exposure to risk have driven up insurance costs nationwide.
He is a professor of real estate and finance at the University of
Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, and one of the country’s top experts on
climate change, home values, and insurance markets.
</p>
<br>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with Keys about
how California broke its insurance market, why insurance costs are
rising nationwide, and how homeowners, home buyers, and communities can
protect themselves. They dive into President Donald Trump’s dizzying
first day of executive actions and how they’ll affect the future of
energy development. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding
executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy
systems engineering at Princeton University.
