A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows just how dramatic the surge is. Electricity use in the region has tripled since 2000, and it’s expected to jump another 50% by 2035. That’s like adding the current combined electricity demand of Germany and Spain.</p>

And, sure – the taller driving position offers road presence, but when it comes to real-world utility, a proper long-roof wagon can hang with the best of them while offering Teutonic driving dynamics no SUV can match. All it would take to spark a wagon revival in the US is one sleek, solidly built, and <em>affordable</em> entry from a mainstream brand. And VW already has the perfect candidate waiting in the wings. Meet the Škoda Vision O (Passat badges not included).</p>

That “waterproof” pannier that started leaking after the first storm, the multitool that rounded out on its tenth bolt, the lights that faded faster than a dying AA battery. I’ve had my share of disappointments. But over the past decade of nearly daily riding, there’s a small handful of e-bike tools and accessories that have stood the test of time. I’m talking <em>half a decade or more</em> of constant use, surviving rain, dust, sun, and the occasional crash, and still going strong.</p>

Of course, the first thing that stands out about the new Leaf is its design. Nissan says it’s adopting a subcompact crossover style instead of the hatchback style in the previous two iterations.</p>



<p>I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for the quirky design of the first-generation Leaf, but the design was polarizing to say the least. The second-generation Leaf was more widely palatable, but bland and almost forgettable. The design team at Nissan stepped up hugely with the 2026 Leaf, channeling looks from the Nissan Ariya, which shares the same EV platform.</p>

I also get about a dozen emails a day from people asking what type of e-bike would be best for them, so it’d probably be more efficient to simply tell everyone the correct answer all at once. </p>



<p>If you ask me, there’s one e-bike style that will work for more people than just about anything else on the market. I’m not saying it’s the perfect choice for <em>everyone</em> – there’s no such thing – but if you’re staring at a dozen browser tabs of e-bike specs and feeling decision fatigue, this is the style I’d point you toward.</p>

That lack of accessible grid power makes it tough to fully decarbonize some construction sites, no matter how committed they are to reducing emissions. That’s where Hitachi Energy’s new HyFlex hydrogen generator comes in, offering off-grid charging <em>without</em> the harmful emissions of diesel.</p>
