true culprit behind Helene’s record-breaking strength is <em>us</em>
– the climate change that we humans caused by burning fossil fuels.

It’s an exciting week for grid resiliency-lovers in California, as
Governor Gavin Newsom followed up his earlier
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/26/new-ca-smart-grid-law-will-help-solar-and-fix-the-grid-by-simply-replacing-wires/">smart
grid law</a> and signed another law this week which may require
bidirectional charging on EVs in the future – though the law has no hard
timeline attached, so it may be a while before we see this happen.
