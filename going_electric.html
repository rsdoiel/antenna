There’s a new “world’s fastest EV” in town, and it’s a familiar name if
you follow <em>Electrek</em>. Japanese car manufacturing and engineering
firm <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/aspark/">Aspark</a> has
developed an upgraded version of its ultrafast (and ultra-expensive) OWL
hypercar with the help of Italy’s Manifattura Automobili Torino and took
the EV to the track where it clocked in at a top speed of nearly 439
km/h.

The ‘One simple trick’ trope has long become a running joke among
journalists, usually signifying the beginning of a scam. But every once
in a while, it’s exactly right. Such is the case with how Paris was able
to transform its air quality and thus the quality of life in the city in
the run-up to the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics.

<p>
So what was the trick? Kicking out cars.

most affordable models available today… as long as you find somewhere
that has CHAdeMO charging.

In what could likely be a sign of continued overstocking issues in the
North American electric bike industry, Ride1Up has drastically reduced
the price of its much acclaimed Prodigy electric bike. Now
<a href="https://bit.ly/Ride1up-Prodigy">just $1,495</a>, this marks the
lowest-priced Brose-powered electric bicycle ever from a major retailer.

<p>
There’s a good chance that when you were a teenager, getting your
driver’s license was seen as a rite of passage, and you probably
couldn’t wait for the freedom promised by that shiny new card in your
credit card-less wallet. At least, that’s unless you’re a teenager
today, and then the picture might not be so cut and dry. Unlike when I
got my learner’s permit 20 years ago, today’s teenagers have already
been enjoying a new form of affordable and effective transportation
freedom: electric bikes.
</p>
<p>
And it’s changing the way they view getting a driver’s license.
