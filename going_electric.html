<p>A new sighting of Tesla Cybercab prototypes in Austin, Texas, is fueling the ongoing debate about the vehicle’s design. While the prototypes were spotted with steering wheels, which is standard for testing, it raises questions about whether Tesla can actually stick to its plan to launch the vehicle without them given the state of its self-driving effort.</p>

<p>We talk a lot here at <em>Electrek</em> about the exponential growth of electric vehicles and the massive strain that puts on the battery supply chain. Literally, the majority of that demand and production comes from China.</p>
<p>But there is a massive difference between <em>processing</em> materials and actually having them in the ground.</p>
<p>A new image from a gigantic materials mining and recycling company in China, gives us a sobering look at the reality of their domestic reserves. The data suggests that China’s own supply of the most critical battery metals isn’t just running low; in some cases, it’s already gone.</p>

<p>A major link in Tesla’s 4680 battery supply chain has just snapped. South Korean battery material supplier L&amp;F Co. announced today that the value of its massive supply deal with Tesla has been slashed by over 99%, signaling a catastrophic drop in demand for the automaker’s in-house battery cells.</p>
<p>This is arguably the strongest evidence yet that Tesla’s 4680 program, and the vehicle that relies on it, the Cybertruck, is in serious trouble.</p>

<p>A lot of mainstream auto media coverage right now is pushing the idea that some EVs are “dying.” What we’re <em>really</em> seeing is a wave of end-of-cycle, first-generation vehicles making way for their next-gen replacements — and, historically, that’s when buyers get the best deals.</p>
<p>If that’s what <em>you’re</em> after, these are the EVs you should be looking at right now.</p>

<p>In what appears to be significant strategic pivot, Samsung SDI will begin supplying prismatic lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems under a fresh US contract worth more than 2 trillion won (~$1.35 billion). The move will see the company shift US EV battery production lines to ESS output ahead of 2027.</p>

<p>Now, Elon Musk has confirmed the final step in that divorce, rebranding the company’s goal from “Sustainable Abundance” to simply “Amazing Abundance.”</p>

<p>If you’ve covered e-bikes as long as I have, you’ll know two things about them: they’re an awesome way to get around, and the basic technology behind an e-bike motor hasn’t radically changed in a long, long time. However, based on the new e-bike motor design I just tested from a powertrain technology company called <a href="https://www.chargebike.co/">CHARGE</a>, the e-bike world may be about to get turned on its head. These guys discovered that nearly any e-bike hub motor can perform regenerative braking, but everyone has just been building them wrong this whole time.</p>

<p>I’ve ridden a lot of electric scooters over the years, and many of them blur together. Plenty are fast. Many are powerful. Some look aggressive. But only a handful manage to combine all of that with a ride that actually feels polished and confidence-inspiring. After spending real time riding the Apollo Phantom 2.0 (52V version), it’s clear this scooter sits firmly in that top tier.</p>

<p>The Dahon K-Feather is one of those electric bikes that makes a lot more sense the longer you ride it. On paper, it looks rather low-power and low-capacity compared to the spec sheets for most e-bikes. In practice, especially when used exactly as intended, it turns out to be a remarkably well-executed urban commuter that still feels refreshingly different years after its release.</p>

<p>The Delaware Supreme Court made its ruling in the fight over Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package from 2018, reversing the Court of Chancery’s decision and reinstating the pay package.</p>
<p>But the Court still penalized Musk $1 plus attorney’s fees due to the award’s unfairness.</p>

<p>Dutch leasing company Mistergreen, known for its “Tesla only” fleet and bold bets on a future of autonomous robotaxis, is reportedly facing bankruptcy.

<p>BYD is making a significant move to boost confidence in its electric vehicles in Europe. The Chinese automaker has announced a major update to its warranty terms, extending the battery coverage to 8 years or 250,000 km (approx. 155,000 miles), whichever comes first.</p>
<p>This new policy significantly outpaces the industry standard and puts pressure on competitors like Tesla and Volkswagen to follow suit.</p>

That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of December 2025. This could be your last chance to get some crazy good deals as companies try to clear shelves before the end of the year. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>It’s finally happening. After years of promises, missed timelines dating back to the “Autonomy Day” in 2019, and endless iterations of “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), a Tesla vehicle has been spotted driving on public roads in Austin without anyone in the driver’s seat or a safety monitor in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Robotaxi testing has officially commenced. This is undeniably a step forward for the company’s autonomy ambitions.</p>
<p>But it is also a terrifying leap of faith, given the complete lack of safety data proving the system is ready for this.</p>

<p>Turning cheap daytime solar into electricity you can actually use at night just got a lot cheaper. A <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/how-cheap-is-battery-storage/">new analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember shows that utility-scale battery storage costs have fallen to $65 per megawatt-hour (MWh) as of October 2025 in markets outside China and the US. At that level, pairing solar with batteries to deliver power when it’s needed is now economically viable.</p>

      <h1>Tesla ranks dead last in used car reliability study, but there’s a catch</h1>

<p>Consumer Reports is out with its latest study on used car reliability, and the headlines are already circulating: Tesla has landed at the very bottom of the list.</p>
<p>The study, which examines 5-to-10-year-old vehicles, ranks Tesla 26th out of 26 brands, placing it behind Chrysler, Dodge, and even Jeep – brands known for decades for their reliability issues.</p>
<p>While critics will undoubtedly use this as ammo to attack the brand, a closer look at the data reveals a much more nuanced picture, one that highlights just how recent an automaker Tesla still is.</p>

<p>In a story I could have titled “Even a broken clock is right twice a day,” US President Donald Trump made headlines this week by expressing his love of small, affordable vehicles – and encouraging automakers to start building more compacts domestically. That’s great stuff, but there are dozens of some great compact cars out there already.</p>
<p>Here’s my list of compact EVs that need to find their way to America ASAP.</p>

<p>Portable power stations have gotten impressively capable over the last few years, but every now and then you run into one that genuinely changes your sense of scale. That’s the feeling I had while testing the VTOMAN FlashSpeed Pro 3600, a 3.1 kWh, 3.6 kW monster of a power box that – despite weighing as much as a medium-sized meteor – rolls around surprisingly easily thanks to its integrated handle and wheels. And at its current price <a href="https://vtoman.com/products/vtoman-flashspeed-pro-3600-power-station?variant=45055026888873">of $1,399</a>, it’s one of the better deals I’ve seen in the high-capacity power station space.</p>

<p>It follows a wave of other automakers gaining access over the last year as the industry transitions to NACS (North American Charging Standard), Tesla’s proprietary connector that has now become the standard.</p>

      <h1>Elon Musk delusionally claims Waymo ‘never had a chance’ against Tesla</h1>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) this morning to dismiss Waymo’s progress in autonomous driving, claiming that the Alphabet-owned company “never really had a chance against Tesla” and that this will be “obvious in hindsight.”</p>
<p>The comment came as a direct response to a discussion about Waymo’s newly released safety data—a level of transparency that Tesla has yet to match.</p>

      <h1>Bo M2 review: The premium e-scooter unlike anything I’ve ever tested before</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)

<p>I’ve ridden <a href="http://electrek.co/guides/electric-scooter">a lot of electric scooters</a> over the years. Most blur together – two wheels, a deck, a motor, and a series of compromises. But every now and then, one stands out. And after a couple of weeks riding the Bo M2 electric scooter, I can confidently say: this one’s different.</p>
<p>The Bo M2 is not your average e-scooter. It’s a purpose-built, premium commuter with some seriously refined features – and a price tag to match. At $2,490, it’s firmly in high-end territory. But for riders who want a serious transportation tool, not a toy, there’s a lot to like here.</p>

      <h1>Why the Rest of the World Is Buying Chinese EVs</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>China’s electric vehicle industry, it’s now well understood, is churning out cars that rival or exceed the best products coming out of the West. Chinese EVs are cheaper, cooler, more innovative, and have better range. And now they’re surging into car markets around the world — markets where consumers are hungry for clean, affordable transportation.</p>
<p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob talks to Ilaria Mazzocco about <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-ev-shift-role-china-and-industrial-policy-emerging-economies">her new report</a> on how six countries around the world are dealing with the rise of Chinese EVs. Why do countries welcome Chinese-made EVs, and why do countries resist them? How do domestic carmakers act when Chinese EVs come to town? And are climate concerns still driving uptake?</p>
<p>Mazzocco is the deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University. Jesse is off this week.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will remove “safety monitors” from the passenger seats of Tesla’s Robotaxi vehicles in “about three weeks,” which would mean we’d see completely driverless Teslas in the Austin area potentially by the end of the year – if that timeline sticks.</p>
