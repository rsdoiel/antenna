<p>When it comes to electric bikes, the <a href="https://alnk.to/hsyfubF">JackRabbit OG2 Pro</a> barely qualifies as one – and that’s kind of the point. With no pedals, a seat barely higher than your hip, and a wheelbase shorter than some skateboards, this is less a traditional e-bike and more a bite-sized personal transporter that feels like a cross between a folding bike and an electric scooter.</p>
<p>But after riding it around for the past few months, I can confidently say: it’s an absolute blast. It’s more powerful than it looks, it’s easier to transport than you’d expect, and it’s simply more fun than you can imagine. It’s the small-format whip that I wish had existed years ago.</p>

<p>Elon Musk recently walked back his impossible extremely ambitious robotaxi goals, shifting from a target of reaching “ <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/23/elon-musk-with-straight-face-tesla-robotaxi-will-cover-half-us-population-end-year/">half the U.S. population by the end of 2025</a>” to a more “modest” goal of launching in “eight to 10 U.S. metro areas” within the next two months.</p>
<p>Now, in a development that should surprise no one, a new report suggests that even this heavily scaled-back timeline is facing significant obstacles.</p>

<p>It’s about 10% of the 63,619 Cybertrucks in existence, which we know about due to <em>another</em> recall from last week (though that one was fixed by a software update) – showing that the Cybertruck is selling a lot more poorly than initial estimates would have suggested.</p>

<p>According to new data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), electricity demand across the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) hit record highs in the first nine months of 2025. ERCOT, which supplies power to about 90% of the state, saw demand jump 5% year-over-year to 372 terawatt hours (TWh) – a 23% increase since 2021. No other major US grid has grown faster over the past year.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of hand-wringing lately about electric bikes. You’ve probably seen the headlines – the ones about sidewalk conflicts, teenagers riding too fast, or policymakers scrambling to define what qualifies as an e-bike in the first place. And sure, it’s healthy for cities to ask questions about how new forms of mobility fit into the urban fabric. But let’s not lose sight of something much more important: e-bikes are still one of the best things to happen to cities in decades.</p>
<p>I’d argue they’re the best thing for urban life since flush toilets.</p>

On today’s episode of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElectrekDaily">Quick Charge</a></em>, I suggest GM’s Mary Barra should replace him, and explore some of the compelling EV deals out there looking to take a bite out of Elon’s market share.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of October 2025. Fall sales are really kicking off and that means big savings for e-bike riders! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>The new new Super E cultivator from Tilmor isn’t just another pice of compact farm equipment – it’s a purpose-built electric cultivator that trades loud diesel clatter for quiet confidence and precision control. Made in the USA and ready to work, it’s proof that electric farming may be closer (and more practical) than you think.</p>

<p>A lot of EV charging apps can tell you where the plugs are, and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chargeway/">Chargeway</a> tells you that, too — <em>along with everything else</em>. From your EV’s state of charge, to the best charging strategy to get you from point A to point B, to real-time charger availability, and more, it’s simply the best tool I’ve found to help new EV drivers understand how an EV fits into their busy lives today. And as of today, in fact, Chargeway is adding another benefit to its platform: <strong>real-time kWh pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>The untimely demise of the $7,500 Federal EV tax credit has set off a price war in the EV space, with affordable new models from some corners, massive discounts and price cuts from others, and even some price hikes from unexpected brands. Now, even Mazda is getting into the mix, and it’s slashing the price of its XC-70 plug-in crossover.</p>

<p>Tesla is now selling its stripped-down, “more affordable” vehicle, the Model Y Standard, in Europe, just <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/tesla-releases-new-more-affordable-model-y-3-2k-more-than-last-week/">three days after releasing it in the US</a>. Its US release was widely panned as the massive number of missing features outweighed the relatively small price cut. But the new European release has fewer cut features <em>and</em> a larger price differential, making the calculus much different in a territory where Tesla sales have fallen rapidly.</p>
