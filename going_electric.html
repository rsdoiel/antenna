<p>It’s running these ads not to boost its <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/">falling sales</a>, but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-tsla-releases-q3-2025-financing-results-earnings-decline-despite-record-revenue/">earnings drop precipitously</a> under his direction.</p>

<p>Electricity demand is surging in Texas, and solar, wind, and battery storage are meeting it.</p>
<p>According to new data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), electricity demand across the Texas grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) hit record highs in the first nine months of 2025. ERCOT, which supplies power to about 90% of the state, saw demand jump 5% year-over-year to 372 terawatt hours (TWh) – a 23% increase since 2021. No other major US grid has grown faster over the past year.</p>

But let’s not lose sight of something much more important: e-bikes are still one of the best things to happen to cities in decades.</p>
<p>I’d argue they’re the best thing for urban life since flush toilets.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of October 2025. Fall sales are really kicking off and that means big savings for e-bike riders! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>The current EV era is ripe with revered classic car designs and iconic nameplates that are being reborn as battery-powered rides – <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/08/renault-5-snatches-model-y-sales-crown-as-france-crosses-15-ev-adoption/">and the success of cars the Renault 5 proves it can be a winning formula</a>. Today, I’m suggesting another 1980s classic that deserves a modern electric update: <strong>the Buick Grand National</strong>.</p>

<p>Tesla, a company that prides itself on not advertising, is in the midst of a serious marketing effort. In doing so it’s exploiting employees, attacking shareholders, and retaining outside strategy firms to help it advertise.</p>
<p>It’s running these ads not to boost its <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/">falling sales</a>, but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as earnings drop precipitously under his direction.</p>

<p>A lot of EV charging apps can tell you where the plugs are, and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/chargeway/">Chargeway</a> tells you that, too — <em>along with everything else</em>. From your EV’s state of charge, to the best charging strategy to get you from point A to point B, to real-time charger availability, and more, it’s simply the best tool I’ve found to help new EV drivers understand how an EV fits into their busy lives today. And as of today, in fact, Chargeway is adding another benefit to its platform: <strong>real-time kWh pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>Utilities, state governments, and private developers are racing to roll out faster, more powerful EV chargers. At the same time, automakers and tech giants across the globe are pouring billions into R&amp;D to develop batteries that can take ever-higher levels of power. But what if there’s a better, easier, cheaper, and <em>more effective</em> way to cut emissions?</p>
<p>What if, instead of faster chargers, we pushed for SLOWER gas pumps?</p>

<p>Tesla is now selling its stripped-down, “more affordable” vehicle, the Model Y Standard, in Europe, just <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/tesla-releases-new-more-affordable-model-y-3-2k-more-than-last-week/">three days after releasing it in the US</a>. Its US release was widely panned as the massive number of missing features outweighed the relatively small price cut. But the new European release has fewer cut features <em>and</em> a larger price differential, making the calculus much different in a territory where Tesla sales have fallen rapidly.</p>

<p>Solar and wind power aren’t just keeping up with global electricity demand anymore – they’re pulling ahead. According to a <a href="https://ember-energy.org/page-not-found/">new analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember, solar and wind combined outpaced global electricity demand growth in the first half of 2025. That shift led to a drop in both coal and gas generation compared to the same period last year. For the first time ever, renewables generated more power than coal globally.</p>

<p>We’ve got good news – EV lease prices look much better than expected, despite the end of the federal tax credit and 25% import tariff being in place. Prices have crept up compared to last month, but several automakers have stepped in to fill the gap by covering the $7,500 credit themselves or adding extra incentives – and the price of one EV even <em>dropped</em>. Here are October’s top EV lease deals, spotted by our friends at CarsDirect.</p>
