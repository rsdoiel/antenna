<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ford/">Ford</a> (F) reported Q2 2025
earnings on Wednesday, beating top and bottom line expectations. Despite
the revenue growth, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ford/">Ford</a>

Tesla is about to tumble off a familiar policy cliff. The $7,500 federal
tax credit that juiced demand for electric vehicles in the US, Tesla’s
last large, healthy market, after September 30, 2025. Tesla has been
here before, but the ground underneath the company looks very different
today.
</p>
<p>
Let’s dig into what happened last time, what’s changing now, and why
Elon Musk is already warning shareholders of “tough quarters ahead.”

with the Infinite Machine P1: A futuristic electric scooter that’s built

<a href="https://www.infinitemachine.com/p1?lp_location=wf">Infinite
Machine’s</a> debut product looks like it was carved out of a steel
block in a dystopian future. The design is bold, brutalist, and
unapologetically industrial. As a first product offering, it does a
great job of catching people’s attention. Whether you like the look or
not is up to you, but there is no denying that it is a head-turner. So
when I had the opportunity to get some hands-on time with it, I knew I
had to jump at that chance.
</p>
<p>
And after just an hour of riding the P1 around NYC, I can confidently
say this thing turns heads for good reason. It’s fast, futuristic, and
fun. This is just a first impression, but I’ll have it for an extended
period soon — so stay tuned for a deeper dive and complete review. For
now, let’s talk about my experience.

Cadillac is throwing a whole bunch more of the HPs and performance into

The best-selling vehicle in China, EV or gas-powered, in the first half
of 2025 was not the BYD Seagull or
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tesla-model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a>.
It was actually the Geely Xingyuan. AKA the “Star Wish,” Geely’s EV
topped the sales charts with prices starting under $10,000 in China.

Chinese media outlet Dongchedi conducted another massive test of driver
assist systems, testing many of the same cars as it did in the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/26/a-chinese-real-world-self-driving-test-36-cars-216-crashes-with-tesla-on-top/">highway
test we we reported on this weekend</a>.
</p>
<p>
This time, the test covers various urban driving scenarios, where much
more human carnage is possible due to the presence of vulnerable road
users like pedestrians and two-wheelers. And given how poorly the cars
did on the last test, you can guess how they might have done on this one
– although, once again, Tesla fared rather well, but was not without
issue.

the Roadster?

cool-looking electric motorcycle wants to pretend to be an e-bike

Canadian startup Beachman has just unveiled its latest electric
two-wheeler, the ’64, a vintage-styled electric motorcycle that looks
like it rolled straight out of the 1960s. With throwback café racer
design and a respectable top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), it’s a slick
little ride with a curious twist: it calls itself an e-bike.
</p>
<p>
[Update: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the
Beachman ’64 E-bike did not have pedals. In fact, it does have small
cranks and pedals folded up against the bike, mounted to the swingarm.]
