If you live in or develop apartments in California, there’s fresh cash
on the table to get Level 2 EV chargers installed. The Communities in
Charge project, backed by the California Energy Commission’s Clean
Transportation Program, just opened a new funding lane worth up to $56.5
million for multi-family housing and nearby spots where tenants can plug
in.

Rivian just posted its more recent letter to shareholders outlining its
progress and financial numbers from Q2 2025. We have already covered
much of <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/">Rivian’s</a> Q2

understanding of where the American automaker stands on production
numbers, revenue, and gross profit through half the year as it continues
to gear up for the start of R2 production next year.

A couple years ago, my wife started a new job as an elementary school
principal. It was an exciting milestone, but it also came with a
stressful commute. The school isn’t far – just a few kilometers across
the city – but during rush hour, taking the bus often meant sitting in
gridlock for 45 minutes. Not exactly the best way to start or end a
workday.
</p>
<p>
So we got her an electric bike.

Car brands like Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla have built up solid

still prize safety, is that there’s an all-electric Hyundai for under
$40K that scores top marks on the IIHS’ toughest new safety tests.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of July 2025. Summer is peaking, making this a great
chance to enjoy this riding season with a fun and efficient electric
bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could
become your next electric bike.
