The flying car is no longer a Sci-Fi fantasy. It’s becoming a reality,
and it could be here by the end of the year. Alef Aeronautics is now
building pre-production models of what it’s calling “the first true

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/flying-car/">flying car</a> uses
less energy than a Tesla or any other EV.

<p>
Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in the middle of a nasty
break-up and it didn’t take long for Musk’s companies, including Tesla,
to be thrown in the middle of it like kids in a divorce.
</p>
<p>
We will focus on the real impact on Tesla’s business here, rather than
its stock price, which is largely driven by sentiment, similar to a meme
stock.

Tesla has announced that it now offers interest-free loans on the
Cybertruck until the end of the month. The move is the equivalent of a
roughly $10,000 discount and shows that Tesla has reached a new level of
desperation in trying to sell the Cybertruck.

<p>
Tesla stock dropped over 50 points today, primarily in response to a
very public feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and convicted felon Donald
Trump.

But, as we
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/12/call-it-like-it-is-tslas-rise-is-not-due-to-performance-but-hope-for-corruption/">pointed
out in November</a>, this doesn’t have anything to do with company
performance, and rather only reflects a change in the market’s
expectation of potential benefit to Tesla from government corruption.

New York City officials are preparing to roll out a new speed limit for

all e-bikes, as part of a broader crackdown aimed at addressing rising
concerns about sidewalk safety, delivery rider behavior, and
e-bike-related crashes.

last week, but a fresh investment from Mullen Automotive and a new/old

<p>
I’m super bullish on electric trikes. I may not be a silver-haired fox
(yet), but even at a ripe 36 years old, I can appreciate the advantages
of a comfortable e-trike just as much as their larger market of mature
riders.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think age or accessibility should be the only factors when
considering the advantages of three wheels over two, and the MeetOne
Tour dual motor electric trike is a great example of that. Sure, it’d be
awesome for folks who can no longer feel the same confidence or
stability from two-wheelers. But it’s also just a blast to ride at any
age and ability level!

When Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly denied a report that Tesla had
canceled its work on the $25,000 “Model 2” despite the project ending
weeks prior, Tesla executives were “alarmed” by Musk’s public lie,
according to a new report by Reuters.

<p>
The electric motorcycle market is a small and highly interconnected one,
with a limited amount of suppliers and an even smaller number of actual
honest-to-goodness motorcycle manufacturers. While Covid-era progress
led to a series of highly-funded
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/20/ryvid-anthem-electric-motorcycle-unveil/">rapid
advancements</a> and
<a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/18/damon-unveils-two-new-electric-motorcycles-based-on-novel-hyperdrive-platform/">flashy
announcements</a>, the last few years have been hard on the industry as
funding and excitement have both dwindled, resulting in a smaller number
of big releases. So it makes sense that people would jump at news that
Honda is now producing its first electric motorcycle and that you can
already buy it. The only problem is that none of that is true – finally
some <em>real</em> fake news.
