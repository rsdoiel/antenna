Driving the 2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz was an experience that left a
lasting impression. This all-electric micro bus seamlessly fuses the
charm of the classic VW minibus with today’s EV tech, creating something
truly unique on the road. Everywhere I drove this ID Buzz, it stopped
people in their tracks and everyone had questions about it. Having the
chance to be one of the first to drive this iconic vehicle was very
exciting and I have some thoughts.
