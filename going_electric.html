<p>
As perhaps one of the most prolific electric bike reviewers on the
internet, I spend a lot of time riding city streets and have
occasionally wondered if this is the way I’ll go out one day. Yesterday,
I nearly had the answer to that question as a police cruiser almost
smeared me across three lanes of traffic.
</p>
<p>
It happened to occur while I was in the middle of filming a review of a
Velotric Breeze 1 electric bike. With the rare opportunity of catching a
moment like that on camera, it turned into a chance for me to take a
second look at what I did right as well as what I might have done wrong
to wind up in that situation.
</p>
<p>
And why keep that kind of analysis to myself? Come along with me while I
Monday morning quarterback myself.

While the current majority in DC shared intentions to likely kill the
existing
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-federal-tax-credit/">$7,500
federal EV tax credit,</a> some language in a (very fluid) proposal
suggests that not all automakers will be immediately affected. For
example, Rivian is an American automaker whose sales are young enough
that US consumers might still be able to take advantage of the tax
credit, and that could also include the upcoming R2 EVs.

While the current majority in DC shared intentions to likely kill the
existing
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-federal-tax-credit/">$7,500
federal EV tax credit,</a> some language in a (very fluid) proposal
suggests that not all automakers will be immediately affected. For
example, Rivian is an American automaker whose sales are young enough
that US consumers might still be able to take advantage of the tax
credit, and that could also include the upcoming R2 EVs.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of May 2025. Summer is so close we can feel it, making
this a great chance to start the riding season off with a fun and
efficient electric bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any
one of which could become your next electric bike.
