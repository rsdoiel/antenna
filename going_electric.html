Republicans have used the Congressional Review Act to roll back
California’s states’ right to protect its own residents’ lungs and
pocketbooks with better pollution rules.
</p>
<p>
But here’s the thing: Congress doesn’t <em>have</em> that authority
because that’s not how the Congressional Review Act works, so the
republican party is once again just letting everyone know that it wants
to poison Americans and raise their fuel costs, no matter the legality
of doing so.

There was a time when having your own plane was a pretty clear indicator
that you were part of that upper crust of society. If it was a pricey
and rare electric plane, then all the more. But those days are numbered
as the influx of compact and powerful electric powertrain components
collides with good old American entrepreneurism to create a number of
interesting new electric flying machines that now make it cheaper to fly
yourself than drive.

testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of June 2025. Summer is staring us in the face, making
this a great chance to start the riding season off with a fun and
efficient electric bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any
one of which could become your next electric bike.

EVs got a little more affordable in May, and Tesla’s price drop had a
lot to do with that. According to new data from Kelley Blue Book, the

down from $59,123 in April. Year-over-year, that’s a 1.1% drop.

Hyundai saw the storm coming and has been preparing for an industry
upheaval. With a stockpile of rare EV minerals,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> claims it has
“far more wiggle room” as the industry braces for supply chain
disruptions stemming from China’s new export restrictions.

VanMoof, the Dutch makers of slick-looking electric bikes that proved
too high-tech to succeed just two years ago, is back with two new models
that help return the company to (some of) its former glory. The new
VanMoof S6 and S6 Open (i.e. low-step) are here. But will riders return?

While I enjoy covering news and reviews related to new e-bikes and other
micromobility vehicles, my favorite part of working in this industry is
actually getting to go deeper behind the scenes, often pulling back the
curtain to see what lies behind some of the biggest companies in the
market. Most only show us their polished front-facing image, but there’s
so much more to the story than that. From the people who build and
operate these brands to the way new ideas work their way through the
design pipeline and into bike boxes headed to our doorsteps, there are
countless untold stories just waiting to be revealed. And that’s exactly
what I set out to do when I visited the headquarters of
<a href="https://eunorau-ebike.com/">EUNORAU</a>, one of the most
prolific e-bike makers in the world.

The US solar industry is still booming, but looming policy threats could

According to the new US Solar Market Insight report from SEIA and Wood

Kia’s first electric van is finally here. Although it <span
style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">appears to be from the
future, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia-pv5/" target="_blank">the
PV5</a> boasts impressive interior space, a long driving range,
adva</span>nced technology, and a range of features. It’s offered in a
variety of different configurations, including an upcoming refrigerated
truck, a light camper, and a luxury “Prime” model. With orders opening
in Korea this week, we are learning a little more about what to expect
