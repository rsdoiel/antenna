California and 16 other states have sued the government for illegally
withholding $5 billion in funds that Congress earmarked for EV charging,
calling the action “another trump gift to China.”

At 51 years old, I’m trying not to ruin myself at skate parks
anymore<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">, but I still enjoy
riding a long skateboard on short trips or just out and about on a sunny
day. Last month, I got to try out the <span

Flow ($699</a>), </span>a lovely wood-grained, electric longboard with a
kicktail. But its standout feature is more about what it isn’t. Let me
explain.</span>

Republicans in Congress have voted to use the Congressional Review Act
to roll back California’s states’ right to protect its own residents’
lungs and pocketbooks with better pollution rules.
</p>
<p>
But here’s the thing: Congress doesn’t <em>have</em> that authority
because that’s not how the Congressional Review Act works, so the
republican party is once again just letting everyone know that it wants
to poison Americans and raise their fuel costs, no matter the legality
of doing so.

The Trump administration wants to pull the plug on ENERGY STAR, the
federal program behind those familiar blue labels on energy-efficient
appliances, homes, and buildings. Launched in 1992, ENERGY STAR has
saved Americans more than $500 billion in energy costs while slashing
greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
To dig into what this means for everyday Americans, we spoke with
Rebecca Foster, CEO of clean energy nonprofit Vermont Energy Investment
Corporation (VEIC), which has spent decades working to make homes,
schools, and businesses more energy efficient.

In a surprising and disappointing turn for fans of innovative
micromobility, Podbike, the Norwegian maker of the sleek, fully enclosed

significant attention and accolades for its standout design and
functionality, the company ultimately couldn’t overcome the financial
hurdles that have cut down so many ambitious mobility startups lately.

Toyota USA has refreshed its RAV4 for 2026, and, in a significant step
forward for efficiency, Toyota has axed the non-hybrid version of the
vehicle. The RAV4 will now only be available in conventional hybrid and
PHEV versions starting in the 2026 model year.
</p>

However, in an act of greenwashing reminiscent of many things Toyota has
done before, it’s confusingly calling its vehicles “100% electrified” –
despite that every single RAV4 includes a gas engine.

Honda said it will reduce its planned EV investments by $21 billion,
claiming that it’s doing so due to a slowdown in EV sales which isn’t
actually happening.
</p>
<p>
Instead, it will focus on hybrids, which get 100% of their energy from
fossil fuels, and which cause climate change and poison the air you
breathe.
