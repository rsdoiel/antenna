<p>If you want to ditch snow blowing and shoveling forever, Yarbo’s got just the solution. The robotics company that took home a 2023 CES Innovation Award is redefining what it means to have a “smart yard” in all four seasons. Yarbo’s autonomous outdoor robots use advanced sensors, cameras, and algorithms to do the heavy lifting – literally. From snow blowing to mowing to leaf clearing, these machines handle tough jobs with precision, safety, and zero supervision.</p>
<p>Yarbo’s innovative “1+N” design is centered around one core unit (“1”) that can be expanded with multiple modular attachments (“N”) to meet a variety of yard care needs. This design allows users to save space and cost by owning a single core robot instead of multiple separate machines. Customize functionality by adding modules such as Lawn Mower, Snow Blower, Plow Blade, Cutting Disc, and more. Easily upgrade or adapt to different seasons and tasks without replacing the entire system.</p>
<p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/1N.gif?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>And right now, you can snag a <strong>fantastic discount</strong> <strong>of up to $1,200 at Yarbo’s biggest sale of the year</strong>. Check out the <strong><a href="https://go.yarbo.com/zzeiC">official Black Friday launch deals</a></strong> below – you won’t want to miss these!</p>

<p>Pedego, one of the most recognizable names from the early days of American e-bike brands, is entering a new era. The company has been acquired by the “US-based” ownership group behind the Asian e-bike brand Urtopia, a relatively young, tech-forward electric bike brand known for carbon fiber e-bikes with built-in connectivity and smart features. The result is a newly formed New Pedego Holdings Inc., which both companies are pitching not as a takeover, but as a reboot designed to modernize Pedego and rebuild the dealer network that once made it a retail powerhouse.</p>

<p>The General Motors EV1 has a vital place in electric vehicle history. It mainly served to show two things:</p>

<li>Show a viable path for battery-electric vehicles back in the 1990s.</li>

<p>GM only leased the EV1, never sold any, and prevented almost anyone from keeping them when it killed the vehicle program.</p>
<p>The automaker ended up crushing the vast majority of them. While a few empty shells exist in museums, they are strictly prohibited from ever driving again.

<p>Well, the last domino has fallen, but the most interesting thing is that the NACS connector, which stands for North American Charging Standard, is going global – beyond North America.</p>

<p>Kandi has become fairly well known in the US for its electric golf carts and work-focused UTVs, but the company has teamed up with Lowe’s and the NFL on something more playful: the Kandi 4P electric golf cart. Sold through Lowe’s with official NFL team liveries, this four-seat neighborhood cruiser is aimed less at the fairway and more at cul-de-sacs, grocery runs, and game-day tailgates. I spent time with a Miami Dolphins–themed 4P in South Florida to see what it can really do.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/iea/">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) says renewables and AI are reshaping the world’s energy future, and that transformation is happening faster than anyone expected. In its new “World Energy Outlook 2025,” the IEA warns that energy security risks now stretch far beyond oil and gas. Critical minerals essential to clean tech, defense, and AI have become the new fault lines in global supply chains. The IEA also states that energy has become a central focus of geopolitical power struggles, making it one of the defining economic and security challenges of our time.</p>

<p>Solid-state batteries have long been the holy grail of electric vehicles, especially for light EVs like electric bicycles that are usually charged indoors. They hold major safety benefits over traditional lithium-ion batteries, plus offer better energy density, making it possible to use smaller batteries or simply fit more capacity in the same-sized battery pack.</p>

<p>NIU is back at EICMA 2025 (the Milan Motorcycle Show) with a fresh lineup of electric two-wheelers that push the boundaries of performance, design, and smart connectivity. The Chinese electric mobility giant, already known for selling over 5 million electric scooters and motorcycles across over 50 countries, used the Milan show to unveil its 2026 product range – and it’s clear NIU is looking to hang on to that leader status.</p>

<p>When it comes to battery longevity, it appears that brand matters. A recent study published by Germany’s ADAC revealed tangible, real-world differences in how the high-voltage batteries in PHEVs age across manufacturers. The results: Mercedes’ batteries came out on top, Mitsubishi trailed behind.</p>

<p>At EICMA 2025, Honda finally pulled back the curtain on its first full-size electric motorcycle with the first-ever public unveiling of the <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/16/honda-unveils-new-wn7-electric-motorcycle-but-with-a-huge-dealbreaker/">Honda WN7</a>. As someone who’s followed the electric motorcycle space for over a decade, I’ve been waiting a long time to see Big Red bring some serious voltage – and it looks like that moment has arrived.</p>

<p>Just as we saw with EVs in September, there’s a broad, documented surge in demand for home solar tied to the 30% Federal tax credit expiring December 31st. And, while it’s still not too late for many Americans to go solar, contractors in North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona say their 2025 calendars are jammed.</p>

<p>While NIU showed off a full lineup of production-ready electric scooters and motorcycles at EICMA this year, one of the most eye-catching was something you <em>can’t</em> buy just yet – but will definitely want to. It’s called the Concept 06, and it’s NIU’s boldest vision yet for the future of electric two-wheelers.</p>

<p>While the typical buyers of the flagship Mercedes-Maybach EQS 680 may not <em>have</em> to ask what one costs, they do need to know what number to write on the check – and if they happen to be asking this month, that number will be $50,000 LOWER than before.</p>

      <h1>VMAX VX2 Hub 33 MPH e-scooter review: Fast yet surprisingly stable – and affordable!</h1>

<p>When it comes to high-performance electric scooters that are still reasonably priced, it’s a tricky balance. Most affordable scooters are underpowered and wobbly. The powerful ones often creep into motorcycle territory – with prices to match. But the <a href="https://vmax-escooter.us/products/vx2-hub-vmax-electric-scooter">VMAX VX2 Hub</a> might just be the sweet spot we’ve been waiting for. It’s fast, it’s strong, it’s well-built, and most importantly – it actually feels good to ride.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into what makes this scooter stand out.</p>

<p>Tesla’s EV registrations in the UK, its biggest market in Europe, took a dramatic hit in October 2025 — just 511 units — marking one of the brand’s weakest showings in recent memory. That’s a steep drop from 971 in October 2024 and 2,677 in October 2023. The tone of the market is shifting.</p>
<p>Maybe Tesla’s CEO stoking a civil war in England isn’t helping the automaker’s demand in the important market.</p>

<p>British electric motorcycle maker Maeving just launched its first two-seater model in the US: the Maeving RM2. This marks the company’s latest move to bring its classically styled electric motorcycles across the Atlantic – this time with a roomier seat, extra utility, and the same swappable battery design that helped put Maeving on the map.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of November 2025. For basically the entire month, e-bike companies are running their extended Black Friday (more like Black November) deals, and that means big savings for e-bike riders! While many companies are likely to toss in an extra lock or headlight or T-shirt on Black Friday/Cyber Monday itself, the real deals are pretty much already up and happening all month long. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>When it comes to electric bikes, the <a href="https://alnk.to/hsyfubF">JackRabbit OG2 Pro</a> barely qualifies as one – and that’s kind of the point. With no pedals, a seat barely higher than your hip, and a wheelbase shorter than some skateboards, this is less a traditional e-bike and more a bite-sized personal transporter that feels like a cross between a folding bike and an electric scooter.</p>
<p>But after riding it around for the past few months, I can confidently say: it’s an absolute blast. It’s more powerful than it looks, it’s easier to transport than you’d expect, and it’s simply more fun than you can imagine. It’s the small-format whip that I wish had existed years ago.</p>

<p>Elon Musk recently walked back his impossible extremely ambitious robotaxi goals, shifting from a target of reaching “ <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/23/elon-musk-with-straight-face-tesla-robotaxi-will-cover-half-us-population-end-year/">half the U.S. population by the end of 2025</a>” to a more “modest” goal of launching in “eight to 10 U.S. metro areas” within the next two months.</p>
<p>Now, in a development that should surprise no one, a new report suggests that even this heavily scaled-back timeline is facing significant obstacles.</p>

<p>Latin America’s electric mobility transition is kicking into high gear, and Brazil-based Vammo is emerging as its battery-swapping champion. The São Paulo startup just closed a $45 million Series B funding round led by Ecosystem Integrity Fund, with backing from Qualcomm Ventures, 2150, Construct Capital, and others – positioning the company to expand across the region’s megacities and build what it calls the backbone of Latin America’s clean transport network.</p>

<p>It’s about 10% of the 63,619 Cybertrucks in existence, which we know about due to <em>another</em> recall from last week (though that one was fixed by a software update) – showing that the Cybertruck is selling a lot more poorly than initial estimates would have suggested.</p>
