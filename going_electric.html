<p>
In the past week, TSLA stock has increased by about one-third of its
previous value. But this increase has had nothing to do with company
performance, or even due to external factors like consumer tastes or
beneficial changes in EV policy. Rather, the week’s speculation has come
out of a simple desire to see Tesla become the benefit of government
corruption.

Now a year later, I caught up with the company at the same show to learn
how the Ponie P2 is now preparing to hit the road.
