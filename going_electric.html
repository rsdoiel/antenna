In what could likely be a sign of continued overstocking issues in the
North American electric bike industry, Ride1Up has drastically reduced
the price of its much acclaimed Prodigy electric bike. Now
<a href="https://bit.ly/Ride1up-Prodigy">just $1,495</a>, this marks the
lowest-priced Brose-powered electric bicycle ever from a major retailer.

As US consumers await deliveries of the first Emeya hyper GTs from

segment with impressive charging times.
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/lotus/">Lotus</a> is hailing the
Emeya’s charging speeds from 10-80% as a record breaker, but whether
that’s true or not, there’s no denying the new hyper GT can be as fast
at the charger as it is on the road.

more American teenagers are rejecting driver’s licenses in favor of

<p>
There’s a good chance that when you were a teenager, getting your
driver’s license was seen as a rite of passage, and you probably
couldn’t wait for the freedom promised by that shiny new card in your
credit card-less wallet. At least, that’s unless you’re a teenager
today, and then the picture might not be so cut and dry. Unlike when I
got my learner’s permit 20 years ago, today’s teenagers have already
been enjoying a new form of affordable and effective transportation
freedom: electric bikes.
</p>
<p>
And it’s changing the way they view getting a driver’s license.
