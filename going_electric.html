      <h1>Tesla ranks dead last in used car reliability study, but there’s a catch</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)

<p>Consumer Reports is out with its latest study on used car reliability, and the headlines are already circulating: Tesla has landed at the very bottom of the list.</p>
<p>The study, which examines 5-to-10-year-old vehicles, ranks Tesla 26th out of 26 brands, placing it behind Chrysler, Dodge, and even Jeep – brands known for decades for their reliability issues.</p>
<p>While critics will undoubtedly use this as ammo to attack the brand, a closer look at the data reveals a much more nuanced picture, one that highlights just how recent an automaker Tesla still is.</p>

<p>In a story I could have titled “Even a broken clock is right twice a day,” US President Donald Trump made headlines this week by expressing his love of small, affordable vehicles – and encouraging automakers to start building more compacts domestically. That’s great stuff, but there are dozens of some great compact cars out there already.</p>
<p>Here’s my list of compact EVs that need to find their way to America ASAP.</p>

<p>Portable power stations have gotten impressively capable over the last few years, but every now and then you run into one that genuinely changes your sense of scale. That’s the feeling I had while testing the VTOMAN FlashSpeed Pro 3600, a 3.1 kWh, 3.6 kW monster of a power box that – despite weighing as much as a medium-sized meteor – rolls around surprisingly easily thanks to its integrated handle and wheels. And at its current price <a href="https://vtoman.com/products/vtoman-flashspeed-pro-3600-power-station?variant=45055026888873">of $1,399</a>, it’s one of the better deals I’ve seen in the high-capacity power station space.</p>

<p>BMW is the latest major automaker to officially gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network in North America.

<p>It follows a wave of other automakers gaining access over the last year as the industry transitions to NACS (North American Charging Standard), Tesla’s proprietary connector that has now become the standard.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) this morning to dismiss Waymo’s progress in autonomous driving, claiming that the Alphabet-owned company “never really had a chance against Tesla” and that this will be “obvious in hindsight.”</p>
<p>The comment came as a direct response to a discussion about Waymo’s newly released safety data—a level of transparency that Tesla has yet to match.</p>

      <h1>Bo M2 review: The premium e-scooter unlike anything I’ve ever tested before</h1>

<p>I’ve ridden <a href="http://electrek.co/guides/electric-scooter">a lot of electric scooters</a> over the years. Most blur together – two wheels, a deck, a motor, and a series of compromises. But every now and then, one stands out. And after a couple of weeks riding the Bo M2 electric scooter, I can confidently say: this one’s different.</p>
<p>The Bo M2 is not your average e-scooter. It’s a purpose-built, premium commuter with some seriously refined features – and a price tag to match. At $2,490, it’s firmly in high-end territory. But for riders who want a serious transportation tool, not a toy, there’s a lot to like here.</p>

      <h1>Why the Rest of the World Is Buying Chinese EVs</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>China’s electric vehicle industry, it’s now well understood, is churning out cars that rival or exceed the best products coming out of the West. Chinese EVs are cheaper, cooler, more innovative, and have better range. And now they’re surging into car markets around the world — markets where consumers are hungry for clean, affordable transportation.</p>
<p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob talks to Ilaria Mazzocco about <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-ev-shift-role-china-and-industrial-policy-emerging-economies">her new report</a> on how six countries around the world are dealing with the rise of Chinese EVs. Why do countries welcome Chinese-made EVs, and why do countries resist them? How do domestic carmakers act when Chinese EVs come to town? And are climate concerns still driving uptake?</p>
<p>Mazzocco is the deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University. Jesse is off this week.</p>

<p>Tesla is pulling every demand lever available as we head into the final weeks of the year. The automaker has launched a new set of aggressive incentives in the US, including free upgrades on inventory vehicles, 0% APR financing, and $0 down leases.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the quarter (and year), and as per usual, Tesla is trying to empty its inventory, but it’s more difficult this year due to the end of the tax credit in Q3 pulling a lot of demand away from Q4.</p>

<p>A new video surfacing from a Tesla demonstration in Miami this weekend shows the Optimus humanoid robot taking a nasty fall. But it’s not the fall itself that is raising eyebrows, it’s the specific hand movements the robot made on its way down, which strongly suggest it was mimicking a remote operator frantically removing a VR headset.</p>

Sitting up front, nose practically pressed against the container doors, was my new 10,000-plus-pound (4,700 kg) electric tractor: the NESHER L3000 wheel loader.</p>

<p>I recently attended Strutt’s Demo Day to check out the company’s new EV1 mobility device, and even if you’ve never paid attention to electric wheelchairs before, you’ll still probably find this interesting.</p>
<p>The EV1 isn’t really a wheelchair in the traditional sense. It’s closer to an autonomous robot that just happens to take the form of a chair. Imagine a self-driving car fused with a humanoid robot, shrunk down to indoor-outdoor mobility scale. That’s the EV1. And after having spent some seat time in it, I can tell you that this technology is <em>going to change lives</em>.</p>

<p>Multiple outlets are reporting on Donald Trump’s apparent effort to change US regulations to bring tiny Japanese kei cars to the US, but there’s little reason to think that effort will be serious.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system now allows drivers to text and drive, though he added a caveat that it depends on the “context of surrounding traffic.”</p>
<p>This comes just a month after the CEO promised the feature was coming, despite the obvious legal and safety concerns surrounding it.</p>
<p>Does the law agree with this?</p>

The company announced that its fleet partners have now logged more than one million miles (1.6 million km) using Tern electric cargo bikes for commercial delivery work in the city – a figure that reflects not only enormous demand for e-bike logistics, but also the durability of the hardware behind it.</p>

<p>For years, the loudest and most persistent argument coming from the Tesla camp, including Elon Musk himself, against Waymo has been simple: “Sure, it works, but it can’t scale.”</p>
<p>The narrative, usually pushed by those heavily invested in the promise of Tesla’s “generalized Full Self-Driving”, was that Waymo was a geofenced parlor trick. They argued that Waymo’s reliance on lidar, radar, and, specifically, high-definition (HD) mapping would mean it would take years to launch in every new city.</p>
<p>But the narrative is now dying, as Waymo went from testing to fully autonomous in a couple of Texas cities in just a few months.</p>

      <h1>Tezeus Swift review: This lightweight carbon fiber folding e-bike really surprised me</h1>

<p>Folding e-bikes come in all shapes, sizes, and questionable design choices, but every once in a while, one comes along that makes me take a second look. After so much time on heavier folding e-bikes, that was my experience with the Tezeus Swift, a carbon fiber folding e-bike I recently spent a couple of weeks riding.</p>
<p>On paper, it looks like a lightweight urban commuter with modest power. In practice, it turned out to be a surprisingly polished little machine that feels far more refined than most of the budget folders we tend to see.</p>

<p>Newly published data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ferc/">FERC</a>), reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign, reveal that solar accounted for over 75% of US electrical generating capacity added in the first nine months of 2025. In September alone, solar provided 98% of new capacity, marking 25 consecutive months in which solar has led among all energy sources.</p>
<p>Year-to-date (YTD), solar and wind have each added more new capacity than natural gas has. The mix of all renewables remains on track to exceed 40% of installed capacity within three years; solar alone may be 20%.</p>

<p>Scooters have never really had their moment in the US the way they have in Europe or much of Asia (despite the few fun-loving Vespas clubs here and there). A mere ocean away in Europe, a scooter is just basic transportation – a smart, efficient, dead-simple way to navigate a city. But in the US, scooters tend to get ignored by car folks and lumped into the “not really a motorcycle” category by bike folks.</p>
<p>But LiveWire’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/05/livewire-unveils-powerful-electric-maxi-scooter-built-on-its-motorcycle-platform/">upcoming new electric maxi-scooter concept</a> might actually have a shot at shifting that narrative.</p>

<p>Tesla has received a brutal reality check from Germany this week.

<p>It’s a tough look for the world’s best-selling car, though the details paint a more nuanced picture than just “the car is falling apart.”</p>

<p>Elon Musk announced last night that Tesla is planning to “roughly double” its Robotaxi fleet in Austin next month. While an expansion of the pilot sounds positive on the surface, a look at the actual numbers reveals that Tesla is missing its own “end of year” target by a massive margin.</p>
<p>Just last month, Musk explicitly stated that Tesla aimed to have 500 Robotaxis in Austin by the end of the year. Now, “doubling” the current estimated fleet suggests the actual number will be closer to 60.</p>

<p>The race for autonomous driving has three fronts: software, hardware, and regulatory. For years, we’ve watched Tesla try to brute-force its way to “Full Self-Driving (FSD)” with its own custom hardware, while the rest of the automotive industry is increasingly lining up behind NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Now that we know <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/20/tesla-delays-next-gen-ai5-chip-mid-2027-cybercab/">Tesla’s new AI5 chip is delayed and won’t be in vehicles until 2027</a>, it’s worth comparing the two most dominant “self-driving” chips today: Tesla’s latest Hardware 4 (AI4) and NVIDIA’s Drive Thor.</p>

<p>When I first saw the <a href="https://alnk.to/3ydVs50">JackRabbit MG Doble</a> upon its unveiling <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/12/two-people-one-scooter-jackrabbit-unveils-micro-hauler-line-of-two-seater-rides/">earlier this year</a>, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect. It’s not quite a full-size electric bike, but definitely not a mini-bike either. It has no pedals, yet it feels like a legit vehicle, not a toy. And while its higher price tag isn’t exactly budget-friendly, the Doble offers something that’s surprisingly rare in the e-bike world: a two-person ride that’s actually fun, compact, and borderline addictive.</p>

<p>Daimler Truck AG CEO Karin Rådström hopped on LinkedIn today and dropped some absolutely wild pro-hydrogen talking points, using words like “emotional” and “inspiring” while making some pretty heady claims about the viability and economics of hydrogen. The rant is doubly embarrassing for another reason: <strong>the company’s hydrogen trucks are more than 100 <em>million</em> miles behind Volvo’s electric semis</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 22NOV2025</strong>: Daimler just delivered five new hydrogen semis for trials.</p>

<p>For most of human history, currency was a direct claim on tangible, productive output. Before the abstraction of government fiat or cryptocurrency, value was stored in things that required real work and resources, bushels of grain, livestock, gold, assets with their own direct productive output: horses, and tragically, slaves.</p>
<p>These were the foundational assets of economies, representing a direct link between labor, resources, and stored value.</p>
<p>As we accelerate into an all-electric, all-digital age, this fundamental link is re-emerging, but with a new unit of account. The 21st-century economy, defined by automated industry, robotic, electric transport, and now power-hungry artificial intelligence, runs on a single, non-negotiable input: electricity. In this new paradigm, the real base currency, the ultimate representation of productive capacity, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).</p>

<p>If you want to ditch snow blowing and shoveling forever, Yarbo’s got just the solution. The robotics company that took home a 2023 CES Innovation Award is redefining what it means to have a “smart yard” in all four seasons. Yarbo’s autonomous outdoor robots use advanced sensors, cameras, and algorithms to do the heavy lifting – literally. From snow blowing to mowing to leaf clearing, these machines handle tough jobs with precision, safety, and zero supervision.</p>
<p>Yarbo’s innovative “1+N” design is centered around one core unit (“1”) that can be expanded with multiple modular attachments (“N”) to meet a variety of yard care needs. This design allows users to save space and cost by owning a single core robot instead of multiple separate machines. Customize functionality by adding modules such as Lawn Mower, Snow Blower, Plow Blade, Cutting Disc, and more. Easily upgrade or adapt to different seasons and tasks without replacing the entire system.</p>
<p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/1N.gif?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>And right now, you can snag a <strong>fantastic discount</strong> <strong>of up to $1,200 at Yarbo’s biggest sale of the year</strong>. Check out the <strong><a href="https://go.yarbo.com/zzeiC">official Black Friday launch deals</a></strong> below – you won’t want to miss these!</p>

<p>Pedego, one of the most recognizable names from the early days of American e-bike brands, is entering a new era. The company has been acquired by the “US-based” ownership group behind the Asian e-bike brand Urtopia, a relatively young, tech-forward electric bike brand known for carbon fiber e-bikes with built-in connectivity and smart features. The result is a newly formed New Pedego Holdings Inc., which both companies are pitching not as a takeover, but as a reboot designed to modernize Pedego and rebuild the dealer network that once made it a retail powerhouse.</p>
