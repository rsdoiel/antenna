<p>Atlantic City Electric is stepping up its smart charging game — and they’re not just slinging rebates. The <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/comed-charges-ahead-with-100m-in-ev-investments-thousands-of-new-chargers/">Exelon</a>-owned utility is using its innovative new EVsmart program to make EV charging easier for utility customers across South Jersey while quietly laying the groundwork for a smarter, more flexible electrical grid.</p>

<p>I’ve tested a lot of folding fat-tire e-bikes over the years, and while many start to blend together, the <a href="https://www.heybike.com/products/ranger-3-0-pro">Heybike Ranger 3.0 Pro</a> managed to stand out with a thoughtful combination of design, comfort, and surprising feature upgrades. This is a beefy, full-suspension folder that feels more like a mini-adventure bike than a commuter machine – and I mean that in a good way.</p>

<p>VW’s US EV lease deals just went from hero to zero. Federal tax credits are now dead, the automaker has wiped out up to $12,000 in lease incentives on the ID.4, and ended $10,500 in discounts on the ID. Buzz. The move bucks the trend as other brands continue to sweeten their EV lease offers.</p>

<p>Solar and wind power aren’t just keeping up with global electricity demand anymore – they’re pulling ahead. According to a <a href="https://ember-energy.org/page-not-found/">new analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember, solar and wind combined outpaced global electricity demand growth in the first half of 2025. That shift led to a drop in both coal and gas generation compared to the same period last year. For the first time ever, renewables generated more power than coal globally.</p>

<p>We’ve got good news – EV lease prices look much better than expected, despite the end of the federal tax credit and 25% import tariff being in place. Prices have crept up compared to last month, but several automakers have stepped in to fill the gap by covering the $7,500 credit themselves or adding extra incentives – and the price of one EV even <em>dropped</em>. Here are October’s top EV lease deals, spotted by our friends at CarsDirect.</p>

That means that, in many states, you can now get “antique” or “historic” plates for a modern hybrid.</p>
<p>If that sounds appealing to you, here’s what it might cost to keep that OG Prius on the road for many more years to come.</p>

<p>Solar and storage prices are about to rise after a year and a half of record lows, according to new data from Wood Mackenzie.

That’s because China is changing the rules.</p>

<p>I spent about two weeks driving the Cadillac Escalade IQ all around British Columbia for this review, and I came out of the experience impressed. It proves that large SUVs can certainly be all-electric, but you need to be willing to have a big and heavy battery pack.</p>

<p>Robot mowers have come a long way in recent years, but some still fall into two categories: the ones that need perimeter wires, and the ones that get scared of tall grass. The UBHOME M10 falls into neither, and after testing it over the past few weeks, I’ve come away genuinely impressed. It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.element3.io/">Element3</a> just raised a fresh round of funding to launch the first US commercial lithium extraction plants, and it’s sourcing the lithium from oil and gas wastewater in Texas. That’s a big deal because it means there will be a domestic lithium supply for EVs and battery storage within a few months.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced it will spend $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” the US coal industry, claiming it will boost energy production and help rural communities. Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised “beautiful, clean coal” as “essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/01/chevy-cuts-equinox-ev-leases-under-250-a-month/">Lease deals get all the headlines</a>, but 75% of new car buyers still finance their cars, indicating that they want to <em>own</em> their vehicles once the payments are done. If that sounds like you, and you’ve been holding out for relief from sky-high payments, a wave of new EVs are now available with 0% financing — making it one of the best months yet to buy a new EV.</p>

<p>Government researchers in the US and abroad believe we could help decarbonize and electrify the transportation sector with hardy, fast-growing plants that collect the metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries in their roots, then harvest those metals later with a process that’s cleaner and cheaper than traditional mineral mining.</p>

<p>He literally said that.</p>



<p>How far would you be willing to go to get $1 trillion? Would you be willing to lie?</p>
