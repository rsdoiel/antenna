<p>
This white Hyundai IONIQ 5 is single-handedly rewriting the rules on EV
longevity by driving over 360,000 miles on its original battery. What’s
even wilder? The battery still had 87% battery health,
<a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/impacts-of-fast-charging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite
the owner exclusively using DC fast charging to charge the car to
100%</a>.
</p>
<p>
That was more than 50,000 miles ago, <strong>and the car is still going
strong</strong>!

Porsche is launching a new EV battery recycling pilot to recover
valuable raw materials from its cars’ high-voltage battery packs at the
end of their useful life in vehicles. The new pilot hopes to develop a
“closed-loop” raw material cycle that would have new batteries made from
old batteries without the need for new, high carbon cost mineral mining.

President Donald Trump announced that his administration would impose a
25% tariff on all cars</a>, trucks, and even automotive parts imported
into the country. The tariffs kick in April 2nd, and these are the EVs
set to be the hardest hit by those tariffs – if any of these are on your
shopping list, <strong>you’ll want to act now</strong>.
