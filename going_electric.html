Cargo scooters are a rare breed, filling a niche that exists between
typical e-bikes/e-scooters with minimal storage and larger
cargo-specific models designed for utility. But that dearth of cargo
scooters may be changing, based on several
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/11/pnys-electric-cargo-motorcycle-is-actually-hitting-the-road/">interesting
new models we’ve seen lately</a>, including the recently unveiled
<a href="https://www.rollingsunshine.com/">Lightfoot cargo electric
scooter</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yet unlike the few other cargo scooters rolling around out there, the
Lightfoot has one major advantage: its built-in solar panels keep it
charged up directly from the sun.

<p>
In the past week, TSLA stock has increased by about one-third of its
previous value. But this increase has had nothing to do with company
performance, or even due to external factors like consumer tastes or
beneficial changes in EV policy. Rather, the week’s speculation has come
out of a simple desire to see Tesla become the benefit of government
corruption.

Now a year later, I caught up with the company at the same show to learn
how the Ponie P2 is now preparing to hit the road.
