Still think that buying a new car is always much cheaper than leasing if
you’re playing for keeps? Not true, particularly when it comes to
electric vehicles. We found that current factory lease offers on 22
different EV models dispel that myth with terms that pass the
entire <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/18/loophole-may-get-you-a-7500-tax-credit-for-leasing-an-ev.html">commercial

to eventually own the vehicle for thousands of dollars less than paying
cash upfront or taking out a loan.

I’ve always enjoyed electric watersports devices, and have a long
history with everything from
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/08/31/wildest-electric-vehicles-i-tested-summer/">electric
surfboards to electric boats</a>. But it’s the category of electric sea
scooters that likely offers the most accessiblity to the average person,
providing fast and fun water excitement without the larger upfront cost
and complexity of larger vessels. The Sublue Vapor is the latest in a
string of electric sea scooters I’ve tested over the years, and it’s the
fanciest one yet.

I finally got a chance to test out Tesla Full Self-Driving (supervised)

Vigilance is paramount.

modest budget option!
