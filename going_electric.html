After plenty of delays (even as recently as this very morning), the
first videos of Tesla’s Robotaxi rides are coming in and the Tesla fans
that have been invited as early access users seem to have positive
reviews already.

Tesla spent years selling its Full Self-Driving software, for
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/05/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-price-to-15000-is-it-worth-it/">as
much as $15,000</a>, with the promise that owners would be able to use
that software to send their cars out as robotaxis to earn money when
they’re not being used otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Just today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will be charging a
flat fee of $4.20 for rides in its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/">highly-supervised
“robotaxi”.</a> But that brings up the question: if Tesla spent so many
years promising that you could use your car to earn money, and
<em>it’s</em> using <em>its</em> cars to earn money, then why can’t you?

</div>
<p>
A leaked 2026 order guide shows the price on several Volvo models going
up by nearly 6%. That’s thousands of dollars on some models – along with
higher destination charges, fewer discounts, and precious little in the
way of new tech or features to justify the price hike.
</p>
<p>
<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Volvo Cars has a response.

The Senate version of the repubilcans’ tax bill won’t just add trillions

Service’s awesome new EVs and sell them off for pennies on the dollar,
wasting money simply out of spite for vehicles that were already
cleaning your air and making your community safer.

General Motors may be better known for its lineup of full-size trucks
and SUVs, but a recently published patent shows the legacy automaker has
at least <em>considered</em> something much smaller and nimbler: an
electric motorcycle.
