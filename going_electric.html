Depending on where you live in the US, electrical outages can be
anything from a rare occurrence to near certainty. While some only last
a few minutes or hours, longer ones can end up spoiling everything in
your fridge and lead to an uncomfortable day or two with no
air-conditioning or fans. Backup by BioLite is a new home backup battery
launched by electronics company BioLite that makes it easy to install
your own redundancy before the next storm or power outage.

The Aventura-X EV29 has much of the feel-good charm that comes along
with nostalgic Vespa rides, yet without any of the exhaust noise, smell
of gasoline, or oily rag on your workbench. I spent a few enjoyable
weeks riding this fun little runabout and felt almost like I was
cheating, getting the fun vibes without paying the normal entry price of
muss and fuss that goes with classic ICE scooters.

Kia is growing in China as most foreign automakers are rapidly losing
market share. Foreign automakers like Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM are
struggling to keep up with aggressive price cuts and an influx of new
competition. After launching its new low-cost electric SUV, the
EV5, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia/">Kia</a> is already seeing
the results, as brand sales in China topped 20,000 for the third
straight month in August.
