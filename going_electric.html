<p>Elon Musk announced last night that Tesla is planning to “roughly double” its Robotaxi fleet in Austin next month. While an expansion of the pilot sounds positive on the surface, a look at the actual numbers reveals that Tesla is missing its own “end of year” target by a massive margin.</p>
<p>Just last month, Musk explicitly stated that Tesla aimed to have 500 Robotaxis in Austin by the end of the year. Now, “doubling” the current estimated fleet suggests the actual number will be closer to 60.</p>

<p>The race for autonomous driving has three fronts: software, hardware, and regulatory. For years, we’ve watched Tesla try to brute-force its way to “Full Self-Driving (FSD)” with its own custom hardware, while the rest of the automotive industry is increasingly lining up behind NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Now that we know <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/20/tesla-delays-next-gen-ai5-chip-mid-2027-cybercab/">Tesla’s new AI5 chip is delayed and won’t be in vehicles until 2027</a>, it’s worth comparing the two most dominant “self-driving” chips today: Tesla’s latest Hardware 4 (AI4) and NVIDIA’s Drive Thor.</p>

<p>When I first saw the <a href="https://alnk.to/3ydVs50">JackRabbit MG Doble</a> upon its unveiling <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/12/two-people-one-scooter-jackrabbit-unveils-micro-hauler-line-of-two-seater-rides/">earlier this year</a>, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect. It’s not quite a full-size electric bike, but definitely not a mini-bike either. It has no pedals, yet it feels like a legit vehicle, not a toy. And while its higher price tag isn’t exactly budget-friendly, the Doble offers something that’s surprisingly rare in the e-bike world: a two-person ride that’s actually fun, compact, and borderline addictive.</p>

<p>For the first time in what feels like forever, Tesla has put a hard date on the arrival of Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in Europe. The automaker confirmed that the Dutch vehicle authority (RDW) has committed to granting national approval for the system in February 2026, which is just a few months away.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: RDW has denied that it has told Tesla it plans to grant approval in February.</p>

<p>For most of human history, currency was a direct claim on tangible, productive output. Before the abstraction of government fiat or cryptocurrency, value was stored in things that required real work and resources, bushels of grain, livestock, gold, assets with their own direct productive output: horses, and tragically, slaves.</p>
<p>These were the foundational assets of economies, representing a direct link between labor, resources, and stored value.</p>
<p>As we accelerate into an all-electric, all-digital age, this fundamental link is re-emerging, but with a new unit of account. The 21st-century economy, defined by automated industry, robotic, electric transport, and now power-hungry artificial intelligence, runs on a single, non-negotiable input: electricity. In this new paradigm, the real base currency, the ultimate representation of productive capacity, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).</p>

<p>If you want to ditch snow blowing and shoveling forever, Yarbo’s got just the solution. The robotics company that took home a 2023 CES Innovation Award is redefining what it means to have a “smart yard” in all four seasons. Yarbo’s autonomous outdoor robots use advanced sensors, cameras, and algorithms to do the heavy lifting – literally. From snow blowing to mowing to leaf clearing, these machines handle tough jobs with precision, safety, and zero supervision.</p>
<p>Yarbo’s innovative “1+N” design is centered around one core unit (“1”) that can be expanded with multiple modular attachments (“N”) to meet a variety of yard care needs. This design allows users to save space and cost by owning a single core robot instead of multiple separate machines. Customize functionality by adding modules such as Lawn Mower, Snow Blower, Plow Blade, Cutting Disc, and more. Easily upgrade or adapt to different seasons and tasks without replacing the entire system.</p>
<p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/1N.gif?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>And right now, you can snag a <strong>fantastic discount</strong> <strong>of up to $1,200 at Yarbo’s biggest sale of the year</strong>. Check out the <strong><a href="https://go.yarbo.com/zzeiC">official Black Friday launch deals</a></strong> below – you won’t want to miss these!</p>

<p>Pedego, one of the most recognizable names from the early days of American e-bike brands, is entering a new era. The company has been acquired by the “US-based” ownership group behind the Asian e-bike brand Urtopia, a relatively young, tech-forward electric bike brand known for carbon fiber e-bikes with built-in connectivity and smart features. The result is a newly formed New Pedego Holdings Inc., which both companies are pitching not as a takeover, but as a reboot designed to modernize Pedego and rebuild the dealer network that once made it a retail powerhouse.</p>

<p>The General Motors EV1 has a vital place in electric vehicle history. It mainly served to show two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show a viable path for battery-electric vehicles back in the 1990s.</li>
<li>Some forces are clearly at play to suppress electric cars.</li>
</ol>
<p>GM only leased the EV1, never sold any, and prevented almost anyone from keeping them when it killed the vehicle program.</p>
<p>The automaker ended up crushing the vast majority of them. While a few empty shells exist in museums, they are strictly prohibited from ever driving again. But a new project has surfaced involving what appears to be the only legally owned EV1 in private hands, and the new owner plans to put it back on the road with a modern battery pack.</p>
<p>A YouTube channel called <em>Electrek Garage</em> (no relation to us, though we like the name) posted a fascinating video detailing the acquisition and restoration plan for this unicorn of an EV.</p>

<p>Well, the last domino has fallen, but the most interesting thing is that the NACS connector, which stands for North American Charging Standard, is going global – beyond North America.</p>

<p>Kandi has become fairly well known in the US for its electric golf carts and work-focused UTVs, but the company has teamed up with Lowe’s and the NFL on something more playful: the Kandi 4P electric golf cart. Sold through Lowe’s with official NFL team liveries, this four-seat neighborhood cruiser is aimed less at the fairway and more at cul-de-sacs, grocery runs, and game-day tailgates. I spent time with a Miami Dolphins–themed 4P in South Florida to see what it can really do.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/iea/">International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) says renewables and AI are reshaping the world’s energy future, and that transformation is happening faster than anyone expected. In its new “World Energy Outlook 2025,” the IEA warns that energy security risks now stretch far beyond oil and gas. Critical minerals essential to clean tech, defense, and AI have become the new fault lines in global supply chains. The IEA also states that energy has become a central focus of geopolitical power struggles, making it one of the defining economic and security challenges of our time.</p>

<p>Solid-state batteries have long been the holy grail of electric vehicles, especially for light EVs like electric bicycles that are usually charged indoors. They hold major safety benefits over traditional lithium-ion batteries, plus offer better energy density, making it possible to use smaller batteries or simply fit more capacity in the same-sized battery pack.</p>
