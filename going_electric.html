tested the world’s most affordable electric golf cart: The Kandi
Mini</h2>

<p>
The Kandi Mini is unlike any other golf cart in the world in two key

And second, it’s a lot more compact than your average golf cart.
</p>
<p>
Both of these are key features for folks who have become golf cart
curious but don’t have the space in their garages or their wallets for a
new full-size cart.
