I’ve tried a<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/21/viribus-trio-plus-electric-tricycle-review-the-lowest-cost-e-trike-id-still-ride/"> Viribus e-trike before</a>, and while it got the job done, it was a fairly basic and entry level model. But this time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the SC5 delivers more than just the basics.</p>



<p>I’ve been testing it now for various errands, grocery runs, and casual rides around the neighborhood. After logging some decent miles on it, here’s what I’ve learned about this three-wheeled e-bike, and why I think it’s a strong contender in the growing world of electric trikes.</p>

<p>Apparently, the answer is: not like anything else on the road.</p>

<p>It appears Tesla was only operating about 20 vehicles in its “robotaxi” fleet so the number likely only rose to about 30 cars.</p>

The Lightning Shared Scooter Company (LSSC) lured investors with promises of leasing scooters in Asia, offering hefty daily returns to Western investors – often average folks instead of seasoned investors. But now regulators and watchdogs warn it was all a well‑orchestrated scam, leaving victims robbed of millions.</p>

      <p><em>Shift Key is off for Labor Day, so we’re re-running this classic episode.</em></p><br><p>For the first time in 15 years, American electricity demand is rising again as new data centers, factories, and electric vehicles come online. The easiest option is to meet that new demand with new supply — new power plants. But in many parts of the country, it can take years to hook up new wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The reason why is a clogged and broken system called the interconnection queue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, which first aired in 2024, Jesse and Rob speak with two experts about how to understand — and how to fix — what is perhaps the biggest obstacle to deploying more renewables on the U.S. power grid.&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/people/tyler-norris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tyler Norris</a> is a doctoral student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment.
