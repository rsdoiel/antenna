<p>Like a 90s “gifted” kid that was supposed to be a lot of things, the electric Jeep Wagoneer S was supposed to be sporty, luxurious, and appeal to a whole new Jeep buyer. Despite being a decent vehicle, it never really found its place — but now that Jeep is offering nearly $17,000 off select models, it might be time to give the go-fast Wagoneer S a second look.</p>

The technology continued to mature, prices kept shifting in occasionally unexpected ways, and e-bikes found themselves squarely in the middle of broader conversations about transportation, safety, regulation, and urban life. What several years ago felt like a niche corner of the EV world is now impossible to ignore, with electric bikes influencing how cities plan streets, how families get around, and how regulators try (and sometimes struggle) to keep up.</p>

Needless to say, this hasn’t gone over well with the general public.</p>
<p>Now, GM has <a href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/topic/us/en/2025/dec/1215-Apple-Music-available-GM-vehicles-standard-streaming.html">one bit of good news</a> for its owners: a new Apple Music app rolling out for select cars starting today.</p>

<p>This new policy significantly outpaces the industry standard and puts pressure on competitors like Tesla and Volkswagen to follow suit.</p>

<p>I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
<p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of December 2025. This could be your last chance to get some crazy good deals as companies try to clear shelves before the end of the year. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

<p>It’s finally happening. After years of promises, missed timelines dating back to the “Autonomy Day” in 2019, and endless iterations of “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), a Tesla vehicle has been spotted driving on public roads in Austin without anyone in the driver’s seat or a safety monitor in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Robotaxi testing has officially commenced. This is undeniably a step forward for the company’s autonomy ambitions.</p>
<p>But it is also a terrifying leap of faith, given the complete lack of safety data proving the system is ready for this.</p>

<p>Turning cheap daytime solar into electricity you can actually use at night just got a lot cheaper. A <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/how-cheap-is-battery-storage/">new analysis</a> from energy think tank Ember shows that utility-scale battery storage costs have fallen to $65 per megawatt-hour (MWh) as of October 2025 in markets outside China and the US. At that level, pairing solar with batteries to deliver power when it’s needed is now economically viable.</p>

<p>Consumer Reports is out with its latest study on used car reliability, and the headlines are already circulating: Tesla has landed at the very bottom of the list.</p>
<p>The study, which examines 5-to-10-year-old vehicles, ranks Tesla 26th out of 26 brands, placing it behind Chrysler, Dodge, and even Jeep – brands known for decades for their reliability issues.</p>
<p>While critics will undoubtedly use this as ammo to attack the brand, a closer look at the data reveals a much more nuanced picture, one that highlights just how recent an automaker Tesla still is.</p>

<p>In a story I could have titled “Even a broken clock is right twice a day,” US President Donald Trump made headlines this week by expressing his love of small, affordable vehicles – and encouraging automakers to start building more compacts domestically. That’s great stuff, but there are dozens of some great compact cars out there already.</p>
<p>Here’s my list of compact EVs that need to find their way to America ASAP.</p>

<p>Portable power stations have gotten impressively capable over the last few years, but every now and then you run into one that genuinely changes your sense of scale. That’s the feeling I had while testing the VTOMAN FlashSpeed Pro 3600, a 3.1 kWh, 3.6 kW monster of a power box that – despite weighing as much as a medium-sized meteor – rolls around surprisingly easily thanks to its integrated handle and wheels. And at its current price <a href="https://vtoman.com/products/vtoman-flashspeed-pro-3600-power-station?variant=45055026888873">of $1,399</a>, it’s one of the better deals I’ve seen in the high-capacity power station space.</p>

<p>BMW is the latest major automaker to officially gain access to the Tesla Supercharger network in North America. Starting today, BMW EV drivers in the US can access over 25,000 Tesla Superchargers, adding a massive boost to the charging options for owners of the i4, iX, and other electric models from the German automaker.</p>
<p>It follows a wave of other automakers gaining access over the last year as the industry transitions to NACS (North American Charging Standard), Tesla’s proprietary connector that has now become the standard.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) this morning to dismiss Waymo’s progress in autonomous driving, claiming that the Alphabet-owned company “never really had a chance against Tesla” and that this will be “obvious in hindsight.”</p>
<p>The comment came as a direct response to a discussion about Waymo’s newly released safety data—a level of transparency that Tesla has yet to match.</p>

      <h1>Bo M2 review: The premium e-scooter unlike anything I’ve ever tested before</h1>

<p>I’ve ridden <a href="http://electrek.co/guides/electric-scooter">a lot of electric scooters</a> over the years. Most blur together – two wheels, a deck, a motor, and a series of compromises. But every now and then, one stands out. And after a couple of weeks riding the Bo M2 electric scooter, I can confidently say: this one’s different.</p>
<p>The Bo M2 is not your average e-scooter. It’s a purpose-built, premium commuter with some seriously refined features – and a price tag to match. At $2,490, it’s firmly in high-end territory. But for riders who want a serious transportation tool, not a toy, there’s a lot to like here.</p>

      <h1>Why the Rest of the World Is Buying Chinese EVs</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>China’s electric vehicle industry, it’s now well understood, is churning out cars that rival or exceed the best products coming out of the West. Chinese EVs are cheaper, cooler, more innovative, and have better range. And now they’re surging into car markets around the world — markets where consumers are hungry for clean, affordable transportation.</p>
<p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob talks to Ilaria Mazzocco about <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-ev-shift-role-china-and-industrial-policy-emerging-economies">her new report</a> on how six countries around the world are dealing with the rise of Chinese EVs. Why do countries welcome Chinese-made EVs, and why do countries resist them? How do domestic carmakers act when Chinese EVs come to town? And are climate concerns still driving uptake?</p>
<p>Mazzocco is the deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University. Jesse is off this week.</p>

<p>Rather than straining the grid, the batteries in EVs can actually help to <em>stabilize</em> the energy grid under heavy loads. PG&amp;E gets that, and to encourage participation in its growing V2G programs, the utility is offering GM Energy customers in its territory up to $4,500 toward qualifying home battery systems.</p>

<p>A new video surfacing from a Tesla demonstration in Miami this weekend shows the Optimus humanoid robot taking a nasty fall. But it’s not the fall itself that is raising eyebrows, it’s the specific hand movements the robot made on its way down, which strongly suggest it was mimicking a remote operator frantically removing a VR headset.</p>

<p>I recently attended Strutt’s Demo Day to check out the company’s new EV1 mobility device, and even if you’ve never paid attention to electric wheelchairs before, you’ll still probably find this interesting.</p>
<p>The EV1 isn’t really a wheelchair in the traditional sense. It’s closer to an autonomous robot that just happens to take the form of a chair. Imagine a self-driving car fused with a humanoid robot, shrunk down to indoor-outdoor mobility scale. That’s the EV1. And after having spent some seat time in it, I can tell you that this technology is <em>going to change lives</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, Virginia, there are still great EV lease deals to be had in December. Hyundai continues to offer EV leases for under $200 a month, and the BMW i4 can be leased for the same price it was when the federal tax credit was still in effect. With 2025 models disappearing fast, this might be your last shot to snag a year-end <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-deals/">lease deal</a> on an EV. Check out the standouts below.</p>

<p>This comes just a month after the CEO promised the feature was coming, despite the obvious legal and safety concerns surrounding it.</p>

<p>For years, the loudest and most persistent argument coming from the Tesla camp, including Elon Musk himself, against Waymo has been simple: “Sure, it works, but it can’t scale.”</p>
<p>The narrative, usually pushed by those heavily invested in the promise of Tesla’s “generalized Full Self-Driving”, was that Waymo was a geofenced parlor trick. They argued that Waymo’s reliance on lidar, radar, and, specifically, high-definition (HD) mapping would mean it would take years to launch in every new city.</p>
<p>But the narrative is now dying, as Waymo went from testing to fully autonomous in a couple of Texas cities in just a few months.</p>

<p>Folding e-bikes come in all shapes, sizes, and questionable design choices, but every once in a while, one comes along that makes me take a second look. After so much time on heavier folding e-bikes, that was my experience with the Tezeus Swift, a carbon fiber folding e-bike I recently spent a couple of weeks riding.</p>
<p>On paper, it looks like a lightweight urban commuter with modest power. In practice, it turned out to be a surprisingly polished little machine that feels far more refined than most of the budget folders we tend to see.</p>

<p>Newly published data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ferc/">FERC</a>), reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign, reveal that solar accounted for over 75% of US electrical generating capacity added in the first nine months of 2025. In September alone, solar provided 98% of new capacity, marking 25 consecutive months in which solar has led among all energy sources.</p>
<p>Year-to-date (YTD), solar and wind have each added more new capacity than natural gas has. The mix of all renewables remains on track to exceed 40% of installed capacity within three years; solar alone may be 20%.</p>

<p>According to registration data tracked by <em>Electrek</em>, Tesla’s volumes in key European markets are down 12.3% year-over-year.</p>

<p>Scooters have never really had their moment in the US the way they have in Europe or much of Asia (despite the few fun-loving Vespas clubs here and there). A mere ocean away in Europe, a scooter is just basic transportation – a smart, efficient, dead-simple way to navigate a city. But in the US, scooters tend to get ignored by car folks and lumped into the “not really a motorcycle” category by bike folks.</p>
<p>But LiveWire’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/05/livewire-unveils-powerful-electric-maxi-scooter-built-on-its-motorcycle-platform/">upcoming new electric maxi-scooter concept</a> might actually have a shot at shifting that narrative.</p>

<p>It’s a tough look for the world’s best-selling car, though the details paint a more nuanced picture than just “the car is falling apart.”</p>
