“finally when we compete directly with Tesla,” but the EV maker has even
bigger plans to drive growth.

<p>
It’s a tale as old as time. A man takes a ride on an electric motorcycle
and thinks to himself, “This is great, but you know what it’s missing?
The ability to morph into an electric snowmobile, too.”
</p>
<p>
Ok, perhaps it’s not the most common thought among us. But that hasn’t
stopped it from apparently becoming a reality thanks to Canadian
designer Steven Foster, who has now spent three years developing and
testing that exact concept to bring the Avvenire Combat e-motorcycle to
life.
