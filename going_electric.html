It’s thumbs down on the BYD Atto 3, at least from Europe’s leading car
safety agency EuroNCAP when rating the BEV’s driver assistance system.
Meanwhile, the BMW i5, along with other European models, receives top
scores.

European logistics firm DFDS placed a massive, 100 unit order for
Volvo’s long-range electric semi truck earlier this year. Last week,
they put their first 10 examples on the road delivering goods in
northwest England and Ireland.

Whether it’s the Rivian
“<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/08/11/rivian-front-dig-mode/">Tank
Turn</a>,” GMC Hummer “Crab Walk,” or the Mercedes G Wagen’s “G-turn,”
it seems like every EV brand has their own idea of what to call their
vehicle’s four-wheel steering tricks. Now, Chevy’s joining the name game
with their own trademark term: <strong>Sidewinder</strong>.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of November 2024. We’re in peak sale season with
holiday shopping cranking up, and that means there are likely some even
better sales than we’re used to! And just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has already
been a year of impressive e-bike sales. So check out the awesome e-bikes
below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.
