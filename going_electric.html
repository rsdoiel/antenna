<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/volvo/">Volvo</a> has no plans to
challenge low-cost EVs in China as the ongoing price war intensifies.
The EX30, Volvo’s cheapest EV, starts at around $28,000 (200,800 yuan),
but that’s as low as the company will go.

Still think that buying a new car is always much cheaper than leasing if
you’re playing for keeps? Not true, particularly when it comes to
electric vehicles. We found that current factory lease offers on 22
different EV models dispel that myth with terms that pass the

to eventually own the vehicle for thousands of dollars less than paying

history with everything from

providing fast and fun water excitement without the larger upfront cost
and complexity of larger vessels. The Sublue Vapor is the latest in a
string of electric sea scooters I’ve tested over the years, and it’s the
fanciest one yet.

<p>
The <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/polestar/">Polestar</a> 3 has
long been promised to be the first true branded BEV from the Volvo- and
Geely-owned automaker, and it has a lot riding on its success. After
taking a trip out to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to test drive both variants
of the Polestar 3, I think this SUV is something pretty special inside
and out.

The Furukawa Unic corporation expanded its line of pop-up “spider”
cranes earlier this year with the launch of the battery-powered UM325
electric spider crane – and it looks every bit like it’s ready to be
cast in a Michael Bay Transformers movie.
