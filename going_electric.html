      <h1>Review: UBHOME M10 Robotic Mower is the easiest way to mow your lawn</h1>

(date: 2025-09-30)

<p>Robot mowers have come a long way in recent years, but some still fall into two categories: the ones that need perimeter wires, and the ones that get scared of tall grass. The UBHOME M10 falls into neither, and after testing it over the past few weeks, I’ve come away genuinely impressed. It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced it will spend $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” the US coal industry, claiming it will boost energy production and help rural communities. Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised “beautiful, clean coal” as “essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>

The grants come from the second round of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which supports Illinois’s goal of registering 1 million EVs by 2030. </p>

VPPs connect small energy systems and smart devices into a single network managed by an energy company or utility. That can include residential solar panels, battery storage, EVs, and smart thermostats. When the grid needs help during peak demand or emergencies, they can be tapped – and you get paid for participating.</p>

I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the current state of electric chainsaws, but I was excited to put the new machine to work. Fast forward a full year, and I’ve got an update: we’ve abused the heck out of it – and it’s still going strong!</p>

A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows just how dramatic the surge is. Electricity use in the region has tripled since 2000, and it’s expected to jump another 50% by 2035. That’s like adding the current combined electricity demand of Germany and Spain.</p>

And, sure – the taller driving position offers road presence, but when it comes to real-world utility, a proper long-roof wagon can hang with the best of them while offering Teutonic driving dynamics no SUV can match. All it would take to spark a wagon revival in the US is one sleek, solidly built, and <em>affordable</em> entry from a mainstream brand. And VW already has the perfect candidate waiting in the wings. Meet the Škoda Vision O (Passat badges not included).</p>

That “waterproof” pannier that started leaking after the first storm, the multitool that rounded out on its tenth bolt, the lights that faded faster than a dying AA battery. I’ve had my share of disappointments. But over the past decade of nearly daily riding, there’s a small handful of e-bike tools and accessories that have stood the test of time. I’m talking <em>half a decade or more</em> of constant use, surviving rain, dust, sun, and the occasional crash, and still going strong.</p>

The world is on track to add its second terawatt of wind capacity by 2030. To put that in perspective, it took 23 years to install the first terawatt, which was reached in 2023. The second will come in just seven.</p>

Of course, the first thing that stands out about the new Leaf is its design. Nissan says it’s adopting a subcompact crossover style instead of the hatchback style in the previous two iterations.</p>



<p>I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for the quirky design of the first-generation Leaf, but the design was polarizing to say the least. The second-generation Leaf was more widely palatable, but bland and almost forgettable. The design team at Nissan stepped up hugely with the 2026 Leaf, channeling looks from the Nissan Ariya, which shares the same EV platform.</p>

<p>If you ask me, there’s one e-bike style that will work for more people than just about anything else on the market. I’m not saying it’s the perfect choice for <em>everyone</em> – there’s no such thing – but if you’re staring at a dozen browser tabs of e-bike specs and feeling decision fatigue, this is the style I’d point you toward.</p>
