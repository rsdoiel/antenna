XG Pro</a>, my instinct was to take it somewhere wild. Sure, it’s
designed to be a compact, fun-sized ride for urban zipping and off-road
excursions — but what if I took it even further? What if I used it to
tow a kayak… to the beach… and then paddled that kayak with the e-bike
strapped to it to a deserted island to go camping?

<p>
Sometimes bad ideas turn into great stories. This was one of those.

As “extreme” weather events become more commonplace, the demand for
reliable and portable energy continues to rise. In response to that
growing demand for dependable off-grid power, Volvo has developed the
new PU500 Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) designed to take
electrical power when it’s needed most.

In a bold bid to combat the crippling air pollution crisis in its
capital, Delhi, Indian lawmakers have begun high-level discussions about

that could cause a seismic shift in the global EV space and provide a
cleaner, greener future for India’s capital.
