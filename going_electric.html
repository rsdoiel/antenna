Hyundai’s first EV is set to roll off the production line at its new
$7.6 billion Metaplant in Georgia later this year. With Trump vowing to
end “EV mandates” on day one if elected,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> is preparing
for a sudden shift in leadership. Hyundai’s EV plant was built to comply
with the Biden administration’s move to promote domestic production and
move the US toward a cleaner future. What will happen if Trump reverses
all the progress?

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/">Rivian</a> has made a name
for itself in the growing BEV segment thanks to its uniquely designed
vehicles and their supportive software. One flaw argued by some R1T or
R1S drivers, however, is Rivian’s lack of Apple CarPlay availability.
While the door on CarPlay integration was still only slightly ajar,
Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe appears to have shut it for good.

efficiency of a golf cart</a> to shuttle workers and supplies around the

this the most practical electric pickup you can buy</strong>?
