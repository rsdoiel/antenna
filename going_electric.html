If you’ve been hanging around in the world of electric bikes for any
decent amount of time, you’ve probably come across Bafang. They don’t
make electric bikes, but they’ve long made many of the components used
by them. I visited the factory
<a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/21/how-electric-bicycle-motors-are-made-bafang-factory-tour/">back
in 2019</a>, and recently returned for a second visit to see what had
changed. Boy, was I unprepared for what awaited me…

Cummins has its eye on hybrid powertrains to help decarbonize the
transport, construction, and mining spaces the operates in. To that end,
the company has acquired the hybrid equipment experts First Mode, and
plans to make the first commercially available retrofit hybrid system
for mining equipment a reality not just soon – but <em>now</em>.

Grapes are sensitive – and when you’re depending on them to have a
certain flavor, a certain acidity, and even a certain smell, the last
thing you want is diesel particulate matter settling on them. That’s
just one of the reasons electric equipment options like Volvo’s electric
wheel loader offer unique advantages to companies like Ästad Vingård.

Last month,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/19/electric-car-will-fall-apart-before-its-battery-pack-does-study-finds/">Geotab</a>
signed a deal with Volvo Group to integrate the manufacturer’s vehicle
data API into Geotab’s telematics platform. It’s the latest in a recent
onslaught of such deals between telematics providers and OEMs that begs
the question: <strong>what’s in it for the OEMs</strong>?

French hydrogen firm Hyvia has been given a stay of execution. The
Commercial Court of Versaille has given Hyvia a few extra weeks to get
through its insolvency proceedings and find a buyer – but, frankly, it
ain’t lookin’ good.
