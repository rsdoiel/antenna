<p>
There are still many questions surrounding the plausibility of
full-fledged autonomous robotaxi operations around the world, but
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/waymo">Waymo</a>, one of the current
leaders in the segment, is putting at least one stigma to rest. A new
study conducted with the help of reinsurance provider Swiss Re used
hundreds of thousands of liability claims to demonstrate that robotaxi
vehicles using the Waymo Driver platform deliver significantly higher
safety performance than vehicles operated by a human driver.

There’s nothing worse than a weak cargo e-bike that struggles on hills
and under heavy loads. That’s why Heybike ensured the deck was stacked
in riders’ favor when they built the
<a href="https://shrsl.com/4shke">Heybike Hauler electric cargo
bike</a>. With a 1,400W peak-rated motor and 28 mph speeds, it sounded
ready to rock n’ roll. And now that I’ve been testing one out for a
while, here are my thoughts on the latest budget-oriented yet high-power
family e-bike.

The world’s leading EV battery maker wants to make gas stations a thing
of the past. On Wednesday,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/catl/">CATL</a> revealed ambitious
plans to expand its EV battery swap network with ten new models. By
swapping batteries, EV drivers can get a fully charged pack within two
minutes. That’s even quicker than filling up your gas tank.
