Bear with me, as this one is a bit complicated and jargon-heavy. Lotus
Technology Inc. announced that
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/geely/">Geely</a>, the majority
owner of its vehicle manufacturing business Lotus UK, exercised its put
option earlier this week to sell its 51% stake in the latter company
back to the former company. In layperson’s terms, Geely is out, so Lotus
Tech has to buy the 51% of Lotus UK back, putting all those respective
businesses back under one umbrella. Still with me? More below.

<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/business/video/byd-tesla-china-us-tariffs-marc-stewart-digvid">have
reported</a> that Chinese automotive giant BYD has overtaken Tesla as
the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles. While it may be true
that BYD has usurped Tesla to sell more electric vehicles or generate
more revenue, the idea that either is the largest EV seller in the world
completely ignores a company that sells more EVs each year than both
Tesla and BYD combined.

<p>
Those EVs just have half the wheels.
