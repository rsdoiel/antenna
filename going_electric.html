For a couple of years, two of the leading driving systems pushing the
limits of automotive autonomy have been Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD)
and XPeng Motors’ Navigation Guided Pilot
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xpeng-ngp/">(XNGP)</a>. Both EV
automakers are leading the race in their respective markets, but neither
technology is available in the opposite country (at least for now). In a
cool video recently posted by XPeng, founder, chairman, and CEO He
Xiaopeng tested out Tesla FSD for himself in the US and documented his
experience, which you can see in the video below.

Where BEV conversions are going, we don’t need roads… Actually, we still
very much need roads, but we no longer need to look at the original
DeLorean DMC-12, considered by many as a design far ahead of its time,
as a dated combustion classic. The EV conversion experts at
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/electrogenic/">Electrogenic</a> have
introduced a new “plug and play” kit that can bring any sample of the
original DeLorean into the future of electric mobility. It still can’t
actually travel through time, though…
