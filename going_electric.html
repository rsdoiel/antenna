<p>I recently attended Strutt’s Demo Day to check out the company’s new EV1 mobility device, and even if you’ve never paid attention to electric wheelchairs before, you’ll still probably find this interesting.</p>
<p>The EV1 isn’t really a wheelchair in the traditional sense. It’s closer to an autonomous robot that just happens to take the form of a chair. Imagine a self-driving car fused with a humanoid robot, shrunk down to indoor-outdoor mobility scale. That’s the EV1. And after having spent some seat time in it, I can tell you that this technology is <em>going to change lives</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, Virginia, there are still great EV lease deals to be had in December. Hyundai continues to offer EV leases for under $200 a month, and the BMW i4 can be leased for the same price it was when the federal tax credit was still in effect. With 2025 models disappearing fast, this might be your last shot to snag a year-end <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-deals/">lease deal</a> on an EV. Check out the standouts below.</p>

<p>This comes just a month after the CEO promised the feature was coming, despite the obvious legal and safety concerns surrounding it.</p>

<p>For years, the loudest and most persistent argument coming from the Tesla camp, including Elon Musk himself, against Waymo has been simple: “Sure, it works, but it can’t scale.”</p>
<p>The narrative, usually pushed by those heavily invested in the promise of Tesla’s “generalized Full Self-Driving”, was that Waymo was a geofenced parlor trick. They argued that Waymo’s reliance on lidar, radar, and, specifically, high-definition (HD) mapping would mean it would take years to launch in every new city.</p>
<p>But the narrative is now dying, as Waymo went from testing to fully autonomous in a couple of Texas cities in just a few months.</p>

<p>Folding e-bikes come in all shapes, sizes, and questionable design choices, but every once in a while, one comes along that makes me take a second look. After so much time on heavier folding e-bikes, that was my experience with the Tezeus Swift, a carbon fiber folding e-bike I recently spent a couple of weeks riding.</p>
<p>On paper, it looks like a lightweight urban commuter with modest power. In practice, it turned out to be a surprisingly polished little machine that feels far more refined than most of the budget folders we tend to see.</p>

<p>Newly published data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ferc/">FERC</a>), reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign, reveal that solar accounted for over 75% of US electrical generating capacity added in the first nine months of 2025. In September alone, solar provided 98% of new capacity, marking 25 consecutive months in which solar has led among all energy sources.</p>
<p>Year-to-date (YTD), solar and wind have each added more new capacity than natural gas has. The mix of all renewables remains on track to exceed 40% of installed capacity within three years; solar alone may be 20%.</p>

<p>Scooters have never really had their moment in the US the way they have in Europe or much of Asia (despite the few fun-loving Vespas clubs here and there). A mere ocean away in Europe, a scooter is just basic transportation – a smart, efficient, dead-simple way to navigate a city. But in the US, scooters tend to get ignored by car folks and lumped into the “not really a motorcycle” category by bike folks.</p>
<p>But LiveWire’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/05/livewire-unveils-powerful-electric-maxi-scooter-built-on-its-motorcycle-platform/">upcoming new electric maxi-scooter concept</a> might actually have a shot at shifting that narrative.</p>

<p>It’s a tough look for the world’s best-selling car, though the details paint a more nuanced picture than just “the car is falling apart.”</p>

<p>Elon Musk announced last night that Tesla is planning to “roughly double” its Robotaxi fleet in Austin next month. While an expansion of the pilot sounds positive on the surface, a look at the actual numbers reveals that Tesla is missing its own “end of year” target by a massive margin.</p>
<p>Just last month, Musk explicitly stated that Tesla aimed to have 500 Robotaxis in Austin by the end of the year. Now, “doubling” the current estimated fleet suggests the actual number will be closer to 60.</p>

<p>The race for autonomous driving has three fronts: software, hardware, and regulatory. For years, we’ve watched Tesla try to brute-force its way to “Full Self-Driving (FSD)” with its own custom hardware, while the rest of the automotive industry is increasingly lining up behind NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Now that we know <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/20/tesla-delays-next-gen-ai5-chip-mid-2027-cybercab/">Tesla’s new AI5 chip is delayed and won’t be in vehicles until 2027</a>, it’s worth comparing the two most dominant “self-driving” chips today: Tesla’s latest Hardware 4 (AI4) and NVIDIA’s Drive Thor.</p>

<p>When I first saw the <a href="https://alnk.to/3ydVs50">JackRabbit MG Doble</a> upon its unveiling <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/12/two-people-one-scooter-jackrabbit-unveils-micro-hauler-line-of-two-seater-rides/">earlier this year</a>, I wasn’t totally sure what to expect. It’s not quite a full-size electric bike, but definitely not a mini-bike either. It has no pedals, yet it feels like a legit vehicle, not a toy. And while its higher price tag isn’t exactly budget-friendly, the Doble offers something that’s surprisingly rare in the e-bike world: a two-person ride that’s actually fun, compact, and borderline addictive.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 22NOV2025</strong>: Daimler just delivered five new hydrogen semis for trials.</p>

<p>For most of human history, currency was a direct claim on tangible, productive output. Before the abstraction of government fiat or cryptocurrency, value was stored in things that required real work and resources, bushels of grain, livestock, gold, assets with their own direct productive output: horses, and tragically, slaves.</p>
<p>These were the foundational assets of economies, representing a direct link between labor, resources, and stored value.</p>
<p>As we accelerate into an all-electric, all-digital age, this fundamental link is re-emerging, but with a new unit of account. The 21st-century economy, defined by automated industry, robotic, electric transport, and now power-hungry artificial intelligence, runs on a single, non-negotiable input: electricity. In this new paradigm, the real base currency, the ultimate representation of productive capacity, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).</p>

<p>If you want to ditch snow blowing and shoveling forever, Yarbo’s got just the solution. The robotics company that took home a 2023 CES Innovation Award is redefining what it means to have a “smart yard” in all four seasons. Yarbo’s autonomous outdoor robots use advanced sensors, cameras, and algorithms to do the heavy lifting – literally. From snow blowing to mowing to leaf clearing, these machines handle tough jobs with precision, safety, and zero supervision.</p>
<p>Yarbo’s innovative “1+N” design is centered around one core unit (“1”) that can be expanded with multiple modular attachments (“N”) to meet a variety of yard care needs. This design allows users to save space and cost by owning a single core robot instead of multiple separate machines. Customize functionality by adding modules such as Lawn Mower, Snow Blower, Plow Blade, Cutting Disc, and more. Easily upgrade or adapt to different seasons and tasks without replacing the entire system.</p>
<p><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/1N.gif?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>And right now, you can snag a <strong>fantastic discount</strong> <strong>of up to $1,200 at Yarbo’s biggest sale of the year</strong>. Check out the <strong><a href="https://go.yarbo.com/zzeiC">official Black Friday launch deals</a></strong> below – you won’t want to miss these!</p>

<p>Pedego, one of the most recognizable names from the early days of American e-bike brands, is entering a new era. The company has been acquired by the “US-based” ownership group behind the Asian e-bike brand Urtopia, a relatively young, tech-forward electric bike brand known for carbon fiber e-bikes with built-in connectivity and smart features. The result is a newly formed New Pedego Holdings Inc., which both companies are pitching not as a takeover, but as a reboot designed to modernize Pedego and rebuild the dealer network that once made it a retail powerhouse.</p>

And in typical Future Motion fashion, they didn’t just build a bike. They built a weirdly wild, 1970s-inspired electric mini bike that can literally hold you in a wheelie.</p>

<p>The General Motors EV1 has a vital place in electric vehicle history. It mainly served to show two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show a viable path for battery-electric vehicles back in the 1990s.</li>
<li>Some forces are clearly at play to suppress electric cars.</li>
</ol>
<p>GM only leased the EV1, never sold any, and prevented almost anyone from keeping them when it killed the vehicle program.</p>
<p>The automaker ended up crushing the vast majority of them. While a few empty shells exist in museums, they are strictly prohibited from ever driving again. But a new project has surfaced involving what appears to be the only legally owned EV1 in private hands, and the new owner plans to put it back on the road with a modern battery pack.</p>
<p>A YouTube channel called <em>Electrek Garage</em> (no relation to us, though we like the name) posted a fascinating video detailing the acquisition and restoration plan for this unicorn of an EV.</p>

<p>Kandi has become fairly well known in the US for its electric golf carts and work-focused UTVs, but the company has teamed up with Lowe’s and the NFL on something more playful: the Kandi 4P electric golf cart. Sold through Lowe’s with official NFL team liveries, this four-seat neighborhood cruiser is aimed less at the fairway and more at cul-de-sacs, grocery runs, and game-day tailgates. I spent time with a Miami Dolphins–themed 4P in South Florida to see what it can really do.</p>
