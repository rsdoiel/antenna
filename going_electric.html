Less than a year after its initial reveal, Hyundai officially launched
its off-road-friendly IONIQ 5 XRT variant in the US and invited us to
Palm Springs to test it out. This is a
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai </a>IONIQ through

new drive mode to help it tackle tougher terrain than its siblings.

As we get ready to exit month two of 2025, the opportunities to test
drive model-year BEVs are starting to arise. The most recent was a trip
to Palm Springs, California, to test out the 2025 Hyundai IONIQ 5. This
flagship BEV saw a mid- refresh for 2025, so I didn’t experience the
most drastic of changes compared to previous versions. In the places
where <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai </a>did
improve the IONIQ 5, however, I noticed savvy upgrades that took
customer feedback into consideration and made an already high-quality
BEV even better.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of February 2025. It may still be cold and snowy in
much of the country, but that doesn’t mean now isn’t a great chance to
start the year off with a fun and efficient electric bicycle! So check
out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next
electric bike.

<p>
Kia’s flagship electric SUV just got a high-performance upgrade. On
Tuesday, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia/">Kia</a> launched the
EV9 GT in South Korea with over 500 horsepower, a sporty new design, and
a price tag just north of $60,000. That’s not too bad for a fully loaded
three-row electric SUV. Following its domestic launch, the sporty new
trim will roll out to the US, Europe, and other global markets. Check it

If you’ve been hanging around in the world of electric bikes for any
decent amount of time, you’ve probably come across Bafang. They don’t
make electric bikes, but they’ve long made many of the components used
by them. I visited the factory
<a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/21/how-electric-bicycle-motors-are-made-bafang-factory-tour/">back
in 2019</a>, and recently returned for a second visit to see what had
changed. Boy, was I unprepared for what awaited me…

Cummins has its eye on hybrid powertrains to help decarbonize the
transport, construction, and mining spaces the operates in. To that end,
the company has acquired the hybrid equipment experts First Mode, and
plans to make the first commercially available retrofit hybrid system
for mining equipment a reality not just soon – but <em>now</em>.

Grapes are sensitive – and when you’re depending on them to have a
certain flavor, a certain acidity, and even a certain smell, the last
thing you want is diesel particulate matter settling on them. That’s
just one of the reasons electric equipment options like Volvo’s electric
wheel loader offer unique advantages to companies like Ästad Vingård.

Last month,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/19/electric-car-will-fall-apart-before-its-battery-pack-does-study-finds/">Geotab</a>
signed a deal with Volvo Group to integrate the manufacturer’s vehicle
data API into Geotab’s telematics platform. It’s the latest in a recent
onslaught of such deals between telematics providers and OEMs that begs
the question: <strong>what’s in it for the OEMs</strong>?

French hydrogen firm Hyvia has been given a stay of execution. The
Commercial Court of Versaille has given Hyvia a few extra weeks to get
through its insolvency proceedings and find a buyer – but, frankly, it
ain’t lookin’ good.
