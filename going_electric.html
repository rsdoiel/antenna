In 2024, the world sold 3.5 million more EVs than it did in the previous
year, according to a new report by Rho Motion. This increase is
<em>larger</em> than the 3.2 million increase in EV sales from the
previous year – meaning that EV sales aren’t just up, but that the rate
of growth is itself increasing.
</p>
<p>
However, an entire year of false political, media and industry
statements might have had you thinking otherwise.

fast and questionably (or clearly) illegal e-bike modes seems to be
coming to an end for the brand.
