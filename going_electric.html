<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them for the industry noobs that they
are. A rebate is a powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome
obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, and down payment
requirements and get you to drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re dealing with any of the above,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tariffs/">but still hope to slide
behind the wheel of a new EV before new tariffs kick in</a>, pay
attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric
ride sooner than you think!
</p>
<p>
<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Kia really, <em>really</em> wants you to buy a
new EV this month!
