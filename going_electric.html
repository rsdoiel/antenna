<p>This fall marks the 25th anniversary of the US launch of the first-gen Toyota Prius — a car that, arguably, has done more to more to shift the market away from fossil fuels than any other single vehicle (more on that in a minute). That means that, in many states, you can now get “antique” or “historic” plates for a modern hybrid.</p>
<p>If that sounds appealing to you, here’s what it might cost to keep that OG Prius on the road for many more years to come.</p>

<p>Solar and storage prices are about to rise after a year and a half of record lows, according to new data from Wood Mackenzie.

That’s because China is changing the rules.</p>

<p>I spent about two weeks driving the Cadillac Escalade IQ all around British Columbia for this review, and I came out of the experience impressed. It proves that large SUVs can certainly be all-electric, but you need to be willing to have a big and heavy battery pack.</p>

<p>Robot mowers have come a long way in recent years, but some still fall into two categories: the ones that need perimeter wires, and the ones that get scared of tall grass. The UBHOME M10 falls into neither, and after testing it over the past few weeks, I’ve come away genuinely impressed. It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.element3.io/">Element3</a> just raised a fresh round of funding to launch the first US commercial lithium extraction plants, and it’s sourcing the lithium from oil and gas wastewater in Texas. That’s a big deal because it means there will be a domestic lithium supply for EVs and battery storage within a few months.</p>

<p>The US Department of Energy (DOE) announced it will spend $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” the US coal industry, claiming it will boost energy production and help rural communities. Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised “beautiful, clean coal” as “essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/01/chevy-cuts-equinox-ev-leases-under-250-a-month/">Lease deals get all the headlines</a>, but 75% of new car buyers still finance their cars, indicating that they want to <em>own</em> their vehicles once the payments are done. If that sounds like you, and you’ve been holding out for relief from sky-high payments, a wave of new EVs are now available with 0% financing — making it one of the best months yet to buy a new EV.</p>

<p>Government researchers in the US and abroad believe we could help decarbonize and electrify the transportation sector with hardy, fast-growing plants that collect the metals needed to manufacture electric vehicle batteries in their roots, then harvest those metals later with a process that’s cleaner and cheaper than traditional mineral mining.</p>

A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows just how dramatic the surge is. Electricity use in the region has tripled since 2000, and it’s expected to jump another 50% by 2035. That’s like adding the current combined electricity demand of Germany and Spain.</p>

And, sure – the taller driving position offers road presence, but when it comes to real-world utility, a proper long-roof wagon can hang with the best of them while offering Teutonic driving dynamics no SUV can match. All it would take to spark a wagon revival in the US is one sleek, solidly built, and <em>affordable</em> entry from a mainstream brand. And VW already has the perfect candidate waiting in the wings. Meet the Škoda Vision O (Passat badges not included).</p>

That “waterproof” pannier that started leaking after the first storm, the multitool that rounded out on its tenth bolt, the lights that faded faster than a dying AA battery. I’ve had my share of disappointments. But over the past decade of nearly daily riding, there’s a small handful of e-bike tools and accessories that have stood the test of time. I’m talking <em>half a decade or more</em> of constant use, surviving rain, dust, sun, and the occasional crash, and still going strong.</p>
