<p>Editor’s note: This article contains mentions of AI-generated sexual
abuse and suicidal ideation that may be disturbing to some readers. From
a Beverly Hills middle school where male students created fake nudes of
their female classmates, to the college student whose fight for justice
after seeing her face in deepfake pornography forms the core of the
documentary, “Another Body,” it is clear that the recent rise of
AI-generated sexual abuse, primarily deepfakes, have given students easy
access to create nonconsensual sexually explicit content of their
peers.</p>
