<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Americans, in many ways, are more scientifically illiterate now than
they have ever been. We live in an age where the most preposterous and
unjustifiable beliefs can be reaffirmed with a simple Google search.</p>

defeats Hawaiʻi with second half charge in first look at Foster’s

<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Sept. 2 at 11:24 p.m.</em> HONOLULU – There
were debuts galore Saturday afternoon in Honolulu. And they ran the
gamut – the Bruins in the Big Ten, coach DeShaun Foster at the team’s
helm, redshirt senior Ethan Garbers at starting quarterback and
associate head coach and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy’s NFL-style
offense.  Halfway through the duel, though, lackluster was the fitting
term for each new look.</p>
