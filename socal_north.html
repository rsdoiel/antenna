      <h1>Space Force Teams with Universities to Advance Sonic Boom Research in California</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>Vandenberg Space Force Base is collaborating with Brigham Young University, California State University Bakersfield, and other partners to advance research on rocket launch acoustics and sonic booms through the ECOBOOM program. This initiative, launched in June 2024, focuses on monitoring and analyzing the noise impacts of rocket launches on nearby communities.</p>
<p>Using data collected from 23 launches and 477 recordings across eight acoustic monitoring stations, researchers employ advanced modeling software to study sonic boom patterns influenced by factors such as weather and wind direction. Seasonal variations have been observed, with larger boom footprints during fall, winter, and spring compared to summer.</p>
<p>The program integrates findings into operational planning, enabling Vandenberg SFB to optimize launch trajectories while minimizing disruptions to populated areas, demonstrating a commitment to balancing national defense priorities with environmental and community stewardship.</p>
<p>Beyond sonic boom research, Vandenberg SFB conducts comprehensive conservation and environmental management for over 330 wildlife species, including 17 threatened or endangered species, as outlined in the Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>As a strategic hub for space launches and national defense, Vandenberg supports critical operations, including missile testing and space command training, while maintaining a strong commitment to safeguarding natural resources and fostering community partnerships.</p>
