<p>A message to our students: We write today with hearts full of sadness
and outrage. Your university administration has failed you. It has
failed to protect you and support you, and in doing so, it has made
clear where its priorities lie: in silencing protests and maintaining
the status quo at the cost of your rights of free speech and
assembly.</p>

<p><em>This post was updated May 5 at 9:50 p.m.</em> LONG BEACH – A
huddle disbanded as limbs collapsed to Walter Pyramid’s floor in sheer
jubilation. Senior outside hitter Ethan Champlin, his final swing now
adorned in glory, side-stepped to his fall on the service line.  The
ball cradled in Skyler Varga’s palms at the net as he arced the ball
back toward the Bruins.  It took a moment.  The Beach’s outside hitter
paused for contemplation – followed by an unforgiving grasp of reality
as his eyes drank in a vibrant mound of blue and gold rejoicing on his
home floor.</p>
