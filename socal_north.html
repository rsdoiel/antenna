<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>
<em>Introduction:</em>
</p>
<p>
In the dystopian world of Panem, where each choice defines destinies and
the division between good and evil is blurred more often than not, “The
Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” dives into the core
conflicts present in the entire Hunger Games franchise. Themes of
desperation, morality, and the human condition are revisited by diving
into the origin story of the tyrannical President Coriolanus Snow, the
originator of the state of the Games that we saw in the main franchise.
For ASCIT’s annual free movie night held on November 19th, 2023, Caltech
students were teleported into the world of the twelve districts and the
Capitol to follow along as Coriolanus goes from ambitious student to
cold-blooded manipulator.

ballad of songbirds and snakes</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>Introduction:</em> In the dystopian world of Panem, where each
choice defines destinies and the division between good and evil is
blurred more often than not, “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds
and Snakes” dives into the core conflicts present in the entire Hunger
Games franchise. Themes of desperation, morality, and the human
condition are revisited by diving into the origin story of the
tyrannical President Coriolanus Snow, the originator of the state of the
Games that we saw in the main franchise. For ASCIT’s annual free movie
night held on November 19th, 2023, Caltech students were teleported into
the world of the twelve districts and the Capitol to follow along as
Coriolanus goes from ambitious student to cold-blooded manipulator.</p>

<p>The most fundamental tenet of a Caltech undergraduate education is
training students to collaborate effectively in order to solve the most
difficult problems in science and math today. And yet, the sanctity of
every common lounge space in every undergraduate house, the home of
collaboration, is at risk due to a recent renovation effort by the
Housing Office.</p>

lost all of them. Personally, I scored a whole one point for my team

<h2 id="the-honor-code-is-falling-apart-we-are-the-solution.">The Honor
Code is Falling Apart – We are the Solution.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>Caltech Faculty members have begun reevaluating the relevance of the
Honor Code in their classrooms because they are losing faith in the
ability of the student body to fulfill their responsibilities to the
Honor Code. Students are worried about the state of the Honor Code
because they think they are the only ones following it, believing
faculty and administrative offices on campus are not held accountable
for honor code violations. The number of reports of honor code
violations has been elevated since the 2015-16 academic year, but during
the year of online learning, reports of honor code violations further
increased to 3 to 4 times the baseline case load. While the number of
reports of honor code violations has fallen to the 2015-16 level, the
stress placed on the Board of Control pushed it to the verge of failure.
The BoC system implemented almost 100 years ago was not built to process
this high case load, not built to withstand the ire of distrustful
members of the Caltech community, and not built to protect a community,
who, whether due to disinterest, fear, or overworkedness, is in some
part negligent of the implications and applications of the Honor
Code.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of buzz about the vague spectre of “admin”

inclusivity, the <em>Tech</em> interviewed Dr. Kevin Gilmartin, Vice

conversation focused on two specific issues: Blacker Hovse’s Potato
Cannon, and Ricketts Hovse’s Rotation Dinner Skits.</p>
