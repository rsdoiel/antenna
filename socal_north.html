<p>A research team including UCLA doctoral students and professors found
that sea urchins help maintain the resilience of coral reefs despite
human activity. In the study published in February, researchers measured
algae height in Pacific coral reefs both in the presence and absence of
herbivorous sea urchins and fish, determining that even when most fish
had disappeared, a robust urchin population helped reduce algal height
and improve reef health.</p>
