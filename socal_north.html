      In the crucible of the Iraq War, Chief Master Sgt. Randolph, then an Airman First Class, experienced a moment that would forever alter the trajectory of his life. Deployed in 2005, his convoy was struck by a landmine, an event that ripped through the landscape and left an indelible mark on his mind and soul.

“The explosion… the aftermath… it's something you can never truly forget," Randolph said, his voice carrying the quiet weight of a veteran. While he physically recovered, the invisible wounds festered, suppressed mental health issues lurking beneath the surface for years. Finally, rising to the rank of Senior Master Sergeant, he made the courageous decision to seek help.<br/>

Randolph, 30th Security Forces Squadron senior enlisted leader, then an Airman First Class, poses on a Humvee in July 2005 that was damaged by a landmine during a convoy to Mosul, Iraq, on June 22, 2005. Randolph and his team posed relative to the positions they were sitting in the Humvee during the attack. All three Airmen were awarded Purple Hearts for their injuries. While he physically recovered, Randolph endured years of suppressed emotional strain stemming from the incident. Randolph recently shared his story during a Hawk Talk event at Vandenberg Space Force Base, emphasizing the resilience of service members and the critical need for mental health support.' /> <br />
