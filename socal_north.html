of baseball is officially back! As a longtime Dodger fan, some of my

game. From the sound of the thousands of fans cheering in the stadium,
to enjoying garlic fries […]

men’s volleyball downs Long Beach to seize back-to-back titles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated May 5 at 9:50 p.m.</em> LONG BEACH – A
huddle disbanded as limbs collapsed to Walter Pyramid’s floor in sheer
jubilation. Senior outside hitter Ethan Champlin, his final swing now
adorned in glory, side-stepped to his fall on the service line.  The
ball cradled in Skyler Varga’s palms at the net as he arced the ball
back toward the Bruins.  It took a moment.  The Beach’s outside hitter
paused for contemplation – followed by an unforgiving grasp of reality
as his eyes drank in a vibrant mound of blue and gold rejoicing on his
home floor.</p>
