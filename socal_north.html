UCLA students must scrutinize USAC candidates on Palestine and free
speech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>In this year’s USAC elections, we will have 40 candidates, each with
a unique set of viewpoints on a host of issues. While voters hear out
each candidate and what they have to offer, I encourage them to pinpoint
a candidate’s position on two key issues: Palestine and free speech.</p>

anti-war protests at universities across the nation, UCLA is tasked with
upholding the principle of freedom of expression.</p>
