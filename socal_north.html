<p><em>This post was updated May 5 at 9:50 p.m.</em> LONG BEACH – A
huddle disbanded as limbs collapsed to Walter Pyramid’s floor in sheer
jubilation. Senior outside hitter Ethan Champlin, his final swing now
adorned in glory, side-stepped to his fall on the service line.  The
ball cradled in Skyler Varga’s palms at the net as he arced the ball
back toward the Bruins.  It took a moment.  The Beach’s outside hitter
paused for contemplation – followed by an unforgiving grasp of reality
as his eyes drank in a vibrant mound of blue and gold rejoicing on his
home floor.</p>
