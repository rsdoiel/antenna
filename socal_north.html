<p>It’s the beginning of term, and the new frosh class are met with
their first challenge of the year: attempting to socialize with random
upperclass students. Each night for their first week at Caltech they
rotate, attending events from all the houses, trying to find the perfect
fit for their four years at Caltech. Then comes the cannon fire, and
rotation comes to an end. The end of rotation brings every frosh a new
housing assignment they have to move into. A very exhausting day follows
as frosh move across campus, the dread of the boat problem and the first
week of sets lingering overhead all the while.</p>

<p>A common concern heard among the undergraduates on registration day
these past few terms is “there aren’t enough hums!”. Broadly referring
to all Humanities and Social Science (HSS) courses offered in a given
term by the word ‘hum’, what specifically does the statement mean? That
there aren’t enough advanced humanities courses being offered in any
given term (i.e. not enough_ total <em>HSS courses)? That there isn’t
enough breadth of courses to satisfy their interests (i.e. not
enough</em> “interesting”_ HSS courses for any given student)? That
there aren’t enough courses that fit into their schedule (i.e. not
enough HSS courses <em>at a given time</em>)? The Academics and Research
Committee (ARC) has compiled the following data to understand the source
of the concern.</p>

<p>At the start of 2023, students began to hear rumors of major
renovations coming to Braun Athletic Center and Scott Brown Gym. We
heard that the distribution of gym equipment would be changing, that the
athletic training office would be moving, and circulating most of all,
that the locker rooms were to see major renovations. For students and
members, athletes and otherwise, this was an exciting change. The locker
rooms had been outdated for a long time, both in their facilities and
the ideas they reflected, and in April 2023, this much needed change
began.</p>

Unstandardization of Caltech: Bathrooms</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-17, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>After arriving at Caltech, one of the first things I noticed about
the campus once I finally had time to wander around was that, from what
I could tell, this place lacked a consistent architectural style.
There’s a mix of Spanish-style architecture like Beckman Institute, more
modern-looking buildings like Chen, and silly guys like the Beckman Hall
(and also ugly ass ones like Downs-Lauritsen). This mixing of styles
continues inside, with some buildings like Bridge keeping their
old-fashioned style but Gates-Thomas deciding to modernize. That’s all
neat and cool, but it goes a little further than what you see walking up
and down the halls. The place I noticed these tiny details is a sacred
place where you have time to yourself, a place free of distraction, a
place of relief: the bathroom.</p>

<p>On Friday, September 29, 2023, the Caltech Graduate Students and
Postdocs United (C/GPU) hosted a rally to celebrate reaching a majority
of signed union authorization cards. For those unfamiliar or just
confused about the process, this was not a vote. Those in charge of the
union effort made it clear that according to their recorded numbers,
enough graduate students and postdocs currently support moving forward
to a vote to force the issue. These same leaders have also been very
vocal about the fact that a vote would not have needed to be forced if
the administration had simply consented early on to let us hold one.</p>

Late last year, during the aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns that kept

Nursing Homes Are Becoming ‘De Facto Mental Health Centers’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-09-21, from: The LAist</p>
<p>All over California, people with serious mental illness are living in
nursing homes that experts say weren’t meant to care for them — an
investigation by LAist, APM Research Lab and The California Newsroom
reveals. Some call it “warehousing” and say the practice might violate
federal laws. The consequences have been deadly.</p>

<p>The Caltech experience for women and non-binary folks is undeniably
influenced by the fact that the majority of people at this school are
men. Only in the past few decades has the undergraduate gender ratio at
Caltech approached some semblance of balance. Enrollment statistics for

<p>In 1988, Mobil Oil Field foreman Michele Judd stood on top of an oil
platform in Paso Robles, California. She did not give much thought to
the day ending or the stars coming out. To Judd, this simply signified
that the workday was finishing and most of her workers would be heading
home, leaving just a skeleton crew to work through the night. But years
later, she remembers looking up into the darkening sky, wondering what
it would be like working on projects high in space rather than working
with materials deep in the earth.</p>

</p>
<p>
<span class="first-letter">S</span>cience is a labor of love—love of
discovery, and love of pushing the limits of current human knowledge and
ability. As graduate student and postdoctoral workers at Caltech, we
nourish our cell culture lines on weekends, stay up all night observing
through telescopes, spend hours welding devices, and travel long
distances to study our world. We care deeply about our science, and we
want the best environment in which to do that science.
</p>
<p>
Some aspects of our environment support our ability to do strong
science, such as access to cutting-edge technologies, brilliant
colleagues, and compelling classes and seminars. Other factors hinder or
harm that ability, particularly for colleagues disadvantaged by our
current system: for example, wages that fall short of the cost-of-living
year-after-year, unexpected changes or cuts to our health insurance,
unsafe laboratory environments, and a history of institutional failures
to address
<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation" target="_blank">mistreatment
by faculty</a>. To address these issues and create the best environment
in which to do our science, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
across the Institute are in support of forming a union
(<a href="https://caltechgpu.org/" target="_blank">known as Caltech
Graduate Researchers and Postdocs United, or C/GPU</a>). Unionization
will allow us to collectively bargain for better working conditions and
codify them in an enforceable contract.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, administrators leading Caltech are actively opposed to
graduate students and postdoctoral scholars forming a union. In an email
to graduate students in May 2023, Dean of Graduate Studies David Chan
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXukjDK-flgHf3GVaG3XydVXx1--mu0N/view" target="_blank">bluntly
wrote</a>, “As Institute leadership, we believe that unionizing is not
in the best interest of our students or community”. Provost David
Tirrell
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLUWlNWjYpTkfTCwK82BtoEVvIfYBkx6/view" target="_blank">expressed
a similar sentiment</a>, writing in March that unionization would alter
the “direct” and “collaborative” relationship between administrators and
students.
</p>
<p>
Why is Caltech against us unionizing? A union will better position us to
negotiate for the best conditions to do our science by challenging the
current power dynamic where Caltech administrators unilaterally control
all aspects of our working conditions. Case-in-point: year after year,
the Graduate Student Council has presented Caltech with data-driven,
explicit, well-formulated requests for stipend increases that meet the
rising costs of living. Each time, Caltech has given marginal increases.
Then, after the public debut of Caltech Grads and Postdocs United in
December 2022, Caltech announced a sudden $5,000 increase in the
graduate student stipend. In a message to faculty, Provost Tirrell
explained that this stipend increase would be funded
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKYRA3hDGrXhHxv6AK8Qd_F8x75NCVaf/view" target="_blank">without
impacting research budgets</a>. Despite years of pleading from the
Graduate Student Council, it took the specter of a union and a possible
shift in power to finally persuade Caltech to increase stipends, and
prove that they could do so without burdening lab funds. It is no wonder
that on May 10th, 2023 the Caltech Graduate Student Council
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ax-s1AXrfOIom9NmvfHTAdtgDRpJIQrh/view" target="_blank">released
a statement</a> of support for C/GPU!
</p>
<p>
Caltech administrators have repeatedly sent graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars a link to a
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OkiteVPXrsV45FCRvB5bHt51zpEwVGvw/view" target="_blank">website</a>
which provides supposedly unbiased “facts about, and resources for,
current discussions about the potential Caltech graduate student and
postdoctoral scholar unionization.” We were dismayed that much of the
information in Caltech’s “Know the Facts” page lacks evidence, and
worse, some of the “facts” are blatantly misleading. For example, they
provide an example where “if only 100 out of 500 eligible people vote,
51 voters would determine the outcome for all 500 people in the
bargaining unit, as well as future graduate students and postdocs”,
which would suggest that graduate student and postdoctoral scholar union
elections often have low (20%) participation. Twenty percent
participation is far lower than any graduate student worker and
postdoctoral scholar union election in recent history. Examples include
<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/31-RC-308858" target="_blank">USC</a>,
<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-RC-309139" target="_blank">Johns
Hopkins</a>, and
<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/01-RC-305762" target="_blank">Yale</a>,
where union elections saw participation by 60%, 67%, and 63% of the
voting body, respectively, with over 90% voting in favor in all three
elections.
</p>
<p>
In fact, much of the language on Caltech’s webpage is similar to
anti-union webpages at other universities. Several of these institutions
have hired top-dollar law firms to prevent graduate students from
unionizing; Duke University
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/punching-in-grad-student-unions-face-duke-university-challenge-28" target="_blank">famously
funded</a> a legal campaign to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/05/23/nlrb-revisit-ruling-that-granted-graduate-students-right-organize-employees/" target="_blank">challenge
the law</a> that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/23/are-they-students-or-are-they-employees-nlrb-rules-that-graduate-students-are-employees/" target="_blank">graduate
students are workers</a> with the right to unionize. Curiously, large
sections of the Caltech administration’s webpage are identical to a page
about graduate student unionization
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XOYyqEnLOyVh5WOJQ_Bpm68RsOSCAioK/view" target="_blank">published
by Duke</a>. Caltech graduate students and postdocs have taken the time
to research, fact-check, and write
<a href="https://caltechgpu.org/be-informed/" target="_blank">critical
clarifications</a> to Caltech’s “Know the Facts” webpage.

<p>
Graduate student and postdoctoral workers drive the research and
discovery happening at Caltech. We put all of our intellect (and most of
our waking hours) into the generation, analysis, interpretation and
dissemination of critical scientific advances. We do this work because
we love science and discovery, but at the same time many of us struggle
to pay for rent, healthcare, childcare, and international scholar visa
and legal fees. Some of us deal with unsupportive or abusive advisors,
and work in research settings with very real health hazards.
Unionization can address these challenges and enhance our ability to do
the scientific work that we love.
</p>
<p>
The undersigned graduate student workers and postdoctoral scholars have
collectively contributed over a century of research and teaching years
at Caltech. We have seen the serious hardships many fellow researchers
have faced while trying to do their science at Caltech. We came here to
work with and learn from Caltech’s world-class faculty, and we believe
that a union will allow us to achieve more together. Many faculty,
having once been junior researchers themselves, have expressed support
for graduate students and postdocs unionizing at Caltech. We advocate
not only for ourselves, but for all of our colleagues, especially those
in more vulnerable positions. With a union, we will have the ability to
bargain for long-overdue improvements and protections, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Formal grievance procedures and third-party arbitration that puts
students and survivors first, similar to mechanisms that the
<a href="https://thetech.com/2022/02/03/unionize-students-first" target="_blank">graduate
student union at MIT</a> is fighting for and the
<a href="https://uaw5810.org/2022/10/03/major-victory-on-workplace-bullying-and-abuse/" target="_blank">unions
at UC have won</a>
</li>
<li>
Protections and rights for
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/protests-uc-san-diego-agrees-not-fire-chinese-postdoc-raised-concerns-rcna43737" target="_blank">international
students and scholars</a>
</li>
<li>
Written, contractual stipend increases that reflect cost of living every
year for graduate students and postdocs
</li>
<li>
Guaranteed funding to transition away from toxic lab environments,
<a href="https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/contract" target="_blank">conditions
that Columbia</a> academic workers recently won in their contract
</li>
<li>
Affordable health insurance and child care
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have done our homework and made the decision that forming a union is
necessary to ensure that we and future scholars at Caltech are best
positioned to make discoveries that can positively change our world.

<i>Young Juliet Drinkard with her parents in 1951.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Juliet Drinkard has always loved history, so much so that at the age of
16, she entered an essay-writing competition to highlight a significant
African American in history. She chose mathematician and surveyor
Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806), won the contest, and was crowned Queen of
Los Angeles’ “Miss Negro History Week” in 1969.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the tour she organized and scripted for a family reunion in
1986 large enough to fill two tour buses that caravanned through many of
Los Angeles’ historic areas, starting at Watts Towers, ending in
Hollywood, and of course allowing for a shopping stop at Santee Alley.
And although she moved out for years-long stretches, she still lives in
the huge South Central house she was raised in, purchased by her parents
in 1954, which she describes as “looking like a big ship.”
</p>
<p>
Although living in the home can be bittersweet now that her folks are
gone, she has special memories of eating family meals looking out of the
big picture windows of the breakfast room into the backyard at her
father’s lush garden, which she says was “like being in a professional
nursery.”

<i>The Drinkard Family Home. </i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Juliet’s family home was built in 1910, like many of the other houses in
the neighborhood.  She describes her parents trying to modernize the
house, painting the dark wood white, removing the coffered ceilings and
some of the built-ins.  Juliet tried to convince her parents not to make
these renovations.  She says that “Even at 11, I liked looking at older
buildings,” both her own house and those of her relatives.  Juliet
especially likes the opportunities that participating in Conservancy
events offers to get inside of homes and other buildings that she
wouldn’t otherwise have access to. 
</p>
<p>
Her parents both moved to Los Angeles from the south, her mother from
Louisiana her father from Alabama.  Her father and his brother lived
with their uncle, who “bought a tiny house on a street called “Success”
in Compton,” notes Juliet.  Her parents met through an uncle on her
mother’s side; they dated for a year and got married, spending their
honeymoon night at the Clark Hotel on Central Avenue.  Juliet describes
the special experience of being able to visit the Clark Hotel in the
1980s.  
</p>
<p>
Juliet’s commitment to historic preservation intensified when she
started working in downtown Los Angeles in the 1970s.  “I went over to
see the Bunker Hill area, and learned that the Victorian-era homes had
been bulldozed.  I felt sick.  That area should have been preserved…
something should have been done,” she says, adding “It’s important –
that’s a part of the history of Los Angeles.”

<i>Newspaper clippings of 1969’s “Negro History Week” where 16-year-old
Juliet was named Queen.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With her passion for Los Angeles history, it was inevitable that Juliet
would find her way to the Los Angeles Conservancy as a member and
volunteer (her first assignment was the 2014 special tour We Heart
Garden Apartments).  She supports the organization “to make a difference
in preserving Los Angeles’ history.”  She loves to explore Los Angeles,
and take friends and visitors to many places around town, with a special
affection for historic locations.  She observes, “there’s so much to do
and see in our own hometown!”   
</p>
<p>
One of Juliet’s favorite historic places to visit is Frank Lloyd
Wright’s Hollyhock House.  She went to visit three times in a 7-year
period before Covid.  She said every time she went, she saw something
different, and just loved standing in the space and looking around to
get the feeling of the place. 
</p>
<p>
Two of her other favorite historic locations in L.A. are Union Station
and the Farmers Market, both formative places in her childhood that she
still loves to visit. She describes going to the Farmers Market in the
early 1960s as an 11 year old.  Her mother “worked for a lady whose
apartment overlooked the Farmers Market,” and one time her mom gave her
five dollars and let her explore the shops on her own.  She remembers
how exciting that was. “I bought a little box of pastel chalks for
$4.95,” which she says she still has to this day. 
</p>
<p>
She describes going to Union Station frequently with her parents when
she was young, “starting in the 1950s; relatives were always coming and
going.”  As a child, she would look through the window at the Fred
Harvey restaurant – she wanted to go in but never did.  It was a real
pleasure for her to volunteer when the L.A. Conservancy held an event to
celebrate the grand opening of the Imperial Western Brewing Company in
2018, in the former Fred Harvey restaurant space, which had sat empty
for decades.  She says, “My dream came true.  Over 60 years later, I’m
walking through the door, sitting and eating inside.”

<i>Congratulations to the selected recipients of the L.A. Conservancy’s
Legacy Business Grant!</i> The five legacy businesses of the first round
of our $5,000 grants have been selected and we’re thrilled to introduce
them to you: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
88 Gifts Shop (1987) in L.A.’s Chinatown 
</li>
<li>
Candelas Guitars (1947) in Boyle Heights 
</li>
<li>
El Aguila Bakery (1973) in El Sereno  
</li>
<li>
Gardena Cinema (1976) in the City of Gardena 
</li>
<li>
SIKA (established in 1992) in Leimert Park 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
From an essential neighborhood shop selling everything from houseware
items to plants to a rare, affordable single-screen movie theatre, these
locally-owned businesses boast a combined age of more than <i>200
years</i> in operation in their neighborhoods and communities. They also
represent the essence of L.A.’s legacy businesses: long-standing
neighborhood anchors where people connect, memories are made, and a
sense of community is nourished. 
</p>
<p>
We hope that their stories demonstrate the value of longtime businesses
and that you hurry out to patronize their business in the very near
future!

</p>
<p>
 For over 30 years, the original location of 88 Gifts Shop (88 Gifts)
was at 711 North Broadway in BC Plaza. In 2020, owner Annie Ma was
forced to relocate her business to its present location. 
</p>
<p>
Ma’s shop sells housewares, plants, and a variety of Lunar New Year
gifts to neighborhood residents and tourists. Perhaps most notably, 88
Gifts sells Chinese-language newspapers to Chinatown’s elders, allowing
them to remain in touch with news events both here and abroad 
</p>
<p>
Still feeling the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this grant
will make it possible to pay for rent increases and avoid another
relocation.

<p>
Brothers Porfirio and Candelario Delgado-Flores moved from Mexico to Los
Angeles in 1947 and brought with them a burgeoning music business that
specialized in custom guitar marking. The store’s clientele includes
famous artists like José Feliciano but it’s also a source of community
pride, giving back to Boyle Heights in many ways including the creation
of a 501c(3) nonprofit that provides free music lessons to local youth. 
</p>
<p>
After closing for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Candelas was

El Aguila Bakery was established by Apolinar Casillas in 1973 and has
been a beloved fixture in L.A.’s El Sereno community ever since. With a
loyal, multi-generational clientele, El Aguila prides itself on its
authentic Mexican sweet breads, cakes, tamales, and so much more! The
bakery also supports the community by giving back to local institutions
such as the city, schools, and places of worship.  
</p>
<p>
But the bakery’s authentic flavors come at a cost. When ingredient
prices rose more than 200%, the bakery had to increase its prices,
causing sales to slump. This grant will allow them to cover increased
costs and make payments to necessary vendors.

Gardena Cinema is a single-screen movie cinema built in 1946 and
operated by the Kim family since 1976. It’s the only such theatre
located Gardena and has provided affordable entertainment options for

together and have meaningful experiences: in addition to their unique
film slate, Gardena Cinema also hosts cinema potlucks, popcorn happy
hours, and more. 
</p>

A combination of the pandemic and personal health challenges forced the
cinema to be closed for 32 months. The grant will provide them with a

Sika, an institution of Leimert Park Village, has been specializing in
custom jewelry, African art, clothing, and other goods for 30 years.
 Sika, the store’s owner, weathered a downturn in the economy in the
2000s when many businesses left the Village. His resilience has
commanded the love and respect of the Leimert Park community and, today,
despite concerns about gentrification and displacement Sika remains at
the heart of the neighborhood as a cultural gathering place.

<h2>
<b>ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAM</b> 
</h2>
<p>
When we first announced the grant program in November of 2022, it was
the culmination of more than two years of advocacy, dedicated to raising
awareness about the importance of legacy businesses throughout Los
Angeles County. 
</p>
<p>
Longtime businesses add to our rich history and culture. These community
anchors have long been one of the focal points of the Conservancy’s
work, from responding to threats of demolition to providing technical
assistance. We saved the original McDonald’s from demolition in the
’90s, brought funding for the rehabilitation of the Formosa Cafe’s
Pacific Electric Red Car, and rallied to designate Norms on La Cienega,
Tom Bergin’s on Fairfax, and Otomisan Japanese Restaurant in Boyle
Heights as Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM). In late 2019, we proudly
launched a Legacy Business initiative to raise awareness about and
support for these important places in L.A. County. 
</p>
<p>
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we understood the immediate threat and
unthinkable challenges facing longtime business owners. Thanks to Wells
Fargo, we’ve been able to expand our legacy business initiative to
include a grant program. This grant provides $5,000 to ten (10) eligible
small businesses that have operated and contributed to their community’s
history and/or identity for at least 20 years and have less than 25
full-time employees. 
</p>
<p>
So far, the response has been overwhelming. Nearly 400 owners applied
for the first round of grants, making the task of choosing just five
winners almost seem impossible. Please join our Legacy Business Network
and follow us on social media to learn more about our winners and to
stay up-to-date on Round 2 of the L.A. Conservancy’s Legacy Business
Grant Program!

<span class="first-letter">E</span>very Friday, I run a Dungeons &amp;
Dragons adventure at my local game shop. It’s one of my favorite ways to
meet people outside of Caltech. Armed with bags of dice in every color
imaginable, I guide players through zany high-fantasy tales and lay out
puzzles for our team of intrepid heroes to solve.
</p>
<p>
But tonight’s D&amp;D session isn’t your standard lair-crawling,
monster-slashing module. Tonight, I’m running an adventure that doubles
as science outreach. I still have plenty of classic D&amp;D hijinks
planned, but as a battery chemist, I’ve put my own spin on the story.
I’ve written different types of real-world batteries into the game
mechanics, and I’ve plotted a tale that will show my players how those
batteries work as they use a battery-powered device to defeat this
week’s villain. As people start to join my table, introducing themselves
or chatting about their characters, I’m excited to see how they’ll
approach the science-themed adventure I’ve laid out.

<p>
My battery-based D&amp;D module was developed with the assistance of the
<a href="https://stemap.org/" target="_blank">STEM Ambassador
Program</a> (STEMAP), an outreach training program that helps scientists
design their own community engagement activities. I had a little
experience leading community outreach, though mainly through programs
developed by someone else. STEMAP taught me to design my own outreach
program, and their approach surprised me in its difference from the work
I’d done previously.
</p>
<p>
STEMAP prioritizes building trust between scientists and the community,
instead of a strict focus on teaching science. Rather than reaching out
to conventional places of learning like schools, libraries, or museums,
STEMAP encouraged us to look for places where science outreach doesn’t
usually happen, like game stores or tattoo parlors,
<a href="https://stemap.org/engagement-activities/" target="_blank">among
others</a>. Looking beyond the obvious venues allowed us to reach people
who don’t, or can’t, engage with science in those spaces. And instead of
showing up with a demonstration already planned out or with activity
kits already in hand, we spent time talking to leaders and
representatives of the focal group—the group we wanted to work
with—about the best way to present scientific material before we even
began planning our program.

<p>
This relationship-centered model seems simple, but it fosters an
empathic approach to outreach that seems to be lacking in the modern
scientific community. Too often, scientists fall into the trap of the
“<a href="https://smallpondscience.com/2020/01/18/the-deficit-model-of-science-communication/" target="_blank">deficit
model</a>”: the belief or assumption that skepticism of science stems
from a lack of scientific understanding, and that we do outreach to
teach science to people who lack scientific knowledge. But that approach
devalues the sociocultural factors that influence attitudes toward
science, ignores what people might already know about the topic from
their own lived experiences, and erases the group’s agency in deciding
how and why they want to learn more. The deficit model alienates people
whose
<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/society/how-western-science-is-finally-catching-up-to-indigenous-knowledge/" target="_blank">science
knowledge</a> draws from experiences outside of formal education, who
have historically been
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-racism-in-healthcare-has-led-to-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank">undervalued</a>
by scientific institutions, or whose attitudes toward science stem from
deeply held
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-4-fall/feature/nimby-threat-renewable-energy" target="_blank">values</a>
and beliefs that are challenged by scientific advances. In contrast, a
more empathic, value sharing approach
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/69/4/305/5369893" target="_blank">increases</a>
public interest in science and improves scientists’ connections to their
communities.
</p>

</div>
<p class="c-content__image-caption">
The deficit model sees scientific outreach as a didactic practice,
providing scientific knowledge where it was previously lacking. The
relationship-centered model recognizes and draws on the lived
experiences and existing knowledge of community members.
</p>
<p class="c-content__image-credit">
</p>
<p>
So how can we, as scientists, build authentic and trustworthy
relationships with the communities we want to reach? Below are a few
considerations that we can implement at any stage of the engagement
process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Get to know your audience.</strong> When communicating our
science, trainees are encouraged to “consider your audience,” usually to
get us to think about our audience’s education level. Dig deeper.
Consider your audience’s interests, the tools and resources they have
(or need), and the knowledge or skills they might already have acquired
outside the school system. Use those interests, tools, and knowledge to
build common ground.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Talk to community leaders.</strong> Build your outreach and
engagement programs in collaboration with people who already know your
audience. Ask what the group wants to learn. Listen to, and learn from,
how they already engage with science. Spend time in the space you’ll be
occupying. Resist the urge to guess (or to assume you already know) what
your audience cares about or how they want to engage with the material.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Be your full self.</strong> Engage with your own community,
whether that community is built around shared identities, interests, or
values. That shared connection can be as deep or as frivolous as you
want it to be, but bonding over something important to both you and your
focal group builds trust and invites the public to see you as more than
just your lab coat. Building that trust is just as worthy and important
of a goal as sharing the science, and it will open doors to more
effective and long-lasting relationships with our communities.
</p>
<p>
I encountered a powerful example of these principles in action at a
conference in the summer of 2022. I met a researcher from South Africa
who was working with rural and tribal groups to find more
climate-friendly alternatives to coal mining. Her efforts weren’t
focused on educating those groups on climate change though; as she
explained, they already knew a lot about the effects of climate change
on agriculture from their own lived experiences. They understood the
science of climate change through a different lens, and they knew that
closing coal mines would help fight both climate change and
mining-related illness. But closing the mines would destroy the
economies of their mining towns. Rather than hammering home the negative
impacts of coal mining on the environment, her work focused on building
trust and open conversations with the residents of those towns to ensure
that alternatives to the coal mines would meet their economic and public
health needs.
</p>
<p>
These principles can be applied just as easily in less politically
charged situations, like classroom outreach or my battery D&amp;D
adventure. Though the stakes are much lower, there are clear parallels
in how our focal groups respond when given the freedom and agency to
direct their own engagement with a topic. When we approach outreach with
empathy and openness, we build stronger, more trustworthy relationships
with the communities we want to reach.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
As our party of heroes defeats their last imaginary foe, I look out
across the table at the smiling faces of a team that were strangers to
each other, and to me, not three hours before. Even if they don’t
remember a single thing about batteries, I’ve taken the first steps
towards building an outreach relationship based on trust and mutual
interest. I’ve shown that I’m more than just a scientist, and that I see
them as more than just people who don’t know about batteries. Building
trust through shared values might not be a typical focus during
outreach, but I’m hopeful that by prioritizing those relationships, we
can grow lasting, authentic, and impactful educational partnerships.

Sonya Kolowrat joined the Conservancy this year, and jumped in feet
first, participating in our Community Leadership Boot Camp and joining
the Last Remaining Seats committee. Development Director Liz Leshin
recently checked in with her. 
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: How did you learn about the L.A. Conservancy, and what compelled
you to join?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: A few years ago, a friend and I were talking about Downtown LA and
all the stunning buildings there, the theaters in particular, and she
told me that her father-in-law (Herb Silverman) is a docent for the
Conservancy-led tours. That was my initial introduction to the
Conservancy.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
I’ve also been exploring downtown a lot and recently started an
Instagram account dedicated to Los Angeles Terrazzo
(<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.instagram.com/losangelesterrazzo/" target="_blank"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="losangelesterrazzo">@losangelesterrazzo</span></a>), and
when I post about the amazing terrazzo I find, I try to research the
building and area, and nearly every time, I am led to the Conservancy
website. It was probably my obsession with the old theaters, and the
possibility of exploring inside of them that led me to join the
Conservancy
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: You participated in the Conservancy’s Community Leadership Boot
Camp this year; what did you get out of the experience</b>?
</p>
<p>
SK: I LOVED my Boot Camp experience! I learned so much – it’s hard to
even encapsulate. I learned about all the amazing resources and research
tools available. I know the process of landmarking a building and what
it takes to do that. I know what city agencies control what, and I know
that the Vista Hermosa neighborhood has way too many uncapped oil wells.
I made friends too! Most importantly, I learned about what I can do as a
citizen of Los Angeles to make my voice heard and help advocate to raise
awareness of historic spaces.
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: Which neighborhood do you live in?  And what do you think makes
it distinct?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: I live in Eagle Rock. I love it for the community feel and I love
the location - this unique little pocket between the rest of LA and
Pasadena. It’s got two lovely main streets in Colorado Blvd and Eagle
Rock Blvd that are filled with really special independent retail shops
and restaurants that really seem to support each other. Of course we
have our literal Eagle Rock.
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: You also became a member of the Last Remaining Seats committee. 
What attracted you to that, and what is your favorite part of LRS?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: Last Remaining Seats is such a special and magical series. I work in
the music industry, but I LOVE film and old theaters – the glamour they
hold, the golden age of cinema, and this is such a great merger of that.
</p>
<p>
I met Lia, the Conservancy’s volunteer coordinator at the in-person Boot
Camp meeting, and when we started chatting about the volunteer
opportunities I learned that I could volunteer on this committee, so I
did! It was great timing, and I can’t wait for the next season. I’ll be
at every screening, and part of the appeal for me was really just being
able to be inside these lovely spaces. A film I suggested will hopefully
be shown, and I’m really excited for the entire potential slate, TBA!
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: What case would you make to others for joining and supporting the
L.A. Conservancy?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: If you love your city, it’s important to take an active role in its
upkeep. No matter the cause, one voice CAN make a difference. It can be
something as small as writing a letter. Los Angeles is unique, magical,
diverse and HUGE. There is a lot of work to be done, and it’s so
important to protect these spaces and neighborhoods. The saying “if
these walls could talk” really could define preservation in Los Angeles,
and I feel like the Conservancy is really working hard to make sure that
the future of LA also includes the past, and they can’t do it without
us!

<span class="first-letter">A</span>s an incoming freshman in 2016, I
received my first orange, Caltech-branded T-shirt during orientation. In
cheerful comic sans, it proclaimed “Study, Eat, Coffee, All-Nighter,
Repeat.” The facilitators waxed poetic about how we would bond spending
long nights studying under the bright fluorescent lights of the library,
running problem sets over to their drop boxes at 3 a.m. together, and
enjoying the beautiful sunrises before finally going to sleep. The next
four years were a whirlwind as I desperately tried to stay on top of my
assignments, and it was only in the year after I graduated that I
realized the extent to which I was burnt out by my time at Caltech. I
realized the habits of overwork I developed as a student were working to
my detriment outside of college. As it turns out, I wasn’t alone.

In preparing for this article, I interviewed several recent alumni from
various majors, houses, and extracurricular groups at Caltech. They all
described experiencing burnout, an occupational condition characterized
by exhaustion, lack of passion, and reduced productivity due to chronic
workplace stress. Everyone felt it; we all agreed that overworking
students makes them dislike what they are doing and makes them less
effective at doing it. Each interview underscored an unfortunate truth:
the Caltech undergraduate experience is structured in a way that puts
students at a high risk of burnout and encourages bad work habits that
will serve them poorly as they enter the workforce.
</p>
<p>
Every graduate I talked to remembered struggling to find time for
everything. If their life was in perfect order, if every moment was
scheduled, showers and meals were carefully timed, and leisure
activities were used as a chance to do some of the easier work, only
then was it possible to get all of the coursework done. There wasn’t a
margin for error. There was never a moment to take for yourself, to
think about what you were learning and what it all meant. There was
always another set to do, another experiment to run, another recitation
to go to. If something went wrong, if you got sick or injured, your
whole life tumbled out of control.

<p>
I thought I flourished in that environment, having deadlines that
pressured me to succeed in a short time. If every moment was carefully
structured, then my productivity must have been maximized. If I spent
every spare moment learning, then I must have learned a lot. To an
outside observer, I was successful — I led two clubs, did publishable
research, and kept a high GPA — but under the surface I was always
exhausted, never slept enough, and felt like things were about to fall
apart.
</p>
<p>
Many alumni I spoke to expressed concern that the students at Caltech
were chronically sleep deprived. Some alumni worried that students
aren’t aware of the negative effects of poor sleep habits, including
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation/" target="_blank">reduced
attention span, difficulties with memory formation and critical
thinking, and increased depressive symptoms</a>. Others worried that
students—unaware of the consequences of poor sleep—were not putting in
effort to fix their sleep schedules. Even though I knew the cost of
sleep deprivation during my time at Caltech, I was still unable to
maintain a healthy sleep schedule while also fulfilling my academic
duties. The students I spoke to who did manage to cut enough time out of
their work schedule to sleep often had to give up research, networking,
teaching, or extracurriculars and deal with unbearable stress to make up
the time “lost” to sleep. They didn’t feel they had the opportunities
afforded to students who gave up sleep to get everything done.
</p>
<p>
Many students seem to take a perverse pride in — or at least have a grim
acceptance of — this toxic culture. Students and professors alike look
with awe at those students who are able to excel without appearing to
struggle. This attitude plays into widespread impostor syndrome (the
feeling of being academically out-of-place) among the student body (as
described in the 2022
<a href="https://president.caltech.edu/documents/21447/Caltech_Co-Curricular_Group_C3_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Co-Curricular
Group Report</a>). Students feel that they “don’t belong here” if they
don’t force themselves to maximize their accomplishments at the expense
of their physical and mental health. As a result, poor sleep habits and
poor work-life balance are marks of pride, representing the sacrifices
we make to succeed. They demonstrate how much harder we are working than
everyone else and “prove” that we aren’t impostors. A selfless devotion
to the pursuit of knowledge at the cost of physical and mental health is
the hallmark of the mythical (and perhaps unduly venerated) “Caltech
Genius.”

<p>
Proper sleep hygiene is made even more challenging by work expectations
that force students to prioritize completing their work over healthy
sleep habits. At Caltech, most problem sets are expected to be done
collaboratively. They are intentionally made more difficult than what
one person can do on their own so that they are suitable for a group,
which incentivizes students to work together and penalizes students for
working alone. This system, paired with undergraduate work culture,
promotes work habits that make healthy sleep patterns impossible. Groups
are generally only available at night due to daytime classes and
extracurriculars, so most work gets done between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. In
addition, many sets incorporate information taught up to the due date,
so it often isn’t possible to work ahead of time. Classes at Caltech are
also chronically “under-unitted,” meaning that the actual hours spent by
students on the class far exceed the hours listed in the course catalog.
While intending to create a collaborative environment, the assignment
structure at Caltech inadvertently causes students to spend more time
struggling through homework than thinking critically about what they
have learned.
</p>
<p>
The time pressure undergraduates experience at Caltech forces students
to choose between central aspects of the traditional college experience.
A lot of undergrads at Caltech don’t go to lectures, and many that do
are late or exhausted. I always found this puzzling — here we are with
some of the most accomplished scientists in the world teaching us the
secrets of the universe, and yet we can’t bother to get out of bed for
class. But when every moment has to be strictly scheduled, and lectures
aren’t essential to learn the material, it often becomes a choice
between going to lecture or getting the work done. An hour of lecture
could be used to edit a paper, work on a problem set, or even just catch
up on the sleep missed because of a paper or problem set for a different
class.
</p>
<p>
The culture of burnout at Caltech isn’t the fault of any one person or
group. It’s systemic, and the students and faculty are complicit. The
bad habits that students internalize and often glorify are both
encouraged and taken advantage of by the way classes are structured.
There is a general assumption that students will sacrifice sleep and
career opportunities to get their coursework done, which in turn allows
professors to assign more work. This environment of chronic stress and
poor sleep makes learning that much harder, which makes assignments take
longer, which creates more stress and worse sleep; the result is a cycle
of unhealthy conditions.

These habits don’t magically disappear with an easier workload or a
different institution. I still find myself working at strange hours,
struggling to get up in the morning, and taking on more than my share,
even when my supervisors encourage me to put my mental health first.
Without ingrained healthy work habits, I often find myself ignoring
signs of fatigue and illness to get more work done. Having now worked at
other institutions, I’ve seen how environments that intentionally
prioritize the health and wellbeing of students and staff actually
increase productivity and quality of work. I’m still unlearning the work
and sleep habits I developed at Caltech, but I’m lucky to be surrounded
by coworkers and supervisors who not only encourage me to take care of
myself but model healthy work habits themselves. I’m grateful to have
the experience I gained from Caltech, but it came at the cost of my
health.
</p>
<p>
One night at freshman orientation, in 2016, an admissions officer got up
in front of the assembled class of 2020 and told us that all of us
belonged here, even though we might not feel that way. This school would
be better served if the students and faculty believed this. That means
structuring classes with the goal of most effectively teaching the
information, rather than trying to weed out students who “don’t have
what it takes.” That means both students and faculty recognizing
unhealthy work habits as detrimental and encouraging and modeling
healthy work habits. That means reevaluating class curricula to ensure
that students are not expected to spend more than their unit load worth
of hours doing work for classes. That means mindfully structuring
classes such that students can easily understand the concepts rather
than being mired down in busywork. Caltech is one of the most selective
universities in the country, and everyone here has earned their place.
Students deserve an environment where they are free to learn without
sacrificing their health.

<h2 id="how-the-universe-made-us">How the universe made us</h2>
<p>date: 2022-12-05, from: Caltech Letters (a student blog)</p>
<p>
Have you ever wondered where the particles we are made of come from? In
the words of the late, great Carl Sagan, ‘We are made of star stuff.’
The hydrogen and oxygen in water, the carbon in every life form, the
nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our bones and teeth, the iron in our
blood, and the gold we wear were all made in exotic places in the
Universe. To understand how this came to be, we need to zoom out of your
room, city, and even Earth and take a journey to the edge of the
Universe.
</p>
<p>
Before starting this journey, we will detour to some basic science. What
makes carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and all other elements different? To
answer this question, we have to take a look inside the structure of the
elements. The constituent particles of an element are called atoms,
which are the smallest building blocks of all matter. Atoms are made of
positively charged protons and chargeless neutrons packed tightly into a
highly compact nucleus that is orbited by negatively charged electrons.
The number of protons in the nucleus determines the elemental identity
of the atom. For example, eight protons combine with eight neutrons and
eight electrons to create oxygen, twenty of each combine to form
calcium, and so on. From a pool of a little over one hundred different
elements comes your body and everything we know on Earth. But where and
how did these elements, the basis for our entire existence, originate?
</p>

</p>
<p>
Let us start with the simplest element, hydrogen, which is made of one
proton in the nucleus and one orbiting electron. Hydrogen is present in
the water we drink, the food we eat, and the fuels we put in our cars.
To see where hydrogen first formed, we need to travel back to the start
of time, to the birth of the Universe itself. Astronomers have theorized
that the Universe began with the Big Bang—an explosion with extremely
high energy. Immediately after the Big Bang, bits and pieces of matter
and energy rapidly expanded into the Universe. In these early moments,
however, the environment was far too hot, dense, and chaotic for larger
structures—like atoms and molecules—to form. Hydrogen didn’t appear
until the Universe had spread out and subsequently cooled down—enough
for the first protons, neutrons, and simple atoms to form. Electrons
were formed within the first microsecond (one-millionth of a second)
after the Big Bang. Protons and neutrons began forming shortly after,
within a single second. About three minutes after the Big Bang,
conditions had cooled enough for these protons and neutrons to form a
hydrogen nucleus. This is called the era of nucleosynthesis (i.e., the
synthesis of atomic nuclei). As the Universe cooled down further, these
hydrogen atoms came together under the influence of gravity to form the
first stars of the Universe. Continuing our journey to understand the
basis of our existence, we now turn to these twinkling stars.
</p>
<p>
Humanity has looked at the stars and wondered about our place under them
for hundreds of years. In the bellies of these stars—seemingly serene
dots in the sky—a high-pressure inferno begins to squeeze together atoms
of lighter elements and combine them into heavier ones. Because all
protons are positively charged, they tend to repel each other. However,
the extreme conditions of stellar interiors make them one of the few
places in the Universe where protons can be forced to fuse into a
heavier nucleus. Let’s examine this fusion process more closely. When
two protons and two neutrons are squeezed together, they form the
nucleus of helium. This nuclear fusion process releases enough energy to
power the Sun. Then, three helium nuclei can combine in a multi-step
process to form the nucleus of carbon, a 6-proton element. The fusion of
carbon and helium nuclei leads to an oxygen nucleus containing 8
protons. The process continues. Through successive fusion reactions, the
nuclei of most elements lighter than iron (26 protons) can be formed.
The atomic factories inside stars continuously churn day in and out,
generating all the carbon and oxygen atoms in the Universe. In fact, all
the organic elements inside plants, animals, and even humans once came
from the bellies of stars.

While lighter elements are created in living stars, heavier elements
originate in magnificent, explosive stellar deaths. When a star dies, it
explodes in a phenomenon known as a supernova, an explosion so bright
that it may even look like a second sun in the sky. In the few seconds
of a supernova, more energy is released than during a star’s
billion-year lifetime. In 1054 AD,
<a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~akr/crab_webtifr.html" target="_blank">Chinese
astronomers discovered such a second ‘sun’</a> visible in the daylight
for nearly twenty days. This energy provides ideal conditions for heavy
atomic nuclei to bind together and form even heavier elements, such as
calcium and iron. My own research involves scanning the night sky to
discover new supernovae. We then study how they evolve over time with
the hope of understanding the physics driving the explosion itself, and
the processes involved in making these heavy elements.

There are much heavier elements of course, like gold, that even
supernovae can’t create. So where do these elements form? You might
understand the game by now: we need to travel to places in the Universe
that are even more exotic. After a supernova explosion, what’s left is
an extremely high-density object called a neutron star. It’s so dense
that a spoonful of a neutron star weighs more than the Himalayas! These
highly compact objects provide a gigantic reservoir of neutrons
essential for the synthesis of heavier elements. But to access this
neutron reservoir, we need a way to tear it open. In this pursuit, we
now turn to binary neutron stars. While we started our journey in a
single star, like our Sun, most stars are actually binary (double): two
stars orbiting each other. After both stars in a binary system explode,
the two dense neutron stars left behind eventually spiral into each
other and collide, releasing neutrons heated to billions of degrees.
Heavy elements form in under a second. In 2017,
<a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-led-teams-strike-cosmic-gold-80074" target="_blank">observations</a>
made by Caltech scientists and others helped astronomers discover such a
merger for the first time. The color and brightness of the merger
provided direct evidence for the presence of gold and platinum—it was
like observing alchemy in action!

</p>
<p>
How did these elements, formed billions of years ago, finally make their
way to us? As stars die and explode as supernovae, they release all the
elements they made into space. Similarly, mergers of stellar corpses
also produce explosions that expel all synthesized elements, forming a
cloud of gas and dust. This stardust later forms new stars, like our
Sun, and new planets, like Earth. Astronomers believe that our solar
system formed from one such cloud of stardust called the Solar Nebula
around 5 billion years ago.
</p>
<p>
The origin story of the atoms that make up our muscles, bones and blood,
the jewelry we wear, and the smartphones we use, a story that predates
us by billions of years, is identical for each and every one of us. It
is a story independent of one’s caste, race, religion, or country. Times
are uncertain. No matter what you are going through, remember that we
all are connected by this incredible, better-than-science-fiction story.
You are made of stardust; every bit of you is glorious star stuff. Go
out there and shine!

<h2 id="the-science-of-fear-and-decision-making">The science of fear and
decision-making</h2>
<p>date: 2022-11-15, from: Caltech Letters (a student blog)</p>
<p>
“What is its name? Can I pet it?”
</p>
<p>
“That wasn’t the right response,” I thought to myself, my hands sweating
inside my blue nitrile safety gloves. But instead of saying anything, I
just smiled back at the volunteer, who by this point was far too
enamored with the test animal to pay attention to instructions from me.
</p>
<p>
And the animal in question?
</p>
<p>
A palm-sized, three-ounce adult tarantula.
</p>
<p>
Surprised? Well I was, too. This was meant to be an experiment on fear
and anxiety, and my eight-legged lab partners were supposed to help us
understand how those emotions work by eliciting them from volunteers.
</p>
<p>
Of course, as I learned that day, nothing in an experiment ever goes
exactly according to plan…
</p>
<p>
Still, it was strange that I was getting this many volunteers who seemed
unafraid of my test animals. The fear of spiders is called
arachnophobia, and it is the most common fear among humans. Around 5% of
the human population have this phobia, and in a study run by Graham
Davey at City University London, 75% of the people interviewed were at
least somewhat afraid of spiders.
</p>
<p>
So what exactly was I trying to test with this experiment? Long story
short, I was trying to see how fears could affect how humans make
decisions, and perhaps use the findings to come up with practical ways
to use our emotions to guide our own decision-making.
</p>
<p>
Let’s say that someone is afraid of spiders: Could money incentivize
them to kiss their fears goodbye and touch a spider? Or, in the reverse
sense, could the presence of a spider impede them from collecting money?
We were interested in investigating how fear could control a person’s
decision-making.
</p>
<p>
In the
<a href="https://www.deanmobbslab.com/people" target="_blank">Mobbs
Lab</a>, we constructed large black boxes with holes that allowed people
to stick their entire arms into them. We then placed Easter eggs that
represented different amounts of award money within those boxes. During
each trial, the subject would reach their arm into a box and try to
collect as many of the four Easter eggs as they could. The caveat? There
was a 25% chance the box had a tarantula in it, acting as a stimulus to
induce fear and stopping people from collecting all the eggs.

</p>
<p>
When I first toured the lab, the members showed me the tarantulas, which
were alive, awake, and ready to scare their next subject. As a proud
member of the 75% that feel mildly uncomfortable with spiders, I
shivered as I saw them stretch their legs out and zip around in their
cages. Lab members showed me how to handle them: they noted that wearing
lab gloves was important, and they even fed the tarantulas live
crickets. They told me about not only the spider experiments, but also
other experiments, including one where the fear stimulus was in the form
of a haunted house with actual electric chairs, cockroaches, and rooms
designed for suffocating visitors.
</p>
<p>
It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work on these experiments. I
knew that I wanted to be a part of cool experiments where I could handle
tarantulas and use them to scare subjects, and see how their fear could
affect how they act. Usually, labs performing psychology and
neuroscience experiments on human subjects have resorted to using fake
stimuli for convenience. For example, in past experiments looking at
arachnophobia, subjects were simply shown images of spiders on a flat
computer screen.
</p>
<p>
Later, I learned that the lab wasn’t working with real stimuli just
because it sounded cooler than using fake stimuli. Looking at an image
of a spider simply does not engage the same brain areas and fear
pathways in the brain as actually interacting with a moving, real-life
spider. Two behavioral scientists at Caltech, Professor Colin Camerer
and Professor Dean Mobbs,
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661316301905" target="_blank">contended
in a 2017 paper</a> that using real stimuli is important for obtaining
meaningful experimental results when studying fear.

</p>
<p>
In addition to using realistic stimuli, we designed mini questionnaires
that we gave the subjects before each “spider box” trial, in which we
asked how many eggs they were planning on collecting and how anxious
they felt, since anxiety is the feeling that you experience before a
fear-inducing event. After each trial, we would ask the subject to rate
the fear they had felt while collecting eggs. Along with those
questionnaires, we planned to take an automated, constant stream of
objective biological measurements of the subjects during each trial. One
measurement was a subject’s sweat level, taken using a Fitbit-like
gadget at the subject’s fingertips. Another measurement was the blood
flow in a subject’s face, computed using computer vision techniques on
video recordings taken throughout the experiment.
</p>
<p>
I worked with the team to advertise the research study and recruited an
initial fourteen volunteers to come into our lab to undergo the
experiment.
</p>
<p>
To thoroughly assess our volunteers’ fear of spiders, I gave them thick
packets of questionnaires to fill out, including the
<a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/spider-fear-spq.html" target="_blank">Spider
Fear Questionnaire</a> (SPQ) and
<a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/spider-fear-fsq.html" target="_blank">Fear
of Spiders Questionnaire</a> (FSQ) when they first entered the lab.
After that, I led the volunteers into the experiment room for them to
undergo the experiment. It was at this point when some volunteers would
make comments that revealed how eager they were about meeting the
spiders! It was clear that they would be willing to stick their hands
into the boxes just for the opportunity to pet the spiders, even if the
boxes didn’t contain any money.
</p>
<p>
In a final survey after the volunteers underwent the experiment, we
asked them what their strategies were for grabbing the Easter eggs from
the box. I had naively prepared myself to read about strategies to dodge
the tarantula. Instead, I ended up reading about the strategies that
they used to help protect the spider from their hands, such as by
curling their fingers to stop themselves from poking the spider.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, every subject managed to pick up all the Easter eggs and thus
the maximum amount of money from each box. And what I found when I took
a close look at the results of the spider fear questionnaires was that
none of our volunteers were actually arachnophobic, confirming my
suspicions.
</p>
<p>
Although none of my study participants were fearful enough of spiders to
be classified as arachnophobic, some subjects did show signs of mild
fear. One person jumped up when they felt their hand had rubbed against
the spider when their arm was in the box.
</p>
<p>
Even though there was some variation among the fear scores, we couldn’t
find a relationship between the amount of money people collected and the
spider fear scores; the subjects who had the lowest fear scores and the
subjects who had the highest fear scores collected the same number of
Easter eggs – all of them. And although we had also eagerly collected
reams of physiological data, like sweat levels and blood flow, we
couldn’t correlate the number of eggs collected with any of it either.
</p>
<p>
This was a great example of self-selection bias, where those who
volunteer to participate in an experiment don’t reflect the general
population and lead to skewed results. In my case, those who were less
prone to be fearful of spiders were more likely to sign up for the
experiment. Not having any arachnophobic people in our volunteer pool
became a huge obstacle to eliciting findings from our study.
</p>
<p>
But we weren’t done just yet.
</p>
<p>
Remember those mini questionnaires we painstakingly issued before and
after each trial? It turns out there were patterns within them!
</p>
<p>
By simply looking at the survey data we had collected both before and
after each trial, we could see if the levels of anxiety and fear that
each subject experienced had changed over time, over all the trials.
</p>
<p>
First, we looked at anxiety, which was the fear that subjects felt
before reaching their hand into the box. We found that it decreased the
more trials the subject participated in, which could mean that if you
repeat a scary action over and over again, you could feel less anxious
about performing the action the more you’ve done it before.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, our surveys also revealed that fear during egg collection
stayed the same over all the trials. This meant that the actual feeling
of fear did not change with the amount of egg-collecting experience a
subject had.
</p>
<p>
Our findings show that although we failed to answer our question of how
fear could affect decision-making because of selection bias, we could
still find meaningful patterns of anxiety and fear even among people who
do not have very high levels of fear.
</p>
<p>
A similar analysis on the physiological measurements that we took could
teach us something about how the levels of blood flow or sweat changes
between trials as well. The next step we have planned is to take a look
at our biological measurement data and find out!
</p>
<p>
What are some practical applications of understanding how anxiety and
fear work in humans? It turns out that there are quite a few! For
instance, if we understood better how strong emotions influence how we
make decisions, we might be able to create tools that trigger specific
emotions within us and help us perform better decision-making.
</p>
<p>
In the spider experiment, I wanted to see how fear could deter people
from collecting monetary rewards. This didn’t work out perfectly since
all of our volunteers were undeterred, but we still found out about how
repeated exposures to fear-inducing stimuli could affect fear and
anxiety.
</p>
<p>
This finding could be extended to people with higher baseline levels of
fear, and this fact could help us with coming up with tools that help
people with decision-making.

<p>
Since doing this experiment, I have tried to apply my learnings to help
with my own decision-making. To reduce the time I spent on my phone on
entertainment such as social media and YouTube, one day I decided to
change my phone background to a picture of holes. Since I have mild
trypophobia, the fear of holes, every time I wanted to turn on my phone
that day, I was too scared to do so. Unfortunately, it made me scared of
using my phone even when I really had to for non-entertainment purposes,
so I changed the phone background back to what it was originally by the
end of that day.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, we still have a long way to go before the lessons learned from
this study can be used for practical applications! But I am confident
that continued research into the complex nature of fear could one day
yield deep insights into human behavior, allowing us to better
understand and control our decision-making in the real world.

<p>
For a short time when I was six years old, I was really into rocks.
Armed with a notepad, ruler, and magnifying glass, I’d march to the
neighborhood park to catalog its geology in as much detail as possible.
I still remember the rush of excitement that came each time I
“discovered” a new stone, like no one had ever set eyes on it before. It
was the first time I ever felt like a scientist.
</p>
<p>
That kind of wondrous, wide-eyed exploration is the reason I decided to
pursue research in the first place, albeit more recently as a biology
student (my passion for pebbles has since subsided). This is the realm
of what we call “basic” science, which is termed for its focus on
curiosity-driven discovery rather than any inherent simplicity. Yet the
closer I get to becoming a card-carrying academic, the more I’m forced
to ask myself whether my motivations should be more pragmatic. We
urgently need to solve real-world problems, from global pandemics to
climate change. Why bother developing abstract theories when we could
spend that effort creating new medicines? Even if those theories later
prove to be prerequisites that yield practical dividends, getting there
by curiosity alone seems slower, riskier, more circuitous, and harder to
control.
</p>
<p>
This debate is as old as science itself—and yet I can’t help but feel
suspicious of those who deride basic research as foolishly romantic. I’m
reminded of
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/986790" target="_blank">the
apocryphal story</a> about Michael Faraday who, when challenged by an
audience member to justify the value of some discovery, retorted:
“Madam, what is the use of a newborn child?” Clearly, it would be
ridiculous to judge a person’s future potential based solely on their
defenselessness as an infant. Similarly, when science aggressively
optimizes for immediate utility above all else, it risks missing a
wealth of mysteries we have yet to understand or even conceive. How much
is a fact really worth? What’s the going rate for a flash of insight, a
new model in biophysics, or an entire branch of mathematics? Why did
Newton invent calculus, Darwin follow finches, and Einstein ponder
gravity? The most impactful advances in human history were born of
curiosity alone. And while their initial value is difficult to formulate
in dollars and cents, their ensuing practical ramifications have
revolutionized our lives. “People cannot foresee the future well enough
to predict what’s going to develop from basic research,”
<a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/people/fred.prochaska/courses/ScWk170/s0/Basic-vs.-Applied-Research.pdf" target="_blank">says
George Smoot</a>, a 2006 Nobel Laureate in Physics. “If we only did
applied research, we would still be making better spears.”
</p>
<p>
On its own, applied research is a fundamentally myopic endeavor. We
cannot see the future, and we will never know the answers to our
questions unless we ask them first. We’ll never know which new
discoveries will be made—or how, or when—until we find them, lurking at
the edges of our perception, and yank them into the light. This is the
reality of our existence, as inescapable as death, or entropy, or taxes.
It’s the reason science must always be a defender of curiosity-driven
inquiry.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, today’s academia leaves less room for basic science than
ever before.
<a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21324" target="_blank">Only 17%
of total U.S. R&amp;D expenditure</a> is devoted to basic research—and
while universities performed 58% of it in 2007, that proportion
<a href="https://www.ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20202/academic-r-d-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">has
since dropped</a> to just 48% in 2017. Even federal support for basic
research has stagnated over the past decade (in absolute dollars), as
reviewers and funding agencies
<a href="https://newscience.org/nih/" target="_blank">become
increasingly risk-averse</a>. Taxpayers and policymakers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110530002942/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/26/6724606-funny-science-sparks-serious-spat" target="_blank">bristle</a>
at the idea of underwriting esoteric research without obvious practical
impact. Scientists, forced to devote a growing portion of their time to
chasing vital grants, are incentivized to pursue the kinds of projects
that are more likely to be funded: low-risk proposals with clear,
short-term results. Together, these forces leave curiosity-driven
science in a quiet crisis. Society demands progress, but in the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/TheLivesOfACell" target="_blank">words
of Lewis Thomas</a>, “we’d like to pay less for it and get our money’s
worth on some more orderly, businesslike schedule.”

A breakdown of federal R&amp;D funding from 2000-2017. While the U.S.

<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2019/nsf19321/overview.htm" target="_blank">has
surpassed</a> that of basic science (in absolute dollars).

State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2020</a> (NCSES report).
</p>
<p>
The resulting trickle-down effects are pernicious. In a country where
<a href="https://www.ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20201/u-s-r-d-performance-and-funding" target="_blank">just
3.6% of total R&amp;D funding reaches universities</a>, competition for
those research dollars is intense. Tacitly or overtly, trainees are
encouraged to frame, upsell, and twist their research into the most
“fundable” version possible. In the life sciences—which account for
<a href="https://www.ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20202/academic-r-d-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">more
than half</a> of all academic research expenditure—it is a common
practice to contort grant proposals until they offer some tenuous
translational relevance, so that they might be considered by the
monolithic National Institutes of Health. Even if a basic project is
funded to completion, it can be an entirely different battle to publish
the findings. Peer review at the most prestigious
journals—<em>Cell</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and <em>Science</em>—emphasizes
groundbreaking results with broad applicability, which naturally
incentivizes authors to play up the importance of their work. Those who
publish successfully in “high impact” journals bring in more grant
money, boosting their academic careers. Researchers unlucky enough to be
interested in unfashionable questions have little recourse; when they
fail to publish “well” or to obtain further funding, they are promptly
ejected from the scientific establishment.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>The system now favors those who can guarantee results rather than
those with potentially path-breaking ideas that, by definition, cannot
promise success… Many surprising discoveries, powerful research tools,
and important medical benefits have arisen from efforts to decipher
complex biological phenomena in model organisms. In a climate that
discourages such work by emphasizing short-term goals, scientific
progress will inevitably be slowed, and revolutionary findings will be
deferred.</em>

</blockquote>
<p>
Despite these monumental pressures, pockets of resistance still exist.
<a href="https://arbesman.net/overedge/">New communities are
emerging</a> with the goal of establishing alternative ecosystems
outside of academia, where basic science can flourish.

<a href="https://research.arcadiascience.com/" target="_blank">publishing</a>
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83889" target="_blank">platforms</a>
could help address the limitations and misaligned incentives of modern
peer review. A growing number of private and philanthropic organizations
are starting to invest in riskier, exploratory projects, which might
help to pick up the slack as federal funding slows. These are all
welcome efforts, but we also need fundamental reform—which is where
trainees are uniquely equipped to fight back.
</p>
<p>
To my fellow graduate students: resist the deforming gaze of today’s
academia, which compels the commodification of your innate curiosity.
You have the freedom to direct your research; this is a unique
privilege. Do work that fascinates you, even if you can’t justify its
immediate utility. Share your passion with the world, instead of letting
the world beat it out of you. Tell old friends and first dates about
your work. Blog about it. Present it at conferences. You will feel
pressure to defend your interests in terms of technological advancement
or practical impact, but remember that your curiosity is always worth
your time. Following it isn’t some recreational or ivory-towered
pursuit; it’s the beating heart of what science is all about.
</p>
<p>
After all, basic science is the original science. Since our earliest
sapient ancestors first gazed up at the stars in wonder, we have been
fighting to make sense of the universe. In the same way, our childhood
fixations—whether rocks, space, dinosaurs, or something else
entirely—reveal that there is something universal about our desire to
understand. This search for meaning has been the engine of progress for
our species throughout history. Curiosity is humanity’s most valuable
compass—we must protect it in order to protect our future.

You might be familiar with the idea of quantum mechanics—maybe from a
physics class or your favorite superhero movie. At small scales, the
everyday physics we’re accustomed to starts to break down, and light and
matter take on strange properties.
</p>
<p>
What if we could tap into those properties and harness them for our own
purposes? That’s the idea behind quantum information, which could
dramatically increase the power of our computers and networks in the
coming years.
</p>
<p>
According to graduate student Piero Chiappina, quantum technologies are
poised to revolutionize the way we store and share data, in applications
ranging from chemical modeling to information security.
</p>
<p>
In this far-reaching explainer, Piero gives a crash course in the
physics behind quantum information and offers a peek at the exciting
opportunities these tools might offer in the coming years.

If you’ve ever had a glass of cabernet sauvignon or a cup of oversteeped
tea, you’ll likely be familiar with the dry feeling they leave in your
mouth. That dryness comes from tannins, a type of molecule found in the
leaves and fruits of many plants.
</p>
<p>
But how do tannins cause that drying sensation? Where do tannins come
from, anyway? And what does that mean for your next trip to the wine
aisle?
</p>
<p>
Siobhan MacArdle (PhD ’22) explains how tannins interact with our
mouths, why some wines have more tannins than others, and how to choose
a wine that gives you the perfect mouthfeel.

Science is often viewed as objective, impartial, and absolute. But
humans are inherently subjective, and the ways we perform and interpret
science can change with contemporary social climates and attitudes.
</p>
<p>
What does the influence of sociocultural factors mean for the scientific
method? What happens when cultural and scientific views clash? Can
scientific understanding ever be separated from the social environment
in which that understanding arises?
</p>
<p>
Graduate student Fayth Tan grapples with these questions and examines
the role of cultural context in scientific discovery through the lens of
orchids, femininity, and colonialism in Victorian England.

There are many ways we can reduce our carbon footprints. Small lifestyle
changes like carpooling, taking public transit to work, or ditching
single-use plastics can all add up over time. But some changes, like
switching from natural gas to electric appliances, can have even
farther-reaching impacts.
</p>
<p>
In Los Angeles, building energy use makes up a staggering 40% of carbon
emissions, most of which comes from natural gas appliances.
Transitioning away from natural gas in buildings in favor of universal
electrification, according to recent graduate Cora Went (PhD ’22), is
the only practical way to eliminate this source of greenhouse gas.
</p>
<p>
Cora notes, however, that natural gas providers in California have been
broadly opposed to electrification initiatives—all the while advertising
their support for renewable energy research at universities like
Caltech.
</p>
<p>
In this incisive commentary, Cora details her experiences fighting for
local building electrification and urges scientists to critically
examine the implications of accepting funding tied to fossil fuel
companies.

llustration by Isabel Swafford for Caltech Letters over “Braun
Laboratories at Caltech”, captured by Lev Tsypin
</p>
<p>
In 2019, Stewart and Lynda Resnick—billionaire owners of agriculture
conglomerate The Wonderful Company — pledged a record $750 million to
Caltech to support energy and sustainability research, including a
brand-new 80,000 square-foot research building.
</p>
<p>
This eye-popping figure—the
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/us/resnick-caltech-donation-trnd" target="_blank">second-largest</a>
private donation ever made to a US university—spurred a range of

In a world of scarce research funding, how should researchers grapple
with the dilemma of accepting donations from controversial sources?
Should scientists accept support from organizations whose practices

border in South Africa, the complexity of our current environmental

Etan Rosenbloom is a blogger on L.A. history, a lifelong Angeleno, and a
new L.A. Conservancy member! His
blog<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/" target="_blank">
Etan Does L.A. </a>follows his journey to visit all of the L.A. County
landmarks listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</p>
<p>
We recently asked him to share his “L.A. story” with us and how the
Conservancy’s resources have enriched his life and work.
</p>
<p>
<i>Note: an edited version of this interview appeared in the
</i><i><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.laconservancy.org/" target="_blank">L.A.
Conservancy</a></i><i>’s July/August 2022 newsletter.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>As a lifelong Angeleno, tell us a bit about where you are from and
what sparked your passion for Los Angeles history?</b>
</p>
<p>
My family lived in Silver Lake in the early ’80s, back before it was
hip. My parents like to tell the story of the unstable neighbor next
door who enjoyed throwing statues into our pool! We moved to Altadena
when I was 4, where my parents still live. After college I moved into
the infamous Alexander Ruler of the World apartments, right across from
Paramount Studios – I was “lucky” enough to move in just a couple months
before the owner started painting it dark magenta. Since then, I’ve
lived in Echo Park, Highland Park, and now Valley Village.  
</p>
<p>
Whenever I moved to a new neighborhood, I would read a book or two about
local history. But my passion for Los Angeles history really took off in
September 2021, when I launched my
<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.etandoesla.com/" target="_blank">Etan
Does LA project</a> (more on that later). As I dug into the backstories
of the LA landmarks I was visiting, it became clear very quickly that
there were giant gaps in my knowledge of how this city became itself.
I’ve been hooked ever since.  
</p>
<p>
<b>How did your love of L.A. history and
</b><i><b><a href="https://href.li/?http://www.laconservancy.org/lrs" target="_blank">Last
Remaining Seats</a></b></i><b><i> </i>motivate you to join the L.A.
Conservancy?</b> 
</p>
<p>
It felt natural to join an organization that does so much important work
educating people like me about L.A. history. The endless resources on
your website and social media feeds have informed my blog, Etan Does LA,
and helped to make connections for me that I might not have made on my
own. For that alone, the cost of membership is far more than worth it!
My first year of membership was a gift from my mom for my 40th birthday.
Couldn’t have asked for a better present. 
</p>
<p>
Last Remaining Seats was actually how I first heard of the L.A.
Conservancy. Back in 2014 a good friend of mine invited me to an <i>Last
Remaining Seats</i> screening of <i>Citizen Kane</i> at the Orpheum. I
had never seen the film before, so to be able to see the genius
cinematography and all that incredible visual framing on the big screen
was an absolute privilege. Plus, I was seated in the balcony – so I
quite literally had a different perspective of <i>Citizen Kane</i> than
most people will ever get!  
</p>
<p>
<b>Why do you think it’s important for folks to experience classic
movies inside historic theatres?</b> 
</p>
<p>
Going to a movie in a theatre is a wholly different experience than
streaming it at home, no matter how immersive your system is. I love the
idea of moviegoing as an <i>experience</i>, something you get dressed up
for, something as exalted as seeing a play or a concert, something you
talk about before and after the film is over. That experience is
enhanced immensely by being in a theatre as dramatic and artful as
what’s on screen. It encourages you to engage with the building and its
history, and also gives you a sense of what moviegoing was like back
before we all had 4k TVs.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Tell us about your blog and what prompted you to start it.</b>
</p>
<p>
My blog,
<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/" target="_blank">Etan
Does LA</a>, documents my quixotic attempt to visit each of the Los
Angeles landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places (there are
around 600 of them). It started off in September 2021, a time when the
pandemic had me feeling pretty disconnected from my city, and I was
looking for a safe way to feel like a part of it again.  
</p>
<p>
I was setting off on a short bike ride to
the<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/1-portal-of-the-folded-wings-shrine-to-aviation/" target="_blank">
</a><a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/1-portal-of-the-folded-wings-shrine-to-aviation/" target="_blank">Portal
of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation</a> in Burbank, and figured I’d
look up a bit of information about it first (fun classic movie fact: the
Portal features ornate sculptures by
<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.portalofthefoldedwings.net/PAGES/Giorgi.html" target="_blank">Federico
Giorgi</a>, who designed the epic Babylonian sets in DW
Griffith’s <i>Intolerance</i>). I noticed the Portal was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places, which got me thinking about all
the other things that might be on the list. If a lifelong Angeleno like
me has never heard of many of these places, I bet I’m not the only one,
right?  
</p>
<p>
What started as a few photos and a few sentences of history for each
site, posted on
<a href="https://href.li/?http://www.instagram.com/etandoesla" target="_blank">my
Instagram page</a>, has expanded to a website with written histories,
videos, and photo galleries. I’ve visited eyepopping modernist homes and
humble post offices, missions and bridges, fire stations and funeral
homes, craftsman bungalows and Hollywood high-rises, churches and
adobes, plus playgrounds, libraries, Civil War-era mountain passes and
of course, historic theatres. Every single visit fills in a detail about
Los Angeles history that I didn’t know, and more often than not,
learning about one site will send me down a joyous research rabbit hole.
Like, when you learn that Grammy-winning record producer Joe Henry owned
<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/93-lucretia-garfield-house-greene-greene/" target="_blank">Greene
&amp; Greene’s Lucretia Garfield</a> home for over a decade, you want to
know which albums he recorded there, yeah? And if you can hear anything
craftsman-y on those records? 
</p>
<p>
<b>How is the Los Angeles Conservancy a resource for you, as well as
Angelenos in general?</b> 
</p>
<p>
I do a lot of research on L.A. landmarks for my blog posts and videos.
The information you find online is often too poorly researched to be
reliable, or so impenetrably dense with facts and figures that it’s hard
to decide where to start. The L.A. Conservancy’s backgrounders on
historic sites and architects are consistently the most accurate and
concise that I’ve found. They’ve helped deepen my understanding of the
importance of the buildings I visit, and they ground each site in
aesthetic and social contexts. I reference your website all the time in
my blog posts.  
</p>
<p>
It’s super important that Angelenos experience L.A.’s history as
<i>living</i> history. Buildings change over time, and old ones continue
to be relevant to different communities in different ways. So I value
all the programs that the L.A. Conservancy offers to help people engage
with historic sites – whether it’s your regular walking tours, Last
Remaining Seats, or one-off events like the Griffith Park 125th
anniversary celebration last year. I went to a couple stops on that,
learned a ton, and met some fellow L.A. history buffs that I’ve kept in
touch with.  
</p>
<p>
I also love how the Los Angeles Conservancy comes into all of this with
a preservation mindset. That wasn’t necessarily the outlook I had when I
embarked on my project. But I’ve come to understand how fragile history
can be, even when it’s embedded in massive buildings of brick and steel!
And the L.A. Conservancy plays such an active preservation role – not
just through education and advocacy, but also by holding conservation
easements. I recently posted about
<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/101-frank-lloyd-wrights-freeman-house/" target="_blank">Frank
Lloyd Wright’s Harriet and Samuel Freeman House</a>, which was bought in
February by a developer who we <i>hope</i> will invest in a complete
restoration. The easement that L.A. Conservancy holds on that home is a
vital way of preserving its integrity and holding the owner accountable,
so that the public can learn from this building for generations to
come.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Do you have a favorite historic theatre in Los Angeles and/or a
favorite Last Remaining Seats experience?</b> 
</p>
<p>
It’s a tossup between the
<a href="https://href.li/?https://etandoesla.com/49-san-gabriel-mission-playhouse/" target="_blank">Mission
Playhouse in San Gabriel</a>, and the Alex Theatre in Glendale. In
addition to its swoonworthy architecture, the Mission Playhouse was
built as a permanent home for a single production, the <i>Mission
Play</i>, a three-hour epic about the history of the California
missions, written by <i>LA Times</i> columnist, poet and politician John
S. McGroarty. I love the idea of an entire building constructed to house
a single work of art!  
</p>
<p>
The Alex Theatre just screams <i>classic</i> with every fiber of its
Greek/Egyptian-inspired look, and that giant floral spire erupting from
its marquee. I’ll admit it though, this is a nostalgic pick…my high
school graduation was held at the Alex Theatre. I wore a skintight
silver disco outfit and performed Chick Corea’s “Armando’s Rhumba” on
piano onstage. The Alex hasn’t been the same since.  
</p>
<p>
As for my favorite<i> Last Remaining Seats</i> experience, I have to say
that <i>Blade Runner</i> in July 2022 stands out. It’s not just a
classic sci-fi film, it’s a classic <i>Los Angeles</i> sci-fi film. It
was so fun to spot famous LA landmarks like Union Station, the Bradbury
Building and the Million Dollar Theatre in the film, especially at a
time when I’m thinking a lot about how we use and reuse old buildings.
And I was sitting at the Orpheum Theatre, just blocks away from all
those spots! Unforgettable.

<p>
Television City (TVC) is an iconic place in Los Angeles, both for its
commanding presence and stature in the Fairfaix District at the
southeast corner of Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, and for its
undeniable lead role in making television history. As a place that helps
define this city, and a touchtone to our roots dating to the early ’50s,
TVC also illustrates just how vulnerable our heritage can be as part of
the ongoing surge in growth and new development throughout L.A. 
</p>
<p>
The potential for loss is the reason the Conservancy had Television City
designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM) in 2018. It is also why
we have worked so hard for the past year to ensure proposed new
development surrounding TVC is compatible and does not overwhelm this
historic place. 
</p>

<p>
In April, after nearly a year of continuously meeting and working
through various aspects, the Conservancy and Hackman Capital Partners,
owner of TVC, jointly announced a new, revised plan and win-win solution
that provides a balance for preservation and new development at the
site. 
</p>
<p>
“Television City is one of the great Hollywood studio lots,” says
Michael Hackman, Founder and CEO of Hackman Capital Partners. “We are
committed to investing in this important historic resource while
ensuring it remains a robust job creator and world-class studio for
decades to come. We are pleased to have worked with the Conservancy to
find a win-win solution that preserves and celebrates the historic
building while putting forth a plan that enhances TVC’s production
operations and expands its production capacity.”

<p>
The refined plan and solution emerging from our collaboration preserves
historic TVC and allows for significant new development at this
legendary studio property. A comprehensive framework for a state
of-the-art modernization will preserve the historic complex and maintain
the 430- foot Beverly Boulevard viewshed. 
</p>
<p>
The new proposal for TVC results in the following modifications – all
intended to reduce the proximity, bulk and mass of the intended new
construction and impact on the historic TVC complex: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reduction of proposed new construction directly on top of the historic
TVC, eliminating 84 percent of overall volume and 102 feet of height 
</li>
<li>
Limitation to single volume rooftop addition with a maximum height of 36
feet, and set back 55 feet from existing TVC Stage Building north
facade 
</li>
<li>
Setbacks for proposed eastern (60 feet from TVS Service Building) and
western (150 feet from TVC Service Building) production office
buildings 
</li>
<li>
Removal of proposed Flex Pavilion in front of existing TVC Service
Building, and establishment of 60 feet no-build zone 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This proposed project is still in the early phases of the development
and approval process. The Conservancy will remain involved and
ultimately a part of the formal review process regarding the design and
materiality of the proposed new construction. The Conservancy’s goal has
been to preserve TVC, though not freezing it in time, but kept in a way
where new development does not fundamentally harm this conic L.A.
landmark. 
</p>
<p>
Through compromise and working together with Hackman, we think this
solution ensures the studio’s much-needed modernization while protecting
this historic building and maintaining eligibility as a City of Los
Angeles HCM. We are grateful to Hackman Capital Partners for not only
listening, but also working hard with us to achieve a good balance. 
</p>
<p>
After nearly a year of collaboration, the solution now moving forward
significantly reworks a previous design concept released publicly in
March 2021, a design concept where the Conservancy had raised strong
concerns. Environmental review for the Television City 2050 Specific
Plan (TVC 2050) is now underway and we anticipate the release of a Draft
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) soon.

<h2>
A Look Back
</h2>
<p>
In early 2018, the Conservancy started work to protect TVC by initiating
the HCM process. This effort followed earlier news that CBS Corporation
was interested in selling the twenty-five-acre property. Announcement of
a potential sale raised widespread concern over the fate of the
architecturally and culturally significant campus, which was identified
as National Register-eligible in Los Angeles’ SurveyLA (a citywide
inventory of potential historic places in L.A.). 
</p>
<p>
Opened in 1952 and known as CBS Television City, it was the first
large-scale facility in the United States designed specifically for
television production. CBS hired the local architecture firm Pereira
&amp; Luckman. Among the architects on the project team were acclaimed
architects Gin Wong, James Langenheim, and Charles Stanton. The campus
integrated soundstages, studios, editing rooms, offices, rehearsal
halls, shops, and storage, all with expandability in mind. On the
interior, flexibility was key then and now: studio walls and even some
exterior walls can be moved and rearranged to accommodate the needs of
specific productions.
</p>
<p>
 For more than six decades and counting, Television City has been the
portal for some of America’s most beloved television shows. From within
its modern and custom designed stages, television broke new ground, from
variety/sketch comedy television shows like The Carol Burnett Show to
the life of Archie Bunker and the controversial issues of the day in All
in the Family. Today, it is home to such popular newer productions like
The James Corden Show as well as longtime shows such as The Price Is
Right.

<p>
<b>Is there a particular woman that you learned about during your
research that inspires your work? Why?</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Evanne St. Charles: </i>I don’t think I could choose just one woman!
I think it is the thousands of women who came to The Woman’s Building in
search of belonging and purpose. Their ability to work collectively for
change is what inspires me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lindsay Mulchay: </i>I not only learned about inspiring women but was
lucky enough to get to know several, like the writer and activist
Carolyn Weathers, who reminds me to lead with my heart.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sian Winship: </i>Alice Stebbins Wells (1853-1957) was the first
full-time uniformed policewoman in the country. What a game-changer! And
Carol Downer (1933-present), founder of the Women’s Self Help Clinic
Movement, as an alternative to the male-dominated medical profession.
What a visionary!
</p>
<p>
<b>How has your experience studying sites of women’s history shaped your
personal life or identity?</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sian Winship: </i>I happened to be researching the Women’s Rights
Context during the #MeToo movement. It was shocking and disturbing to
see how history repeats itself.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lindsay Mulchay: </i>It affirms for me that organizing is based in
relationships and that those relationships flourish in spaces that
foster safety, self-expression, and community connection.
</p>
<p>
<b>What aspect of The Woman’s Building’s history is timely to understand
today?</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Evanne St. Charles: </i>The Woman’s Building was an institution
created by women, for women. Its goal was to give women – and
underrepresented communities more broadly – a place where their voices
could be heard. Organizations that lift up the voices of
underrepresented peoples continue to be central to the creation of a
more just and equitable society.
</p>
<p>
<b>What aspect of women’s history is timely to understand today?</b>
</p>
<p>
<i>Lindsay Mulachy: </i>The strongest movements are intersectional –
they cast a wide net and center the most marginalized.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sian Winship: </i>We’ve been taught that Northern California led the
way. This is not true. California women would have had the right to vote
in 1896 if it had solely been the votes of Southern Californians…
</p>
<p>
Many of the most important sites from Second Wave Feminism were not
purpose-built buildings. They don’t give up their significance to the
casual observer. Once they start talking, however, their importance is
undeniable.

<p>
<b>How did you first get involved with Los Angeles Conservancy?</b>
</p>
<p>
I became a member of the Los Angeles Conservancy while working for
Morley Builders, focusing on historic seismic upgrade projects. One of
these projects was the Powell Library at UCLA which won a Los Angeles
Conservancy Preservation Award.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
<b>Why is it important to you to support preservation?</b>
</p>
<p>
For me, it began growing up in Carthay and attending Carthay Circle
Elementary School. At that time, the Carthay Circle Theater was
demolished by a wrecking ball. My early introduction to preservation was
on the playground, watching a wrecking ball demolish the historic
theater.
</p>
<p>
The earlier preservation awareness and neighborhood education begins,
the better. I think there is a huge opportunity, through public
education, to highlight neighborhoods where schools are located. This
could include informing students how the adjacent neighborhoods were
developed, designed by architects, built by contractors, etc. Public
educators can speak about the architecture of the schools they teach in
and the adjacent neighborhoods where the students and their parents
live.
</p>
<p>
Supporting preservation coincides with the need for greater public
education and awareness of relevant preservation issues. Through greater
education and awareness, will hopefully inform more of the public to
care more about the areas in which they live and work.
</p>
<p>
<b>What compelled you to become a member of the Pillar Society?</b>
</p>
<p>
Los Angeles Conservancy has been included in my estate planning for many
years. Once the Pillar Society was created, joining became a very easy
decision. The Pillar Society recognizes and makes public what I was
already doing. Hopefully, the public recognition will incentivize and
motivate others to do the same.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why do you think others should consider becoming members of the
Pillar Society?</b>
</p>
<p>
See above.
</p>
<p>
<b>You very generously provided a matching gift to the Conservancy’s
Preservation Advocacy Fund in 2021. What motivated you to do this?</b>
</p>
<p>
Supporting the matching gift initiative is a great way to leverage
funds, which increases the effectiveness of the Los Angeles
Conservancy’s Advocacy efforts.
</p>
<p>
<b>You have been a Conservancy member since 1990, working your way up to
being a Granite Cornerstone member; why do you feel membership support
is important?</b>
</p>
<p>
As a long-term Los Angeles Conservancy Member, my support has increased
in multiple ways over the years, including LAC’s recent support of the
nomination of the Carthay neighborhood as a National Register Historic
District through the Carthay Neighborhoods National Register Nomination
Fund.
</p>
<p>
As property values rise, the tension between development and
preservation also increases, as does the need to support the LAC and
other preservation groups.

</blockquote>
<p>
Happy thirtieth anniversary to Linda Dishman, the Conservancy’s
president and CEO! Focused and fearless, Linda has been a force of
leadership for the Conservancy and the historic preservation movement
throughout California.
</p>
<p>
Linda joined the Conservancy as executive director in March 1992. Since
then, the organization has grown to 5,000 members—the largest membership
of a local historic preservation organization in the country—and our
budget is now $3 million.
</p>
<p>
From all of us at the Conservancy, a heartfelt congratulations and thank
you! We asked Linda to reflect on her time at the Conservancy.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
<b>What do you love about working at the Conservancy? </b>
</p>
<p>
It’s the people! I have a poster on my wall that says, “People make
history, people preserve it.” That really encapsulates why our work is
so meaningful. We save historic buildings because they mean something to
people.
</p>
<p>
The best part is when I talk to people and they [talk about] a building
that has meaning to them. Sometimes it is a school they went to, a
little neighborhood store they visited every Saturday with their
grandmother, or the house where they grew up that holds their memories.
And, sometimes we hear stories about buildings that we all know and
celebrate, like City Hall and the Central Library.
</p>
<p>
We respect that people’s stories reside in many places throughout Los
Angeles. They’re what makes Los Angeles so special!
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>How has preservation changed in the last thirty years? </b>
</p>
<p>
There is greater public awareness and appreciation for historic
buildings and what they do for communities. We can point to many
examples that showcase the value of historic preservation on a project.
Take the Tower Theatre, for example. It was vacant for over thirty
years. Then, Apple came in with a strong vision to adaptively reuse the
space in a way that celebrated its historic character on par with its
cutting-edge technology.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>How has the Conservancy changed since you started?</b>
</p>
<p>
The Conservancy has more members and staff, more experience, and more
great work under our belt! We’re doing more to celebrate the full story
of Los Angeles, including nominations of culturally significant sites,
community outreach, and a wildly successful legacy business campaign.
I’m excited for us to expand this work further. The Conservancy also has
more tools and has developed best practices we’re now sharing with the
public through our Community Leadership Boot Camps. Win or lose, there
is much to be learned from every advocacy effort.
</p>
<p>
Our work to specifically tell a broader, more inclusive story through
our advocacy and educational work has grown the perception of what’s
worth saving in truly meaningful ways.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>How has the Conservancy stayed the same? </b>
</p>
<p>
We remain rooted in our values to find win-win preservation-minded
solutions. When we’re working on advocacy issues, we focus on options
that preserve the historic building and also meet the project’s end
goals, whether it is adding housing units or turning a commercial
building into office space. The Conservancy is eager to demonstrate how
historic preservation can be a tool in helping Los Angeles address
critical issues, like housing or climate change.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>What was one of your greatest losses at the Conservancy?</b>
</p>
<p>
It’s really tough to lose a building, especially a building you’ve
worked a long time to try and save. That was certainly the situation
with the demolition of the Ambassador Hotel in 2005 and 2006. We were
sad. <i>I was sad.</i> We did everything possible to provide an
alternative to demolition. We’d never had the capacity to do that
before. We exhausted every resource and idea. By the time we lost, <i>we
lost. </i>But we looked at the effort and thought: <i>how do we use this
loss as we look to the future? </i>We learned a lot.
</p>
<p>
It’s interesting, people still tell me how sad they are about the loss
of the Ambassador—even those who were not that supportive at the time.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is one of your most memorable moments in a historic
building?</b>
</p>
<p>
In talking about the Ambassador Hotel, it brings back the memory of
being in the pantry where Robert Kennedy was assassinated.
</p>
<p>
It was a place of great sadness and being there in person was very
powerful. It really resonated as a sacred place. What happened in that
pantry changed the direction of our country. The Conservancy wanted the
pantry to be preserved for that reason, so students could understand the
assassination in a broader context, understand the history of our
nation, and be inspired.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is something people may not know about you?</b>
</p>
<p>
People think I’m from Los Angeles, but I actually grew up in Sacramento.
My mother was from South Pasadena, so I was raised hearing stories of
her going to the Broadway theatres, riding the streetcars downtown, and
ice cream sundaes at Chatam’s in Westwood Village. She went to UCLA.
Even before I came to L.A., I had a strong sense of the history of Los
Angeles.
</p>
<p>
One of my most precious memories is when I was five and came down to Los
Angeles with my mom. My grandmother took me to the Ambassador Hotel and
we had lunch at the patio there. Maybe that’s why it was poignant when
we lost the building.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is one of your favorite preservation moments?</b>
</p>
<p>
The evening when the Downey McDonald’s reopened. Saving the Downey
McDonald’s was a really hard fight because we were up against one of the
biggest corporations in America, who for a variety of reasons didn’t
want this building to survive. Thankfully, they changed their trajectory
and decided to restore the building. At the opening event, there was a
big black-tie affair in the parking lot. The servers came out with
platters covered by silver domes for each person. When they opened the
silver dome, there was a Quarter Pounder with fries. It was the perfect
way to celebrate McDonald’s reopening!

<p>
Caltech recently received the second-largest gift ever donated to a US
university,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/caltech-resnick-climate-change.html" target="_blank">a
whopping $750 million from the Resnick family</a>, meant to support
research into sustainable technologies and means of combating climate
change. This money will be used to erect a new building, bolster
Caltech’s endowment, and fund environmentally-oriented research.
Researchers who receive these funds will retain full self-determination
over their work. It is tempting to unquestioningly celebrate this gift
and the freedom to use it, but I believe that it is not ethical to
pursue research using these funds without critically examining our
relationship with the Resnicks. As scientists, we mold our work, our
speech, and our way of interpreting the world in pursuit of objectivity.
However, we often end up deluding ourselves and each other into
believing that we actually are objective beings. Such beliefs are
dangerous when we encounter ethical dilemmas: a person who believes
themself to be objective can always justify their actions as “right.” As
we consider how the Resnick gift should be employed, we need to be clear
about how we judge the ethics of its use.
</p>
<p>
When we think of moral dilemmas, we usually think of dramatic scenarios:
for example, the
<a href="https://www.existentialcomics.com/comic/106" target="_blank">trolley</a>
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/doing-allowing/#TrolProb" target="_blank">problem</a>
or, in the case of scientific research,
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/02/516280895/embryo-experiments-reveal-earliest-human-development-but-stir-ethical-debate" target="_blank">how
long artificial embryos should be allowed to develop</a>. But the vast
majority of ethical choices scientists face are mundane. These choices
are typically not even related to experiments, but rather to funding:
from whom to procure it and how to compete for it. In the US, scientists
usually turn to a combination of government agencies and private
organizations. The government agencies, such as the National Science
Foundation (NSF), usually have a very broad scope and support many
diverse scientific ventures. The private foundations typically have very
concrete missions, such as developing treatments for a particular
disease. Despite the differences in breadth of focus between public and
private sponsors, US scientists typically justify their applications for
funding by claiming that their research will contribute to the “Greater
Good”. These contributions are codified in grant and proposal guidelines
and are sometimes termed the “broader impacts” of the work. For example,
the Center for Advancing Research Impact in Society (ARIS) developed a
<a href="https://researchinsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GuidingPrinciplesDoc2020.pdf" target="_blank">guiding
document</a> to advise grant reviewers and program managers on how to
evaluate NSF grant applications, underscoring the importance of the
quality of their proposed broader impacts. This document states that a
key factor in evaluating a given proposal is its potential “to benefit
society or advance desired societal outcomes.” In other words, while
scientific research directions are typically driven by myriad human
motivations like aspiration, ego, and curiosity, they have to be
recontextualized and sold as socially beneficial.
</p>
<p>
Relying on the strength of the broader impacts of their research,
scientists make a utilitarian claim. Maximizing utility, broadly defined
as achieving the most good for the most people, is an important
motivation and should be at the foundation of public policy. But I
contend that it can never be an objective goal. There is no universal
definition of “Good,” and, for most definitions, this Good cannot be
evaluated within our lifetimes. Utilitarianism usually cannot be a moral
basis for a scientist to pursue their work ethically because the work’s
utility cannot be guaranteed. In applications for funding, utility often
emerges as either an afterthought or an assertion provided solely to
procure funding. Unless a different, non-utilitarian moral ground
underlies the work, the scientist’s ethical obligations as a human being
cannot be satisfied by their proposed research alone.
</p>
<p>
To give a concrete, admittedly dramatic, example of the tension between
utilitarianism, funding, and social values, I present the case of Martin
Couney:
</p>
<p>
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the burgeoning eugenics
movement held
<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/better-babies-contests-pushed-infant-health-also-played-eugenics-movement-180971288/" target="_blank">“Better
Babies” contests</a> (e.g., which blue-eyed white baby is
“scientifically best?”), and most doctors advocated that premature
infants be left to die,
<a href="https://daily.jstor.org/coney-islands-incubator-babies/" target="_blank">Martin
Couney developed incubators that saved thousands of these children</a>,
including his own daughter<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Couney did this
as a showman who continually lied about his credentials: In 1898, he
began traveling to expositions and fairgrounds in the US, with infants
on display in his incubators as sideshows, all the while claiming to
have a European medical license and training under Dr. Pierre Budin, a
founder of modern neonatal care, neither of which was
true<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In 1903 and 1904, respectively,
Couney established permanent expositions on Coney Island and in Atlantic
City that both ran for nearly forty years<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.
By charging the peeping public for admission, Couney was able to fully
cover the cost of the medical care, sanitation, and nurses’ wages at no
cost to the desperate parents who brought him their newborns. When the
infants matured, they were returned to their families. Couney
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36321692" target="_blank">saved
roughly 85% of the premature babies</a> in his shows, in contrast to the
<a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-infantorium/" target="_blank">roughly
25% that were surviving standard care</a>. Gradually, Couney garnered
enough respect to win over the medical establishment. His influence went
beyond saving the preemies to proving that they could grow up to be
indistinguishable from those who had been born at full-term. As one
example, possibly due to the simple fact that oxygen was too expensive
to provide in excess in Couney’s sideshows, infants under his care
avoided developing retrolental fibroplasia, blindness that plagued
children who were given too much oxygen in hospital
incubators<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. The approximately 6,500 people
saved by Couney’s enterprise grew up to have children, grandchildren,
and great-grandchildren of their own; there are likely tens of thousands
of people alive today because of him. Couney’s work made him a kind of
anti-eugenicist, aligning him against the utilitarianism of his time:
the reason why the medical establishment did not bother trying to
develop means of saving premature infants was that those children were
deemed to not be worth the effort. Preemies were considered weaklings
who would be inferior to the “better babies.”
</p>
<p>
This story underscores the capricious nature of utilitarianism. Back
then, as it would now, the way that Couney funded his work delegitimized
his efforts<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. However, the fact that there
was no social ethic, no “legitimate” establishment that would support
saving premature infants, created the possibility for Couney’s success.
Couney wanted to save those children, to spread “preemie
propaganda”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>, and found an unorthodox way to
do it, while also accruing significant wealth. Today, after the fact, it
is tempting to explain why what Couney did was right by making a
utilitarian argument, that the ends clearly justified the means, but
this retroactive argument is misleading. We now think that the ends have
justified the means because our social values have changed (for the
better), and we, as a society, agree that the lives of premature infants
are worth saving. This change in values is not due to us having followed
a utilitarian ethic. It is due to the non-utilitarian work of people
like Couney.
</p>
<p>
This example may seem incomparable to a gift of $750 million from one
established group (the Resnicks) to another (Caltech), but Couney’s
revenue was actually millions of dollars in today’s
value<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>. The connection that I want to draw
between the two cases rests on their shared dissonance between utility,
funding, and social values. To paraphrase one of Lily E. Kay’s opening
arguments in
<em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-molecular-vision-of-life-caltech-the-rockefeller-foundation-and-the-rise-of-the-new-biology/9780195111439" target="_blank">The
Molecular Vision of Life</a></em><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>, by
participating in the given funding system, the scientist also
participates in forming a consensus of values and priorities with the
funder<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. This happens even when the
scientist’s motivations—such as general curiosity, desire for social
progress, or self-interest—have nothing to do with their relationship
with the sponsor. This consensus of values and priorities, which
constitute the social program of the funder, is more beneficial to the
funder than the scientist. While a funding agency provides an individual
scientist a sort of legitimacy (evidence that the scientist was able to
convince someone to give them money), the fact that the agency unified a
whole field of research solidifies that agency’s influence on society.
Thus, uncritically using money from a given group strengthens it,
regardless of what the funds are used toward. Neither a utilitarian
claim nor a successful procurement of funding can serve as evidence of
ethical work.
</p>
<p>
So, in order to use the Resnick gift ethically, we must critically
consider their values and priorities, as evidenced by their practices.
The Resnicks made their fortune through questionable business practices,
such as
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-01/hiltzik-resnicks-caltech-gift" target="_blank">shipping
drinking water from Fiji to the US</a> and
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-aug-18-la-fi-hiltzik-20100818-1-story.html" target="_blank">taking
control of a previously California-owned waterbank</a>. Accepting their
donation raises questions about where the line between reputation
laundering and reparation is drawn. For example, by conducting research
with their money, are we justifying the way in which they accrued their
wealth? Have the Resnicks given enough money directly to Fiji (via
taxes, donations, investments, or reparations) to qualify as having made
a restitution? Such questions are not restricted to the Resnick gift and
apply generally to issues of accepting money for research from harmful
enterprises, such as from
<a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/dirty-money-green-science" target="_blank">fossil
fuel companies</a>. However, the Resnick gift is unique in its size and
intention, being the first of its magnitude to directly aim for
environmental improvement. It will cause reverberations in donations to
other universities, and so it behooves us to establish a system of
ethics for using it from the outset.
</p>
<p>
We already know part of how Caltech will use the gift: $400 million will
go into Caltech’s endowment, $100 million will go towards a new
building, and $250 million will be applied toward research via the
Resnick Sustainability Institute (RSI). The RSI has four interconnected
initiatives:
“<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/sunlight-everything" target="_blank">Sunlight
to Everything</a>”, which aims to use solar energy to combat pollution
and greenhouse gasses;
“<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/climate-science" target="_blank">Climate
Science</a>”, which aims to mitigate the effects of global warming;
“<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/water-resources" target="_blank">Water
Resources</a>”, which aims to improve the availability of drinking
water; and
“<a href="http://resnick.caltech.edu/research/ecology-and-biosphere-engineering" target="_blank">Ecology
and Biosphere Engineering</a>”, which aims to understand and mitigate
negative human impacts on ecosystems. This mass project is uniquely
poised to involve every branch of science found at Caltech. There is no
doubt in my mind that research funded through the RSI will lead to
applicable, beneficial, and interesting outcomes. But this research is
unlikely to undo the direct harm done to the environment by the
Resnicks’ companies, despite all the freedom that a private donation
allows. Undoing this harm would require Caltech to start an explicit
program to assess and address environmental damage done to Fiji, the
Pacific Ocean, and California’s freshwater reserves by Caltech’s biggest
donor.

</p>
<p>
The question stands before every scientist at Caltech who is, or wants
to be, funded through the RSI: Do you support the Resnicks’ practices?
If you use their money and do not actually resist their business ethic,
then it does not matter what your reflexive answer is; you are
participating in the formation of the consensus that these practices are
okay. As a member of society, you should feel free and welcome to follow
your curiosity, invent new solutions to social problems, and pursue the
work that you believe in. But you should also remember who is allowing
you to do so. Scientists stand to gain from clarity about how funding
shapes research and about how to formulate an ethical system in a
changing world, and demonstrating this clarity will serve to increase
public trust in science. There are several key questions that each
scientist should engage with:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is the social program of the group funding me or the research I’m
invested in?
</li>
<li>
Are the funders using researchers as props to justify their social
programs?
</li>
<li>
By lending credibility to the funders, is my research supporting
something that I stand against?
</li>
<li>
If yes, does the funding provide an excuse to keep doing what I have
been doing, or is it an opportunity to subvert the practices or social
program I oppose?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It is almost always easier to keep doing what you have been doing, and
it is sometimes right to do so. Ultimately, different people will have
different tolerances for how much cognitive dissonance they can bear
when their work supports a social program that they stand against. When
I ask myself the above questions, I find myself where I believe most
scientists are: the opaque moral gray. I find my own work interesting
and worthwhile, insofar as all fundamental, creative pursuits are
important human practices. But I do not believe that, during my PhD, I
will be able to pursue research that compensates for the social programs
of some of my funders (e.g., the Army Research Office). I have to live
with this fact, and how I do so is the ethical choice before me. The way
I see it, sticking to my research and doing nothing outside of it to
improve my environment would be wrong.
</p>
<p>
In the case of the Resnick gift, my non-utilitarian stance is that money
should be used to pursue sustainability research and combat climate
change, as the gift was intended to be used, but that this cannot be
done innocently. Guided by a non-utilitarian ethic, our use of the money
ought to be paired with action that is separate from the exchange that
the Resnicks and Caltech have made. This action should serve to subvert
the aspects of the Resnick companies’ social programs that we disagree
with and move us beyond a zero-sum moral accounting.
</p>
<p>
If you find yourself in a similar position to mine, the call to action
is three-fold: improve the immediate social space around us, improve the
institution(s) we are a part of, and improve the society we find
ourselves in. It is not possible for an individual to address or work on
all scales at once, but there are a lot of issues that can be addressed
on an approximately local scale through collective advocacy. In the case
of Caltech, an obvious small-scale example is to combat food waste (it
is absurd that we received $750 million for sustainability research
without any infrastructure for composting on campus). More generally in
academia, we should move to involve trainees in decision-making (e.g.,
admission, hiring, tenure, and curricula, which would foster increased
trust and understanding between faculty and their mentees). Graduate
students, postdocs, and staff should collectively advocate for more
equitable working conditions, grievance procedures, and compensation.
Labs, be they in academia, non-profit organizations, or industry, should
have explicit conversations about their values and how they align or
conflict with those of their funding sources. These are opportunities to
supplement research in a way that centers actual, subjective values and
thus sculpts the norms of scientific conduct. These are opportunities to
do something good.

This piece has been in the works for a year, and has been shaped by many
people. I want to thank Audrey Massman for introducing me to Martin
Couney’s story during a tabletop role playing game. I’ve had many
conversations about the ethics of scientific funding, including with
members of the Newman Lab antiracism discussion subgroup, with whom I
read Lily E. Kay’s <em>Molecular Vision of Life</em>, and I want to
particularly thank Elise Tookmanian and Georgia Squyres as co-leaders of
that group. I’ve had long discussions about how to improve Caltech with
many of my friends and colleagues, which influenced the tone and
direction of this piece, and I want to thank Fayth Tan, Krystal Vasquez,
Aditi Narayanan, and Hannah Weller for helping me crystalize my
perspective on the systems of power that are at play within academia.
I’m hugely grateful to my adviser, Dianne Newman, who has been nothing
but supportive of me when I have come into conflict with Caltech, who
finds the humor within our personal disagreements, and who has ensured
my success as a PhD student even as I have gotten increasingly active on
campus outside the lab. Thank you to the editors, Melba Nuzen, Nicole
Wallack, Skyler Ware, and Heidi Klumpe for their careful and
constructive criticism of this piece. Most of all, I’m grateful for my
fiancée, Yana Zlochistaya, who has read, thought about, and discussed
this piece with me since its inception.

My favorite place on Earth is a secluded tributary to the Tuolumne River
in Yosemite National Park, California. In the fall, the river becomes a
trickle of water between emerald pools carved into the granite—the
perfect swimming holes. I have gone backpacking there most years since
high school. Yet for the past few autumns, raging wildfires,
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001210" target="_blank">driven
by climate change</a>, have forced me to cancel the trip. With climate
change, it has become hard to imagine a future in which I am able to
return to this yearly tradition. If this future exists, it depends on a
steep drawdown of carbon dioxide emissions driven by a combination of
policy changes and technological innovations.

<p>
As a Caltech scientist, I have long struggled with how I can personally
work to abate the climate crisis. The impacts of climate change
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2017/09/18/hurricanes-hit-the-poor-the-hardest/" target="_blank">fall
hardest</a> on the most disadvantaged communities, which places a
responsibility on me to act. For now, I have landed on a combination of
technology research and organizing. In the lab,
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aax6061" target="_blank">I
research</a> new materials for capturing solar energy. Outside of the
lab, I organize with the Los Angeles chapter of the Sunrise Movement Los
Angeles
(<a href="https://sunrisemovementla.org/" target="_blank">Sunrise
LA</a>), a group of young people fighting to stop climate change through
direct action, electing Green New Deal champions into office, and
working on local policy.
</p>
<p>
I represent Sunrise LA on the SoCal Building Electrification Coalition,
which aims to pass
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2021/07/californias-cities-lead-way-gas-free-future" target="_blank">building
codes</a> that transition both existing and new buildings to
all-electric appliances. We don’t hear much about buildings in the
context of climate change, but, in California, they comprise a
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/building-decarbonization" target="_blank">full
quarter</a> of our carbon emissions. In Los Angeles, that number
<a href="https://plan.lamayor.org/sites/default/files/pLAn_2019_final.pdf" target="_blank">exceeds
40%</a>. Much of this comes from natural gas appliances—mainly gas hot
water heaters, gas stoves, and gas furnaces. On top of emitting carbon
dioxide, natural gas appliances also come with significant health risks:
growing up in a home with a gas stove increases asthma risk for children
by
<a href="https://rmi.org/insight/decarbonizing-homes/" target="_blank">as
much as 40%</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there are alternatives: electric heat pumps can provide
both heating and cooling to a home and are at least
<a href="https://www.eec.org.au/for-energy-users/technologies-2/heat-pumps" target="_blank">three
times</a> as efficient as traditional furnaces. For new buildings, they
are
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RMI_Economics_of_Electrifying_Buildings_2018.pdf" target="_blank">less
expensive over their lifetime</a> than traditional furnaces and air
conditioners. Crucially, electric heat pumps
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/RMI_Economics_of_Electrifying_Buildings_2018.pdf" target="_blank">emit
less carbon dioxide</a>, and the benefits will only compound as we add
more renewable energy sources to the electric grid.
</p>
<p>
Across all sectors, experts are
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" target="_blank">coming</a>
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68214.pdf" target="_blank">to</a>
<a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">a</a>
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-futures-study" target="_blank">consensus</a>
on the cheapest and most equitable path to a zero-carbon future. This
consensus can be summed up in two words:
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything" target="_blank"><em>electrify
everything</em></a>. We already know how to make cheap, abundant
renewable electricity, and whatever runs on electricity is as clean as
the grid. Not only will our buildings be all-electric, but so will our
cars, our trucks, and our public transit. A wide range of
<a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">energy
models</a> have demonstrated that to achieve net zero by 2050, we will
use at least twice the amount of <em>electricity</em> we currently do,
while our total <em>energy</em> use (electricity plus other sources of
energy, like liquid fuels) will decrease.

This graph shows how much we can decrease US CO2 emissions with various
changes. Decarbonizing our power generation alone only reduces emitted
CO2 by 30%. When combined with electrification, 71% CO2 reductions are
possible.

</p>
<p>
These same
<a href="https://www.2035report.com/electricity/" target="_blank">energy
models</a> show that the market alone won’t get us there quickly enough.
We need to use all of the policy tools at our disposal to accelerate
electrification, from investing in electric public transit and electric
vehicle charging infrastructure to subsidizing heat pumps and ensuring
new buildings are all-electric.
</p>
<p>
Electrifying everything also means that, for our survival, the fossil
fuel industry must shrink dramatically.
</p>
<p>
Many have said that the fossil fuel giants—Chevron, Exxon, BP,
Shell—will simply become energy companies, providing the wind, solar,
and other renewables that we need in a zero-carbon future. This is
misguided: they
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/" target="_blank">missed
their chance</a> to make that transformation decades ago. Instead, they
dug in their heels, becoming the
<a href="https://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/" target="_blank">purveyors of
climate denial</a> and the opposers of climate legislation. Today, they
are still extracting huge quantities of fossil fuels.

<p>
In the past five years, fossil fuel companies and utilities have taken a
more subtle approach, trying to convince politicians and the public that
they are
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/lawsuits-target-exxons-social-media-green-washing/" target="_blank">part
of the solution</a> to climate change rather than denying its existence.
The fossil fuel industry now argues that
<a href="https://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/1415383063635406850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1415383063635406850%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdennismichaellynch.com%2Freport-manchin-voices-his-concerns-at-biden-lunch%2F" target="_blank">we
need more innovation</a>, so we should wait to eliminate fossil fuels.
This is misleading—energy modeling shows that
<a href="https://www.2035report.com/electricity/" target="_blank">we
already have most of the technology</a> we need to stop climate change.
It is also a false dichotomy, suggesting that we cannot innovate at the
same time as we work to eliminate fossil fuels. Not only can we, but we
must.
</p>
<p>
On the local level, our SoCal Building Electrification Coalition is
coming up against these same tactics and talking points. Our natural gas
utility in Los Angeles, SoCalGas, is threatened by the electrification
ordinances that we are advancing, since
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/2/14/21131109/california-natural-gas-renewable-socalgas" target="_blank">80%
of their revenue</a> comes from selling natural gas to residential
customers. Following the fossil fuel industry’s playbook, they are
trying to position themselves as the solution while delaying the
phase-out of natural gas to maximize their own profits.
</p>
<p>
In public, SoCalGas has pledged to achieve
<a href="https://www.sempra.com/southern-california-gas-company-sets-bold-net-zero-emissions-pledge" target="_blank">net
zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2045</a>. They heavily advertise their
research on
<a href="https://www.socalgas.com/sustainability/renewable-gas" target="_blank">renewable
natural gas</a> and
<a href="https://newsroom.socalgas.com/stories/the-h2-hydrogen-home-named-a-world-changing-idea-by-fast-company" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>.
In private, they’re fighting tooth and nail against the climate progress
we need to make immediately to solve this crisis, which is
electrification and shrinking their industry.
</p>
<p>
SoCalGas
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-08-04/california-sued-by-nations-biggest-gas-utility-in-climate-change-dispute" target="_blank">sued
the California Energy Commission</a> when the commission tried to reduce
gas use in the state. They
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/socalgas-misused-funds-to-fight-gas-regulations-judge-says" target="_blank">got
in trouble with California regulators</a> last year for misusing
customer money to lobby against energy efficiency standards. Recently,
Santa Barbara residents
<a href="https://www.independent.com/2020/12/31/its-time-for-santa-barbara-to-ditch-fossil-gas/" target="_blank">received
a mass text</a> from SoCalGas encouraging them to call and oppose a
building electrification ordinance. The utility has responded to these
ordinances by pushing localities to adopt
“<a href="https://www.socalgas.com/energychoice" target="_blank">balanced
energy resolutions</a>” across the state.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most egregiously, SoCalGas was found to have
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-07/socal-gas-astroturf-group-allegations" target="_blank">launched
and funded a front group</a>, Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions
(C4BES), to advocate for continued natural gas use in the state. This
organization poses as a group of natural gas consumers, with pictures of
families cooking on gas stoves and messaging about “energy choice” and
the “right to use natural gas” on their website. The principles on the
C4BES website even match those on the SoCalGas website nearly
word-for-word. This is a classic example of “astroturfing,” where a
corporation creates a front group which poses as a grassroots
organization in order to boost their political voice.

Just last week, the California Public Utilities Commission
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-04/socalgas-faces-10-million-fine-for-fighting-climate-action" target="_blank">levied
a $10 million fine</a> against SoCalGas for continuing to use ratepayer
money to lobby against stronger rules for buildings and appliances. This
lobbying
<a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M447/K845/447845811.PDF" target="_blank">included
efforts</a> to weaken 2022 updates to the state building code, which
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2022/california-fines-socalgas-10-million-for-efforts-to-weaken-building-and-appliance-efficiency-measures" target="_blank">moves
California</a> towards all-electric new construction. Despite multiple
sanctions and negative press coverage, SoCalGas, a company that derives
its power from being a state-sanctioned monopoly, continues to use that
power to keep us hooked to an energy supply that is damaging our health
and the planet.
</p>
<p>
In light of this, the public pledges that SoCalGas has made to achieve
net zero by 2045 ring hollow. Further, their plan to rely on energy
sources like hydrogen and renewable natural gas to achieve their goals
is unrealistic. These sources have an important role to play in a
zero-carbon future,
<a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-two-the-demand-side/" target="_blank">particularly
in hard-to-electrify sectors</a> such as aviation,
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abbd02/pdf" target="_blank">parts
of industry</a>, and
<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/pdfExtended/S2542-4351(20)30325-1" target="_blank">long-duration
energy storage</a> (storing energy for days to years). However, neither
is poised to take the place of natural gas in buildings. Renewable
natural gas is
<a href="https://www.ethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Deep_Decarbonization_in_a_High_Renewables_Future_CEC-500-2018-012.pdf" target="_blank">not
abundant enough</a>, hydrogen is
<a href="https://www.iee.fraunhofer.de/en/presse-infothek/press-media/overview/2020/Hydrogen-and-Heat-in-Buildings.html" target="_blank">inefficient</a>,
and both are
<a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/CEC-500-2019-055-F.pdf" target="_blank">expensive</a>.
Electrification remains by far the cheapest and the safest way to
decarbonize buildings. The talk of hydrogen-powered homes is a classic
example of greenwashing, or misleading the public to think that a
company is more climate-friendly than it is.
</p>
<p>
Given their history of underhanded tactics around Southern California,
and their nefarious reputation in the building electrification world, I
was surprised to learn that SoCalGas
<a href="https://www.socalgas.com/sites/default/files/2020%20SoCalGas%20RD%26D%20Annual%20Report%20-%20Final%20Draft.pdf" target="_blank">funds
research</a> on renewable natural gas, carbon capture, and hydrogen at
Caltech. They recently
<a href="https://newsroom.socalgas.com/press-release/socalgas-and-bloom-energy-showcase-technology-to-power-hydrogen-economy-with-gas" target="_blank">partnered
with Caltech</a> on a hydrogen demonstration project. At first glance,
this could seem like a good thing: the profits gained from polluting our
environment are being reinvested into necessary research and
development.
</p>
<p>
But this funding should not be welcomed, and we can look to the
parallels with the tobacco industry to see why. Cigarette companies have
long funded cancer research, using the profits from their deadly
products to create a public relations smokescreen. They claim to be
solving the problems they have caused, while pursuing covert legal and
political tactics to keep the sales coming in. Many
<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/applying-for-funding/policies-that-affect-your-grant/code-of-practice-on-tobacco-industry-funding-to-universities" target="_blank">cancer
researchers</a> now
<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-09-2017-who-statement-on-philip-morris-funded-foundation-for-a-smoke-free-world" target="_blank">eschew
funding from tobacco companies</a>, understanding that this money merely
perpetuates the cycle of harm done by the industry.
</p>
<p>
Armed with the
<a href="https://newsroom.socalgas.com/press-release/southern-california-gas-company-sets-bold-net-zero-emissions-pledge" target="_blank">reputational
benefits</a> of their collaborations with Caltech researchers, SoCalGas
has the credibility today to make false claims to government officials
and the public that we should not pass all-electric building ordinances,
because they are funding research on technical solutions like hydrogen
that are just around the corner. They can pump the brakes on the
affordable and realistic solutions that are already here.
</p>
<p>
Both tobacco and fossil fuel companies could take substantive steps
towards solving the problems they claim to care about by supporting
efforts to regulate their industry. Of course, under capitalism, a
private company will never have internal incentives to support
regulation that hurts their bottom line. But we, as energy researchers,
can follow the example of cancer scientists and stop feeding into the
industry’s cycle of harm.
</p>
<p>
It’s time for scientists at Caltech, and other research institutions, to
reject funding from SoCalGas. This would decrease SoCalGas’s credibility
and political power, which would get us closer to passing the building
electrification ordinances that we need in Southern California.
</p>
<p>
I know this isn’t simple. Government funding can be hard to come by, and
we need to drastically increase federal support for climate-related
research—<a href="http://aip.org/fyi/2021/fate-‘build-back-better’-science-funding-pushed-2022#:~:text=In%20its%20original%20proposal%20for,the%20DOE%20Office%20of%20Science." target="_blank">the
$45 billion over 10 years</a> of science funding included in the initial
draft of the Build Back Better plan would be a good start. Additionally,
many academic funding sources are dubiously ethical, and perhaps that
money would just go to another institution if not Caltech. But the
benefits gained from that research funding are outweighed by the costs
of enabling SoCalGas as they slow political action on the climate
crisis.
</p>
<p>
I dream of one day being able to journey back to the emerald pools in
Yosemite without fear of wildfires. But for me, this is a privilege. The
climate crisis threatens the entire lives and livelihoods of Black,
brown, and working-class people on the frontlines of climate change. At
Caltech, our mission—to expand human knowledge and benefit society
through research integrated with education—has embedded within it a
commitment to improving people’s lives through our research. If we are
serious about this mission, we need to take a holistic view of our
research, from funding sources to new technologies. For Caltech
researchers working on climate solutions, upholding our mission means
rejecting funding from the fossil fuel industry. The stakes could not be
higher.

<p>
<span class="first-letter">I</span>f you’ve ever drunk wine with a wine
aficionado (don’t call them snobs!) you’ve probably heard them describe
what they smell—maybe dark fruits, baking spices, freshly cut grass—and
also note whether or not the wine has tannins and how much. To
understand what people mean when they talk about tannins in wine, we can
start with an experience that has nothing to do with wine: drinking
oversteeped tea. When you finally take a sip of the tea you forgot about
20 minutes ago, your soothing afternoon ritual is now stripping the
inside of your mouth of all its moisture, causing you to recoil and
shiver. You are feeling astringency, like your mouth is being dried out.
This astringent experience is caused by molecules called
tannins—chemicals found in many foods such as tea, dried fruit, and
chocolate, but perhaps most famous for their presence in wine. In a good
wine, tannins cause a more subtle drying sensation than in your
forgotten oolong, providing complexity and structure, which adds another
dimension to the tastes and smells we get from these chemical solutions.
</p>
<p>
The astringent sensation caused by tannins makes your mouth feel dry.
However, tannins aren’t actually drying out your mouth–this is just how
our brains perceive the interaction between tannins and our saliva. The
chemical structure of tannins makes them particularly good at sticking
to things and clumping them up. Think of tannins like those burrs that
get stuck to your clothes when you go for a walk in nature. Just like
burrs, the interactions that tannins make are nonspecific; they will
stick to many different types of molecules (whatever they happen to bump
into). In our mouths, they bump into saliva proteins. The saliva in our
mouths is full of proteins that keep our digestive tracts lubricated,
but after taking a sip of wine or that neglected tea, the tannins in
these beverages will bind to our saliva proteins and clump them up. All
clumped up, these proteins are no longer dissolvable in our saliva and
they become more like tiny pieces of sand—not big enough to see, but big
enough to feel. We experience the friction of these tiny bits of
sand-like protein-tannin clumps as astringency, or dryness, in our
mouths.
</p>
<p>
So, what is it about tannins that makes them so prone to clumping?
Tannins are a subcategory of a broader class of molecules called
polyphenols. Phenols are carbon rings decorated with oxygen atoms and
polyphenols are many of these phenols joined into one big molecule.
Phenols have many double bonds, which carry lots of negatively-charged
electrons that aren’t married to any particular atom. The oxygens on the
phenols are electronegative, which means they pull electrons toward
themselves. This combination of lots of double bonds and lots of oxygen
atoms creates many areas of polarization in the molecule, which means
certain parts carry slight negative charges and other parts carry
positive charges. This polarization makes the tannins more likely to
form attractive interactions with things that they bump into than if
they were neutral molecules.
</p>
<p>
For example, when a negatively-charged part of the tannin comes into
contact with another molecule, the negative charge will repel the
electrons of that molecule, causing that part of the other molecule to
be slightly positively charged. Now you have a slight negative charge in
the tannin and a slight positive charge in the other molecule, which
causes attraction! These attractions are called van der Waals forces and
they are relatively weak, way weaker than the bonds that bind atoms in
molecules: if bonds between atoms in a molecule are superglue, van der
Waals forces are maple syrup. Long story short, tannins are
sticky<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. They are likely to glom on to
chemicals that they find, and when we’re talking about tannins in wine,
the largest class of chemicals that they find are the proteins in our
saliva.
</p>
<p>
Our saliva proteins are well equipped to interact with tannins as well.
All proteins are made up of a combination of 21 different amino acids
stuck together in a long chain and folded into a unique structure. The
proteins in our mouths contain a lot of a particular amino acid called
proline. Proline is special because it forces a kink in the protein
structure. So lots of prolines means lots of kinks and bends in the
protein, which makes for a disordered squiggly mess. This open and
unstructured shape of the proteins in our saliva provides many spots for
tannins to bind. Although there are no specific bonds that happen
between tannins and saliva proteins, both are perfectly suited for many
non-specific interactions, thus resulting in
clumping.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>

The interaction between tannins and saliva proteins.

</p>
<p>
But why did our saliva evolve to have all these squiggly proteins? Let’s
imagine that we didn’t have these proteins in our saliva—the tannins
would have nothing to clump to in our mouths and would make it to our
stomachs and intestines all on their own. There, they would find the
important digestive enzymes—chemicals that we need to get nutrients from
our food. If free tannins made their way to these enzymes, they would
bind and clump them up, taking them out of commission and disrupting our
digestion. You might have experienced this if you stubbornly drank that
over-steeped cup of tea anyway and gave yourself a stomach ache. We
probably evolved to have these squiggly proteins in our saliva as
sacrificial tannin sponges to protect our digestive enzymes from the
tannins in our diet.
</p>
<p>
There is immense range in the levels of tannins in wine, and wines are
commonly described as having low, medium, or high tannins. If you start
paying attention to the level of astringency you experience from certain
wines, you might develop a preference for wines with a particular level
of tannins. And then you might actually have an answer at the wine store
when they put you on the spot with, “are you looking for anything in
particular?”
</p>
<p>
Most of the tannins in wine come from the skins of the grapes used to
make wine<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. These skins and the winemaker’s
choice of what to do with them are how we end up with wines of such
varying tannin levels. If the winemaker chooses to include the skins
during fermentation, the tannins dissolve into the grape juice and the
resulting wine will have tannins. The extent of tannic character depends
on the length of time the winemaker chooses to keep the skins around.
Just like a tea bag, the longer the skins are “steeped,” the more
intense the astringent experience caused by tannins will be. In addition
to time with the skins, the other variable affecting tannin levels is
the type of grape. Certain grapes are thicker-skinned than others, so
they will impart more tannins to the wine than wines made from grapes
with thin skins. Pinot Noir, for example, is notoriously thin-skinned,
so these wines will always be low in tannins. Nebbiolo grapes, on the
other hand, contain a lot of tannins in their thick skins, so wines made
from these grapes will have an intense tannic character.
</p>
<p>
Even within a grape variety, there can be variation in the levels of
tannins depending on the conditions used to grow the grape. Tannin
molecules may serve as a sort of “sunscreen” for the grapes, absorbing
UV rays from the sun that could be damaging to the grape cells (all
those double bonds in tannins that were mentioned earlier are also great
for absorbing UV radiation!). Thus, grapes that are grown at higher
altitude and in more direct sunlight, where they are more prone to
harmful levels of UV radiation, will produce more tannins to protect
themselves than grapes grown in the shade and at lower elevation.
</p>
<p>
You might have noticed that red wines tend to have more tannins than
white wines. This is because traditionally, red wine is made from red
grapes and the skins are included in the fermentation, while white wine
is made from white grapes and the skins are separated out before
fermentation. With no skins around during fermentation of white wine,
there are no tannins to be had. Rosé is made from red grapes, but the
skins are separated before fermentation, as they are for white wines,
which is why rosés are lighter in color and tannins than red
wines<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. A fun tasting experiment is to try
to find a red wine and a rosé from the same producer of the same grape
(something to ask about the next time you’re at the wine store!).
Tasting these wines side by side will give you a sense of what flavors
and sensation come from the grape juice vs. the grape skins.
</p>
<p>
There is a fourth variety of wine growing in popularity in the US called
“orange wine” or “skin contact white wine.” Just like how rosés are made
from red grapes in the style of white wines, orange wines are made from
white grapes in the style of red wines. That is, orange wines are made
by fermenting white grapes without separating out the skins. Therefore,
these wines have some of the color and tannic complexity of red wines,
with the brightness and acidity of white wines. They come in varying
shades from light yellow to deep amber depending on how long the skins
were kept mixed into the juice during fermentation. You can ask at your
local wine store how much skin contact a particular orange wine has. If
they say 6 months, you’re getting a more tannic and dark orange wine,
whereas if they say 24 hours, you’ll be drinking something more akin to
a traditional white wine.
</p>
<p>
You don’t need to know any of this to consume and enjoy the complexity
that tannins bring to wine, but it is fun to think about how much more
our mouths can do than just taste. Because the drying sensation we get
from tannins happens in our mouths, we often talk about tasting them;
however, the sense we use to detect tannins is actually touch. By
feeling the clumping of saliva proteins in your mouth you’re getting a
glimpse into the story of the wine, starting from the conditions of the
grape growing in the vineyard, through the fermentation of the grape
juice, and finally, into the bottle. And understanding the mechanism
behind our perception can help us bring awareness to the tannins and
other features of great wine. You might get so focused that you start to
notice differences in the astringency feeling you get from some wines
versus others. In fact, people might describe different types of tannins
in wine as soft, fine or even velvety.
</p>
<p>
Finding tannins in food, even beyond wine, can be an effective
mindfulness practice. The next time you eat or drink, try to distinguish
between what your mouth is feeling versus what you are tasting, and
you’ll likely discover many more tannins in food!

<em>There are such queer things about orchids. Such possibilities of
surprises.</em>

1894</em></sup></sub>

<p>
<span class="first-letter">I</span>n 1862, three years after <em>The
Origin of Species</em>, Charles Darwin published <em>On the Various
Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilized by
Insects</em>. Using the mechanics of orchid pollination, Darwin sought
to provide empirical evidence for his new theory of evolution.
Specifically, since orchids attract pollinating insects with nectar,
traits of orchids and insects should have evolved together. When Darwin
was sent an orchid from Madagascar with a nectar tube almost a foot in
length, he surmised that there must exist an insect with a proboscis—an
elongated tubular mouthpart—long enough to reach the nectar. The insect
in question was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2013/oct/02/moth-tongues-orchids-darwin-evolution" target="_blank">discovered
21 years after Darwin’s death</a>. The moth <em>Xanthopan morganii
praedicta</em> (translating to “predicted moth”) has a proboscis up to
14 inches long and exclusively pollinates the Madagascar orchid.
Darwin’s accurate prediction that the orchid’s floral morphology was
adapted to extremely specific pollinators vindicated natural selection
as not just metaphysical speculation, but a principle able to generate
hypotheses and guide experimentation.

In his studies, however, one genus of orchid baffled Darwin. Orchids of
the genus <em>Ophrys</em> rarely produced nectar but were clearly
adapted to insect pollination. Most curiously, they resembled insects
enough to be given common names such as bee orchid or fly orchid. Why
these orchids had adopted insectiform mimicry, however, remained
unclear. Only sixty years later, in the early 20th century, would
naturalists Maurice Pouyanne, Edith Coleman, and Masters John Godfery
separately answer this question. All of them observed that
<em>Ophrys</em> orchids are indeed pollinated by insects, despite not
producing nectar to attract them. Rather, the central petal at the base
of the bee orchid specifically resembles the abdomen of a female bee,
both in texture and in coloration. Males of the species mistake the
orchid for a female bee, land on the petal, and attempt to mate with the
flower. As the bee does so, its movements dislodge the orchid’s dense
packets of pollen onto the bee, which will fertilize the next
<em>Ophrys</em> flower the unwitting insect attempts to mate with.
Unlike other orchids that leverage insects’ hunger for nectar, the
<em>Ophrys</em> orchids leverage their hunger for sex.

<p>
Intriguingly, interactions between insects and these orchids were
documented by Darwin himself. There are accounts of <em>Ophrys</em>
being “attacked” by bees in his 1862 book, though his records read, “The
meaning of these attacks, I cannot conjecture.” Though Darwin was making
the same observations as the naturalists who would make the discovery
sixty years later, he was unable to interpret their significance.

Darwin’s struggle to understand <em>Ophrys</em> orchid was likely
colored by the
“<a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1904-06-26/ed-1/seq-54/" target="_blank">orchidelirium</a>”
seizing broader Victorian society at that time. These rare flowers were
a luxury commodity accessible only to the very wealthy, with desirable
varieties selling for
<a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1906-02-25/ed-1/seq-31/#date1=1836&amp;index=1&amp;rows=20&amp;words=hunter+hunters+orchid+orchid-hunter+orchid-hunters&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=orchid+hunters&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1" target="_blank">over
$20,000 in today’s money</a>. Demand produced a new professional class
of orchid hunters, explorers commissioned by rich patrons to go on
expeditions into the tropics. While “delirium” implies fevered
psychological compulsion, the Victorian appetite for orchids can also be
understood as an exercise in wealth, power, and control. Orchid
ownership not only signified riches, but connections, education, and
taste—a material avenue through which the hierarchies of Victorian
England could be expressed.
</p>
<p>
Nineteenth-century English society was highly stratified along lines of
gender and culture, and the principles underlying Darwin’s own work were
extrapolated to justify its social hierarchies. The philosophy of Social
Darwinism suggested, rather conveniently, that the current social
hierarchy was simply the “natural” outcome of applying natural selection
and evolution to human society. The philosopher Herbert Spencer, coiner
of the phrase “survival of the fittest,” used the
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3177552.pdf" target="_blank">metaphor
of the body</a> to describe the Victorian hierarchy of gender and class.
Upper or middle-class men were the Head, the seat of reason, and thus
suited to rule and govern. Women were the Heart, keepers of emotion and
spirituality. Notably, botany, particularly the study of flowers, was a
culturally sanctioned science for women, intended to socialize them into
rationality and industriousness, and away from feminine frivolity.
Cultural hierarchies were also used to justify British colonialism as a
“civilizing mission” necessary to “assist” colonies to develop
sufficiently sophisticated governments and societies. Therefore,
orchids, from yet-unexplored regions beyond the empire’s reach, were
seen as passive objects to be acquired and cultivated to English tastes.
</p>
<p>
The process of acquiring orchids only reinforced their place in
Victorian hierarchies as exotic objects. The expeditions were dangerous,
and orchid hunting was a hypermasculine arena, far from the feminine
associations of botany. Orchid hunters ventured to far-flung locales,
lured by the promise of fortune and repute, but often met grisly ends.
Moreover, the journey of the intrepid orchid hunter into the tropics was
not only a physical danger, but a moral one as well. Explorers were
entering a space unregulated by English societal norms and morality,
with only their own self-control preventing them from being corrupted
away from Victorian gentility. While lurid stories of murder and
betrayal among orchid hunters resulted from financial competition rather
than any tropical corruption, the idea of the tropics as an inherently
transgressive space captured the public imagination. Surviving an orchid
hunt acted out a cultural narrative of the triumph of civilization over
chaos, of English propriety over deviant morality. In return, victors
were rewarded with their own personal part of the tropics, a personal
stake in the colonial machine. As the empire expanded with growing
networks of colonists, missionaries, and traders, exploring and
exploiting the tropics became easier. Maps were drawn, dangers were
cataloged, and routes were constructed, enabling increased varieties and
numbers of orchids to be shipped to England. The once-unattainable
orchid was now safely contained in English greenhouses, stripped of its
perilous origins, a tamed and civilized ornament.
</p>
<p>
This view of the orchid, submissive to male impulses and receptive to
“civilizing” forces, could certainly present an obstacle to
understanding its actively deceptive and manipulative pollination
strategies. In fact, the gradual understanding of its actual biology
coincided with and may have benefited from a shift in Victorian society.
As the reach of the British empire expanded rapidly through the 19th
century, so too did cultural anxiety. The Victorian social hierarchy was
being challenged both at home and abroad. The word “feminist”
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23720210?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">entered
English usage in the 1890s</a>, with women campaigning for the rights to
their own bodily autonomy, such as sexual consent within marriage and
the ability to use contraception.
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230117389_12" target="_blank">Organized
anticolonial movements</a> escalated in the latter half of the century,
including years-long armed resistance throughout the African continent
and mass political mobilization in South Asia. The assured status of the
patriarchal empire no longer seemed so certain, and the exoticizing
fascination in cultural narratives took on a distinct element of fear.
</p>
<p>
These growing fears around gender and loss of empire were conflated in a
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27278105/" target="_blank">common
literary archetype</a> in tropical journey narratives of the 19th
century: the “native woman.” She was
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3177552.pdf" target="_blank">Other
in both race and sex</a>, uncannily seductive, dangerously sensuous, and
irrevocably foreign. Previously exotic and passive through the lens of
white male protagonists, the “native woman” evolves into something more
ominous by the end of the century, often with the help of the orchid. In
the pulp magazine story,
“<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27278105/" target="_blank">The
Orchid Horror</a>”, the protagonist is seduced by an unnamed native
woman called the Goddess of the Orchids, who sends him to collect an
orchid she does not yet have. Upon finding it, he realizes the orchid’s
scent is a powerful narcotic, entrapping those who inhale it to the
Goddess’s will. Other stories describe secretly carnivorous orchids worn
around the necks of native women, or in more literal presentations,
monstrous hybrid orchid-women endemic to the tropics. The orchid took on
the recurring image of the provocative Other, capable of undermining and
subverting hierarchy and social order—the flower as exotic seductress,
as
<em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/femme%20fatale" target="_blank">femme
fatale</a></em>. The ending of the 1894 short story,
“<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/2865/" target="_blank">The
Flowering of the Strange Orchid</a>,” by science fiction author H.G.
Wells lays these anxieties bare: the unsuspecting protagonist is
overwhelmed by the orchid’s sickly-sweet scent and is seized by its
bloodsucking roots. The orchid he had assumed was a harmless beauty
turns out to be a vampiric predator, and he is only saved by his
housekeeper, who was suspicious of the overtly foreign bloom. The
creeping unease is obvious: what if the subjugated are no longer truly
within our control? In this space, so far from the assumptions of
Darwin’s Victorian England, an orchid pollinated by providing false
sexual promises is no longer far-fetched.

The slow discovery of <em>Ophrys</em> pollination illustrates the
dialectic of scientific discovery: social context continuously
influences the way we do and understand science. <em>Ophrys</em>
pollination had to be observed, but it also had to be interpreted.
Exactly how it was interpreted was dependent on the social and cultural
narratives surrounding it. As science historian Jim Endersby concisely
puts it in his book
<em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo24044571.html" target="_blank">Orchid:
A Cultural History</a></em>, “There is no stable boundary between the
natural and the cultural.” For <em>Ophrys</em> pollination to be
understood as an act of sexual deception, three intertwined cultural
ideas—femininity, foreignness, and flowers—had to be simultaneously
reimagined as active subjects instead of passive objects. The
destabilization of Victorian society was a powerful catalyst for this
reimagination: the greater emancipation of English women and the
emergence of organized anticolonial movements challenged what were once
thought of as “natural” hierarchies, inspiring reactionary consternation
and manifesting as sublimated fears in popular culture like “The
Flowering of the Strange Orchid.”
</p>
<p>
Femininity, seduction, and deception remain entwined with
<em>Ophrys</em> pollination even today, and the orchid continues to
report on changing, though not necessarily improved, cultural
hierarchies: tellingly, some botanists still refer to the bee orchid by
another common name: the prostitute flower. While we may prefer to
believe that the empirical process of science is completely separated
from our sociocultural beliefs, the parallel shifts in the cultural and
scientific understanding of orchids tell another story. Like an insect
enticed by <em>Ophrys</em>, we labor under a compelling belief, but
ultimately an illusory one.

Think you know what’s up with the proposed redevelopment of the West
L.A. Civic Center? The November 9th, 2021 West L.A. Commons community
meeting shed some light and details on the project but few on
preservation, much like the project itself.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the scoop:
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
Built between 1957-1965 to meet growing demand for government services,
the West L.A. Civic Center is significant for its Modernist architecture
and role in expanded government services following WWII. More recently,
it’s become hallowed ground for L.A.’s skateboarding scene, attracting
skaters worldwide with its stairs and ledges. In January 2021, the
County and City selected Abode Communities and AvalonBay Communities to
redevelop the site.
</p>
<p>
As currently planned, the 1960 Courthouse, 1961 branch City Hall, 1962
Community Center (Senior Center), and 1965 Amphitheatre are to be
demolished.
</p>
<p>
(Only the 1956 library will stay–for now–and is not a part of this
project scope.)
</p>
<p>
<b><i>This means an eligible historic district marking an important part
of West L.A.’s growth will be erased.</i></b>

<p>
Two facades of the branch City Hall were planned to be kept (which is
not preservation) yet that is now being reconsidered, citing soil
conditions. The same goes for the now-doomed Googie style Amphitheatre,
despite being marked for preservation in the proposal that was selected
by the City and County.
</p>
<p>
As a public-private venture between the City, County and the developer
(AvalonBay and Abode Communities), preservation was supposed to be a
priority, at least it was in the official Request for Proposals (RFP)
process, stated as one of ten key aspects to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
<i>So … what is happening here?</i>
</p>
<p>
Preservation through adaptive reuse is readily achievable in this
project, and can complement the proposed new mixed income housing. New
buildings of the same footprint are to replace the branch City Hall and
Courthouse. The existing Amphitheatre can be repurposed and kept.
</p>
<p>
It is easier to demolish everything and build subterranean parking over
the entire site than build around the historic buildings. Yet easy does
not equal better. Until someone in leadership steps forward and presses
for an alternative that successfully marries the old with the new, this
development team will continue to seek the easy way out. As a familiar
pattern that keeps repeating itself across this city, L.A. can do and
deserves better.
</p>
<p>
Please join the L.A. Conservancy in pressing City Councilmember Mike
Bonin and County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl for another alternative! Email

<p>
<span class="first-letter">S</span>ome of the greatest technological
advancements in history have come from exploiting the laws of physics.
With further mastery of each set of laws came a new chapter in the
history of mankind. Newton’s laws unlocked the secrets of motion. We
have used his discoveries to build bridges and skyscrapers, and send
rockets to the moon. The laws of thermodynamics brought about the
engines that make our cars run, the refrigerators that preserve our
food, and the machinery of the industrial revolution. The laws of
electricity and magnetism taught us how to power our cities, to build
the electronics in our cellphones and laptops, and to communicate with
people halfway across the globe. But there is a set of laws in physics
that we have not yet learned to fully exploit, and these are the laws of
quantum mechanics. These laws describe very small things like atoms and
molecules, and very cold things, hundreds of degrees below freezing. At
these extremes, the physics of everyday life completely breaks down, and
light and matter behave in very bizarre ways.
</p>
<p>
To understand this behavior, let’s take a crash course on quantum
physics.
</p>
<p>
You’re probably familiar with the idea of a state. Traffic lights can be
in one of three states: green, yellow, or red. Coins have two states:
heads or tails. In the quantum world, objects exist in states with very
specific physical properties. Atoms, for example, have <em>energy
states</em>, where their energies take on specific values—we say the
energies are <em>quantized</em>, hence the term ‘quantum mechanics’. In
each energy state, electrons move around the atom with different speeds
and spatial patterns. This is like if you were driving a car, but
instead of gradually speeding up when you step on the gas, you jump
spontaneously to different speeds: 10mph to 20mph to 50mph.
</p>
<p>
But it’s more complicated than that: quantum objects behave wildly
differently when we’re not looking at them. Before we look at a quantum
object, it has no well-defined physical properties like energy,
position, or speed. Instead, a quantum object exists in a combination of
all of its possible states <em>simultaneously</em>, until someone looks
at it. At that moment, the object pops into existence in a single state
(there are other interpretations of this effect involving
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZacggH9wB7Y&amp;t=182s" target="_blank">multiple
universes</a>, but we’ll leave that for another day). The very act of
<em>looking</em> at a quantum object changes its state.
</p>
<p>
That’s like a car approaching a fork in the road, but instead of going
down one path or the other, it exists in two different locations at once
and travels down <em>both</em> paths. But the moment someone clocks the
car’s speed, it pops into existence at a single place. It sounds
ridiculous, but this is the reality of the quantum world. When we’re not
looking, the tiniest objects like electrons can be in multiple places or
move in different directions at once (though in reality it’s a bit more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv-YXKRUheQ" target="_blank">subtle</a>).
We call this behavior
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwWRX9IdblE&amp;t=663s" target="_blank"><em>superposition</em></a>.
</p>

<p class="c-content__image-caption">
A car traveling down a path that splits. If the car obeyed quantum
physics, then it does not go down one path or the other; it partially
goes down both paths at once while no one is looking. As soon as someone
looks, the car randomly appears on one of the two paths and the version
of the car traveling down the opposite path disappears.

<p>
Perhaps weirdest of all is that multiple quantum objects can behave in a
coordinated way, where the state of one object
<a href="https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/untangling-entanglement" target="_blank">seems
to affect</a> the state of another, no matter where they are in the
universe. Imagine having a pair of coins that always land on the same
face when you flip them. If one coin lands on heads, the other coin will
land on heads, even if they are on opposite sides of the galaxy. It
sounds like wizardry, but this is the essence of a real phenomenon
called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unb_yoj1Usk" target="_blank"><em>entanglement</em></a>,
one of the most powerful resources of the quantum world. We observe
entanglement in how electrons spin, how light propagates, how atoms
move, and much more.

<p>
What if we could tap into these strange properties? What could we do
with them? This question is the foundation of quantum information, an
emerging frontier of science. After a few decades of research,
<em>quantum information</em> is poised to have a dramatic impact on
science and technology.
</p>
<p>
To understand how, let’s look at the simple idea that kickstarted
today’s information revolution: all of the information in our computers
is stored as a string of 1’s and 0’s. The text you just sent? Your
recent bank transaction? The color of the pixels on your screen? All
have a special code in your computer made of a specific combination of
1’s and 0’s. Each digit of this code is called a <em>bit</em>, and they
are the fundamental building blocks of today’s information.
</p>
<p>
Of course, 1 and 0 are just mathematical abstractions, so these bits are
encoded in real life through the voltage in tiny electrical switches.
‘0’ corresponds to the switch being OFF, and ‘1’ corresponds to the
switch being ON. Each computer chip contains billions of these switches,
flipping on and off in a desired way to store and process information.
The essence of solving a problem on a computer is flipping these
switches into a final configuration that represents the answer to the
problem.
</p>
<p>
Crucially, the way information behaves depends on the physical object
that carries the information. In today’s computers, our information
carriers can only do one of two things: turn on and turn off. What if we
could store information inside something else, something that behaves
fundamentally differently? That’s where quantum information comes in.
</p>
<p>
Instead of electrical switches, the 1’s and 0’s in quantum information
are stored in the quantum states of light and matter. This could be, for
example, the energy states of an atom. ‘0’ corresponds to one energy
state, and ‘1’ corresponds to a different energy state. Because of this,
information behaves in a much richer way than before: information can
exist in superposition and be entangled. The bits in quantum
information, called <em>qubits</em>, can be 1, 0, or a superposition of
1 and 0 simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Add more qubits, and the complexity increases. Two bits can have four
states: ‘00’, ‘01’, ‘10’, or ‘11’. A superposition of two qubits allows
them to be in all four states simultaneously. A three-qubit
superposition has eight states, four have sixteen, and so on. Just 60
qubits in superposition have over one <em>quintillion</em> possible
states, more than the world’s biggest supercomputers. A <em>quantum
computer</em> made of 60 qubits could store and manipulate all of that
information <em>simultaneously</em>.
</p>
<p>
The caveat is that we can’t access all of that information. Just like
the car approaching the fork in the road, as soon as we look at the
qubits, the superposition is destroyed and only a single state out of
the one quintillion is revealed to us. This is bad for computation: how
do we know that the one state revealed to us contains the right answer?
It boils down to the
<a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta/course/introduction-course" target="_blank">mathematics</a>,
but scientists have found clever ways to control qubits in some
algorithms to get around this problem. The result is that these quantum
computers have the potential to solve certain problems that are far
beyond the capabilities of conventional computers.
</p>
<p>
One example is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD370qyxTyw" target="_blank">quantum
simulation</a>, where we program a computer to replicate the behavior of
the atoms, electrons, and nuclei in a chemical or material. Quantum
simulation helps us understand how atoms and electrons interact to give
chemicals their properties. This could pave the way for developing
life-saving drugs, new energy sources, and a better understanding of the
universe itself. Today’s computers are surprisingly bad at quantum
simulation, because it requires keeping track of all possible quantum
states of a complex arrangement of atoms. A typical drug like penicillin
has more quantum states than the number of atoms in the universe. We
couldn’t simulate its full quantum structure on a conventional computer
within our lifetime. Quantum computers are uniquely poised for this
task, because qubits obey quantum physics exactly the same way the
states of a molecule do. A quantum computer with roughly 100-1000 qubits
could simulate molecules like penicillin within a few days. Quantum
computers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvIbrDR1G_c" target="_blank">aren’t
all-powerful</a>, though. This type of magnificent speedup is only
possible for a few problems, but these problems have enormous
implications for a wide range of industries.
</p>
<p>
We can also use qubits to send information more securely through a
<em>quantum internet</em>. We’re constantly sharing important
information online: credit cards, social security numbers, and more.
Ensuring information is secure online is a crucial aspect of the
internet. As computers get smarter and faster, it becomes easier for
hackers to access your important information without you knowing. In
fact, an alarming problem that a large (thousands of qubits) quantum
computer would be very good at is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q&amp;t=846s" target="_blank">breaking
RSA encryption</a> - the method that protects most of your information
on the internet.
</p>
<p>
Quantum information is much trickier to hack. It hinges on the idea that
looking at a qubit changes its state. Imagine you want to share
information stored in qubits. If a hacker tries to read the message, the
qubits containing the message will change their state, revealing random
gibberish. Scientists have developed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiJiXNEm-Go" target="_blank">
<em>quantum encryption protocols</em></a> based on this idea. It’s a
guaranteed way to know if a hacker is tampering with sensitive
information. For this reason, a quantum internet has the attention of
banks, governments, and schools.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps the most exciting answer to what quantum information will be
useful for is this: <em>no one really knows</em>. 50 years ago, we could
never have predicted the enormous impact computers and the internet
would have on our daily lives. The explosion of the Information Age came
about through decades of experimentation. It’s likely we’ll see the same
with quantum information: the most exciting applications may only reveal
themselves once the technology starts maturing.
</p>
<p>
So where are we in this grand vision? We have quantum devices with
50-100 qubits, but we can’t control them accurately enough to really do
anything useful with them yet. This is because quantum states are
incredibly sensitive to their environment. Remember that looking at a
quantum object changes its state, but it’s not just us humans that do
the looking. Everything in the environment can “look” at a qubit by
interacting with it, from static charge to vibrations in the ground to
molecules in the air. Even the tiniest disturbance can alter the state
of a qubit, which leads to corrupted information. It’s like trying to
balance a pencil on its tip: even the slightest push can topple the
pencil. It’s why scientists are building
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV1wL5jsfRU" target="_blank">
intricate</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-FyH2A7Ed0" target="_blank">
protective machinery</a> to isolate qubits from the outside world. Even
then, it’s not enough.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, scientists have spent years developing protocols for
detecting and correcting these errors. These protocols are known as
<em>quantum error correction codes</em>, and they are the reason we
believe quantum technology is feasible even in the presence of errors.
In a quantum error correction code, the 1’s and 0’s aren’t the qubits
themselves, but how the qubits are <em>entangled</em>. Let’s go back to
the pair of entangled quantum coins. There are two possible ways they
can be entangled. In one way, the coins always land on the same face. In
the other way, the coins always land on opposite faces. We can call ‘0’
the state where the coins land the same, and ‘1’ the state where the
coins land opposite. The stored information is protected because even if
one of the coins is disturbed, the information about how the coins are
entangled remains hidden to the environment unless <em>both</em> of the
coins are disturbed.
</p>
<p>
This protection comes at a cost: you need two qubits to encode one
‘protected’ qubit. Practical error correction protocols are more
extravagant and require tens, hundreds, even thousands of entangled
qubits per protected qubit. This means that quantum technology of any
practical use requires control of thousands, even millions of qubits,
far off from the number we have today. No need to worry about quantum
computers breaking the internet any time soon.
</p>
<p>
But we’re making progress: over the last 20 years we’ve gone from pen
and paper ideas to functional intermediately-sized quantum machines.
We’re playing with atoms, light, and ultra-cold electronics in the lab,
learning to harness their properties. We’re beginning to demonstrate the
first quantum error correction protocol, sending qubits
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QlcKuxDGrs" target="_blank">
over hundreds of miles</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZNEzzDcllU" target="_blank">
doing calculations </a> on quantum computers that surpass the
capabilities of our traditional computers. That said, large-scale
quantum technology with practical relevance to our lives will likely
only arrive once we figure out how to implement quantum error
correction. How long will that take? No one really knows for sure: it
could be 5 years, 5 decades, or more, but the work we do now will pave
the way for that long-term vision.

<span class="first-letter">W</span>hen I signed up to tutor underserved
high school students at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I wasn’t
quite sure what to expect. I had tutored before, but never through a
computer screen, and I was anticipating challenges. However, when
teaching a high school biology module on population genetics, I
discovered a koi pond simulation<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The
student and I watched as the fish in our virtual pond changed from
orange to white over simulated generations, with young fish appearing
and old fish disappearing. With just a few buttons, the student could
adjust the parameters that affect the rates of evolutionary change in
the koi population, like the number of fish and rate of genetic
mutation, and rerun the simulation. As the koi changed from orange to
white faster or slower, I saw the principles of evolution and genetics
begin to click into place for the student. While this koi pond
simulation may not have the aesthetics and user experience of today’s
most popular video games, I was still impressed. The use of interactive
virtual games was certainly not a widely available learning tool when I
was a high school student, but over the past year of tutoring, I
repeatedly discovered that virtual games are an effective way to teach.
</p>
<p>
I might not have found the koi pond simulation if the COVID-19 pandemic
had not forced me to meet with my student remotely. During the pandemic,
many teachers turned to new virtual tools out of necessity, but even as
many students return to the classroom, interactive and engaging virtual
worlds could continue to be a valuable resource for teaching.
</p>
<p>
The video game industry and the rise of virtual reality (VR) have laid
the groundwork to make science education virtual. People who play video
games spend an average of 7 hours a week in the virtual
world<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In America, 60% of 18-29 year olds
are gamers<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. Not only do more young people
play video games, but they also spend the most time, averaging 8 hours
per week with a preference for strategy and puzzle
games<sup><a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a></sup>. Young gamers
demonstrate incredible focus, persistence, attention to detail,
patience, and creativity as they conquer each challenge and improve
towards mastery. These are some of the same traits that are key to
excelling in a different arena:
science<sup><a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a></sup>. By adopting
techniques successfully used in gaming, science education could more
effectively captivate the interest of young people in primary and
secondary school to improve scientific literacy and preparation for
careers in science.
</p>
<p>
Immersive design is a key element that keeps people playing. Gamers are
engrossed by well-developed characters and stories that require constant
interaction<sup><a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a></sup>. But it’s
not just the story that keeps people hooked—background
music<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> and interactive, aesthetic
graphics<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> engage people in the virtual
world. Elements of achievement and competition, such as the use of
progress bars, level advancement, fake currency, prizes, and increased
challenge as the user advances, help to keep gamers motivated and
provide feedback<sup><a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
While the use of virtual interactive environments is starting to trickle
into classrooms, the immersive design of technologies like video games
and VR could purposefully be applied towards making science education
more engaging. Scientific objectives could be part of a story where the
student is a key character that actively participates by advancing
through the material. Through engaging music and
graphics<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>, the virtual format could bring
abstract ideas to life or create more authentic and inspiring
visualizations of cells or ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
Unlike a large classroom, the video game experience can be very
individualized. The gaming interface makes it possible for learners to
receive instantaneous, personalized feedback on their progress toward
mastering scientific concepts through repetition. Students come from
varying backgrounds and skill levels, and with the customized options of
a video game, students can complete side quests for supplementary
material to reward curiosity, spend more or less time on topics catered
to their unique strengths and weaknesses, and progress towards mastery
in a way not possible in a traditional classroom. The video game format
could make education more immersive, individualized, and therefore,

The design and mechanisms used in popular games can serve as inspiration
to guide the gamification of scientific concepts. Take <em>Tetris</em>,
a tile-matching game in which the user manipulates tiles to fill gaps
under increasing time pressure as the user advances. A similar setup
could be used to teach DNA transcription to RNA, as the user matches
complementary base pairs of DNA and RNA nucleotides. Alternatively,
inspired by <em>Mario Kart</em>, blood cells could race through the
circulatory system, refueling with oxygen at the lungs and even
delivering medications to treat obstacles like clots. For a more
creative or survival themed game, the user could ward off viral or
bacterial infections by producing an antibody response or applying
therapeutics while learning how they work.

Video games demonstrate a long-established ability to engage the public
in everything from education to exercise. <em>Wii Sports</em> and
<em>Pokémon Go</em> got users moving, off the couch and into the
neighborhood respectively, gaining attention not only for their
interactive formats, but also for their fitness
benefits<sup><a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a></sup>. On the
education front, <em>Where in the World is Carmen SanDiego?</em>
incorporates history, geography, and culture as players follow the
titular character on her global crime-solving
missions<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>. <em>The Oregon Trail</em>
similarly educates players on the harsh trials of the U.S. westward
migration in the 19th century<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>. Both of
these games have persisted in public consciousness years after they were
first used in schools. The science-based television shows <em>Bill Nye
the Science Guy</em> and <em>The Magic School Bus</em> and
disease-combating board game Pandemic have also achieved mainstream
popularity<sup><a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a></sup>. These
successes show it is possible for broad science education to be
engaging—perhaps now through a video game format.
</p>
<p>
Promising efforts to use virtual worlds to enhance science research and
education are already underway. In the video game <em>InCell
VR</em><sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>, the player races to save a human
cell from destruction by a virus while learning biology concepts along
the way. Use of VR technology in <em>InCell VR</em> and other games
shows promise for making science education even more interactive and
collaborative<sup><a href="#17">17</a>,<a href="#18">18</a></sup>. Use
of VR for training in science-related professions is also expanding:
neurosurgeons can now practice operating on a virtual
brain<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>, and scientists at Purdue
University are developing VR courses for training in cryo-electron
microscopy<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>, the topic of the 2017 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. Such applications demonstrate the value of immersive
virtual learning environments for technical education.
</p>
<p>
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have had to adapt to a
new age of “Zoom learning”. However, this isn’t the only way to approach
remote learning. Since 2018, Caltech has also been developing a software
prototype for a VR teaching space to provide a virtual environment for
college-level education. In this virtual classroom, students have
streamlined options to interact with the instructor, other students, and
3D scientific models, all with the click of a
button<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>. Science teachers can use this
technology to instantaneously assess understanding of the materials and
rapidly customize activities to each student’s needs, creating a more
personalized and immersive educational experience. Likewise, students
can instantly and privately indicate confusion and get extra practice on
difficult material, promoting inclusivity. Development of these new
educational tools could not only facilitate more effective remote
teaching during the current pandemic, but also expand the capabilities
of future classrooms to tackle persistent challenges.

</p>
<p>
Despite the potential benefits of incorporating this immersive
technology into schools, this objective faces the same major hurdle as
most educational endeavors: money. Video gaming is a massive industry
that generated $120 billion in revenue in
2019<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>, but production costs can range in
the millions for games with advanced graphics and modern
software-development
tools<sup><a href="#23">23</a>,<a href="#24">24</a></sup>. It is not
clear if the government, schools, individuals, or some combination would
contribute most to profits that drive production. Nevertheless, <em>The
Oregon Trail</em> generated around ten million dollars in revenue
annually by 1995, demonstrating the potential profitability of
educational games<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>. The rising U.S.
learning-based game market is also promising: valued at $2.4 billion in
2018, the value is projected to exceed $4 billion by
2024<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup>. Heavy collaboration between
educators and game developers seems critical to create games that are
both educational and engaging (and therefore
profitable)<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>. However, the impact of even
a great science game will only extend as far as the number of people it
reaches. While games like <em>The Oregon Trail</em> show us that
popularity and revenue are possible for educational games, disparities
in technology access and public school funding remain a hurdle for video
games to be a truly equalizing force in science education.
</p>
<p>
Combining immersive and entertaining virtual worlds with instructional
design that meets learning objectives is key for this educational
strategy to be successful. Using the interactive format of video games
and VR in the classroom could not only increase engagement but also make
science education more personalized, inclusive, and therefore,
effective. Gamification of education to reach a diverse audience of
young people may lead to a more informed world, increased appreciation
for science, and preparation for a career in STEM. It is time VR
headsets and game controllers made their way into the classroom, giving
education an overdue technological upgrade to immerse students in
science.

Letters Year in Review: Our 5 Favorite Articles of 2020-2021</h2>
<p>date: 2021-10-05, from: Caltech Letters (a student blog)</p>
<p>
This past year has been a remarkable one for Caltech Letters. As the
pandemic slowed and the campus gradually sputtered back to life, we
celebrated the publication of our 40th feature-length science article
and the second year of our viewpoints section. In the four years since
our launch, we’ve published work by over 70 Caltech scientists and
exponentially grown our audience to hundreds of thousands.
</p>
<p>
Here are a few of our favorite reads from 2020-2021’s lineup:

Genomes are the “blueprints” of life. Their building blocks are billions
of tiny nucleotides—denoted by the letters A, C, T, G—which form
instructions for cells to grow, die, or behave in certain ways. This
story, of course, is well-known to folks who remember high school
biology.
</p>
<p>
But how do cells actually read and interpret the contents of a genome?
Given an almost endless list of instructions, when do cells know which
ones to follow, and in what order? Enter the realm of gene regulation.
Although they may seem like a static jumble of letters, genomes in fact
operate dynamically and—like a novel—are richly infused with their own
grammar, punctuation, and plot.
</p>
<p>
Graduate students Suzy Beeler (PhD ’21) and Nicholas McCarty explain how
today’s biologists and physicists decode the beautiful, chaotic language
through which genes express themselves.

Objectivity is frequently viewed as a core tenet of the scientific
method. But what does it mean to be objective in science? And what
happens when the process of conducting research clashes with the
surrounding environment and community?
</p>
<p>
Unlike science, art makes no pretenses of independence, but also
naturally incorporates the complex cultural, political, and social
contexts in which it lives. Can researchers produce better science by
accounting for subjectivity and the oft-entangled relationships their
work has with the broader world?
</p>
<p>
Graduate student Sarah Zeichner examines these questions as she studies
landscapes from her perspectives as both a geochemist and an artist.

For over two decades, the opioid epidemic has silently burned through
the US, leaving only a mounting death toll and devastated communities in
its wake. But until recently, detailed, distributor-level data on sales
of opioids has been kept behind closed doors, posing challenges to
researchers who have sought to reconstruct the epidemic’s path. Armed
with data recently made public by a federal lawsuit, graduate student
Shiyu Zhang and a classmate track how misuse of name-brand oxycodone
fell after a major manufacturer was pressured by regulators to make its
pills harder to abuse.

<p>
Robert A. Millikan is a venerated man.
</p>
<p>
A physicist and Nobel laureate, Millikan is known for his namesake 1913
oil drop experiment and—during a 26-year tenure as Caltech’s first
president—his role in transforming the Institute from a small vocational
school into a top-flight research center.
</p>
<p>
Nearly a century later, however, that legacy has come under fire, both
on campus and across Southern California.
</p>
<p>
In an emphatic viewpoint, Sophia Charan (PhD ’21) challenges readers to
re-examine Millikan and several of Caltech’s key benefactors in light of
their staunch promotion of eugenics, segregation, and racial redlining
throughout the early 20th century. Amid a national reckoning over racial
injustice, Charan explores how we can reconcile this sordid history with
visions for a more just, inclusive future at Caltech.

<p>
“What is life?”
</p>
<p>
It’s a deceptively simple question, but attempting to answer it can lead
to long-winded, inconsistent, and maybe even downright paradoxical
definitions. For centuries, philosophers and scientists have struggled
to come up with a set of universal, easy-to-understand criteria for this
fundamental phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, bacteria and insects are alive, and an inanimate rock is not.
But what about self-replicating machines or viral ideas, like Internet
memes? Could those be “alive?”
</p>
<p>
How about creatures—if they are to be found—on other planets? Will they
satisfy any known definition of “life” that we have here on earth?
</p>
<p>
As planetary scientist and astrobiologist Mike Wong (PhD ’18) explains,
truly understanding life and its origins might require a new framework
that moves beyond familiar precepts of earth-bound biology.

<b><i>Interview by Gabriela Philo</i></b>
</p>
<p>
Helen Tocco recently spoke to us about her experience in the
Conservancy’s Community Leadership Boot Camp, and why she is a
Conservancy member.
</p>
<p>
<b>Which neighborhood do you live in? </b>
</p>
<p>
And what makes it distinct? I live in Palms. It is a wonderful walkable
community with tons of great restaurants and local businesses, a Metro
stop, good freeway proximity, and you can even find street parking here.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
<b>You’ve been a Los Angeles Conservancy member since 2018. What
compelled you to join? </b>
</p>
<p>
I learned about the Conservancy when they got involved to try to help
save the Tabor House, which was a historic home in Palms. Unfortunately,
the building was demolished, but it led me to want to learn more about
the Conservancy and L.A. historic buildings.
</p>
<p>
<b>This Spring, you joined the Community Leadership Boot Camp. What did
you get out of the experience? </b>
</p>
<p>
I am an architect in my day job and I work on historic easement and
historic tax credit projects around the country, so I am always looking
to expand my learning and the Boot Camp seemed like a great opportunity.
I also wanted to learn how to be more prepared to save the few remaining
historic buildings in Palms if any more face demolition like the Tabor
House did.
</p>
<p>
<b>You’re on the Board of the Palms Neighborhood Council; why do you
think it’s important to be active in neighborhood activities? </b>
</p>
<p>
L.A. is such a big city that Neighborhood Councils are crucial to help
our city government keep tabs on specific local concerns and build
community engagement.
</p>
<p>
<b>Which programs of the L.A. Conservancy do you like and why? </b>
</p>
<p>
The Conservancy’s walking tours are fun and educational, and I am so
happy to see that they are back! The Conservancy has also done a great
job with virtual tours and presentations during the pandemic so that we
could stay engaged with historic preservation from the comfort of our
homes.

<b><i>Interview by M. Rosalind Sagara</i></b>
</p>
<p>
The First Baptist Church of Venice and adjacent parking lots located at
671-685 and 686-688 East Westminster Avenue are among the last remaining
significant historic resources associated with the history and
development of Oakwood, an early African American neighborhood in Los
Angeles. These properties tell the story of pioneering African Americans
who financed and built an important center of spiritual, cultural, and
social life in Venice.
</p>
<p>
In 2018, the Cultural Heritage Commission denied the Historic-Cultural
Monument nomination of the church property. The community persisted and
with newfound support from Councilmember Mike Bonin, a new application
for landmark designation was considered by the Cultural Heritage
Commission on June 3, 2021. The Commission unanimously recommended
listing and the nomination now heads to the City Council’s Planning and
Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee and then to the City Council for
final approval.
</p>
<p>
Naomi Nightingale, Venice resident, community organizer, and recent
graduate of the Conservancy’s Community Leadership Boot Camp, helped
gather new information for the nomination. In addition, she has had a
front-row seat to the nearly four-year journey the community has been on
to landmark the church property. Naomi spoke to Neighborhood Outreach
Manager M. Rosalind Sagara in June about what she’s learned about the
landmarking process and her community through her work on this
preservation issue.
</p>

<p>
<b>RS:</b> When did you get involved in preserving the First Baptist
Church of Venice?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN:</b> In 2017 when I saw Laddie Williams sitting in front of the
church. I stopped and asked her why she was there. I learned the church
had been sold and it shocked me. I also learned there were some people
who were members of the church who had filed a lawsuit to prevent the
sale and to keep the church, but they were not successful. The judge
ruled that the sale of church was legitimate; the court would not
rescind the sale. So, at that point, the community decided we were going
to fight to preserve it. Then owner Jay Penske had filed a permit for an
adaptive reuse with the intent of making the church his personal home
and the community was affronted and appalled by that.
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>How did you secure support for the nomination from the
Council District and others?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN: </b>I think Councilmember Bonin saw that the community was
adamant, that we were relentless, and that our efforts for the church
were coming from a place of history, significance, bonding, and ties,
for our grandparents and other people that we knew. While we are talking
about the church, we’re seeing the erasure of our history through the
destruction of buildings and the removal, or the exodus of people and
families. I think he thought we were not going to go away. We pressed
our Councilmember, “What support have you given us? What recognition and
acknowledgement of the contributions and the culture of this [African
American] community have you given us?” I think from that point forward,
there was a shift. He saw us as a formidable force in reference to the
church and what we said made sense in terms of the historical
significance of the church and the community.
</p>
<p>
We felt that not only the Councilmember, but developers, and other
people in other parts of the community didn’t have an understanding
about what the church meant to the African American community. To them,
it was like “What’s the big deal?” These were people who actually lived
here in the community, Caucasian people, who may not have really paid
attention, or had no connection with what was going on. The more that we
were able to put the word out, spread the news so to speak, and engage
people about what the church meant and who Arthur Reese was, the more we
found support. There had not been a lot of information out there about
him except for he was the guy who did the amusement parks, or was the
guy who helped with the decorations, but being a homeowner, a land
owner, civically engaged, that was not information about Reese that
people knew.
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>In your research for the nomination of the church was there a
story that stood out to you?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN:</b> I was ecstatic to learn about the church’s architect George
Williams. It seemed that so much hung on who the builder or architect of
the church was. It seemed that because people were not able to name him
previously, there was less importance or significance to the church
because Paul Williams, the architect of the congregation’s previous
church, was so huge. When I discovered information about George Williams
from the AIA and newspaper clippings, that brought absolute joy to my
heart!
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>What has kept people motivated to stay involved over the
years?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN:</b> The real desire to not allow our history to be erased. That
was at the top of the list. To take the church away and to make it into
someone’s personal living room, bedroom, or living quarters was just
sacrilegious. We just could not allow that to happen. To lose the church
would be to lose so much more in terms of our history, the personalities
of our community, the hard work that we knew, the stories that were told
about our family members who lived on that street, people who went to
that church, and people that we still know today. To us, even though the
church was sold it was still a living, breathing, important piece of our
lives. And there just wasn’t the will to let it go.
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>What activities did you organize to help keep people engaged?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN:</b> We met on those church steps every single Sunday for almost
four years. We passed out fliers and engaged people as they passed by.
We invited other people. We had radio and T.V. appearances. This was
early on when we were going before the Westside Commission and I think I
was asked at the time what will you do, what’s next? “We’re not giving
up.” I was raised with the idea that if you had the fire in your spirit,
that meant you were still supposed to go. As long as there is any spark
of possibility, then you don’t accept no. I didn’t know just like a lot
of us did not know what the outcome was going to be, what the next step
was going to be, but we all knew that whatever it was going to be, we
were not going to stop.
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>Could you talk about how the Black Lives Matter Mural in
front of the church came to be and how it’s related to the community’s
effort to preserve the church?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN:</b> When we met with Councilmember Bonin, we said we needed to
not only preserve the church, but we needed to also have an imprint
within the Oakwood community that also acknowledged the significance of
the community. And we thought the Black Lives Matter mural would do
that. We had a big rally there following George Floyd’s death and we had
probably at least 400 people, or more out there. We held a march and
that raised the importance of the church to the community and to lots of
other people, White, Black, Brown. Not just in the Venice community, or
the Oakwood community, but from outside, people from the beach, from
Santa Monica, students from USC, and other parts of the city. The church
was on the map of the Oakwood community as being the first African
American church in the community and its longevity was known, but it
helped us get widespread acknowledgment. People from Alabama were
writing and inviting me to other meetings about rural communities in the
South! I was able to get information about how other people are going
about trying to save or resurrect their communities.
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>At the June 3rdCultural Heritage Commission meeting,
Councilmember Bonin requested that the parking lots adjacent to the
church and those across the street where the earlier church building had
stood be included in the Historic-Cultural Monument nomination. Can you
tell us more?
</p>
<p>
<b>NN:</b> The City staff findings recommended the church for
designation, but the parking lots were excluded because they believed
they had no significance to the structure itself. We were not in
agreement with that recommendation. From the beginning, we wanted the
lots to be included. I was prepared to make a case for including both
the adjacent lots and those across the street on the day of the hearing.
Arthur Reese owned the lot where the previous church stood. The land was
deeded to him. He donated the lot to the church and was a deacon there.
The church was built on the land. And then across the street, that used
to be a boat yard. The community purchased that land, some of them
giving up their deeds or monies to help build collateral for the
purchase of the land, and then the church was built. So how anyone could
say there’s no connection or historical significance? To me it’s just a
land grab and we’re not going to accept that, and I told them why. The
people that established the Oakwood community, that worked it, made it
what it is, that gave to the land, that brought their families here, all
of that is part of the richness of the Oakwood community and land is
wealth. And, so as the erasure of the community continues it means that
the wealth that was built here is also being erased. For the community,
there was never a separation between the seven lots. We always spoke in
terms of the seven lot ties to the church’s history.
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: </b>What’s next?
</p>
<p>
NN: I’m in the process of writing a plan for the future use of the
church. I know the property is still owned by a private party, but I’m
writing it anyway. It’s based on ideas that the community has talked
about. I will present it to the community and we’ll see how it goes.

<p>
The Conservancy’s longtime friend and former staff Volunteer Coordinator
Connie Humberger died on May 25 at the age of 91. The only child of
Maria Rivas and Andres del Tiempo, her birth name was Concha Dolores del
Tiempo. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Connie graduated from Manual
Arts High School in 1947, attended Los Angeles City College, and went to
work for Pacific Telephone. In 1951, she married William Humberger and
moved to Glendale, where she resided until her death. She was
predeceased by her husband, and is survived by her daughter, Andrea
Humberger.
</p>
<p>
Connie began working for the Glendale Unified School District (GUSD) in
the late 1960s. Fluent in Spanish, she taught English as a Second
Language at Horace Mann Elementary School, and later worked with
bilingual education programs.
</p>
<p>
Connie had a deep love for the city of Los Angeles and its built
environment, especially City Hall and the downtown theatres. So, after
leaving GUSD, she spent more than 20 years working for the L.A.
Conservancy. She managed the Downtown Walking Tour program, and was a
founding member of the Last Remaining Seats Committee.
</p>
<p>
Warm, positive, generous, and enthusiastic, Connie was known as the
heart and soul of the Conservancy. Several of her L.A. Conservancy
co-workers and friends shared memories of Connie.
</p>

<h2>
L.A. Conservancy Colleagues
</h2>
<p>
<b>Linda Dishman:</b> Connie had an amazing ability to connect with
everyone. She especially loved her volunteers. That said, she expected
everyone to perform their assigned duties. One time on a tour, I was
covering for someone as a line monitor at Connie’s site. It was great to
meet and talk with members. Connie told me afterwards that I couldn’t be
a line monitor again because too many people wanted to talk with me
which distracted me from my assigned duties.
</p>
<p>
I learned a great deal from her and I am grateful for the many years we
worked and laughed together.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bruce Scottow: </b>A long time ago (“a hundred years ago” as Connie
was often given to defining long-past events) I paid a visit to the
Conservancy’s downtown office to check out their library. I was doing
some research work on historic buildings and heard their resources were
excellent. A short time after settling in at the table, a woman came
into the room, introduced herself as Connie. Well, my research came to a
halt as over the next hour, we launched into stories about just
everything under the sun. I recall that the receptionist had to ask us
to “keep it down,” So began our 20-year friendship.
</p>
<p>
Within a short time, I became a volunteer with the Conservancy, helping
as a walking tour docent, LRS volunteer, and special tours volunteer. No
matter what my role, Connie made me feel welcomed and valued, as she did
all volunteers. This was something that proved an essential lesson as I
later replaced her as Volunteer Coordinator on her retirement. I
“channeled” Connie dozens of times through my career at the Conservancy,
but try as I might, I quickly knew that nobody could ever fill her
shoes. She was unique and I miss her every day.
</p>
<p>
<b>Annie Laskey:</b> I was hired at LAC in 2000 to run the Walking Tour
program so that Connie could go to part time and focus on volunteers
(although anyone who knew Connie knew that she never ever could do
anything part time!). Stepping into a job that has been run for years by
an adored, amazing, and smart woman is daunting – who could possibly
replace Connie?! I’ll never forget how she used every ounce of her
loving, forceful nature to essentially tell all the docents, “Annie is
taking over the program for me, you had better love her or you will
answer to me!”
</p>
<p>
She had the heart of a lion and the soul of a hostess: along with
advice, there were always flowers on the table and food for the guests.
I was lucky to be friends with her for 20 years, and never stopped being
amazed by her energy and joy.

Square house tour in 1987. That summer Connie was on the planning
committee for the inaugural Last Remaining Seats series and from that
point on we became dear friends for the rest of her life. No matter
which LA landmark we discussed there would be a Connie anecdote or story
connected to it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Kevin Geary:</b> I had the privilege of working with Connie Humberger
at the LAC for two years. Anyone who knew Connie can testify to how well
organized she was…most of the time.
</p>
<p>
Once, Connie and I had to attend a community meeting to give people
details about a possible tour in their neighborhood. I was not only new
to the LAC, I was also new to LA. I had no idea where we were heading.
Connie gave me the directions but also suggested I follow her in case
she left out anything. Thank goodness I was able to follow closely
without losing her! We ended up taking what seemed like five different
freeways, and three of them were not even part of her directions! But we
made it! Connie remained one of my closest friends for 25 years. I will
miss her terribly.

<p>
<b>Rory Cunningham:</b> Connie and I met at the very first meeting of
what became the Last Remaining Seats Committee at John Miller and
Richard Mouck’s beautiful home. We subsequently served as co-chairs for
the final night of the very first LRS at the Los Angeles Theatre in
1987. Her grace, charm and great humor endeared her to everyone who had
the honor of knowing and/or working with her and it’s why she became
such a revered friend of mine for more than 3 decades.
</p>
<p>
<b>Christy McAvoy:</b> Friend, mentor, collaborator, teacher. Connie and
I shared a deep appreciation for the value of educational experiences in
preservation. The level of commitment and the extraordinary quality of
the docent core is a living embodiment of her achievements.
</p>
<p>
<b>Jan Westman:</b> I met Connie when I came to the Conservancy as a
volunteer docent, she was always available whenever I needed help. We
remained close friends after her retirement until her passing. I miss
her greatly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tom Sutherland: </b> Connie Humberger was one of the brightest stars
in the Conservancy Constellation. I worked with her many times over the
last 25 years; every time was a pleasure, especially those with the LRS
Committee. I shall miss her greatly in the days to come.
</p>
<p>
<b>Kari Fowler</b>, Historic Resources Group<b>:</b> I looked forward to
seeing Connie every year at the LA Conservancy luncheon so we could
discuss our shared affection for <i>Spongebob Squarepants</i>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mary Ann Lovato: </b>I have had the utmost pleasure to know Connie
Humberger for over 25 years. She was my instructor for the Volunteer and
Docent Program in 1995. Connie was devoted to the L.A. Conservancy’s
preservation efforts and highly valued each and every docent. She was
very knowledgeable of every building, neighborhood, boulevard, avenue,
courtyard, et. al. in Los Angeles. She loved Los Angeles and made a
sincere effort to preserve its evolving history. The L.A. Conservancy
lost a true gem. Connie Humberger will be dearly missed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Ed Trosper:</b> Whatever the event, whether it was a hot day, a cold
day, or a rainy day, when you heard Connie’s laugh, you knew you were
going to have fun. When holding court at an afterparty, it seemed there
was always a group around her. She remembered every story of triumph or
face plant, and would share them with a guffaw at the end.

<p>
<b>Trina Escartin: </b>Connie was a kind and loving spirit who genuinely
cared about people. I am one of many who adored Miss Connie and it was
an honor to know her.
</p>
<p>
<b>Marcia Hanford:</b> In decades of warmly remembering details about
every volunteer, Connie kept a watchful eye that clear expectations and
working conditions were well managed for all events. Her bilingual
skills were precious. At the time of the first Last Remaining Seats, the
Broadway theatres featured mostly Spanish-speaking films, and some movie
house staff could only communicate through Connie. She kept those wheels
in motion, and the film reels turned on time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tom Gardner:</b> I have known and loved Connie since meeting her at
the Conservancy about 35 years ago, she as the new Volunteer
Coordinator, and I as an active volunteer, and we have socialized
throughout the years. Connie’s Easter Party was always one of the
highlights of our year. We always enjoyed our outings together and our
many phone calls (always filled with laughter even near the end).
</p>
<p>
<b>Mary Alice Wollam and Bob Brennan: </b>Connie was curious, funny,
vivacious, and loved Los Angeles, but I think her greatest talent was
being a friend. Connie used that talent to offer the volunteers
encouragement, a sounding board, sometimes under the most hilarious
circumstances. I have a bucket of Connie stories from so many LAC tours
and events, but what I cherish most is the years of friendship that she
gave Bob and me.

<b><i><small>The clock is ticking on the Historic-Cultural Monument
nomination for Taix French Restaurant and Los Angeles’ local landmark
program!</small></i></b><small> </small>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On Wednesday, June 2nd, the Los Angeles City Council is poised to make a
decision on a recently amended Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM)
nomination for
<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.laconservancy.org/issues/taix-0" target="_blank">Echo
Park’s Taix French Restaurant that protects merely two exterior signs
and a bar top</a>; not the Taix building.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>But this isn’t just about Taix.</i></b><i> </i>
</p>
<p>
As currently proposed, Taix’s HCM nomination not only undermines the
L.A.’s Cultural Heritage Commission but single-handedly devalues the
city’s entire preservation program, established in 1962. By designating
fragments of Taix restaurant, the City is completely disregarding the
demolition of the historic building and allowing the developer to
circumvent environmental laws. The developers would even be able to use
a streamlined process to get the project built.
</p>
<p>
The narrowed scope resulted from a recent proposal by District 13
Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell—and unanimous support by the City of Los
Angeles’ Planning &amp; Land Use Management (PLUM) committee.
(<i><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-01/taix-restaurant-echo-park-preservation-debate" target="_blank">Please

salvage.</i></b>

<b><i><span style="color: #000000">HOW DID WE GET HERE? </span></i></b>
</p>
<p>
After Echo Park’s Taix French Restaurant was sold by the family to
developer Holland Partner Group in 2019, the Los Angeles Conservancy was
in conversation with new owners about plans for the legacy business and
its historic building.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing the uncertain future of Taix, the Friends of Taix was formed
and wrote a Historic-Cultural Monument nomination with the Conservancy’s
support.
</p>
<p>
There is no debate; Taix is a historic resource. The City identified
Taix as an eligible historic place through its SurveyLA program, as did
Holland Partner Group, through a study they commissioned. Everyone
agreed it is historic.
</p>
<p>
Early schematics developed by Holland Partner Group retained a portion
of Taix as part of their development plans. Yet, the project unveiled in
May 2020 called for the building’s demolition, replacing the historic
restaurant building and surface parking lot with a planned, majority
market-rate housing and retail development.
</p>
<p>
The L.A. Conservancy stands up for historic places and supports new
housing and greater density where it makes sense—especially when it
involves much-needed affordable housing.
</p>
<p>
What the City and the Holland Partner Group are offering, in this case,
is a false choice, claiming we either save Taix or build housing.
Through some creative design and a willingness to think outside the box,
we can do both. Otherwise, it’s a ‘lose-lose’ proposition, not only for
Taix and Echo Park but all of Los Angeles as we continue to confront
these growth challenges.

<i><b>WHY DOES SAVING TAIX MEAN SAVING L.A.’s LANDMARK PROGRAM? </b></i>
</p>
<p>
In December 2020, the Cultural Heritage Commission concluded that Taix
was a historic resource, recommended approval of its nomination, and
forwarded it to the City Council. It also rejected Holland Partner
Group’s request to designate only signage and the bar top; essentially,
Councilmember O’Farrell’s modification.
</p>
<p>
Historic nominations are sometimes modified or reduced in scope,
especially as part of the political process. We have never seen it done
to this extreme, where a designated monument no longer represents a
place but instead just architectural fragments.
</p>
<p>
The Conservancy and community partners are pressing for a win-win
alternative, which we firmly believe is possible with creativity and
collaboration.
</p>
<p>
The Holland Partner Group wants to gain approval for its project through
the City’s streamlined Sustainable Communities Project Exemption (SCPE)
process. Their problem is this cannot happen if there is an adverse
impact on a historic place through demolition. Calling the modified Taix
nomination, essentially architectural salvage, a Historic-Cultural
Monument does not give Holland or the City the ability to circumvent the
process.
</p>
<p>
The Conservancy and community partners are concerned about the dangerous
precedent this sets for future nominations. This power play opens the
door for Historic-Cultural Monument nominations to be hijacked and
manipulated for purposes other than heritage conservation, which
devalues a program that until now has helped preserve well over 1,200
historic places throughout Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
Would saving two signs and a counter from the Cinerama Dome or Grand
Central Market be the same as preserving the places where people build
lasting connections?
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Of course not. </b></i>

Named one of the top 20 iconic murals in Los Angeles by
<i><a href="https://www.laweekly.com/20-of-l-a-s-most-iconic-murals/" target="_blank">L.A.
Weekly</a></i>, “Gintong Kasaysayan, Gintong Pamana” (“A Glorious
History, A Golden Legacy”) in
<a href="https://www.lanlt.org/unidad-park-community-garden" target="_blank">Historic
Filipinotown’s Unidad Park</a> turned 25 years old last year.
Commissioned by the Social and Public Art Resource Center
(<a href="https://sparcinla.org/" target="_blank">SPARC</a>) and created
by artist Eliseo Art Silva in 1995, the mural tells a story of the
awakening of Filipino national and political consciousness, and pays
tribute to Filipinos, both locally and nationally. <br/>
</p>
<p>
In May, the L.A. Conservancy’s Neighborhood Outreach Manager M. Rosalind
Sagara interviewed artist Eliseo Art Silva about the mural, Historic
Filipinotown, and how the two contribute to our growing understanding
and appreciation of Asian American &amp; Pacific Islander (AAPI)
heritage in Los Angeles.

<p>
<b>RS: What inspired Gintong Kasaysayan, Gintong Pamana?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>ES: </b>Chapter eight of Jose Rizal’s novel Noli Me Tangere is titled
“Recuerdos,” and it depicts a scene wherein the main protagonist
encounters a kind of inverted telescope which converges Europe and
Manila in one scene. Rizal calls it “The Spectre of Comparisons”: a
charged space where nationalism, art, and the imagination emerge from.
It was the kind of space I wanted to recreate in the expansive “Great
Wall of Pilipinotown” so that ultimately, we can emerge both a Creative
Economy and Ethnic Economy within the Filipino enclave of Los Angeles.
At that time (1994-1995), the area was not yet designated as HiFi.
Filipino leaders
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-27-me-17817-story.html" target="_blank">Uncle
Roy Morales </a>and Joel Jacinto have said that the Filipino mural was
integral to the successful designation of the district as Historic
Filipinotown. 
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: How does the mural fit in to the story of Historic
Filipinotown? </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>ES</b>: There were four murals in Filipinotown painted by Filipino
Americans with a Filipino theme prior to “Gintong Kasaysayan,” and two
more painted after, but only “Gintong Kasaysayan” has been preserved.
Three of the murals were lost to demolition and the other three were
painted over without protest or resistance. The other artists that
painted Filipino murals within the neighborhood are Faustino Caigoy,
Orlando Castillo, and Papo De Asis. 
</p>
<p>
Since previous attempts to Filipinize Filipinotown were largely limited
to Bahay Kubo (“Nipa Hut”) aesthetics and the mentality it generates of
minimizing the achievements of pre-colonial Philippines as a major
player of The Filipino Story, “Gintong Kasaysayan” shifts the Filipino
perspective. From one largely shaped by the Americanization movement,
designed to rid the Philippines of Filipinos, to one that takes The
Filipino Story as the main protagonist. It elevates Filipinos as a major
player in America’s cultural landscape so our own Filipino community can
earn and deserve that equal seat at the table of power and influence.
Why have a seat at the table if all that we bring to the table is the
stories of foreigners in our country told “on their behalf”?  
</p>
<p>
What the “Gintong Kasaysayan” mural offers to the city is what the
Filipino community can offer and why they deserve that equal seat at the
table. What the mural provides is The Filipino Story. It challenges
people to answer the question: What is “Filipino” in Historic
Filipinotown? 
</p>
<p>
At times, it aims to make people uncomfortable that they do not know
enough about the story of Filipinos in this country and city, along with
making Filipinos uncomfortable that they themselves do not take their
own Filipino Story seriously enough to make it the main event in their
own lives and humanity.<br/>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>RS: Has the mural encountered challenges over its lifetime and how
have these been addressed? </b>
</p>
<p>
ES: Yes, many challenges have surfaced throughout the more than 25 years
that the mural was in public view in that area of the city. 
</p>
<p>
First of all, the Filipino community had not held an annual event in
front of the mural until I initiated the Larry Itliong Day celebration
in 2015 at Unidad
Park<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/larry-itliong-day-celebrated-honor-filipino-american-laborer-leader-n450046" target="_blank"></a>.
Because “Gintong Kasaysayan” was largely ignored by our own community
for most of its two decades in the neighborhood, there were several
instances when we almost lost the mural or the cultural integrity of the
site. 
</p>
<p>
When I moved to the East Coast in 2000 and lived there for 15 years, the
mural came to a point when the residents around the mural wanted to
cover the it with a 15-foot-tall fence to accommodate 25 community
garden beds which would have obstructed the entire length of the wall.
Had I not happened to visit the site while the meetings were being
conducted, that community garden would have completely covered the
entire length of the mural. 
</p>
<p>
My personal protest produced the current mural signage for the public to
recognize the significance of the mural and the site to the City of Los
Angeles and the Filipino community. There was also a time when the
neighborhood came close to erecting a life-size full figure monument
honoring Bishop Romero at the center of the dap-ay space. 
</p>
<p>
<i>(Author’s note: The dap-ay is circular in form and intended to create
a communal gathering space. It is a character-defining feature of Unidad
Park and is believed to be the first of its kind outside of the
Philippines.) </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: What is your favorite part of the mural? </b>
</p>
<p>
ES: The shifts in meaning. I like the parts intended to be ambiguous,
challenging and uncomfortable. 
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: How do murals link the past to the present? </b>
</p>
<p>
ES:  I believe that murals are the best way to document communities. At
its best, art and murals are not didactic, yet reveal core truths. I see
murals as a kind of palimpsest intended to build upon previous stories
and images which have ceased to be relevant, active and engaging. 
</p>
<p>
<b>RS: Do you have favorite mural in L.A.? </b>

Los Angeles is one of the most, diverse cities in the world and it’s
never too early to start teaching kids about its incredibly rich
history. The L.A. Conservancy preserves the historic places and make
L.A. County unique, and we’re dedicated to bringing local history to
life through a variety of interactive programs and online resources that
connect kids to the city around them. 
</p>
<p>
For Asian American Pacific Islander Month, we’ve created a list of
resources and tools for kids that highlight the vital contributions of
Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in Los Angeles County? These
tools connect places with people and stories, encouraging kids to
discover historic places through arts and exploration.

In addition to the rich histories of downtown L.A.’s Chinatown and
Koreatown, the AAPI community’s contributions to L.A. span the whole
breadth of the county. After all, L.A. is home to a number of the
largest AAPI communities outside of their native lands. (For example,
did you know that Little India in the South Bay is
<b><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.neh.gov/project/our-stories-south-asian-americans-los-angeles" target="_blank">home
to the largest Indian community in Southern California</a>?</b>)

<span class="first-letter">I</span> first met Cassidy in the fall of
2014. I was a freshman and she was a junior, and we were the only two
women majoring in physics in Avery House. My first impression of Cassidy
was that she was a little awkward, but nice. I remember being a little
surprised when I got her email about participating in an Avery House
Secret Santa: I hadn’t expected her to be involved in house-wide
activities. As I got to know Cassidy better, she became like the older
sister that I never had. I may not have been her closest friend, but she
always offered help when I was struggling with problem sets, needed a
ride to a play when I felt too anxious to ask anyone, or working on my
graduate school applications. To remember who Cassidy was to me, I
reflect back on the days I spent with her at Princeton in late March of
2018.

</p>
<p>
Cassidy was my host when I made an unofficial visit as a potential
graduate student in her program. When I arrived at her apartment on the
night of March 26, Cassidy told me that she was going to sleep on the
couch and that I should take her bed. I asked if she was sure—I was only
there to meet people, while she had to go to the lab early the next
morning—but she insisted. That was so typical of Cassidy as a friend,
always worrying about others first. She was even concerned that she
would wake me up while getting ready in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Cassidy was in the second year of her PhD and my visit was only a day
after she had flown back from a conference in Los Angeles. While I was
visiting her place in Princeton, she told me about her research on the
collective behavior of social bacteria called <em>Myxococcus</em> and
showed me her slides and some cool movies she had taken of the bacteria.
I was amazed by Cassidy’s research on these droplets full of thousands
of cool, little bugs.

<p class="c-content__image-caption">

</p>
<p class="c-content__image-credit">
</p>
<p>
I remember asking Cassidy what she liked to do outside of research, and
she told me she enjoyed inviting people over for dinner and making food
for them. At a Princeton memorial on December 8th, 2020, several of
Cassidy’s friends talked about her love of hosting, describing
Friendsgiving gatherings and dumpling-making events at her apartment.
</p>
<p>
Cassidy also told me what it was like to be a graduate student at
Princeton, and not all of her comments were positive. She told me how
frustrating it was when the WiFi was broken in a graduate residence
hall, and how it took a ridiculous amount of time to get it fixed. She
complained about not getting enough mentorship in the department. But
what I admire most about Cassidy is that she didn’t just complain about
things. She understood what needed to be changed, and she never stopped
taking actions to make those changes happen—often behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
She reached out to the administrators of her department to work on
making the Quantitative and Computational Biology (QCB) program better
and more inclusive. Whenever there was a new member in her lab, she was
the one who made sure they got to know everyone and made them feel
comfortable in a new environment. She shared ideas with her colleagues,
gave helpful feedback, and practiced talks with people. She was also in
charge of the QCB happy hours and mentored undergraduate women in
physics throughout her PhD. Cassidy knew that people needed a better
support network, especially in graduate school, and she helped create
one. When I told Cassidy I’d accepted a position at Harvard, she wished
me the best for my PhD career. Even though I went to a different school,
we knew we would keep seeing each other, since we were in the same
field.

<p class="c-content__image-credit">
</p>
<p>
Cassidy changed me as well. At the end of my first year in the Harvard
Molecules, Cells, and Organisms program, I had my own recruit. He had to
visit on his own, since he missed the official recruitment week. When my
program director told me about this, my first thought was that I should
organize a dinner with my recruit and invite all my classmates, just
like Cassidy had done for me. When I had visited Princeton, I had been
worried because I had missed the department’s official recruitment
events. But after Cassidy had invited more than 10 grad students to a
dinner for just a single recruit—me—I had felt welcomed, and I hadn’t
felt awkward anymore. Normally, I would have been too overwhelmed to
organize an event like a big group dinner, but Cassidy made me step out
of my comfort zone because her kindness and consideration had meant so
much to me.
</p>
<p>
The last time I met Cassidy in person was at the American Physical
Society’s (APS) March meeting in Boston in 2019. I missed her talk
because I had a class that day, but she came to mine. I regret so much
that I missed her presentation. We were supposed to meet again at last
year’s March meeting in Denver, but the conference was cancelled at the
last minute due to concerns over COVID-19. I wanted to make it to her
talk this time, ask her about a new exciting paper on
<em>Myxococcus</em> that her group had published, and hang out with all
of the Avery physics folks. I had no doubt that when she defended her
thesis next year, we would all get together and celebrate all the great
things she achieved during her PhD and what an amazing friend she was to
everyone.
</p>
<p>
It has been really difficult to cope with losing Cassidy and her sister
Angel so suddenly, and I can’t imagine how heartbreaking it has been for
the people who spent more time with her. Yet I am truly grateful that I
had Cassidy in my life. She inspired me in so many ways, and even now I
am discovering more and more incredible things that she gave us by
reconnecting with all the amazing people who knew her.

<p>
I want to close by sharing a story about a beautiful Sunday I spent with
Cassidy and two of our Avery housemates, Joseph and Yubo, during the APS
meeting in March 2019 in Boston. In the morning, we were going to have
brunch at Cafe Luna, but it was too crowded. Instead, we went to a cafe
called Juliet. During the Lyft ride to the cafe, Yubo left his phone in
the car. The driver was kind enough to drive back to return his phone.
Cassidy offered to pay for the lost item fee, although Yubo wouldn’t let
her. After brunch, we hung out at Joseph’s place, playing board games
and hanging out with Joseph’s roommate’s cat, Marbles. Cassidy brought a
cute board game called Root, Yubo and I brought some desserts from a
bake sale at Harvard, and Joseph baked a cake for us. We were already
full from all the desserts before heading to Spring Shabu Shabu, one of
the best restaurants in the city. We wanted to have an early dinner
because Cassidy had signed up for an escape room that night with her
Princeton friends. The restaurant was jam-packed as always, so we walked
through the Petco next door while we waited. I still have a video of a
guinea pig sleeping with its mouth open, which I found hilarious. We ate
so much (including the ice cream for dessert) and Cassidy left early to
have fun with her other group of friends. During that week, we had a big
snow storm after a very warm winter. Nobody could stop complaining about
the weather, but it was the most beautiful week I have ever had in
Boston. And Cassidy was there.

<i>(“Hollywood Jazz — 1945-1972” by Richard Wyatt Jr.)</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
By Carley Michelle Hildebrand<br/>
</p>
<p>
Charles Mingus, Nat “King” Cole, Frank Sinatra, and Ornette Coleman
lived here. Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, and Dave
Brubeck recorded here. Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, and Charlie
Parker jammed here. But most importantly, a crucial chapter in jazz
history played out here.  <br/>
</p>
<p>
While cities like New Orleans and New York City are where jazz music was
born and bred, Los Angeles was the beating heart of the West Coast Jazz
scene. From the late 1920s to the 1950s not only was L.A.’s jazz scene
influential to the art of jazz itself, it brought pride and power to
L.A.’s Black community.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
The epicenter of it all was the historic Central Avenue corridor, from
Little Tokyo to Watts, with some jazz joints springing up as far away as
Hollywood. Central Avenue was the economic and social center of a
segregated Black community. A cultural mecca, the scene was constant and
electric. As the only integrated section of L.A., people of all races
and classes—from blue-collar workers to Hollywood stars—mingled together
to watch, to dance, to drink, and…to listen. <br/>

The Dunbar Hotel<br/>
</h2>
<p>
<i>4225 S Central Avenue Los Angeles </i>
</p>
<p>
Any trip through L.A.’s jazz history must start at the Dunbar Hotel.
Originally built as the Hotel Somerville, the Dunbar played a key role
in L.A.’s Black community for decades. Doctor John Somerville built the
hotel for the first West Coast convention of the NAACP in 1928 and it
provided first-class accommodations for African Americans in a
segregated Los Angeles. At the heart of the Central Avenue jazz scene,
many prominent jazz musicians stayed or performed there, including Louis
Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Bessie Smith. Other notable
guests included Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Hern Jefferies, Langston
Hughes, Joe Louis, Arthur B. Spingarn, and W. E. B. Du Bois. As the
epicenter of Black L.A.’s social and cultural life, a number of jazz
clubs and theaters sprang up along Central Avenue and the district began
to flourish as a popular nightlife destination.  <br/>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/dunbar-hotel" target="_blank">After
a herculean restoration</a>, today the Dunbar Hotel provides affordable
housing for seniors and offers a beautiful gathering space for the
community. (More recently, the Dunbar also made a cameo appearance in
2019’s <i>My Name is Dolemite</i>.)

Perhaps the most famous club along
<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/issues/central-avenue" target="_blank">Central
Avenue</a> was Club Alabam, known as the “Finest Harlem Cafe in
America.” Hints of the Ambassador Hotel’s Cocoanut Grove (which was
segregated at the time) could be seen with its rich furnishings and
interior palm trees. Saxophonist Art Pepper recalled that “the bandstand
was plush and gorgeous with curtains that glistened.” Club Alabam, which
had an integrated audience like all of the clubs along the corridor,
became the center of L.A.’s jazz scene boasting some of the finest jazz
artists in the country. At its most glorious, wrote jazz historian
Steven Isoardi, it was kind of a shining star, the premier spot on the
Avenue.
</p>
<p>
Club Alabam may have been the star, but its neighbors were also just as
popular: the Downbeat at 4201 S Central Avenue was a major hot spot and,
at one point, was home to an all-star jazz band that included L.A.
native, the legendary Charles Mingus. Further along, the Elks Hall at
4016 S Central Avenue was said to have been the biggest Black-owned
building in Los Angeles. Able to fit from five to six hundred people, it
had three floors, which offered flexibility for a wide variety of acts
and events.

<h2>
The Lincoln Theatre
</h2>
<p>
2300 Central Avenue
</p>
<p>
Opened in 1927,
<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/lincoln-theatre" target="_blank">the
Lincoln Theater</a> was the largest of five theaters along the Central
Avenue corridor that provided entertainment to the Black community.
While the 1920s boasted the era of the grand movie palaces on Broadway,
African Americans were segregated if allowed at all. The Lincoln, built
between 1926 and 1927, was the first theatre built by African Americans
for African Americans and was easily the most important. A beautiful
example of Moorish Revival Architecture, the California Eagle called it,
“the finest and most beautiful theater in the country built exclusively
for race patronage.” 
</p>
<p>
The Lincoln was a key venue in jazz history, and its stage welcomed
icons like Lionel Hampton and Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis Jr. and so
many more. It’s listed in the National and California Registers.

Ivie Anderson Residence
</h2>
<p>
724 E. 52nd Place, South Los Angeles
</p>
<p>
“It Don’t Mean a Thing (if it ain’t got that swing)” was the battle cry
of the swing era, and

Anderson’s vocals </a> on the 1932 Duke Ellington recording is nothing
less than iconic. Anderson hailed from Gilroy, but called Los Angeles
home for much of her life and lived at 724 E. 52nd Place from 1930 to
1945. During this time Anderson toured heavily with Ellington’s band,
whom she sang with for a decade. 
</p>
<p>
(You can even watch her with Duke’s band in the classic Marx Brothers
film <i>A Day at the Races</i>, where she performs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di-a-jf1c6g" target="_blank"><b>“All

The Tiffany Club
</h2>
<p>
3260 West 8th Street, Los Angeles
</p>
<p>
You’d never guess as you speed past the low-rise market at West 8th
Street and Normandie Avenue that a litany of jazz greats once played
there in the 1950s. Dave Brubeck, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Helen
Forrest, Nat King Cole—the list goes on and on.
<b>(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0SeNrs5LoIaI4hSu1coxk2?si=6a63817c6fbd4806" target="_blank">Chet

listen</a>.)</b>   <br/>
</p>
<p>
In 1952, the great Louis Armstrong headlined the club with an all-star
band that included Earl “Fatha” Hines and Jack Teagarden. It was an
integrated audience, as you can see in this famous photo taken in 1954
of Ella Fitzgerald and Marilyn Monroe at the Tiffany. Monroe was a huge
fan of Fitzgerald and the two women became friends. Monroe actively
promoted Ella by attending her performances, which guaranteed press
coverage.

<h2>
Thomas Jefferson High School
</h2>
<p>
1319 E 41st Street, Los Angeles
</p>
<p>
Not all jazz greats hailed from the East Coast. Many were born right
here in Los Angeles. Most notable, Charles Mingus and Buddy Collette,
who both attended Jordan High School in Watts. (Mingus, in fact, grew up
steps from the Watts Towers and often saw Simon Rodia as he worked on
building his menagerie of glass and scraps.) But it is
<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/thomas-jefferson-high-school" target="_blank">Thomas
Jefferson High Schoo</a>l in South Los Angeles that nurtured the talent
for the largest number of future jazz artists.
</p>
<p>
Dexter Gordon and Don Cherry are perhaps its most famous graduates, but
for many the real star was teacher Samuel R. Browne: the first Black
music teacher in the Los Angeles public school system. After receiving
advanced degrees from USC in music and education, he eventually took a
job at Jefferson High School where, in 1936, he became the first Black
teacher to integrate the school. He often accompanied his students to
Central Avenue jazz clubs and, as part of their music education, took
them to rehearsals where at any given time they’d see Lionel Hampton,
Stan Kenton, or Duke Ellington at work. He’d also bring talent to the
classroom—stars like Nat “King” Cole and Jimmie Lunceford—for recitals
and master class seminars.

<h2>
The Hollywood Bowl
</h2>
<p>
2301 N Highland Ave, Los Angeles
</p>
<p>
The enduring, much beloved L.A. icon has long been a friend to jazz
musicians…even when the critics weren’t. (When Frank Sinatra made his
Bowl debut in 1943 to sellout crowd of Bobby Soxers, the Times sneered
about swing: “is it possible that there is no alternative in this
country?”) In 1954, Louis Armstrong performed “The Whippenproof Song” on
The Colgate Comedy Hour which became the first ever live telecast from
the Bowl. Two years later, the Bowl hosted the jazz event of the decade:
an all-star concert Jazz at the Hollywood Bowl. With
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3f5UQ9wDDRfWGmv8oV4t8S?si=b3d8b2a42d464565" target="_blank"><b>Louis
Armstrong</b></a> and
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/45MTMQGVBmByrxZNBn3LSX?si=01211e0fbda24ff1" target="_blank"><b>Ella
Fitzgerald </b></a>headlining, the concert was an extraordinary
who’s-who of jazz greats, among them Oscar Peterson, Roy Eldridge, Buddy
Rich, and Art Tatum.
</p>
<p>
It’s hardly surprising that the Playboy Jazz Festival has called the
Bowl home since 1979, making it one of the longest-running jazz
festivals around.

<h2>
The It Club
</h2>
<p>
4731 W. Washington Boulevard
</p>
<p>
The It Club (which was across the street from today’s Nate Holden
Performing Arts Center) was owned by John T. McClain, a man who would go
on to become an executive and huge force in the L.A. as one of the most
powerful figures in the world of Black music. McClain’s father rubbed
shoulders with ganger “Bugsy” Siegel and his mother, an accomplished
pianist, appeared with Lena Horne in Hollywood during the ’40s.
</p>
<p>
During the 1950s and ’60s, it was common to see huge jazz stars play the
It Club. Miles Davis and John Coltrane were returning guests, and jazz
legend Thelonious Monk recorded here in 1964, resulting in the album<b>

<h2>
The Parker Room and Billy Berg’s
</h2>
<p>
1358 Vine Street, Hollywood
</p>
<p>
The Parker Room, which recently closed, opened in 2017 to pay homage to
its famous history. During its heyday in the 1940s, Billy Berg’s was one
of the hottest jazz joints in L.A. and the country. Its claim to fame
was being the site of Charlie Parker’s first West Coast engagement.
(Hence the name “The Parker Room.”) In 1949, Billie Holiday threw an
extravagant New Year’s Party in the club. <br/>
</p>
<p>
But Billy Berg’s is also emblematic of a change in the L.A. jazz scene.
In postwar L.A., Black musicians were making inroads at previously
all-white clubs and theaters in places like Hollywood and downtown L.A.
Jewish impresario Billy Berg became a prominent player in running
integrated jazz joints. As KCET reports, in “less than twenty-five
years, Berg came to own at least six different clubs in the Los Angeles
area: Trouville, The Swing Club, Waldorf’s Cellar, Club Capri, The 5-4
Ballroom and the most famous, Billy Berg’s.”
</p>
<p>
Integrated Hollywood clubs also signaled a change in the tide. The scene
on Central Avenue began to fade as white audiences no longer needed to
head south to Central Avenue. Likewise, the desegregation of some jazz
clubs in L.A. opened up more opportunities for Black musicians outside
of Central Avenue.

<h2>
Nat “King” Cole Residence
</h2>
<p>
423 S. Muirfield Road, Hancock Park
</p>
<p>
Nat “King” Cole was among the many jazz musicians who “jumped ship” in
L.A. while on tour, choosing the city as home. Despite being one of the
most successful and popular entertainers of the 20th century, Cole and
his family still faced racism. Discriminatory housing covenants enforced
by homeowners’ associations across L.A. made his celebrity status
irrelevant. In 1948, when Cole and his family purchased this $85,000
property, they were the first Black family to move into exclusively
white Hancock Park.
</p>
<p>
The Cole’s were met with an affidavit by an angry group of white
homeowners claiming that 50-year-old covenants restricted homeownership
to non-Caucasians. After they refused to move, an ambitious plan to oust
them was launched, including threats to his family and their real estate
agent. But the law was against the homeowners’ association: that very
year, the Supreme Court Decision of Shelley v. Kraemer had deemed
restrictive covenants unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>
The Cole family would continue to endure intimidating acts of overt
racism from the neighborhood over the years, but they loved their home
and weathered the storms. Cole would live here until his untimely
passing in 1965 and in 2003, Hancock Park —an HPOZ—dedicated the post
office at 265 South Western Avenue in his honor.

<h2>
Capitol Records
</h2>
<p>
1750 Vine Street, Hollywood
</p>
<p>
And any tour of L.A. jazz history wouldn’t be complete without a stop at
the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood. The Capitol Records
label was home to such legends like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole,
which is why the label’s headquarters in Hollywood—a cherished
Historic-Cultural Monument—proudly celebrates its connections to jazz
history with its gorgeous mural “Hollywood Jazz — 1945-1972” on the
south wall of the tower. <br/>
</p>
<p>
Created by legendary L.A.-based muralist Richard Wyatt, Jr. in 1990, the
mural was commissioned at the request of the Los Angeles Jazz Society,
and in 2013, it received a loving restoration from Capitol Records. An
ode to titans of jazz music, the mural is also as beautiful as it is
personal. “Nat King Cole’s widow [Maria] asked me if I would show him
wearing his favorite tie,” Wyatt recalled in 2013. <br/><br/>

The Lighthouse Café

</p>
<p>
<i>Because we probably wouldn’t hear the end of it otherwise …</i>
</p>
<p>
The last stop on our trek through Jazz Land is Hermosa Beach’s
Lighthouse Cafe which figures prominently in Damien Chazelle’s <i>La La
Land</i> (2016). Like it or loathe it, the film <i>La La Land</i>
certainly did much to trigger interest not simply in L.A. locations, but
the L.A. jazz scene. To its credit, the jazz club at the center of the
film is an actual historic jazz club. The Lighthouse Café in Hermosa
Beach has been in business since 1949, when an experimental Sunday jam
session turned into a success. Over the decades, it welcomed greats like
Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie, but dozens of West Coast jazz artists
from Art Pepper to the Jazz Crusaders recorded here. <br/>
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the popularity of the film <i>La La Land</i>, The Light House
Café remains a popular destination and is one of a handful of historic,
legacy businesses still operating in L.A. that serve up jazz. Others
include the Catalina Club, the Baked Potato, Herb Alpert’s Vibrato, and
LACMA’s popular Friday night jazz series.

<span class="first-letter">A</span>t Caltech, there are many
opportunities to hear people talk about their science, but we seldom
learn about speakers’ career paths beyond the thirty-second
introductions listing awards and alma maters. One of the rare chances to
hear someone’s full career trajectory is at a series of events hosted by
Caltech’s Women in Chemistry group. These wonderfully low-key breakfast
events take place in the historic Gates Chemistry Library. I’ve heard
many different women share their stories over the space of an hour, yet
even these conversations never seem to fully explore their paths. The
career paths described sometimes seemed incredibly straightforward:
<em>I have loved science since I was five years old, I went to graduate
school, and finally, I got my dream job as a professor.</em> They might
mention a departure from the typical trajectory or hardships encountered
along the way, but these conversations, like the thirty
second-introductions, are still a compressed version of the facts.

</p>
<p>
Let me tell you my thirty-second introduction.
</p>
<p>
I grew up outside of Philadelphia and graduated from high school near
the top of my class with a deep love of learning and science. I attended
Franklin &amp; Marshall College, a small liberal arts college in
Pennsylvania with superb undergraduate research opportunities. After
working hard in a lab there for three years, I published two
first-author papers and received awards from the Chemistry department. I
applied to several schools for graduate school but chose Caltech for its
top-tier chemistry department. There, I joined Dianne Newman’s lab to do
exciting interdisciplinary research in the field of geobiology. While at
Caltech, I became an editor for Caltech Letters and plan to pursue a
career in science communication after I graduate.
</p>
<p>
It sounds nice, right?
</p>
<p>
It’s all true, but it certainly isn’t the full story. This thirty-second
introduction obscures my privileges, my struggles, and even my good
luck. These details can easily become invisible because, especially in
the United States and in academia, society constantly reinforces the
idea that the world functions as a meritocracy. In a meritocracy,
wealth, power, and opportunity are distributed to individuals based on
talent and effort alone. It’s the tempting idea that race, class, or
your family background don’t affect your future, that you can do well in
life if you work hard. Meritocracy perpetuates the false beliefs that
you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, that every kindergartener
could be President one day, and that SAT or GRE scores are
<a href="https://caltechletters.org/viewpoints/gre-selects" target="_blank">predictive
of academic success</a>. The data consistently show the opposite. Race
and background play demonstrable roles in
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/interactives/racial-and-ethnic-gaps-in-the-u-s-persist-on-key-demographic-indicators/" target="_blank">measures
of success</a>—especially in the context of
<a href="https://heri.ucla.edu/nih/downloads/ASHE2013-URM-Grad-Students-in-STEM.pdf" target="_blank">STEM</a>
higher education. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that even the
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/05/financial-and-health-impacts-of-covid-19-vary-widely-by-race-and-ethnicity/" target="_blank">economic
fallout of the pandemic</a> and
<a href="cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fracial-ethnic-minorities.html" target="_blank">the
virus itself</a> disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority
groups. Meritocracy would have us believe that any of these failures are
due to character flaws—laziness or lack of intelligence. In reality,
these statistics are the fallout of systemic discrimination that cannot
be overcome by determination alone. Meritocracy preserves the status quo
of white supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, and class divisions by simply
saying that they don’t exist. We’re all just blank slates with the same
world of opportunities at our feet.
</p>
<p>
The story of my life that more accurately accounts for the factors
outside my control goes something like this.
</p>
<p>
I grew up outside Philadelphia in a family of six. We were comfortably
middle-class and never worried about necessities. Both of my parents
graduated from college, so it was always assumed that we would have the
opportunity to do the same. My mom didn’t have to work and chose to
homeschool my siblings and me for a few years instead. She gave me a lot
of specialized attention as I was learning to read and write, but also
the freedom to explore whatever was interesting to me. These experiences
fostered my love of learning, reading, and writing. My high school was
well-funded and offered many AP classes. Taking these AP classes boosted
my GPA and prepared me to take the same courses again in college. When I
was accepted to different colleges and received the financial aid
packages, I chose a school that was slightly more expensive because it
was a good investment. I didn’t have to worry about going into debt. I
had my family to fall back on, and I didn’t need to financially support
them. Beyond that, I simply assumed that I would be able to get a good
job and pay off my student loans without any problems. My background,
growing up middle-class with two parents who graduated from college,
normalized these assumptions.
</p>
<p>
As a white woman growing up in a majority white town, I never felt that
I didn’t belong. I chose to attend Franklin &amp; Marshall College and
later Caltech without a single thought to my race. The note on Caltech’s
application encouraging students from underrepresented groups to apply
didn’t give me pause. I could choose these schools because I knew I
would feel comfortable there. Their reputations as “elite” schools were
positive features; I didn’t have to consider that the descriptor is
often
<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-s-higher-education-system-perpetuates-white-privilege-report-says/" target="_blank">correlated
with</a>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/opinion/affirmative-action-new-york-harvard.html" target="_blank">whiteness</a>.
Even choosing to continue in academia and attend graduate school was a
comfortable decision. My whiteness allowed me to move through these
white academic spaces easily,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01741-7">never
doubting that I belonged there</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond my privileges, I also had some good old-fashioned luck along the
way. When I started doing research, I was given a project that turned
out to be relatively straightforward. When other students spent weeks
trying to get their proteins to crystallize, my protein happened to
crystallize on my very first attempt. I published this project with my
advisors, and I spent the next year expanding on this work to publish a
second paper. I worked hard, but I was also very lucky to be given that
specific project in that particular lab.

</p>
<p>
This second version of my story is longer. And it accounts for only some
of the luck, circumstance, and privileges that got me to Caltech. It is
difficult to reconsider my accomplishments in the broader context of my
privilege—I can no longer take full credit for my success. However, this
version doesn’t negate my hard work or talents or drive. This version
simply recognizes that there was more at play in the opportunities that
presented themselves and my decision-making along the way.
</p>
<p>
In the same way that meritocracy gives meaning to our success, it also
gives meaning to our failure. When I got to graduate school, meritocracy
flipped on its head. What had previously buoyed my belief in my
belonging and success now became a source of deep insecurity and shame.
My struggles became evidence that I didn’t belong at Caltech or even in
graduate school, a reflection of my inadequacy. Within the framework of
meritocracy, everything I did reflected my innate worth: my faults, my
merits. When the problem is you, how do you escape it? Meritocracy puts
all the weight on the individual: both success and failure. If you
succeed, it’s because you are talented, but if you fail, it is because
you are broken.
</p>
<p>
These harsh dichotomies are not a fair or truthful way to view ourselves
or the world. Outside of meritocracy, there are more realistic ways to
understand failure. I failed because science is a place where things
should fail most of the time. I failed because I was learning. I failed
because I beat myself up for failing, making it harder and harder to try
again. I failed because I was struggling with anxiety, a condition that
surfaced during grad school and takes a lot of effort to manage. I
failed because maybe graduate school wasn’t exactly right for me. Not
because I am not smart or talented, but because it wasn’t a good fit. I
missed the concrete goals and the opportunities to try new things that I
had during my liberal arts college experience, and I learned how much I
enjoyed writing and having an impact in my community. No hard feelings.
It’s not me, it’s just, well, graduate school.
</p>
<p>
I say “failed,” but my time in graduate school hasn’t been a failure.
“Failed” may be the first word that comes to my mind because meritocracy
is hardwired into my very neurons, but it (again) isn’t the truth. I may
not have a thesis full of experimental data, but my contributions are
still valuable. I’ve learned so much about myself and even discovered
what I want to try next. The truth is graduate school was a really hard
time for me, and that doesn’t define me as a person.

<p>
I try to hold these truths together as a way to bring form to this
invisible force in the world. I can be hardworking, benefit from white
supremacy, and find it difficult to start working some mornings. This
isn’t always an easy task. But, maybe it is getting easier. According to
a
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/03/02/most-americans-point-to-circumstances-not-work-ethic-as-reasons-people-are-rich-or-poor/" target="_blank">Pew
Center Research report</a> in 2020, 65% of adults in the United States
say that some people are rich because they have had more advantages in
life, rather than due to hard work. This erosion of the myth of
meritocracy gives me hope.
</p>
<p>
Now, when I listen to the thirty-second introductions before seminars, I
try to remember that I’m listening to a story. Stories help us better
understand ourselves and our world. Stories simplify and make sense of
information. But they undoubtedly lose some complexity in the telling.
They are only an approximation of reality. We don’t always have time to
get into all the details. Our stories about ourselves or others rely on
shorthand and tropes in the same way that a movie or book does. And just
as we should critique and analyze the media we consume, I think it is
time to critique the stories we tell about ourselves.
</p>
<p>
By taking into account our privileges and our roadblocks, we can take
control of our personal narratives. This empowering act decouples our
worth and our “success” or “failure” by reevaluating our efforts within
the bigger, more complex landscape that surrounds us. As we take control
of our personal narrative, we can fight off our imposter syndrome and
extend empathy to those around us. We can change how we read other
people’s stories. When
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/31/us-college-faculty-student-diversity/" target="_blank">hiring
a new faculty member</a>, admitting the next class of graduate students,
or giving out awards, we can use this knowledge of our inequitable world
to give someone a bit of good luck. In recognizing the myth of
meritocracy, perhaps we can change the landscape to create the more just
world we desire.

<p>
Fans of the classic Judy Garland musical <i>The Harvey Girls </i>need
look no further than Union Station in downtown Los Angeles to walk in
the shoes of the famed chain of railroad rest stop eateries: the Fred
Harvey restaurants. The Harvey Company, along with the Santa Fe Railway,
boosted the Southwest as tourist destination during the late 19th
century, and the famous “Harvey Girls”—waitresses “of good character”
and adventurous spirit—helped popularize Southwest travel. 
</p>
<p>
The Union Station location was designed by the pioneering Mary Colter,
who was an architect for the Harvey Company from 1904 to 1949. She was
one of the earliest architects—male or female—to give American buildings
a sense of place and one of a very few number of women architects
working during the early 20th century. 
</p>
<p>
Best known for her buildings at the Grand Canyon, she’s been called “the
best-known unknown architect in the national parks.” And her signature
Southwest spirit is on full display at her Union Station location.
Opened in 1939, the restaurant features both Spanish Colonial Revival
and Art Deco designs— reflecting the spirit of Union Station
itself—while still incorporating Southwestern elements, including the
floor, which was designed to resemble a Navajo rug. Its distinct tiled
walls display a parrot motif; Valencia Spanish Tile Company manufactured
these tiles especially for this building.

The former Fred Harvey Restaurant space reopened on October 2018 as

<p>
Few women, let alone Chinese American women, were practicing architects
in postwar America. But Helen Liu Fong not only excelled at her art–her
works remain among some of the most loved among Angelenos even to this
day. Fong was born in Los Angeles’ Old Chinatown in 1927. She received a
degree in city planning from UC Berkeley in 1949. 
</p>
<p>
Upon graduation, she moved back to Los Angeles and got her first job
working as a secretary for architect Eugene Choy, where she learned the
administrative side of architecture. Two years later, she began working
for Armet and Davis, located in the same office building as Choy’s firm,
where she remained until the late 1970s. Best known for her Googie-style
design work, Fong seamlessly integrated interior and exterior elements.
(The rich reds you’ll find in many of Fong’s designs, for example, were
strategic: the color could register from the roadside.) 
</p>
<p>
Fong also commissioned a variety of talented artists to custom create
artwork, murals, and clocks, among other things. Perhaps her most
popular work—and certainly the best preserved—is the iconic Pann’s
Coffee Shop on La Tijera Boulevard in Westchester. (But you’re
guaranteed to find some of her other designs, namely Norms on La Cienega
Boulevard and Johnnie’s Coffee Shop, pop up regularly on your Instagram

<p>
Greta Magnusson Grossman was one of the few female professionals to play
an integral role in the Los Angeles Modern movement. 
</p>
<p>
From the 1940s to the 1960s, she was the only female architect to own an
independent practice in Los Angeles. Grossman had been an award-winning
designer in her native Sweden, but fled to America to escape the Nazi
regime. She and her husband settled in Los Angeles in the late ’40s
where she wasted no time in setting up her own studio, launching a
cutting-edge brand of Swedish Modernism. 
</p>
<p>
She was a hit among a progressive set of Angelenos, with clients
including powerful women in the film industry like Greta Garbo and
Ingrid Bergman—fellow Swedes, both—and was lauded by contemporaries and
critics. She designed 14 residences in Los Angeles, all based on the
Case Study House design principles, including the Nelson Houses in the
Hollywood Hills. With their simple Mid-Century Modern lines and their
breathtaking views, the Nelson Houses are an excellent example of
Grossman’s residential designs, and proof that she undoubtedly helped
define California Modernism. 
</p>
<p>
Although her work has gained the recognition it deserves over the years,
her architectural legacy lies in jeopardy with only a scant handful of
her work remaining.

<p>
Bridget “Biddy” Mason is an American hero. Born a slave, Mason endured
decades of hardship before winning her freedom and becoming one of Los
Angeles’ wealthiest citizens, and most celebrated philanthropists. In
1847, at almost thirty years old, Mason walked more than 2,000 miles
behind her owner’s wagon, from Mississippi to Utah and then California …
her small children at her side. 
</p>
<p>
When she arrived here in 1851, California had been a state for less than
a year. It had been admitted into the Union as a free state. Even so,
many slaves, including Mason, were not free. Black settlers had a
tight-knit community in Los Angeles, ensuring newcomers, like Mason,
knew their rights under California law. 
</p>
<p>
With their support, Mason sued for and won her freedom in a landmark
court case in 1856. Mason became a midwife and parlayed her earnings
into real estate, establishing a homestead on what is present-day
Broadway and Spring Street in 1866. She continued to invest in land and
accumulated a relatively large fortune, carving for herself a prominent
place in the community. “Aunt Biddy,” as she was lovingly known, founded
the First AME Church in her home, opened schools, and was a constant
source of support to the growing settlement of Black Angelenos. 
</p>
<p>
The Los Angeles of Mason’s day is all but gone, but you can follow her
legacy and remarkable achievements at Biddy Mason Memorial Park. Behind
the Bradbury Building, where her original homestead was built, the
artwork “Biddy Mason’s Place: A Passage of Time” commemorates her
incredible journey.

<p>
Julia Morgan was one of California’s most influential architects. Truly
ahead of her time, she was California’s first licensed woman architect
and one of the most influential–and prolific– architects in the state:
By the time of her death in 1957, she had designed an estimated 700
buildings, mostly in California. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most famous for her work for magnate William Randolph
Hearst–namely, Hearts’s Castle in San Simeon–Los Angeles is home to some
of her most significant structures: The Herald Examiner Building (1914)
and the Marion Davies Estate in Santa Monica (1929), both for W.R.
Hearst. The Examiner building was the first large-scale project she
would design for Hearst, designed in the Mission Revival style of
architecture popular throughout Southern California in the early
twentieth century. The red tile roof and blue and yellow tiled domes
make the building a visible landmark on Broadway in downtown Los
Angeles. 
</p>
<p>
Out in Santa Monica, the Annenberg Community Beach House occupies part
of what was Morgan’s spectacular estate for actress Marion Davies.
Commissioned by Davies’ life partner W.R. Hearst, Morgan designed an
estate befitting the major movie star: it was a mansion of 100- plus
rooms, featuring an ornate marble swimming pool. As was the case with
Hearst Castle to the north, the Marion Davies Beach was a popular and
exclusive destination for Old Hollywood’s biggest stars. 
</p>
<p>
The main mansion was demolished in 1956, but the Beach House thrives
today as a year-round public beach facility.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dubbed “the Rosa Parks of architecture,” Sklarek’s courage, talent, and
ambition led to a trailblazing career that forged a place for herself in
an industry dominated by men. When she received her B.Arch from Columbia
in 1950, Sklarek was just one of two women and the only Black person in
the graduating class. 
</p>
<p>
With both her gender and race against her, Sklarek’s self-described
“stick-to-it” attitude resulted in her becoming the first Black woman to
join the American Institute of Architects, in 1959. In 1960, Sklarek
moved to Los Angeles and joined the firm Gruen and Associates. 
</p>
<p>
Later, after becoming California’s first Black woman to be a licensed
architect in 1962, she became the firm’s director of architecture—the
first woman in the company to hold that position. The California Mart
(1963) was one of her earliest projects and she also worked on such
iconic projects as the Pacific Design Center’s “blue whale” (1975). 
</p>
<p>
In 1985, Sklarek scored another “first” as co-founder of what was then
one of the largest woman-owned firms in the country: Siegel, Sklarek and
Diamond. She became a mentor to many aspiring young women architects and
architects of color: 
</p>
<p>
“In architecture,“ said Sklarek,”I had absolutely no role model. I’m
happy today to be a role model for others that follow.”

<p>
When the great Paul Revere Williams joined the Southern California
chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1923, he became
the AIA’s first Black member. This kicked the door open for Black
architects across America, and especially right here in Williams’
hometown of Los Angeles. <b><br/></b>
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Williams’ high-profile success, a small but mighty group of
Black architects overcame intense racism with talent and determination,
working regularly throughout the mid- 20th century. 
</p>
<p>
Black architects may have been overshadowed in the history books by
their more famous white colleagues, but for every Richard Neutra and
R.M. Schindler there were Black architects designing buildings that were
just as creative and ambitious, and they left a Modern imprint that is
still visible here in L.A. … if you know where to look.

<p>
This lovely Mid-Century Modern style office building in Silver Lake was
once home to the architectural firm of Ain &amp;
Garrott.<a href="https://peoplepill.com/people/james-h-garrott" target="_blank">
<b>James H. Garrott (1897 - 1991)</b></a> was the second Black architect
to be admitted to the American Institute of Architects (AIA), thanks to
the support of his mentor, Paul R. Williams, who sponsored his
application. Garrott, originally from Montgomery Alabama, graduated from
Los Angeles Polytechnic High School in 1917 and got his architect’s
license in 1928.
</p>
<p>
Garrott worked for Williams during the 1920s, during which time he made
a huge contribution to the Black community by designing the first Golden
State Mutual Life Insurance building (1928). But Garrott’s career really
began to take flight when he met
<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/architects/gregory-ain" target="_blank">visionary
architect Gregory Ain</a>: the two began a loose partnership in the
1940s, around the same time that Garrott designed his own residence for
him and his wife, Fanny, in Silver Lake. It is located next door to
another Garrott design, the Loren Miller Residence, which was designed
for the powerful Civil Rights attorney, responsible for helping end
racist housing covenant deeds both here in Los Angeles and nationwide.

<p>
Gregory Ain’s progressive politics influenced his approach to Modern
architecture, which then inspired Garrot’s own work: he has since been
described as a “pivotal Black avant-garde modernist of the 1940s.“
</p>
<p>
Together, they designed a small office building in Silver Lake in 1950
and worked on a number of private residences, including the Ben Margolis
Residence (1951). Margolis was a famous L.A. attorney, most remembered
for defending “The Hollywood Ten”: the ten writers and directors
blacklisted by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) over
alleged Communist sympathies. In 1951, one year before courageously
testifying before the HUAC, Margolis commissioned a home from Ain, with
Garrott as partner.

including twenty-five churches and several public buildings like the
striking Westchester Municipal Building (1960). Later in life, Garrott

<p>
Nestled in the affluent enclave of Beverly Crest lies this Mid-Century
Modern gem, designed by the
trailblazing<a href="https://www.monroviaweekly.com/featured/monrovian-superstar-architect-robert-kennard/" target="_blank">
<b>Robert A. Kennard (1920 - 1995</b>)</a>. It’s a post-and-beam beauty
with vaulted ceilings, paneled walls, a sunken living room, and as
recently as 2015, sold for nearly $1.5 million.
</p>
<p>
Kennard was a SoCal native, hailing from Monrovia, and attended Monrovia
High School where a teacher first introduced him to the work of Paul R.
Williams. Thanks to the GI Bill, Kennard was able to attend the USC
School of Architecture after serving in World War II, becoming part of
the second generation of Black architects in L.A. who were buoyed by the
success of Williams.
</p>
<p>
Despite being paid half the rate of his white colleagues, Kennard’s
drive resulted in the founding of his own practice in 1957. <i>(One of
his earlier works, the Zieger Residence [1958] in Laurel Canyon, was
designated in 1989 as City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument
#416.</i>) But his work on privately commissioned homes, like the
Garrett-Hansford Residence (1964) was relatively short-lived. Starting
in the mid-1960s, Kennard shifted his focus to public work. The Kennard
Design Group would work on some 700 projects in Southern California,
including the City of Carson City Hall in 1976 (in partnership with
Robert Alexander and Frank Sata) and the Van Nuys State Office Building
in 1985 (in partnership with another L.A.-based Black architect, Harold
Williams).

<p>
He also focused on becoming a mentor to young people of color who
aspired to make their mark in a predominantly white architectural
community. Remembering the countless doors closed to him because of his
race, he recruited Black students and formed the Minority Architecture
and Planning organization: a precursor of the National Organization of
Minority Architects. “It was an inspiration to know that such prominence
was not beyond the reach of people of color,” Kennard later recalled.
“Life is a two-way street, and it is rewarding to be able to give back a
little of what one was fortunate enough to receive.”
</p>
<p>
Each year, the AIA celebrates his legacy with the Robert A. Kennard
Award for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, honoring his “commitment to
mentorship and encouraging young people, especially underrepresented
ethnicities and women, to pursue careers in architecture.”

<p>
For more than 50 years, the<b>
<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/seaport-marina-hotel-demolished" target="_blank">Seaport
Marina Hotel </a></b>in Long Beach was a distinctive mainstay along the
Alamitos Bay Marina. Designed by
<b><a href="https://lbpost.com/hi-lo/addison-long-beach-lost-seaport-marina-hotel-mid-mod" target="_blank">Roy
A. Sealey (1917-2008)</a></b>, the prominent and prolific Black
architect, the hotel might be better remembered by its original name:
the Edgewater Inn Motel. Sealey’s design included such Mid-Century
features as Y-shaped supports, a diamond-patterned roofline, and
decorative concrete block screens. 
</p>
<p>
The motel was part of the "garden motel” trend, a style influenced by
the bungalow court styles so popular throughout L.A. County. With its
fashionable interiors, cocktail lounges, and ballroom, the Edgewater
quickly became a "destination” hotel. 
</p>
<p>
The City of Long Beach originally commissioned the Edgewater in hopes
that it would be the destination for the World’s Fair for 1963. While
that never happened, the lavish new lodging opened anyway in June of
1963. The papers touted it as an important addition to the Long Beach
hospitality business.

</blockquote>
<p>
By that time, Sealey had been a successful, respected architect for many
years. Born in Gatun, Panama, Sealey immigrated to the United States in
the 1920s, eventually settling in Los Angeles. While studying
architecture at USC in 1939, he went to work for Paul R. Williams.
Sealey left Williams’ practice in 1945 to open his own office where he
specialized in Mid-Century Modern and Googie style buildings.  
</p>
<p>
Success came quickly for him. By August 1950, Sealey was profiled by
Ebony magazine in an article called “Architect for the Wealthy.”  His
notable projects included the East L.A. Department of Social Services
(1967) and the expansion of the County USC Medical Center of 1968 -
76.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And while he mainly worked in Los Angeles, his one project in Long
Beach, the Seaport Marina/Edgewater, would be his most famous. Sadly, in
later decades the Seaport Marina fell into disrepair. After years of
threatened demolition, Sealey’s historic hotel was finally destroyed in
2017.

A similar fate befell another hotel Sealey was involved with: the famous
<a href="https://cockatooinn.com/" target="_blank"><b>Cockatoo Inn Hotel
and Restaurant</b></a> in Hawthorne, which the architect worked on in
1961. The Cockatoo, a big destination spot for Hollywood stars,
politicians, and gangsters like Bugsy Siegel, featured a charming Old
English style exterior and a decadent, European interior with grand
banquet halls and a popular, eccentric bar. But after falling into
disarray over the decades, it was sold to developers and demolished in
2004. (A Candlewood Suites and Holiday Inn Express now stands in its
place.)
</p>
<p>
With stories of Black architects in Los Angeles County so seldom told,
the loss of their physical work is all the more devastating.

<b><a href="https://blog.bluebeam.com/la-african-american-architects/" target="_blank">Ralph
A. Vaughn (1917 - 2000)</a></b> was an award-winning Black architect and
proponent of the postwar Garden City Movement and Modernist
architecture. Vaughn helped to bring about the Mid-Century image for
which Southern California would become known during a time that offered
few opportunities to Black architects. 
</p>
<p>
Vaughn received his bachelor of science in architecture from the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1932 and briefly worked for
the U.S. Department of Agriculture Resettlement Administration as a
draftsman. In 1935, Howard University hired Vaughn to teach
architectural drawing which led to an offer from Paul R. Williams to
join his firm in L.A. as an “efficiency expert.”
</p>
<p>
Vaughn worked with Williams on such local landmarks including the Saks
Fifth Avenue building and the grand MCA Headquarters in Beverly Hills,
not to mention celebrity homes for the likes of Tyrone Power and
Bill “Bojangles” Robinson.  
</p>
<p>
Vaughn also worked as a set designer on a number of feature films,
working with legendary MGM art director Cedric Gibbons.
<a href="http://lacitywatchdog.org/id13.html" target="_blank">It was
during his time at MGM</a> that he met architect and fellow set designer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth_Wharton" target="_blank"><b>Heth
Wharton</b></a>.  The two became friends, and in the late 1940s
they formed the agency, Wharton and Vaughn Associates.

<br/>Their partnership was brief, but together they completed North
Hollywood Manor,
<b><a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/chase-knolls" target="_blank">Chase
Knolls Apartments</a> </b>in Sherman Oaks, and their biggest and most
lasting contribution to public housing architecture: the Lincoln Place
Garden Apartments. 
</p>
<p>
With sprawling grounds and fifty-two buildings,
<b><a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/lincoln-place" target="_blank">Lincoln
Place Apartments</a> </b>epitomized Vaughn’s Modernist tenets and
practical approach. The project was so successful that the Federal
Housing Administration reportedly saw it as a model for sophisticated
yet cost-effective design throughout the 1950s. (After a heated
preservation battle spanning more than a decade, Lincoln Place thrives
today with a mix of historic and new buildings.)
</p>
<p>
He was also an in-demand architect for local restaurants and bars that
required his film industry-era expertise in mood and tone. He created
the Mardi Gras Room in the Park Wilshire Hotel, Melody Cocktail Bar,
Hi-Hat Club, Oyster House Restaurant, and other famous places. In total,
Vaughn contributed forty-seven Mid-Century Modern structures to the Los
Angeles landscape throughout his decades-long career.

<p>
By any measure, architect
<b><a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/architects/paul-r-williams" target="_blank">Paul
Revere Williams (1894 - 1980)</a></b> was a master architect whose
accomplishments are astounding. A native Angeleno, his barrier-breaking
career spanned almost six decades. As the first Black member of the AIA,
he designed more than 3,000 structures and mastered a range of
architectural styles. He broke racial barriers, prevailing over racism
to attend USC’s School of Engineering. 
</p>
<p>
After working for a number of important L.A.-based architects, he began
his own practice in 1923 and would go on to design everything from
glamorous Hollywood estates to affordable homes, public housing, and a
host of civic, commercial, and institutional buildings. Regardless of
style or use, his work shared the common threads of elegant composition
and perfect proportion. 
</p>
<p>
Aptly nicknamed the “architect to the stars,” Williams’ navigated a
multitude of architectural styles to fit the whims of a wealthy,
glittery clientele. Whether it was Hollywood Regency (the Jay Paley
house), Traditional (the Marlon Brando residence) Mid-Century Modern
(the Frank Sinatra house), Georgia Revival (the Tyrone Power house), or
French Normandy (Barbara Stanwyck’s estate), Williams deftly guided his
clients through the process with the aid of a strong in-house design
team, headed by his daughter Norma.

<p>
At the time, Los Angeles still implemented racist housing covenants
which meant that many of Williams’ homes were located in neighborhoods
where he himself was not allowed to live. One such example is Seaview: a
Mid-Century Modern tract community that Williams designed in 1960. Made
to appeal to the breezy suburban lifestyle so popular in the early ‘60s,
Williams’ homes were bursts of colorful greens, pinks, and blues, and
the richly detailed interiors offered some 41 unique styles: from
space-age light fixtures to stone fireplaces. True to the times, the
Seaview HOA initially refused to allow Black residents even though the
community’s architect was one of the most sought-after in the country.

<p>
Williams’ Mid-Century residential work is among his finest and in
Trousdale Estates you’ll find some of his most eye-catching residential
designs, such as the Garris House (1959). Michael J. Garris—a prominent
L.A.-based electrical engineer—had worked with Williams on multiple
projects over the years, during which the two colleagues became good
friends. After purchasing an ambitious plot of land in much sought-after
Trousdale, Garris commissioned Williams to build what would be his
family home.
</p>
<p>
The result was a Mid-Century beauty reminiscent of some of Williams’
celebrity homes. The home remained in the Garris family for 50 years and
stayed faithful to Williams’ original design, making it a living time
capsule.

<p>
<span class="first-letter">T</span>here is a saying in Chinese that
translates to “every medicine is thirty percent poison.” I was brought
up in a family that subscribed to this philosophy. When my doctor
prescribed me a buffet of pain relievers after I got my wisdom teeth
removed in the US, my parents urged me not to take them. They believed
taking pain killers would burden my liver, and the temporary
disappearance of pain would mask any symptoms of a potential
complication. Their reasoning is rooted in the belief that medication is
not needed for every discomfort—you do not <em>need</em> to take pain
medication, unless the pain is life-threatening. Raised in this
environment, I was shocked when I arrived in the US and saw the casual
attitude people have toward pain relievers, as well as the prevalence of
pain medication misuse among Americans.
</p>
<p>
I reflected upon the different attitudes the US and China have towards
medicine as I began my most recent project characterizing opioid misuse
in the United States. Opioids are a class of drugs widely abused in the
United States and are typically prescribed to treat moderate to severe
pain. Opioids cause a sense of euphoria, a “high” that not only dulls
the pain of the body, but also has psychoactive side effects. Long-term
use of opioids creates dependencies and can lead to addiction. The
United States has more people with opioid use disorder than any other
country in the world. In 2017, 1.7 million Americans suffered from
substance use disorders related to prescription opioids and
approximately 47,000 died as a result of an opioid overdose. The issue
is more severe today than ever, as the pandemic and isolation
exacerbates feelings of loneliness and despair, causing some people to
turn to drugs as a coping mechanism.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

<p>
There are many brands of prescription opioids that are manufactured and
sold, but OxyContin is by far one of the most popular. OxyContin was
launched in 1996 by Purdue Pharma (also known as “Purdue”), one of the
major culprits behind the opioid crisis. OxyContin was a unique approach
because it provided round-the-clock pain management from a single pill.
One pill contained enough medication for several hours, but the
innovative extended release formulation slowly delivered oxycodone, the
active ingredient. Purdue spent a huge amount of money marketing
OxyContin, and the company became a financial success in the 1990s and
2000s. In 2009, OxyContin accounted for 34.3% of all oxycodone pain
relievers sold in the United States and 83.3% of all high-dosage pain
relievers.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> While the drug was intended to
optimize patient care, the large amount of oxycodone packed in a single
pill made the drug one of the most popular opioid products to abuse.
Users could crush and snort the OxyContin pills to get an instant high.

Trend in Oxycodone Sales: Sales of all prescription oxycodone increased
substantially from 2000 to 2010, with per-person sales quadrupling in
the 10 year period. The sales of oxycodone declined from 2010 to 2015 as
a result of the OxyContin reformulation and aggressive measures taken by
the states and the federal government to counter opioid addiction.

</p>
<p>
In August 2010, under pressure from policymakers, Purdue reformulated
OxyContin to make it “abuse-deterrent.” The reformulated OxyContin is
almost impossible to crush and inject, so OxyContin lost its attraction
among recreational users. However, it wasn’t clear if those recreational
users were abusing opioids less as a result of the reformulation or
turning to other opioids besides OxyContin (such as heroin) that was
still easy to abuse. The reformulation provides a unique opportunity for
social scientists like myself to study what policies are effective in
reducing opioid misuse. My colleagues and I wanted to know if the
OxyContin reformulation was successful in reducing the recreational use
of OxyContin and opioid abuse and whether it led to any unintended
consequences.
</p>
<p>
While the aim of our study was straightforward, the execution was more
complicated. A lot of people have the misconception that social science
research is qualitative in nature. In reality, gathering, processing,
and making sense of data are all very important parts of our job.
Real-world data is high-dimensional and complex, and we create
mathematical models to mirror these complex, real-world scenarios. The
process of finding the right framework to answer our research question
reminds me of what my undergraduate econometrics teacher used to say
about models. In his opinion,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong" target="_blank">all
models are wrong, but some are useful</a>. All models, by definition,
are simplifications of reality, but they allow us to focus on the most
critical aspects of the data relevant to our research question.
Simplifications that ignore the less important parts of the overall
picture are useful for identifying the main factors that affect the
world around us.
</p>
<p>
For the first few months of our study, my coauthor Daniel Guth, a fellow
graduate student from Caltech’s Humanities and Social Sciences
Department, and I sifted through over 500 million records of
prescription opioid shipments, read books and papers chronicling the
opioid epidemic, and built several mathematical models in an attempt to
understand how opioid use disorder takes hold and evolves in a
community. Much of the data we relied on for this study was only
available because of a court case in 2019 that made half a billion
records of opioid transactions from 2006 to 2014 publicly available.
Before the publication of this data in the new ARCOS (Automated Reports
and Consolidated Ordering System) database, researchers were unable to
break down the sales of opioids by brand (OxyContin vs. non-OxyContin)
or disaggregate the sales to specific locations beyond the state level.
The new publicly available ARCOS data supplied a level of detail that
enabled us to look at exactly where the OxyContin reformulation had the
most impact with respect to misuse and overdose and compare use of the
new abuse-deterrent OxyContin with other brands.
</p>
<p>
This detailed dataset showed that the sales of OxyContin went down after
the reformulation, and the sales of alternative oxycodone went up. Upon
seeing this pattern, it is tempting to conclude that the reformulation
caused users to switch to a different brand of oxycodone. However,
correlation is not causation. Just because two events happened at the
same time does not prove that the first event caused the second event.
Let me use a simple example to illustrate this point: if you look at the
number of people who drowned after falling out of a fishing boat and the
marriage rate in Kentucky from 2000 to 2010, you will realize that the
two numbers move together over time. Despite what the data shows, it is
hard to believe that an increase in marriage rate would cause an
increase in drowning or vice versa. Similarly, just because the sales of
OxyContin went down and the sales of oxycodone went up after the
reformulation does not imply that the changes are caused by the
reformulation. To make our claim stick, we need to investigate whether
these two events are correlated purely by chance or whether one event
causes the other.

An example of spurious correlation.

<p class="c-content__image-credit">
http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlation
</p>
<p>
In order to go from correlation to causation in the case of OxyContin
reformulation, my team used a common mathematical model in my field
called the difference-in-difference (DID) framework. To use the DID
framework, we categorize all US states into two bins: those with either
a high or low percentage of people misusing OxyContin before the
reformulation. If the reformulation truly impacted how people misuse
opioids, then the high-percentage misuse group would experience a bigger
change in OxyContin usage since there are more people affected by the
reformulation. However, if the reformulation had no impact on opioid
abuse, then the low-percentage misuse group should experience the same
amount of change during this period as the high-percentage misuse group.
Hence, by comparing changes in OxyContin usage in both groups we can
better assess whether the reformulation was successful in reducing
OxyContin use.
</p>
<p>
Using the difference-in-difference framework to analyze the ARCOS data
revealed that our hypothesis was correct.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>
The reformulation did indeed cause OxyContin sales to decrease.
Additionally, the same model established that the sales of alternative
prescription oxycodone went up to compensate. Specifically, in locations
where OxyContin misuse was high pre-reform, OxyContin sales dropped a
greater amount than where misuse was low, and alternative oxycodone
sales went up a higher amount. Because the OxyContin reformulation was a
national change uncorrelated with local conditions, this
difference-in-difference model provides causal evidence that
reformulation caused individuals to switch to a different brand of
oxycodone.

</div>
<p class="c-content__image-caption">
<p>Difference-in-difference Framework Example:<br /></p>
<p>Scenario 1: Let us imagine that a state in the U.S., State A is
exactly the same as State B except for its OxyContin misuse level in
2009. After the reformulation, State A experienced a higher drop in
overdose death than State B. Since everything else between A and B are
identical, the difference is likely caused by their initial OxyContin
misuse level. Hence, the OxyContin reformulation likely played a part in
reducing overdose.<br /></p>
Scenario 2: Let us imagine the same situation as above. After the
reformulation, State A experienced the same amount of drop in overdose
death as State B. Hence, whatever caused overdose death to drop is
likely to be independent of the initial OxyContin misuse level.
Therefore, the OxyContin reformulation did not play a part in reducing
overdose in this hypothetical situation.

<p>
Although we are addressing very specific questions concerning the
OxyContin reformulation, the findings from our study can be applied to
develop more effective ways to control opioid abuse. Understanding how
OxyContin users responded to the reformulation, a specific example of
reducing the supply of an abused drug, can be incredibly informative for
researchers and policy makers. These results can shed light on how
recreational users of other drugs will respond to reductions in drug
supply more generally, whether it is a raid on drug dealers or a change
of formulation, as was done for OxyContin. Our study suggests that
partial restriction on access to drugs is not effective in curbing use,
and a strategy to combat addiction needs to be holistic. It needs to not
only cut the supply of illicit drugs, but also connect addicted
individuals with the right resources to fight addiction and withdrawal
symptoms.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> Even the most well-intentioned
interventions may be unsuccessful in curbing drug use, and teams of
policy-makers, sociologists, and physicians must join forces to tackle
this issue that continues to plague our country.

I would like to think that the research I do at Caltech is both
retrospective and forward-looking. In contrast to the work many of my
friends do in other departments at Caltech, my research involves
building quantitative models to make inferences about social phenomena.
While the data I work with and the questions I try to answer concern the
past, the inferences I make concern the future. Doing this research for
the past year has made me cognizant of the fact that cultural
differences in how Chinese and Americans perceive pain medication is not
the only driver of the opioid crisis in the US. Rather, the market for
prescription painkillers in China is much smaller because it started
with stronger regulations. America’s current landscape of opioid use
stems from a combination of government policies, pharmaceutical
companies, and market forces. In each country or state, the drivers of
addiction are complex, and mathematical models can precisely identify
those drivers and therefore distill meaningful lessons from our past.
The sooner we learn those lessons, the more lives we can save.

<span class="first-letter">W</span>hen I was in elementary school, my
mom volunteered to help with Math Olympiad. I already knew that I was
good at art, so I was excited to show off my math skills for her. I
would not be able to articulate why until much later in life, but for
some reason I just thought that I <em>should</em> and <em>would</em> be
good at math. But on Math Olympiad day, I couldn’t do any of the
worksheets, and my humiliation grew until the hour was over. To this
day, being asked to calculate something on the fly ties a knot in my
stomach.

We’ve all heard the stereotype—Asians are good at math. This casual
statement is a manifestation of the Model Minority Myth, the idea that
certain non-white minorities can serve as a successful assimilation
“model” for other non-white minorities. The myth may seem benign, even
beneficial for Asians, but it stems specifically from anti-Black racism
and contrasts the cherry-picked successes of certain East Asian
Americans against stereotypes of Black, LatinX, and Native Americans as
a justification for their continued marginalization. It centers Asian
American and Pacific Islander narratives around East Asians, despite the
rich history of many other Asian groups in the U.S. since the 1800s. It
is also a direct product of the American myth of meritocracy, the idea
that power and privilege are allocated by individual merit alone, blind
to social and economic class<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. As a Caltech
scientist, and as an Asian American<sup><a href="#✝">✝</a></sup> who
used to believe in the Model Minority Myth, I believe we must subject
this stereotype to the same level of critical examination we demand in
our research.
</p>
<p>
In order to dismantle this racist myth, we need to understand that
“race” is a social construct with no scientific basis, based on
perceived differences in physical appearance among human
beings<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. In the American colonies, race was
used to justify why certain people—enslaved Africans and colonized
Indigenous Peoples of North America—were denied the rights and freedoms
that European colonizers took for granted<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
Race was written into the legal system of the colonies, and later the
United States, starting in the 17<sup>th</sup> century in order to grant
exclusive rights and freedoms only to those considered “white,” like
Virginia slave owners and other European
colonizers.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> In the United States, race was
explicitly set up as a hierarchical system with white landowners at the
top and enslaved Black people at the bottom. The social, political, and
economic forces that protect and reinforce this hierarchy are “white
supremacy.”

It is against this backdrop that Asian Americans were racialized. Asia
has been consistently viewed as the West’s “other” throughout history,
simultaneously fascinating and terrifying. <strong>Until after World War
II, Asians living in the United States were primarily seen as “Forever
Foreigners”—a homogeneous group primarily loyal to a monolithic “Asia”
instead of the United
States</strong><sup><a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a></sup>.
Starting in the 1800s, thousands of Asian immigrants—primarily Chinese,
Japanese, and Filipino — came to the United States to work in
agriculture, construction, and other low-wage
jobs<sup><a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Despite the
diversity of this group and their hard work, they were dismissed as
backward, submissive, and inferior<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. Their
perceived lack of loyalty to the United States and their “otherness”
were used as evidence to restrict Asian immigration and reject Asian
immigrants. Regulations were put into place that barred them from
becoming naturalized citizens, prohibited them from owning or leasing
land, and crowded them into ethnic enclaves like Chinatowns that were
considered “depraved colonies of prostitutes, gamblers and opium
addicts.”<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>

immigrants or immigration. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the
first immigration law to prevent an entire ethnic group from immigrating
to the United States and becoming eligible for citizenship. Later, the
Immigration Act of 1917 established an Asian Barred Zone of countries
from which no immigrants were admitted, and the Immigration Act of 1924
supplanted that law to effectively ban all immigration from Asia.

Asian immigrants’ failure to thrive because of restrictive and racist
laws began a feedback cycle that perpetuated their perceived inferiority
and exclusion between the 1870s and World War II. This included passing
increasingly prohibitive immigration policies to keep the Asian
population low (&lt;1%). The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first
immigration law to prevent an entire ethnic group from immigrating to
the United States and becoming eligible for citizenship.6 Citizenship
was even taken away from certain subgroups, when the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in 1923 that Indians were not white and therefore ineligible for
citizenship<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. Later, most Asian immigration
was barred with the passage of the 1917 Immigration Act. The stereotype
of the “Forever Foreigner” continued through WWII with Japanese
internment, a federal policy where people of Japanese descent were
uprooted from their homes, forced into internment camps, and required to
complete “loyalty” questionnaires<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>.
California even ruled that only “1/16th” of Japanese heritage was enough
to qualify<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>. Though the United States was
also at war with Germany, sweeping demands for the internment of German
Americans never materialized.

<p>
After WWII, a split between “good” and “bad” Asian Americans emerged.
<strong>A select subset of Asian Americans—mainly U.S.-born and
-educated Chinese and Japanese Americans—were held up as Model
Minorities.</strong> Economically and academically successful, these
Model Minorities allegedly achieved success due to their adherence to
“traditional American values”—respect for authority, nuclear families,
and adherence to strict gender
roles<sup><a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#11">11</a></sup>. As historian
Ellen Wu has shown, the Model Minority Myth was so successful in the
1950s because it was used as anti-communist propaganda, arguing Chinese
American success was due to American freedom and democracy that was not
available to them in communist China<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
The Model Minority Myth then evolved in the 1960s in response to the
ongoing Civil Rights movement. William Petersen, then a professor of
sociology at UC Berkeley, argued in an influential 1966 New York Times
Magazine article titled “Success Story: Japanese American Style,” that
Japanese Americans were the hard-working antithesis to what he termed
“problem minorities, specifically the ‘American
Negro.’”<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> Those same “traditional American
values,” he argued, had allowed them to overcome discrimination after
World War II and achieve some success in the U.S. This idea immediately
caught on in popular culture and academic literature to apply to all
Asian Americans, resulting in an infamous 1987 TIME Magazine cover that
proclaimed, “Those Asian-American Whiz
Kids.”<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> When explicitly compared to Black
Americans, Asian Americans were said to have achieved success “the
old-fashioned way” through quiet hard work and perseverance—validating
the myth of American meritocracy—instead of protesting in the streets as
Black civil rights leaders were<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>. This myth
held despite the history of activism within the Asian American
community, from the 1800s to the present. After all, it was only after
the concerted activism of East, South, and Southeast Asian American
groups that all people of Asian descent fully secured the right to vote
and become U.S. citizens in
1952<sup><a href="#14">14</a>,<a href="#15">15</a></sup>. Even the term
“Asian American” was only coined in the 1960s by a collective of college
students and activists in order to unite disparate Asian identities in
the fight for political and social
change<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup>.

<strong>Asian Americans were held up as Model Minorities to justify the
enduring divide between white and Black Americans, and to gloss over the
consequences of slavery.</strong> A 1966 article in U.S. News &amp;
World Report noted, “At a time when it is being proposed that hundreds
of billions be spent to uplift Negroes and other minorities, the
nation’s 300,000 Chinese-Americans are getting ahead on their own, with
no help from anyone else.”<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> This statement
is willingly blind to the fact that the wealth of this country comes
from the subordination of Black people, an unrepented sin that can be
traced all the way from slavery, through segregation, to mass
incarceration and police violence today. It also uses the Model Minority
Myth to prevent policies of restorative justice. Today, it is used to
scale back another legacy of the Civil Rights movement: affirmative
action in university admissions. One example is the 2014 <em>Students
for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em> lawsuit, which was filed not by an
Asian American, but by an organization founded by a politically
conservative legal strategist<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>. Asian
Americans have consistently been used as an ideological tool to suggest
that other minorities, particularly Black Americans, have only
themselves to blame for their historical and structural
marginalization<sup><a href="#19">19</a>,<a href="#20">20</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, it was the Civil Rights movement, led by Black Americans,
that shaped the Asian American population that we see today. The Civil
Rights movement led to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,
which abolished restrictive immigration policies that allowed the Asian
American population to grow. The Asian America that we see today is
largely the product of this post-1965 immigration, with 20 million Asian
Americans tracing their roots to more than 20 countries in East and
Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>.
My parents are part of this post-1965 wave; they left China in the early
1980s to pursue PhDs at Columbia University, became naturalized U.S.
citizens, and at this point have lived in the United States longer than
they have lived in China. Today, Asian Americans represent 6% of the
U.S. population and are the fastest growing racial group in
America<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. This group is majority immigrant,
with 74% of all Asian American adults born
abroad<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Although Asian Americans are
traditionally thought of as East Asian due to Japanese and Chinese
Americans being the dominant Asian subgroups prior to 1965, it is
projected that the 2020 census will show Indian Americans as the largest
subgroup<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>. Asian Americans are also

However, as in the past, modern Asian immigration is highly restrictive.
The 1965, and subsequent, Immigration Acts have all preferred
family-based and high-skilled immigration, which has led to the
phenomenon of “hyper-selectivity” in Asian immigrants where many are
better educated than the general American public and their home country
populations<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>. For example, 51% of Chinese
immigrants have at least a bachelor’s degree while only 9% of Chinese
citizens do<sup><a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#23">23</a></sup>. Given the
design of these immigration laws, it is not surprising that Asian
Americans, as a whole, have the highest annual household incomes and
highest household wealth in the U.S.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> It
seems today that U.S. immigration policies, not “traditional American
values,” are responsible for the Model Minority Myth.

</p>
<p>
And yet, that is not the full story either. <strong>The Model Minority
Myth flattens the diverse Asian American population into a
monolith.</strong> In reality, each Asian and Pacific Islander subgroup
has a unique history and faces distinct challenges. Although some have
arrived as highly skilled workers, many have also arrived as refugees,
notably Vietnamese immigrants as a result of the U.S.-backed Vietnam
War. Today, Asians are the fastest growing segment of the U.S.
undocumented population<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>. A growing number
of Asian immigrants are also arriving with minimal education and job
training, one factor that has led to Asian Americans displacing Black
Americans as the most economically divided racial or ethnic subgroup in
the U.S.<sup><a href="#5">5</a>,<a href="#25">25</a></sup> These
immigrants include my aunts, who have worked in Chinese restaurants, as
home aides, and as Amazon warehouse workers. Even academic success is
not guaranteed: two-fifths of Chinese Americans (either born or raised
in the U.S.) do not graduate from college, and in the first year of
college, Asian American and Black students have the highest enrollment
rates in remedial education
courses<sup><a href="#22">22</a>,<a href="#26">26</a></sup>. And despite
the higher median income and education of Asian Americans as a group,
they are underrepresented in leadership positions in government,
corporate America, academia, and popular
media<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Finally, the Model Minority Myth denies the historical and
ongoing racism that Asian Americans face.</strong> In truth, the
“Forever Foreigner” trope never died, but continually resurfaces in
response to American geopolitics. This includes the alarming rise of
hate crimes against South Asian Americans, notably Sikh and Muslim
Americans, since the 2001 September 11
attacks<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>, and assaults against a variety
of Asian Americans in the age of the novel
coronavirus<sup><a href="#28">28</a>,<a href="#29">29</a></sup>. Asian
Americans are also the least likely group to seek and receive treatment
for mental illnesses or report domestic
violence<sup><a href="#30">30</a>,<a href="#31">31</a></sup>. The Model
Minority Myth obscures the reality of who Asian Americans really are,
the challenges they face in their daily lives, and encourages their
silence about it<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
The Model Minority Myth is a difficult thing to talk about among Asian
Americans, perhaps because some feel that it benefits them, and because
some have whole-heartedly embraced it. I thought I was a Model Minority
for a long time, too—growing up in a wealthy suburb of the San Francisco
Bay Area surrounded by successful Asian Americans, it was easy for me to
assume that we had all gotten here by pulling ourselves up by our
bootstraps. It was much more difficult for me to question those
assumptions and educate myself about the tortured history of race and
“success” in America. Clearly, the Model Minority Myth was never meant
to be pro-Asian. Instead, it is used to justify white supremacy and
minimize the continued effects of slavery on Black Americans. The
racialization of Asian Americans is complex and nuanced, and needs to be
viewed within the broader history of race in the U.S.—in fact, the
constantly shifting perceptions of Asian Americans so clearly illustrate
how race is a social construct, a blank screen onto which individuals
with various political agendas project<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.
Buying into the Model Minority Myth only reinforces false narratives of
race and success, and thwarts the efforts of all groups to finally make
the U.S. equitable for all.

<a name="✝">✝</a>:Notes on the term “Asian American”
</h4>
<p>
There have been many terms the community has used to try and label
themselves, including (but not limited to): Asian American Pacific
Islander (AAPI), Asian Pacific American (APA), and Asian Pacific
Islander (API). These changing labels reflect the ongoing dialogues that
these communities are having as they grapple with their identity, as
well as the continually changing demographics of this community. For the
purposes of this piece, I will use the term “Asian American” because: 1)
The history of Pacific Islanders is heavily shaped by colonization,
which cannot be explained in this short piece, and 2) Pew Research
Center data on “Asian Americans” is referenced, which is defined as
people who self-identify with one or more of the following Asian groups:
Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong,
Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Malaysian, Mongolian,
Nepalese, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Thai, and Vietnamese.

<h2 id="the-big-one">The Big One</h2>
<p>date: 2021-01-19, from: Caltech Letters (a student blog)</p>
<p>
It’s 1:00 a.m. and my Uber is winding its way home along a twisting
freeway through the heart of Los Angeles. My driver seems in a talkative
mood.
</p>
<p>
“So, what do you do?” he says.
</p>
<p>
I shake my head to clear the fog after a long evening.
</p>
<p>
“I’m a seismologist,” I respond, “I study earthquakes.”
</p>
<p>
“Earthquakes?” he says. “So can you tell me when the Big One is coming?”
</p>
<p>
The Big One. He’s talking about the massive earthquake that
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/science/back-future-san-andreas-fault" target="_blank">California
is “overdue” for</a>. Whenever I tell people what I do, this is the one
burning question they have. Knowing when the Big One is coming feels
like it could give us some control over our lives—lives every Angeleno
spends on the unpredictable and uncontrollable ground that lurks beneath
our feet.
</p>
<p>
California lies on the boundary between two giant tectonic plates. These
blocks of the Earth’s crust are on the move, sliding about the same
speed as your fingernails grow. But, along the 800-mile long San Andreas
Fault where they meet, friction causes the plates to get stuck. As they
try to slide past each other, the stuck plates bend, storing up energy
like a coiled spring. When the pressure becomes too great, the fault
slips; the plates move rapidly, violently shaking the ground.
</p>
<p>
The San Andreas Fault runs from the Salton Sea in the south to well
north of San Francisco. Each part of it produces big earthquakes,
causing the ground to slip tens of feet, every one to two centuries on
average. When the last Big One hit Northern California, in 1906, it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" target="_blank">reduced
San Francisco to rubble</a>. Meanwhile, the
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/science/back-future-san-andreas-fault?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">southern
end of the fault hasn’t ruptured in roughly three hundred years</a>.

Lingappa for Caltech Letters</a>
</p>
<p>
I study earthquakes, using supercomputers to simulate an event like the
Big One. From the safety of my desk, I create ruptures that break a
digital version of the San Andreas Fault to explore how the earthquakes
start and what makes them stop. But even when I try to tame earthquakes
in my computer, they’re still unruly beasts: fascinating, terrifying,
and full of surprises. Centuries of studying the Earth has taught us
that earthquakes are as inevitable as they are unpredictable. We don’t
know when, but we do know the next Big One is coming.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry to disappoint,” I say to my driver, “but they’re random. We
can’t predict them. Although we know it’s not a question of if, but
when.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it’s the thought of the next earthquake, or perhaps the winding
of the freeway, but I start to feel nauseous. My fingers make for the
window switch to let in some slightly fresher air. Despite the late
hour, my driver wants to know more. “That sounds pretty scary! What’s
going to happen?” he says.
</p>
<p>
My driver’s question pushes my mind’s eye high above the ground, giving
me a view of the whole of Southern California. The San Andreas Fault is
a slice through the landscape, separating the San Gabriel Mountains from
the Mojave desert. Crossing this scar in the ground is a thin vein that
carries the blue lifeblood of our desert city: the Los Angeles Aqueduct,
bringing us water from the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
This aqueduct, and others that also cross the fault, are the source of
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Los-Angeles-water-supply-impacts-from-a-M7.8-San-Davis/7d74f0af647b1ee1aee7aeca0c0a3bcac756fbd9" target="_blank">over
70% of the city’s water</a>. One big slip of the San Andreas severs the
city’s lifelines.
</p>

<p class="c-content__image-caption">
This map shows the three aqueducts that supply over 70% of LA’s water,
all of which cross the San Andreas Fault. An earthquake on the San
Andreas could sever these aqueducts.

<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Los-Angeles-water-supply-impacts-from-a-M7.8-San-Davis/7d74f0af647b1ee1aee7aeca0c0a3bcac756fbd9" target="_blank">C.A.
Davis (2010)</a>
</p>
<p>
I imagine the Big One starting, miles underground. The fault breaks, and
once broken it starts to slip, one side sliding relative to the other at
several feet per second. As it moves, the San Andreas sends out seismic
waves in all directions, shaking the ground and everything on top of it.
In a matter of seconds, the fault slides 20 feet.
</p>
<p>
The consequences are immediate. LA loses access to more than 70% of its
water as seismic waves rupture gas mains and bring down power lines,
sparking thousands of fires. Roads are broken, and cell towers
overloaded. At the end of it all, the potential destruction to our city
is immense:
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1150/" target="_blank">hundreds
of billions of dollars in damage, families fleeing their ruined homes,
and two thousand lives lost</a>. The U.S. hasn’t seen an earthquake this
bad in over 100 years.

<p>
Such a bleak future seems unreal to the human mind, when we can turn on
our tap and have clean water, and I can hail a ride on my phone within
minutes.
</p>
<p>
My car hits a bump, bringing me out of my head and crashing back into my
seat. For a moment, I catch the driver’s concerned eyes in the rear-view
mirror; he’s still waiting to hear what the Big One will do.
</p>
<p>
I hesitate for a second, trying to order my thoughts. Even though I
study earthquakes, my scientific work has given me only a tiny piece of
a puzzle that’s immeasurably complex, ranging from geophysics to
infrastructure safety to disaster planning. We know where the big faults
are, and the kinds of earthquakes they’ve caused before, but we don’t
know how close to breaking they are now. We know how to make buildings
safer, but we don’t know which buildings will suffer the strongest
shaking. Here and now, all I can do is translate a tangled web of knowns
and unknowns into the clearest possible answer. But we need an answer
that’s not just a tale of destruction, leaving us powerless in the face
of disaster. Instead, we need to tell the story of the progress that
we’ve made and the steps we, as individuals and as a society, can still
take to get ready for The Big One.
</p>
<p>
“There will be an earthquake, and it will hit us hard” I say, “but it’s
what we do right now that determines just how bad that earthquake will
be.” I recite the age-old words of earthquake safety: purchase supplies;
have an emergency plan for meeting with loved ones; drop, cover, and
hold on when the shaking starts. But I also tell him just how far we’ve
come: a network of seismic sensors now watching the fault 24 hours a
day, ready to
<a href="https://www.caloes.ca.gov/cal-oes-divisions/earthquake-tsunami-volcano-programs/california-earthquake-early-warning-program" target="_blank">send
out precious seconds of warning</a> when the Big One starts. The
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/faults?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con" target="_blank">better
mapping of dangerous faults</a>, and the
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-quake-retrofit-20180104-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">strengthening
of buildings</a> and pipelines.
</p>
<p>
Science won’t let us predict every random geological event, but it can
teach us how to understand and prepare for those events. The catastrophe
that I imagined is only one possible path; as a society, we can avert
disaster. Preparation lets us tame the fear that uncertainty creates in
our minds, and tame the threat that earthquakes pose to our lives.
Generations of research mean that we’ve never been more prepared for
earthquakes.
</p>

As our ride nears its end, I realize I’ve forgotten something, perhaps
the most important thing we can do to get ready. Being prepared isn’t
just a question of medical supplies and bottled water. “We need to get
to know our neighbors.” I say. “Who lives nearby, who might need help
after the quake. We can recover if we work together.”
</p>
<p>
I thank my driver as I step out into the cool night air.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks later, I find myself in a bar in Palm Springs. As I sit
down, a woman next to me greets me and asks: “So, what do you do?”

<strong>Why saving Section 230 is crucial to protecting free speech
online</strong>
</p>
<p>
By Jess Bermudes
</p>
<p>
In recent years, people from all areas of the political sphere have
sought to curb the protections provided to online platform operators by
Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, including most
recently a congressional bill that would have hampered end-to-end
encryption and an executive order by President Trump to investigate and
draft legislation to repeal the act itself. This is a mistake that will
severely inhibit free speech online. We’ll talk about the history of
legislation in this area, common misconceptions about these Internet
laws and what we can do to protect a free and open Internet.

Marlowe goes all over L.A. looking for clues, including the Hollywood

was rumored to have based the General’s home on the Greystone Mansion.
This film is one of my favorites because it has the best dialogue I’ve

Huston, Diane Ladd, John Alonzo, Richard Sybert, and others.  Their work
can still be admired.  Plus, there are scenes shot on location

L.A. Confidential is a 1950’s Hollywood crime drama of corrupt cops and
mobster bad-guys filmed at historic locations across Los Angeles.  In
particular, the movie showcases Richard Neutra’s “Lovell Health House”
on Dundee Road in Los Feliz as the supposed home of the local pimp, who
runs a prostitution ring of women who have taken on the appearances of
famous movie stars.  Kim Basinger stars as Veronica Lake look-alike.
 Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce star as three very different
cops.  Danny DeVito writes the local tabloid news. Originally built and
named for a health-and-fitness guru, the Lovell Health House has just
been put on the market, according to Curbed Los Angeles, and the current
owner “wants to find a buyer who will appreciate the home’s
architecture—and either preserve it or restore it”.  Any takers? -Leslie

Los Amigos Historic District</a> remind us of our humanity and the
importance of providing medical care to those who are most
vulnerable. </i>
</p>
<p>
Yet, the road to health care in the United States and Greater Los
Angeles is a complex story with highs and lows throughout history.
</p>
<p>
Communities have generally adapted, and our built environment evolved,
in response to public needs—establishing new types of hospital
facilities, zoning laws to ensure to fresh air and light access and
separation of incompatible land uses, and sanitation infrastructure
providing clean water and sewer systems.
</p>
<p>
Various health scares over the years have also left their physical
imprint, whether it be the polio epidemic or tuberculosis (TB), both
contagious and infectious diseases. The 1902 Barlow Sanatorium and
Respiratory Hospital, for instance, provided patients with TB a slow
recovery treatment centered on the clean, dry air of the West. Tucked in
the Elysian Park neighborhood of Echo Park, Barlow continues today in
its original location and historic bungalows, which are listed as an
L.A. Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM).

One of the oldest places representing local public health care is the
currently endangered Rancho Los Amigos in Downey. From poor farm to a
nationally renowned medical facility, Rancho’s campus tells the stories
of the thousands of people who passed through their doors—people who
have been traditionally marginalized and forgotten, including those with
medical and mental health issues, and those who are elderly or
experiencing destitution.
</p>
<p>
Today, Rancho Los Amigos (south campus) is threatened with nearly
wholesale demolition, as the County seeks to fast track its effort to
use portions of the site for a massive expansion of operations for the
county and a Probation Headquarters. Please help us preserve this part
of L.A.’s history before it is too late.

<p>
<b> A Rarely Told Chapter </b>
</p>
<p>
 In Los Angeles County, the public health system traces its roots to
1878 with the opening of the first county hospital. Ten years later, the
County opened a Poor Farm—later renamed Rancho Los Amigos.
</p>
<p>
The poor farm system was based on the simple idea to offer people
experiencing destitution access to work, housing, and medical care.
Throughout the U.S. various state and county administrations assumed
this role and responsibility, especially prior to the establishment of
the Social Security safeguard.
</p>
<p>
While some are unfamiliar with poor farms, there are many others for
whom ‘ending up on the poor farm’ has negative connotations. One reason
is that poor farms shared the County’s responsibility for treating
patients with psychiatric diagnoses, something they were ill-equipped to
handle. Poor farms established themselves as early examples of
sustainable, self-sufficient living, with residents—then referred to
“inmates”—providing the labor to run the agricultural operations,
raising livestock and growing food. In many ways, poor farms were early
forms of the American welfare system.
</p>
<p>
With its initial 124.4 acres of rural farmland, Rancho operated as a
classic poor farm. As its medical operations and the number of people
served grew, its agricultural roots and farming operation decreased. The
farm became more of a convalescent hospital than a traditional county
poor farm. In the early 1930s, the Poor Farm officially changed its name
to Rancho Los Amigos (“ranch of the friends”).

<b> Contagious outbreaks, now and then </b>
</p>
<p>
By the late 1940s and early ’50s, the U.S. was experiencing a surge in
polio outbreaks, including L.A. County. Like COVID-19, there was no
known vaccine at the time for the infectious disease. Polio was also
referred to as the “invisible enemy” with the virus spreading through
person-to-person contact. Social distancing was employed, as were travel
and commerce restrictions in hot zones.
</p>
<p>
The difference between now and then is polio primarily affected the
young, children who could catch the virus and ultimately experience
death or paralysis and a lifetime of crutches, wheelchair, or being
placed in an iron lung (respirator allowing them to breath). During the
summer season polio flared up with swimming and wading pools feared
especially as transmitters for the virus. Concerned parents pressed on
civic leaders to drain or fill in the pools. Today you can still find
remnants of this remedy.

To address the growing epidemic Rancho adapted its focus in the
mid-1940s and operation as a polio respiratory center, expanding to a
northern campus and eventually becoming one of the leading post-polio
respiratory centers in the world. By 1955 polio was finally addressed
through a vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. Rancho would then slowly
transform itself into a respected rehabilitation center.
</p>
<p>
Throughout its history, Rancho Los Amigos ebbed and flowed in terms of
its operation, with a constant theme of overcrowding, expansion periods
with new facilities, and evolving its focus and mission. It would grow
to well over 500 acres in size and serve nearly 3,000 patients at its
peak. By the late ’40s, it was primarily operating as a hospital with
minimal agricultural operations, prompting the selling off of the
property.

<b> Planned demolition of a historic district </b>
</p>
<p>
 By the early 1990s Rancho’s south campus was whittled down to 74 acres
and effectively abandoned with most of its 100+ buildings vacant. For
well over a decade, the Conservancy has been working closely with
various County representatives in regards to Rancho and its future, with
numerous reuse and redevelopment proposals coming and going. During this
time Rancho has been listed on the California Register and determined
eligible as a national historic district.
</p>
<p>
Without adequate security and maintenance Rancho has been allowed to
deteriorate and buildings fall into accelerated disrepair. In recent
years, contributing buildings within the historic district have been
destroyed due to neglect, vandalism, and a recent spate of numerous
arson fires.
</p>
<p>
The current deteriorated conditions and neglect which have occurred
under the County’s stewardship are now cited by the County as a health
and safety concern and justification for the proposed demolition of the
historic district. Despite not planning to redevelop the entire site or
impact all the remaining historic buildings, the County is planning to
virtually demolish it all.
</p>
<figure data-orig-width="1553" data-orig-height="956" class="tmblr-full">
<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/eb48cdee321413a4649058ce17eed9e3/5f7c18cf037e3753-a0/s540x810/0e9fb7c3574cabb50415535a5c83419b41e40c03.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1553" data-orig-height="956"/>
</figure>
<p>
<p>Under a new proposal by the County, the historic district would be
lost; 105 structures and resources, including 61 historic buildings.
Even buildings not impacted by the proposed project are planned to be
removed with no meaningful alternatives, a failure by the County to
adhere to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Overall, the
project would retain just five contributors to the current historic
district: the 1926 Administration Staff building;1930 Casa Consuelo
patient; 1913 water tower; 1909-26 Power Plant building; and a Moreton
Bay fig tree.</p>
</p>
<p>
We strongly believe there is a “win-win” scenario available to the
County where both preservation and new construction is possible. The
opportunity exists to modify the County’s plans by pairing new
construction with adaptive reuse, and a potential public-private
partnership. 
</p>
<p>
Our job in preservation is to unpack and better understand our public
health care past, and show how places like Rancho help make this story
real and, if lost, so much more difficult to understand. If we do not
stand up for the places and people that represent our public health care
past and show us how we got here, we stand the risk of forgetting where
we have been and how far we have come. 
</p>
<p>
Rancho Los Amigos and all it represents to our public health care past
and present is deserving of a better fate than
demolition.<a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/issues/rancho-los-amigos" target="_blank">

We will have our usual meeting. It will be at IHOP in Pasadena. Topic: a
discussion of the LUG, thoughts on the future of LUG, and social time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Covid-19:</strong> We thought about it, and the current (March
10) CDC recommendations are to <em>not</em> cancel events unless there
is community transmission in your area. Pasadena, at this time (March
10), has one “case under investigation”, which is not “community
transmission”.
</p>
<p>
Still, please remember: - Do NOT come if you or someone you know is
vulnerable to the disease
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Do NOT come if you or someone you know is sick, or showing flu-like
symptoms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Wash your hands regularly
</p>

This month, James Mertz is giving a sneak preview of a talk he will be
giving at an upcoming conference. Come prepared to give feedback.
</p>
<p>
<strong> TOPIC </strong>
</p>
<p>
Today, developers and users of Python are being attacked on a daily
basis, most of the time, without their knowledge. We need to be more
aware of these attacks and weaknesses to make more educated design
decisions for our Python code.
</p>
<p>
In this talk we’ll go over some of the major vulnerabilities we face
when it comes to developing Python application and cybersecurity
principles. We’ll also cover different ways to protect yourself from
these attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong> BIO </strong>
</p>
<p>
James grew up staring at the stars with awe wondering what opportunities
await to be discovered. Now he works at his dream job for NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory helping to further our understanding of the
cosmos. When he isn’t working (aka building robots), James can be found
studying for his second master’s in Cyber Security, writing articles for
RealPython.com, or teaching Intro to Python at the local community
college in Pasadena. He is frequently seen at Disneyland, the beach, and
the dog park alongside his wife of 10 years, 2 kids, and trusty dog
SamWise.

And The C: Swallowing The Red Pill</h2>
<p>date: 2019-08-09, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Note: This is a lightly edited reprise of a
<a href="http://www.sgvlug.org/2016/06/09/survival-at-c-swallowing-the-red-pill/">talk
given a few years ago</a> at LUG</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or
C++ well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an
emergency patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the
bottleneck component in the application stack in a fast language, take
an attractive job with a low-level programming component, or otherwise
move from their comfortable language of choice and swallow the Red Pill
of coding closer to the machine. If you are already a programmer, you
don’t need to be taught how to program, and your google-fu is strong for
looking up detailed syntax. Instead, this will be a crash course in
leveraging skills you learned in a high-level environment and
transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new skills
you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of where
the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies. We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of
the material will apply directly to C++. Perhaps surprisingly, some of
it will even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,
higher-level language.

Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave<br />
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin’s
work mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the
handset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
His first good programming language was C. He lies and pretends that C
is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from
the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of
abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn’t find any
documentation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would
be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was
completely free. It’s probably a good thing he doesn’t gamble.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn’t do crack cocaine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
These days he happily hacks Python for Spring Labs.
</p>

<strong>Org-Mode with Spacemacs</strong>
</p>
<p>
The best editor is neither vim nor emacs, it’s Vim and Emacs! Spacemacs
is a community-driven Emacs distribution that comes built-in with many
popular packages, including Evil-Mode - a vim layer for Emacs, and
Org-Mode - a tool for note taking and/or project management that
utilizes a rich plain text markup language. This presentation will be a
live demo of some of orgmode and spacemacs’ features and capabilities.

id="hack-for-la-sed-and-regular-expressions-linux-kernel-boot-process">Hack
for LA, sed and Regular Expressions, Linux Kernel Boot Process</h2>
<p>date: 2019-06-14, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
This month is open mic night with three short talks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Claire on Hack for LA</strong> The two biggest levers for
improving people’s lives at a scale are through technology and
government. At Hack for LA, we bring together coders, designers,
entrepreneurs, students, government staff, activists, and other
civic-minded people to solve the LA region’s biggest challenges through
technology. We are a network of people making government work for the
people, by the people, in the digital age. Claire will share a brief
overview of some civic-hack projects that are currently being built at
Hack for LA, which she has been attending for 3 months.
</p>
<p>
Claire has many interests but there are two things she always gravitates
to: community service and tech! She holds a B.S. in Public Policy and
Law from the University of Southern California (Fight on!) and has
experience working as an IT Project Coordinator. She is now pursing a
career in software development and loves that as a new developer, she
can immediately combine her love for community service and computer
programming at Hack for LA. On her free time, she volunteers at various
tech meetups and conferences. She aims to be part of something bigger
than myself by building meaningful technologies that connect people and
create communities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lan on sed and regular expressions</strong> Sed is a Linux
stream editor that enables text manipulation on the command line. It
makes a great introduction to regular expressions, which are used as
search patterns to find or find-and-replace text.
</p>
<p>
Lan spends the majority of her working hours monitoring and
troubleshooting data processing systems on Linux-based computer
clusters. She has accumulated a number of tips and tricks to deal with
the command line. Her arsenal includes: GNU screen, awk, sed, shell
scripting, remote ssh command execution, bash command history, and a
variety of system utilities
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jess on Linux kernel boot process</strong> Most of us don’t pay
attention to the text that scrolls by during bootup, or maybe our
distros hide it from us. We know we can dual boot OSes with a menu, but
what else does that menu do? We’ll take a brief survey of how the Linux
kernel boots, and how GRUB helps configure an appropriate environment
for the kernel.
</p>
<p>
Jess is a software developer who regularly emcees the SGVLUG meetings
and keeps us entertained with a fun spin on Linux in the news.

<p>
<strong>PyCon 2019: A Brief Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>
James Mertz will give a brief overview of PyCon 2019 held in Cleveland,
OH. He’ll cover some of the interesting talks, some cool announcements,
show off some swag, and more.
</p>
<p>
<strong>About James</strong>
</p>

<h2 id="zeromq-connect-all-the-things">ZeroMQ Connect ALL the
Things</h2>
<p>date: 2019-04-12, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>ZeroMQ: Connect ALL The Things</strong>
</p>
<p>
Writing applications in a multi-core, multi-threaded, multiprocess,
networked world means communicating between many threads and processes
over shared memory, IPC, and the network. This often involves multiple
low-level libraries (e.g. most languages’ built-in threading, unix IPC,
Berkeley sockets) with different programming paradigms, and may require
a potential a scaling bottleneck in the form of a central server or
broker to make it all manageable. ZeroMQ claims to be a better
alternative, providing a single, higher-level message-passing toolkit
across threads, processes, and networks, and languages, and specifically
supports decentralized messaging. That should make it a slower, clunkier
compromise for any one task, but it claims to be both better and easier
to use for any one of those problems than a dedicated library.
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so we’ll examine
how it compares to standard threading and networking facilities and see
how easily we can just connect all the things like Lego bricks,
regardless of type or underlying transport. Of course it wouldn’t be any
fun without including some very informal performance smackdowns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>About Dustin Laurence</strong>
</p>
<p>
Intending to become a programmer (“developer” hadn’t been invented by
the marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more
time than he cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background
filled with continuous mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to
computer science. He eventually returned to his original love of
software. He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn’t do crack
cocaine.

<p>
Lan and Roger will be giving a preview of our SCaLE 17x talk about the
SGVHAK Rover. Any feedback will be extremely helpful. We’ll also be

<p>
<strong>The Trouble with Rovers</strong>
</p>
<p>
The JPL Open Source Rover is a relatively inexpensive and accessible
project for high school and college classes to exercise mechanical and
electronics and software engineering using parts that could be easily
sourced from hobbyist stores.
</p>
<p>
JPL beta-tested their build instructions at a few schools and with the
SGVHAK maker group. The ultimate goal was to refine the build
instructions and grow a community of experienced builders to help
provide support once the rover documentation and code were open sourced.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover">https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover</a>
</p>
<p>
We will go over the experience of the SGVHAK maker group in building the
SGVHAK rover and being inspired to build rovers of our own design. The
SGVHAK maker group built the rover over the period of 3 months while
giving JPL significant feedback and build photos. We diverged from the
original design most significantly in the wheel design, motor selection,
and software.
</p>
<p>
We were able to exhibit the SGVHAK rover at SCALE, the Caltech Science
for March, and the DTLA Mini Maker Faire. We were recently interviewed
for the Command_Line Heroes podcast. Building rovers is a never-ending
process. The SGVHAK rover itself is always under construction. We have
plans to add a robot arm, pan-tilt webcam, and maybe even lidar. Our
members have already started coming up with their own rover designs and
builds. All the code and 3D printer files are on GitHub. Come join us in
our rover-building adventures.

Open Source Licenses and Markdown</h2>
<p>date: 2019-01-11, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Bring tech books and leftover conference swag to exchange with other
members, or put towards a swag pile for our SCaLE booth, if we have one.
Anything that nobody wants could be brought to Repair Cafe this weekend.
</p>
<p>
We also have a double-feature for this month’s presentation, both given
by new member Sean Marquez.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How (and Why) to Choose an Open Source License</strong>
</p>
<p>
There is a common misconception that just because your code is public on
GitHub that it is open source, but unless there is a license in your
codebase, then it is by default copyrighted. This talk will cover an
introduction to copyright, open source, the types of open source
licenses, how to go about choosing an open source license for your
project, and why should you choose to open source your project.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Markdown</strong>
</p>
<p>
Markdown is the most commonly used lightweight markup language on the
internet. However, lately it has been adopted by the technical writing
community as a solution for writing documentation. This has made a lot
of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

Bin Feng, the co-founder and CEO of Microduino, will talk about lowering
the barrier of entry and inspiring creativity for STEAM education.
</p>
<p>
“I was monitoring a server room’s temperature, but getting tired of
going to the room every, single, time. I used Arduino to create a device
that would do the job for me. However, it involved messy wiring,
dangerous soldering, and complicated coding. And so an idea was born. I
wanted to create something that anyone could use to imagine a product
and immediately just build it. The very first set of Microduino modules
was designed to lower the barriers to creativity for everyone. We’re
giving people the freedom to give shape to their ideas.”
</p>
<p>
The company creates the world’s smallest Arduino-compatible smart

<h2 id="javascript-sucks-and-so-do-you">Javascript Sucks and So Do
You</h2>
<p>date: 2018-11-09, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Join us for a humorous conversation about JavaScript sins and how to
write better code. If you enjoy these types of talks, please see Michael
and Carlos afterwards about more meetups on good software design.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TOPIC</strong>
</p>
<p>
JavaScript, like all computer languages, has its flaws. It at times
subtly encourages programmers to commit unabsolvable crimes against the
computing world. It drags new programmers into the abyss of bad practice
with the madness of Lisp and the folly of QuickBasic. Together we shall
journey into the darkness surrounding JavaScript and shine our light
into it.
</p>
<p>
Attendees should expect to learn a bit about the downside to JavaScript
and some of the bad practices that arise. We will then improve our
JavaScript code by establishing good patterns using modern JavaScript
and an understanding of software design principles. If nothing else
attendees shall be thoroughly entertained, and all will rag on
JavaScript just a wee bit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BIO</strong>
</p>
<p>
Michael Starch in an Engineer. He has used JavaScript professionally for
many years, and has committed every sin in JavaScript’s tomb of Evil. He
has often searched for order amongst the chaotic statements of
JavaScript, and brings his methods for your consideration. He is by no
means an authority on JavaScript, but he will step up and speak with
authority anyway. You shall be entertained.

<p>
Meet us for dinner and a presentation, with dinner beginning at 7pm and
presentations starting around 7:45 to 8pm.
</p>
<p>
Chime Hart will present on using Linux while blind:
</p>
<p>
I want to explain a 25-year journey of using computers while blind. In
reality, a better way of understanding would be just navigating with
only keyboard-and-speech for an hour or more.
</p>
<p>
I will go over the challenges and the many joys along the way - from
discovering DOS, being dragged through windows, and finally 15 years as
a Linux user.
</p>
<p>
I look forward to any questions along the way

<h2 id="cloud-automation-using-terraform-and-ansible">Cloud Automation
Using Terraform and Ansible</h2>
<p>date: 2018-08-10, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong><em>This month, we are hosted by
<a href="https://www.everbridge.com/">Everbridge</a> at their training
center. Everbridge is also sponsoring food and drink. </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The software lifecycle does not end when the developer packages their
code and makes it ready for deployment. The delivery of this code is an
integral part of shipping a product. Infrastructure orchestration and
resource configuration should follow a similar lifecycle (and process)
to that of the software delivered on it. In this talk, we will discuss
how to use Terraform and Ansible for automating your infrastructure and
software delivery.
</p>
<p>
Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool for building, managing and
versioning your infrastructure. It allows you to provision and
orchestrate your resources effectively while ensuring that all your
resources configured the way you defined in your code. We will see a
practical example of deploying a complete AWS environment using
Terraform.
</p>
<p>
Ansible is an automation tool that excels at configuration management
and application deployment. We will use Ansible and AWX (the open source
version of Ansible Tower) to configure our resources, deploy
applications and perform patch management.

<h2 id="working-with-data-in-the-unix-shell">Working with Data in the
Unix Shell</h2>
<p>date: 2018-07-13, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Join us for our monthly LUG meeting, featuring some very interesting
shell data tools written by this month’s speaker, Dima Kogan.
</p>
<p>
The UNIX shell is a useful environment to get work done. There’re a
number of standard, simple tools that talk to each other via a universal
interface: the pipeline. This talk focuses on methods to manipulate and
visualize data directly in the shell, without moving to specialized
environments (numpy, matlab, etc). Specifically I will demonstrate and
describe
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>feedgnuplot</em> - a tool plot data coming in on STDIN
</li>
<li>
<em>vnlog</em> - a toolkit to read, write and manipulate columnar ASCII
data
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are independent tools that are useful standalone, but with shell
piping are EXTRA useful together and in conjunction with other standard
UNIX tools. This unification of data processing and normal shell usage
enable powerful workflows that are otherwise unavailable.
</p>
<p>
<em>SPEAKER</em>

<p>
Dima is a long-time user and contributor to various Free Software
projects. He lives in the shell inside Emacs on his Debian box, and is
constantly looking for ways to save keystrokes. He plays with robotics
tools during the day, and tries to give away as much of his work as
possible.

<h2 id="jpl-open-source-rover">JPL Open Source Rover</h2>
<p>date: 2018-05-11, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Eric Junkins, a Software Systems Engineer with the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, will talk about the JPL Open Source Rover. SGVHAK is one of
the beta build groups for this project, so we have lots to discuss and
show off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>TOPIC</strong>
</p>
<p>
The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source robotics project aimed at
STEM education at the high school level. The robot is designed to have
the same mechanical suspension and steering mechanism that the Mars
rovers employ. This project teaches many aspects that go into robotics,
with aspects in mechanical and electrical design/engineering, and
software development. At this point we have had a few beta test groups
on our build instructions, and after refienment of those are quickly
approaching the release date. Eric will be talking about the project,
its’ background, and is hoping to get feedback from some members who
have had lots of experience in the Open Source realm.

AWKwardly Dealing with Data</h2>
<p>date: 2018-01-12, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Lan will be giving a preview of her SCaLE 16x talk on AWK. Any feedback
will be extremely helpful. We’ll also be talking about SCaLE,
volunteering for SCaLE, and plans for our booth at SCaLE.
</p>
<p>
Dinner begins around 7pm and the presentation will start after most
people have received their food or 8pm, whichever comes first. Buying
dinner is optional.

<p>
<strong>Practical AWK - AWKwardly Dealing with Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
AWK is a text processing programming language developed at Bell Labs in
the 1970s. It was originally used for data extraction and reporting. It
inspired the creation of Perl and can, for the most part, be replaced by
Python. It is still incredibly useful on the Linux command-line, both
for one-liners or for short, powerful scripts.
</p>
<p>
Most people have used AWK in one way or another, but they use it without
understanding the language. AWK syntax can seem strange. But once you
understand that it is a data-driven pattern action language where the
data is automatically parsed into predefined variables, it becomes a
powerful and intuitive tool.
</p>
<p>
This talk seeks to take the mystery out of AWK by giving a quick
introduction to the language and its features. There will be examples
where it provides functionality that a dedicated utility like grep or
cut or head might not. There will also be more complex examples where a
few lines of AWK result in useful summarization of large amounts of raw
data.
</p>
<p>
AWK is a great Swiss Army knife if you spend a lot of time on the
command- line.

<h2 id="years-of-teaching-unixlinux">26 years of teaching
Unix/Linux</h2>
<p>date: 2017-12-15, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Unix Operating System has been around since the 1960s and has
provided the backbone for the modern “Internet.”
</p>
<p>
The core of the Unix and Linux experience is the command line shell.
This powerful text based interface can be leveraged to automate tasks
and solve problems that would be too tedious to tackle. The Born Again
Shell is available on all Unix and Linux platforms. A clear
understanding of the features of the shell along with a basic set of
commands can improve your productivity and change the way you implement
solutions to text based problems.
</p>
<p>
Eric will provide an overview of how his Unix/Linux classroom has
evolved over 26 years. From the blackboard handwritten lecture in a room
without computers to modern classroom with a computer on every desk.
Through it all, the common set of command line capabilities has remained
a staple in the Unix/Linux mindset. sed, grep, cut, tr, and awk are
tools that can be combined to transform the simplest of users into a
“Power User”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bio:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Eric Danielson was first exposed to FORTRAN as part of a Saturday high
school program at JPL. Before that, he hadn’t been exposed to computers
except for watching his father open up a briefcase sized modem to
transfer files using the house phone handset. The Saturday class would
walk onto the JPL campus and sit at someone’s desk to log into a VAX
terminal to edit, compile and run FORTRAN77 code.
</p>
<p>
Eric has since earned a B.S. in General Engineering from Harvey Mudd
College and a M.S. in Computer Science from USC. Eric started working at
JPL as a summer student. At that time, he was running radiative transfer
code (FORTRAN) and supporting a science team. After the brand new Sun
Microsystem workstations were installed in the Science Division computer
lab, Eric took some evening classes at Glendale College that included C
Programing and Unix Shell Programming. Soon after, a co-worker and
mentor at JPL encouraged Eric to take over his teaching workload at
Glendale College. An increase in his JPL travel schedule was making it
difficult to continue teaching. Eric started teaching BASIC Programming
and FORTRAN in 1989. He eventually took over the Unix class and has
since added the Unix/Linux System Administration class to the Glendale
College curriculum.
</p>
<p>
Eric is currently the Science Data System (SDS) System Engineer for the
Multi- angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra
Earth Observing System satellite and the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols
(MAIA) instrument currently in development.
</p>
<p>
Eric enjoys tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduinos in the creative
realm of “Makers”. His recent projects include a portable air quality
monitor and a time-lapse camera with a Raspberry Pi.

<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
In this talk <a href="http://christinecorbettmoran.com/">Dr. Corbett
Moran</a> will discuss the challenges and rewards of instructing a mixed
skill class in an apprenticeship style learning environment.
</p>
<p>
On June 26-August 4, 2017 she led a summer program,
<a href="http://summerappspace.com/">Summer App Space</a>, for LA
students and teachers to learn programming while getting paid to do fun
space-related projects. Her work on this was supported by NSF Astronomy
and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship award AST-1501208. Summer App
Space is a paid apprenticeship where high school students are paid to
attend a six week school learning to program in Python and the
fundamentals of Linux, 20 hours per week. Four weeks are lecture and lab
based, and the last two weeks are project based incorporating a
deliverable product and entrepreneurial style teams.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bio</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Corbett Moran is the lead curriculum designer, recruiter and
instructor for the Summer App Space (SAS) 2017 program. She brings to
the table extensive experience in running such programs from a teaching,

perspective.
</p>
<p>
She taught introductory and advanced courses in MIT MEET: Middle East
Education Through Technology for two summers. MEET is a gifted high
school program in which she taught Java programming and mobile app
development in a project, lecture, and guest speaker format. MEET’s
mission is creating a common professional language between Israeli and
Palestinian young leaders. Dr. Corbett Moran served as the lead
technical instructor in MIT’s Global Startup labs in the Philippines for
a summer to students from a variety of backgrounds and socio-economic
status in the Manila area in a highly similar format to that planned for
SAS. She has organized speakers and technology for TEDxZurich as well as
hackathons for Open WhisperSystems and a site of the NASA Space Apps
Challenge, on which she is basing SAS projects.

<p>
<strong>The Young Man and the C Reloaded</strong>
</p>
<p>
What if I told you that most or all nontrivial C and C++ programs you
have ever written were just illusions? Most such programs contain
undefined behavior, and undefined behavior is at the heart of most C and
C++ security problems, yet few programmers understand how far down that
rabbit hole goes. We will swallow the red pill and study the nature and
extent of undefined behavior in C and C++, techniques for writing more
secure, reliable C and C++ in spite of the reality of undefined behavior
and other mischief, and little-used compiler flags and other tools to
detect and/or eliminate bugs.

<p>date: 2017-08-11, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the many strengths of Linux is that it runs on commodity hardware
from an extensive PC ecosystem. We have the freedom to assemble
components in a way that is customized for our own specific needs. And
now we can easily continue our customization to the physical form
factor, thanks to recent advances lowering the cost of fabrication
technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting. Not just the cosmetic
art of the “case mod” audience, either: motivated tinkerers can build
functionally useful creations and share them with the world.
</p>
<p>
We will walk through several custom computer projects, starting with the
“Luggable PC” seen at recent SGVLUG meetups. Each project has its own
motivation, design constraints, and undergo several iterations to refine
the idea. The latest version of each project will be available for
hands-on examination, some accompanied by their predecessors to show
design evolution.

vs Developers, The Fight Over FOSS in Enterprise</h2>
<p>date: 2017-05-12, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Enterprises have learned that Open Source is the way to develop great
and mature software. Leveraging open source tools and packages allows
the enterprise to go to market faster and have stronger applications.
Therefore, using Open Source tools is a no brainer for developers. The
lawyers on the other hand don’t see it the same way.
</p>
<p>
The speaker had the privilege of working with the Open Source approval
and review process in a large security firm. In this talk, he will share
lessons learned from this process and some best practices that
developers should do to make the Enterprise Lawyers happy as much as the
developers are.
</p>
<p>
Each organization that uses Open Source software – even in an unedited
form – has a list of FOSS licenses that are acceptable and some that are
not. Also, has strict requirements on how to handle the software and how
to incorporate it in the distribution of the company’s products. In this
talk, we go through some of the lessons learned and pitfalls that some
Open Source packages have, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Not inserting a copyright clause in project code or homepage
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Asking the user to alter the code in order to change the license from
GPL to MIT, for example
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Using dependencies that could be outdated or have CVE’s against it
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not providing enough information to build the code from scratch
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Protecting your digital identity, passwords, and browsing activity is
difficult in the world of open Wifi networks, freeware, and advanced
advertising techniques based on tracking users across the web. While
complete privacy is not possible while connected to the internet, there
are many things you can do to make access to your personal data more
difficult. This presentation will focus on the basics of internet
security, how to begin protecting your network and your data, and why
it’s so important. We will focus on the two most prominent (and easiest
to fix) security vulnerabilities: encrypting your browsing on external
networks using OpenVPN, and blocking advertising and tracking as early
as possible using Pi-Hole.

Science</h2>
<p>date: 2017-03-10, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
We will be socializing until 7:30am and then we’ll do our usual LUG
announcements and Linux in the News and talk about last weekend’s
Southern California Linux Expo. Presentations usually start at 8pm.
</p>
<p>
<em>If we have at least 30 attendees, we will raffle off leftover booth
swag. Every attendee gets a free ticket and you will be able to buy
additional tickets at $1 apiece. Funds raised go towards SGVTech
expenses, which are primarily Meetup fees and domain name and
webhosting.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
The open science movement calls for open sharing of research findings
and greater trust, transparency, and reuseability in making claims and
reporting results. A researcher-to-researcher training community known
as Carpentry (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and others) has
emerged to prepare researchers to practice open science using more open
and collaborative practices; open source tools; and openly licensed and
distributed methods, data, code.
</p>
<p>
In this program, the Head of Research Services at the Caltech Library
will describe the Carpentry movement; illustrate how lesson development
and delivery takes place; and lead participants through a sample
interactive lesson from Data Carpentry.
</p>
<p>
There will be an interactive lesson. Please bring a fully charged
laptop.<br /> Installation instructions and lesson outline will be
posted ahead of time. OpenX has guest wifi. <strong>We will comment in
the Meetup, if there are any updates.</strong>

<p>
Dave Flynn will share his extensive experience with 3D printing from the
past 4 years, as well as his motivations for designing and building his
own 3D printer. Specifically, his experience is with the RepRap style of
3D printers.
</p>
<p>
The presentation will be short as Dave much prefers answering questions.
</p>
<p>
We welcome the 3D printing community–whether they are experts or
neophytes– to share the things they’ve printed and spark a conversation
about what we can do with 3D printing, how to get started, and how 3D
printing can be used for art, home, hobby, and work.

the Linux Command Line</h2>
<p>date: 2016-09-09, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Text is everywhere but not always in a useful form. On any given day we
encounter dozens or hundreds of data formats. Some formats are focused
on presentation while others focus on structure at the expense of
presentation. Many times the information we need has to be found,
disentangled and manipulated before it is useful. The easier we can
navigate across these boundaries, the more freedom we have to find new
uses and insights.
</p>
<p>
Linux offers a rich array of commands and tools for text processing at
the command line. This talk proposes a classification for different
types of command line processing tasks and then explores some of the
common tools available within each category. Many of these tools have a
host of options. Some useful but lesser known options will be
highlighted. The tools will then be applied to a number of examples
covering data extraction, processing and presentation.

<p>date: 2016-08-12, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract</strong>:
</p>
<p>
What do amateur radio operators, small businesses, giant corporations,
E911 systems, and Linux hobbyists all have in common?
</p>
<p>
Well, besides using Linux, they all are using an application called
Asterisk, in one of its many forms, to handle telecommunications.
</p>
<p>
Amateur radio operators can interlink plain old telephone systems with
repeaters, small businesses can appear to the world to be a large
corporation with custom interactive voice response menus, and hobbyists
can lower their home phone bill to as little as a $1.00 per month with
$0.0015/minute call charges.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention to have a phone number virtually anywhere in the world
termin ate at your home,
</p>
<p>
The presentation will introduce Asterisk, its applications, basic Python
scripting, and many other things.

<strong>Abstract</strong>:
</p>
<p>
The P2P and the World of Tomorrow presentation will address a brief
history on the development on P2P software technology, applications and
implementations by the end user. Applications such as Audio Galaxy,
Napster, Direct Connect, Gnutella, Freenet, eDonkey2000, Kazaa,
Morpheus, BitTorrent and Soulseek will be discussed in the presentation.
End user usage patterns based on net cultural behavioral norms will be
addressed as well as the development of conflict as result of practicing
such norms on a end user case-by-case basis. Media attention and changes
in policies of governance in relation to P2P technology and usage are
topics that will be touched on in the presentation. New changes in P2P
technology being made to maneuver difficulties that have arisen from
changes in governance policies are addressed later in the presentation.
The presentation’s conclusion addresses technological responsibility and
safety practices the audience can use to prevent themselves from
becoming a marginalized end user as in the cases discussed earlier in
the presentation.

<h2 id="survival-at-c-swallowing-the-red-pill">Survival at C: swallowing
the Red Pill</h2>
<p>date: 2016-06-10, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Many good, experienced high-level language programmers do not learn C or
C++ well until they suddenly need to write an FFI extension, make an
emergency patch to an existing C or C++ codebase, re-implement the
bottleneck component in the application stack in a fast language, take
an attractive job with a low-level programming component, or otherwise
move from their comfortable language of choice and swallow the Red Pill
of coding closer to the machine. If you are already a programmer, you
don’t need to be taught how to program, and your google-fu is strong for
looking up detailed syntax. Instead, this will be a crash course in
leveraging skills you learned in a high-level environment and
transferring them to these low-level tools, acquiring some new skills
you simply never needed before, and a building a mental picture of where
the road to expert, idiomatic mastery lies. We will focus on plain C
because C++ is too complex to cover well in a single talk, but much of
the material will apply directly to C++. Perhaps surprisingly, some of
it will even make you a better programmer in your favorite comfortable,
higher-level language.

Some little-known facts about Dustin Laurence:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
His first exposure to computers was playing Colossal Cave<br />
Adventure and the bootleg Fortran IV version of Zork on his cousin’s
work mainframe using a glass teletype and a modem with a cradle for the
handset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
His first good programming language was C. He lies and pretends that C
is where he learned to program because 8-bit BASIC is embarrassing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He once gave up trying to learn the libc low-level I/O functions from
the Ultrix man pages because he thought a buffer must be some kind of
abstract data type provided by the C library and he couldn’t find any
documentation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He once confidently predicted that Linux was a temporary fad that would
be replaced by BSD for serious work once the Berkeley codebase was
completely free. It’s probably a good thing he doesn’t gamble.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn’t do crack cocaine.

keep RSVPs up-to-date, particularly if we have a waitlist. RSVPs will be
capped at 70.<br /> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Topic</strong>
</p>
<p>
OnSight is a tool that allows scientists to work on Mars through the
power of virtual reality. The Mars terrain displayed in OnSight is
produced from real images sent back by the Curiosity rover, and rendered
at 1:1 scale, as if the user were actually standing on Mars. Behind this
exciting user experience is a powerful backend infrastructure that
continually produces 3D terrain reconstructions as new images are sent
back by the Curiosity rover.
</p>
<p>
The terrain build system automatically detects when new images are
available, dynamically starts and stops computing instances to handle
the workload, and presents dashboards to view the progress of terrain
builds. The system runs on Amazon’s cloud services platform, using a mix
of Linux and Windows virtual computing instances. The system leverages a
variety of open source projects including NodeJS, LoopBack, Ansible,
Jenkins, AngularJS, and BootStrap. In this talk will focus on the cloud
computing aspects of the terrain system, rather than on image
processing. I will present a detailed look at the parts of this system,
and discuss the team’s experience adapting a desktop data processing
workflow to a cloud architecture. Please join me for an applied look at
how data processing challenges can be addressed in a cloud computing
environment.

<h2 id="dnssec">DNSSEC</h2>
<p>date: 2016-01-15, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
This month, SGVLUG member Carlos Meza will preview his
<a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/dnssec">SCALE
14x talk</a> on DNSSEC. Why should you care?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“DNSSec is an absolute requirement if we want to … use the Internet for
anything non-trivial.” - Cricket Liu, Leading expert on the Domain Name
System (DNS)
</p>
<p>
“The Internet needs this technology and it needs it now” - Vint Cerf,
Father of the Internet
</p>
<p>
“It is arguably one of the most important security improvements to the
Internet ever.” -Steve Crocker, Internet Pioneer and Chair of the Board
of ICANN
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>
DNS (Domain Name System) is used by everyone who is a consumer of the
Internet. It is a core component of the Internet, yet it is completely
insecure. This puts us all at risk. DNSSEC offers a solution to address
the vulnerabilities of DNS . For this reason I hope stir up demand and
motivation to deploy DNSSEC.
</p>
<p>
We will go over the basic of DNS and its vulnerabilities. Then we will
go over how DNSSEC works and the solution it provides. As users, we will
look at why it is important for our safety to require that our service
providers (ISPs, Registrars, Hosted Services (banking, commerce, etc))
provide DNSSEC. And we will also look at some user-end tools available
to advantage of DNSSEC today. We will go over reasons why companies
would want to make the effort and investment. For sysadmins, we will go
over tools to aid with deployment and some considerations to be aware
of.
</p>
<p>
At its essence, DNS translates names, that humans understand, to IP
addresses, that computers understand. This is how we are able to find
other computers on the Internet (webpages, email servers, etc). But DNS
does not provide a way to validate the answer we receive. This exposes
all of us to a large vulnerability. Exploits such as DNS hijacking and
DNS cache poisoning miss direct us and can lead us to potentially
malicious computers. DNSSEC provides a solution to this by allowing
authentication of DNS data through a chain-of- trust. Being able to
trust DNS goes a long way to creating a safer Internet.
</p>
<p>
When we can trust DNS other things become possible. We can now leverage
DNS to store other information such as cryptographic keys. This means we
can store and trust self signed SSL certificates in DNS because it is
now a trusted source. This eliminates the need for certificate
authorities and the issues with them.
</p>
<p>
DNSSEC is a great improvement on a fundamental component of the Internet
we all us.
</p>
<p>

Carlos has worked many years as a system administrator. His interest
include InfoSec, site reliability and automation, and open source
development. While volunteering as an Interop Team Member, he was

<h2 id="action-movie-crypto">Action-Movie Crypto</h2>
<p>date: 2015-09-11, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
This month, long-time SGVLUG member Dustin Laurence reprises his
<a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x/presentations/action-movie-
crypto">SCALE 13x talk</a>. We’ll also be talking about the SGVLUG BBQ
for September, the 20th anniversary party plans for November, and SCALE
14x.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The details of how cryptographic algorithms are designed, implemented,
verified, and assembled into cryptosystems requires expert knowledge.
Fortunately, the big picture of how the resulting cryptosystems are used
does not. For most users and even most programmers, the underlying
algorithms are black boxes that they do not and need not understand,
while the language and conceptual framework of modern cryptography are
very useful in putting those algorithms to practical use.
</p>
<p>
We will sketch out that conceptual framework at action-movie speed using
the simplest of classical cryptographic algorithms to represent the
modern black boxes for concreteness while studing everything but the
algorithms themselves. After the presentation you should understand:
elementary cryptographic language, security as a probabalistic rather
than absolute guarantee, why the size of the keyspace matters, why
practical security depends on choosing keys randomly, what side-channel
attacks are, what public-key cryptography is, and what a digital
signature is. You should also have the basic conceptual framework and
vocabulary for further study or self-study. The presentation should be
accessible to beginners of all ages.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biography:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Intending to become a programmer (“developer” hadn’t been invented by
the marketing department yet), Dustin got sidetracked and spent more
time than he cares to admit doing theoretical physics, a background
filled with continuous mathematics almost entirely irrelevant to
computer science and cryptography. He eventually returned to his
original love, and these days writes cryptographic and embedded software
for Gem, Inc. He believes that every programmer and indeed every citizen
must be cryptographically literate in the world he and many, many others
are busy creating. He avoids social media for the same reason he doesn’t
do crack cocaine.

<h2 id="desknet-computer-aided-math-drills-for-children">Desknet:
Computer Aided Math Drills for Children</h2>
<p>date: 2015-08-14, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Retired schoolteacher John “Juan” Slayton will share his cool
hardware/software project, Desknet, which is aimed at allowing children
to do computer-aided drills using one laptop and multiple wireless
keyboards.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Behavioral Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The learner will use the Logitech wireless keyboards, observing the
eccentricities resulting from the Desknet decoding strategies.
</li>
<li>
The learner will demonstrate proficiency in addition and multiplication
by engaging in real-time competitive activies with his/her peers.
</li>
<li>
The learner will recognize and appropriately place his/her fingers on
the home row keys, and will gain speed and accuracy in reaching for
non-home- row letters.
</li>
<li>
The learner will use the Desknet system to check his/her written
calculations derived from the 3rd grade math text.
</li>
<li>
The learner will create and edit coherent text, using the Desknet word
processor.
</li>
<li>
The learner will anecdotally recount the development of the Desknet
hardware and system code to peers as occasion demands.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Biography:</strong>
</p>
<p>
John Slayton is a native of Kansas City (Missouri side), but mostly grew
up in California. He received an MA from UCLA in Linguistics.
</p>
<p>
In the early 80’s he became increasingly dissatisfied with his kids’
experience in the public schools and went back to school (Cal Poly
Pomona) to get a California teaching credential. He tried to get a job
with El Monte City Schools, and wound up spending the next 21 years
teaching bilingual classes at LeGore School. His class became his lab in
which he could try new things, not all of which turned out well. But
some worked. The Desknet project is one of these.

<h2 id="writing-and-publishing-books-with-free-software">Writing and
Publishing Books with Free Software</h2>
<p>date: 2015-07-10, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
The old saying goes that “everyone has a book inside of them”, and
advances in technology have made publishing more accessible than ever.
The opportunities in traditional and independent publishing are wide
open. But writing a book remains a daunting task, and new authors will
encounter many steps along the way.
</p>
<p>
What does it take to publish information in the digital age? Hybrid
author Nathan Haines discusses working with traditional publishers that
use proprietary software and formats, and describes the self-publishing
process from start to finish. From ebooks to print, is Free and Open
Source Software up to the task?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biography:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Nathan Haines is an author, instructor, and computer consultant who fell
in love with Ubuntu in 2005, and helped found the Ubuntu California
Local Community Team to share that excitement with others. As a current
leader of the California team and a member of the Ubuntu Local Community
Council, he works to help others support and share Ubuntu worldwide.
</p>
<p>
His mission to educate and excite people about Free Software and Ubuntu
continues with his upcoming book, Beginning Ubuntu Linux for Windows and
Mac Users.

<p>
<strong>TOPIC</strong>
</p>
<p>
Docker is a hot trend in today’s tech community, making it easier than
ever to containerize and deploy modern, and legacy software
applications. While often mistaken for virtualization, containers take a
new, lightweight approach to abstracting and isolating the runtime
environment, dependencies and networking required by modern software.
</p>
<p>
This talk will cover how to get started with Docker, best practices for
containers and example workflows for developing and deploying containers
locally and in cloud environments. After this talk you should have the
essential building blocks for building a containerized environment and
application stack.

<p>
<strong>TOPIC</strong>
</p>
<p>
Andrew Hamilton will go over the basics of Ansible and discuss why it’s
a great tool for running simple commands, complex tasks and workflows
across a group of systems.
</p>
<p>
Ansible is a powerful but simple automation tool. Ansible is simple
enough that most developers and administrators will be able to
understand the scripts without much trouble. With this simplicity,
Ansible is great for organizations looking for a tool that both dev and
ops can use together. The YAML based syntax of Ansible is also much
easier to understand than the DSL that some other tools use.
</p>

<p>
<strong>MORE ON ANSIBLE:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Ansible has many features common to configuration management systems
such as Puppet and Chef. Ansible uses a simple execution model compared
to Puppet and Chef that is much easier for new users to understand. The
majority of the modules it provides are indepotent so a playbook can be
run multiple times without causing problems by running a change multiple
times if it isn’t needed. The use of YAML to describe your playbooks
also makes creating and editing Ansible playbooks much easier.
</p>
<p>
Interacting directly with services such as AWS, GCE, Azure or OpenStack
is easy through a set of provided modules. Ansible allows you to create
an entire deployment framework with one tool that can provision hosts,
configure and install software, add and remove servers from a load
balancer and finally terminate the old instances. Ansible can also use
dynamically generated lists of hosts making it easy to work in highly
dynamic environments.
</p>
<p>
One of the most powerful features of Ansible is that hosts are accessed
over SSH. There is no need to install additional daemons or to open up
additional ports. You can simply write a playbook, give it a set of
hosts to run against, provide a set of credentials and watch Ansible do
what you’ve told it to do.
</p>
<p>
You also don’t need to give Ansible access to root unless it is required
for the playbook. Ansible can use either sudo or su to escalate
privileges for single tasks or entire playbooks.
</p>
<p>
Ansible core is written in Python so it’s easy to run and extend. If
Python is your language of choice, Ansible provides you with a set of
modules that make writing your own modules easy. If you’re not a Python
developer, Ansible allows modules to be written in any language that can
accept JSON through STDIN and then return JSON back to through STDOUT.
Ansible can also be used as a library in Python that allows you to
easily take advantage of some of its features in custom scripts. Ansible
is a flexible tool that allows users to easily perform both adhoc remote
command execution and configuration management across a group of hosts.
Getting started with Ansible is easy and has relatively low overhead.
Ansible playbooks are simple enough that they can be compared with shell
scripts. We’ll go over the basics of Ansible and discuss why it’s a
great tool for running simple commands, complex tasks and workflows
across a group of systems.

<h2
id="streaming-oodt-an-open-source-platform-for-big-data-processing">Streaming-OODT:
An Open-Source Platform for Big-Data Processing</h2>
<p>date: 2015-02-13, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Streaming-OODT was originally conceived to overcome the limitations of
traditional big-data processing and management systems. It is based on
an open source data processing framework called OODT (Object Oriented
Data Technology) and was funded by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Big
Data Research &amp; Technology Development initiative “Archiving,
Processing and Dissemination for the Big Data Era”. The vision behind
the project is to combine state-of-the- art technologies into an
easy-to-use big-data processing system prepackaged to allow users to
quickly process big-data without the need to patch together individual
technologies.
</p>
<p>
Streaming-OODT provides both traditional batch processing as well as
in-memory MapReduce processing for use on general computing clusters.
Cluster management and multi-tenancy is provided via Apache Mesos, which
manages batch processing as well as the Streaming-OODT’s underlying
technologies. This ensures that multi-tenancy is applied to both the
system and the user’s processing.
</p>
<p>
Apache Spark provides in-memory MapReduce processing enabling processing
at speeds hundreds of times faster than Hadoop MapReduce. This system is
augmented by Apache Kafka used to manage streaming data. This enables
the user to process streaming data alongside traditional data in Apache
Spark and thus tackle data-sets too large to persist en-masse to disk,
while not losing the ability to process data sets that already exist on
disk.
</p>
<p>
Tachyon, an in-memory distributed file system, provides lightning-fast
distributed access to data files and streams on all nodes of the
cluster. Persistence is provided by Hadoop Distributed File System
(HDFS) thus allowing the user both fast data access and persistence to
disk.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate Streaming-OODT, which will
enable the audience to use Streaming-OODT and supporting technologies to
quickly tackle their own big-data problems. The talk will introduce
Streaming-OODT, show how to quickly install and configure the system,
explain the value added by the underlying technologies, and walk through
a working example of big-data processing. Finally, benchmarks will be
presented so that the audience can see the benefit of these technologies
and their combination.

The coworking services and developer programs we offer, like Free
Coworking Days, Coders with a Cause, Mobile Device Lab and Developer
Boot Camps, were made possible because of our love of open source and a
passion for learning.
</p>
<p>
We’d love to see more places like Droplabs, and we’re happy to talk at
SGVLUG about how others can replicate our success - and avoid or
overcome the challenges we’ve had over the years:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Identifying a space to build a location-based community
</li>
<li>
Traffic and parking in Downtown Los Angeles
</li>
<li>
Making decisions in a consensus-based organization
</li>
<li>
Empowering members to become leaders
</li>
<li>
Disrupting the coworking business model
</li>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-retro-camera">Raspberry Pi Retro Camera</h2>
<p>date: 2014-07-09, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
James McDuffie gave a presentation on his Raspberry Pi Camera project.
He has hollowed out a film camera and put in a Raspberry Pi, camera, and
some other electronics to make a retro-looking camera that actually
takes digital photos -and- allows ssh access.
</p>
<p>
He had close-up pictures of the electronic components and detailed
explanations of why he chose a particular component, why he modified it,
and how it fit into the project. James’ particular focus was on energy
efficiency, so he went through a lot of trouble to modify the board to
use 3.3v power from a cellphone battery. He also looked for low-power
components and ways to save power. Because there is no leds or lcd, he
used beeps to provide feedback from the camera during operation. He also
has a six-position knob that allows him to do things like turn on the
system, turn off the camera portion, or to send the halt command to the
Raspberry Pi. There is room for more features.
</p>
<p>
He has set up a webserver on the Raspberry Pi using nginx and Flask.
This allows access to the photos on the Pi. Aside from a serial
connection and the controls from the camera, the only way to “talk” to
the Raspberry Pi is through the webserver or ssh. The Raspberry Pi is
set up to automatically connect to known networks in the wpa supplicants
file. The actual camera operation is handled through a Python library
called

<p>
After over 12 years trying to get the video games studio industry to
both create and use more open source software and unrestricted hardware,
Jared Hardy finally gave up on those proprietary-minded fools, and
started building NELA-ISC.Net instead. In the process of bootstrapping
this Northeast LA community utility cooperative (still in progress), he
discovered the catch-22 of funding nonprofit community projects that can
never take any tax deductible donations or returns-based investments. He
then started the deductible- donation accepting Data Roads Foundation to
help solve that catch-22 investment problem – among other issues
inherent to all cooperatively owned networks. More about that and his
other yak shaving projects are available in the links below:

DATA! 24 hour near real time processing and computation for the JPL
Airborne Snow Observatory</h2>
<p>date: 2013-10-21, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
JPL’s Airborne Snow Observatory is an integrated imaging spectrometer
and scanning LIDAR for measuring mountain snow albedo, snow depth/snow
water equivalent, and ice height (once exposed), led by PI Dr. Tom
Painter. The team recently wrapped our “Snow On” campaign where over a
course of 3 months, we flew the Tuolumne River Basin, Sierra Nevada,
California above the O’Shaughnessy Dam of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir;
focusing initial on the Tuolumne, and then moving to weekly flights over
the Uncompahgre Basin, Colorado.
</p>
<p>
To meet the needs of its customers including Water Resource managers who
are keenly interested in Snow melt, the ASO team had to develop and end
to end 24 hour latency capability for processing spectrometer and LIDAR
data from Level 0 to Level 4 (“ish”) products. Fondly referring to these
processing campaigns as “rodeos” the team rapidly constructed an open
source data processing system at minimal cost and risk that not only met
our processing demands, but taught the entire team many lessons about
remote sensing of snow and dust properties, algorithm integration, the
relationship between computer scientists, and snow hydrologist; flight
and engineering teams, geographers, and most importantly lessons about
camaraderie that will engender highly innovative and rapid data systems
development, and quality science products for years to come.
</p>
<p>
Chris Mattmann is the Compute Lead for the ASO project and he will
humbly tell the story of the Compute processing capability on behalf of
the larger team, highlighting contributions of its key members along the
way

Freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2013-01-08, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Since the dawn of the internet, men have tried to restrict the freedoms
of other men. Amongst those bound by the restrictions of the
technocracy, enlightened individuals created technologies to sidestep
the restrictions placed upon them. These technologies, although
effective, remain cryptic to the bound masses of the technologically
illiterate. What follow is a brief introduction to ssh tunnels and
proxies…
</p>
<p>
Bio: Michael Starch was born in the far-frozen Northlands of the
American Midwest. After being enlighten through a university education
in Computer Engineering he set sail for the warm coasts of the
Californian Southland. He is currently employed and has yet to die.

<p>
A modern day Linux Infrastructure should be flexible, scalable and able
to deal with the constant changes any business will require. Automation
is key to a reliable and consistence server infrastructure, Automation
also allows for easy integration of new changes.
</p>
<p>
The DevOps movement melds two traditionally siloed teams; Application
Developers and Operations Engineers. Writing infrastructure as code
presents a number of challenges and potential pitfalls, Operations
Engineers need to write code (something they may not be familar with)
and Developers need to have a strong understanding of the system (many
Developers don’t want to be considered with anything other than web
applications). There are several major projects related purely to the
management of infrastructure as code.
</p>
<p>
We will examine Opscode Chef and make a strong use case for the
implementation of Opscode Chef in a Linux Environment. David will
demonstrate many techniques to utilize Chef quickly and efficiently to
minimize the time of implementation. Although Opscode Chef can be run on
Solaris, FreeBSD and even Windows, the presentation will discuss Linux
and only Linux. David will also discuss the techniques to operate Chef
on various Linux Distros which can provide a layer of abstraction from
the package management systems (apt &amp; yum). Finally David will
discuss how Chef can be used to rebuild an Entire infrastructure
(regardless of size or complexity) in a time previous thought
impossible. The only limitation in speed of deployment is the hardware.

wish that there was a local meetup group where you can meet up with
like-minded folks and actually make progress with your projects?
</p>
<p>
Come to our kickoff meeting on Thursday to discuss starting up this
special interest group. Connect with your fellow hardware geeks and
share some of the projects you’ve been working on. And if we can decide
on a name for the SIG, we can set up things like a mailing list,
website, and wiki.

with the Cloud and Juju</h2>
<p>date: 2012-09-13, from: San Gabriel Valley Linux User Group</p>
<p>
Its time to face the music: There’s only a couple guys in Ops, and a lot
of infrastructure to set up and it was all due yesterday. If only you
could clone all the sysadmins of the world to get all of their expertise
and know-how in deploying open source applications, you could actually
get it done. Perhaps there is a way: Juju and Charms! Juju encapsulates
services in a way that promotes sharing and collaboration the same way
packages have done for open source software. If you are a sysadmin or a
developer who is looking to get an infrastructure of databases,
loadbalancers, and webapps up to speed rapidly, Juju may be interesting.
If you are looking into deploying something massively scalable, like
OpenStack or Hadoop, Juju is built to handle that task.

<p>
Unity is the new desktop environment for Ubuntu, having first premiered
in <br /> version 11.04, significantly enhanced with version 11.10, and
very much the <br /> cornerstone of the upcoming 12.04 release.
</p>
<p>
A striking departure from Gnome 2, Unity has been seen as a source of
<br /> controversy in the Linux world.
</p>
<p>
This talk will outline some of the design goals that Unity addresses,
noting <br /> strengths, weaknesses, and improvements across the three
versions of Ubuntu in which it’s been included.
</p>
<p>
While Unity offers many usability affordances, some Ubuntu users prefer
to <br /> customize it for their specific workflows. Linux is famous for
its <br /> customizability, and Unity is no exception if you know which
tools to look <br /> for.
</p>
<p>
This presentation will outline some of the tools available through the
Ubuntu<br /> Software Center to show you how to customize the Unity
interface.

<h2>
Topic: Virtualmin / Webmin + Brief review Defcon/Blackhat:
</h2>
<p>
Take your Drupal sites to the next level with the free, open-source
Webmin <br /> control panel and its powerful Virtualmin plug-in. Add as
many features as you want, including unlimited domains, mail accounts,
Subversion repositories, <br /> mailing lists, and more with a
point-and-click web interface.
</p>
<p>
Webmin and Virtualmin are similar to cPanel and WHM, respectively, and
can <br /> manage dozens or even hundreds of domains. They are the
perfect tools for <br /> creating test and development sites, hosting
client websites or even managing<br /> a full-blown online
infrastructure for running a business.
</p>
<p>
Did we forget to mention, Webmin and Virtualmin are free* and
open-source? <br /> Compared to site licensing costs of cPanel, WHM,
Plesk and other proprietary <br /> control panels, Webmin and Virtualmin
cost only as much as a basic <br /> $10-20/month VPS account.
</p>
<p>
Bio: —– Christefano is CEO and Co-founder of Exaltation of Larks, where
<br /> Virtualmin has been a key ingredient for rapid website

APRS is a amateur radio network where small packets of data such as
position <br /> reports, messages or telemetry are transmitted to other
radio operators and <br /> eventually propagated to the Internet. <br />

<p>
The proliferation of small, low power and easily hackable ARM devices
opens up many possibilities for setting up unobtrusive computing
solutions. Amateur <br /> radio operator and long time Linux user James
McDuffie (K6JLM) explores using<br /> the Seagate GoFlex Net along with
surplus amateur radio equipment to build a <br /> APRS digipeater for
helping to relay packets both over RF and to the Internet.

The Caltech team participating in the U.S. Department of Energy 2011
Solar <br /> Decathlon will present their project, for which they are
using various <br /> open-source technology.
</p>
<p>
“The Solar Decathlon is a U.S. Department of Energy Sponsored
competition <br /> which challenges teams of college and graduate
students from around the world<br /> to design and build solar-powered,
net-zero houses. Inside the SCI-Arc/Caltech entry, code named CHIP, a
sophisticated home automation system monitors every<br /> watt of
electricity consumed and visually communicates the information to <br />
homeowners. It also plays a central role in optimizing the behavior of
the <br /> house at all times, such as by controlling operation of the
active thermal <br /> mass, shutting down appliances or lights that are
no longer used, and of <br /> course giving the homeowners an instant
understanding into how their own <br /> behaviors affects their energy
use and in turn their energy bill.”

Filling the Digital Divide with Offline Content: Six ways to deliver a
library anywhere for under $90
</p>
<p>
SUMMARY
</p>
<p>
Off-line content is reading material, educational texts, and other
reference <br /> materials delivered on media such as SDCards, DVDs,
custom hardware, or hard <br /> drives so that it can be used without
internet access. A typical deployment <br /> can deliver the equivalent
of tens of thousands of printed books. The cost to<br /> deliver large
off-line libraries has fallen below the cost to deliver online <br />
internet access in most areas. Off-line content thus provides a cost
effective way to provide access to the world’s knowledge before
affordable internet <br /> infrastructure is available. This
presentation reviews six emerging projects <br /> which aim to provide
off-line hardware and libraries, including the author’s <br /> creation,
the $20 Humane Reader

April 2010: An open-source 8-bit computer to save the world Braddock is
back!
</p>
<p>
Braddock Gaskill will discuss and debut his open source hardware and
software<br /> project designed both for hobbyists and as an e-book
reader for developing <br /> nations.
</p>
<p>
The device can store a 5,000 book library or the better part of
Wikipedia and<br /> display it on any TV set in a developing-world
village library - all for under $20. It is also a fun general purpose
8-bit computing platform comparable in <br /> raw capability to the
Apple II and built, in part, for experimentation and <br /> hobbyists.
The entire system is open sourced, and uses GNU toolchain cross <br />
development under Linux with heavy OSS throughout.
</p>
<p>
The presentation will work through the design, schematic, PCB fab,
assembly, <br /> and software dev. Braddock will walk the audience
through each stage, cover <br /> which tools were used, ponder major
design considerations, and pay special <br /> attention to open source
solutions.

Topic: Data Ownership - How I (mostly) wrestled control of my data from
evil <br /> corporate overlords
</p>
<p>
Speaker: Charles N Wyble
</p>
<p>
Charles Wyble is a systems and security engineer. His focus in 2010 is
<br /> security research, with a particular emphasis on improving
performance of <br /> automated analytic systems. In support of this, he
does a lot of networking <br /> stuff and is in the process of building
a malware lab.
</p>
<p>
He lives in sunny southern California, with his wife Patricia and 2 dogs
ISIS<br /> and OSPF. Yes they are named after routing protocols. He
frequently hosts <br /> hacker parties, where all sorts of cool stuff
gets built. You will often find<br /> him at various hot startups doing
consulting, and at numerous user group <br /> meetings throughout the
southwestern United States.
</p>
<p>
Charles Wyble will be joining the SGVLUG group once again and discussing
the <br /> topic of data ownership / private cloud.
</p>
<p>
Owning ones data is a critical and often overlooked part of security. As
such, he will discuss how he maintains numerous web properties on a
Linux server at<br /> his residence, connected to the best DSL ATT has
to offer.
</p>
<p>
He has recently completed moving all his data onto his own server,
freeing it<br /> (mostly) from the control of google,yahoo etc. It was a
relatively <br /> straightforward process, encompassing 4 major phases.
He will talk about the <br /> tools he utilizes, and
advantages/disadvantages to his setup and some of the <br /> problems he
encountered.

A Case Study in Open Source Software Development
</p>
<p>
For three years the speaker ran a small technology startup company
developing<br /> new ways of visualizing and exploring huge datasets,
like, for example, the <br /> entire routing structure of the internet,
or tens of thousands of documents.
</p>
<p>
This talk will cover real-world experiences with the broad variety of
Open <br /> Source software which made the project possible.
Dependencies included Boost,<br /> CMake, OpenSceneGraph, khtml, gecko,
Firefox plugins, GraphViz, lighttpd, <br /> Xerces DOM, and more. Theses
building blocks were in many cases pushed to (and beyond) their limits,
deployed in a cross-platform Linux and Windows <br /> environment, and
compiled with GCC and MSVC++. We will cover lessons learned,<br />
better alternatives, and other findings.

Convergence<br /> Box), the open-source alternative to TiVo or Windows
Media Center. More than <br /> just a digital VCR, which provides basic
“time shifting” capability, Digital <br /> Video Recorders change the
way people watch television by providing the <br /> ability to pause
live TV, instantly replay interesting scenes, and skip <br />
commercials. With an up-to-date TV schedule, the DVR can automatically
record<br /> shows based on user preferences.

Kris Bergstrom will give an introduction to the extremely powerful LaTeX
<br /> typesetting system and its application to real-world document
production. He <br /> will explain how he uses it in the creation of
essays, books, and letters <br /> incorporating graphics. He will also
demonstrate the use of LaTeX in his <br /> band’s annual fund drive
which requires the creation of personalized letters <br /> (mail merge)
and envelopes.
</p>
<p>
Initially designed to typeset mathematical formulae, the LaTeX system
<br /> incorporates world-class fonts with international symbols. The
system <br /> successfully handles the automatic typesetting of
complicated textbooks with <br /> thousands of images and internal page,
chapter, and figure references. The <br /> line-breaking algorithm used
by LaTeX (or more accurately, by the more basic <br /> TeX engine) is
the industry leader (eventually adopted by Adobe for its <br />
commercial program, InDesign).
</p>
<p>
About the presenter: <br /> Kris Bergstrom was first exposed to
GNU/Linux in electronic music courses at <br /> Stanford’s Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. In 2000, <br /> excited by the
ideals of Free Software, he tried to switch his desktop from <br />
Windows to Debian but with limited knowledge of networking and basic
admin <br /> tasks, was unable to get a basic system up and running.
Soon after moving to <br /> Los Angeles in 2002, he joined a Linux Users
Group and found the support he <br /> needed to do all his personal and
business computer tasks with free software.

X509 and SSL are complicated topics. While they share the basic PKI
<br /> infrastructure that PGP and others do, X509 (and SSL by
extension) are more <br /> complicated. Extending beyond the basic
encryption, signing, decryption, and <br /> verification of basic PKI,
X509 includes a variety of extra pieces and <br /> information enabling
more features. This talk will cover what X509 and SSL <br /> are, how
they relate, how to use them, and how to learn more. It will
discuss<br /> PKI from both an certificate end-user perspective as well
as from a <br /> Certificate Authority perspective. If time permits, a
small comparison to PGP<br /> will also be included akin to the one at
the end of my PGP talk.

Why Linux needs to be more like Windows -or- Impediments to enterprise
Linux <br /> adoption
</p>
<p>
Our speaker is Steve Friedl, a software consultant in Orange County
who’s been using UNIX since the early ’80s, using Windows since the late
’80s, and has <br /> more than 20 years of cross-platform consulting and
commercial software <br /> development experience. He has taught
advanced C/UNIX at Bell Labs, and is the only Microsoft MVP with “unix”
in his domain name (unixwiz.net).
</p>
<p>
He’ll be making the case that Linux has some stumbling blocks that make
<br /> enterprise management and deployment much more difficult than
they need to be, and what road there might be to make some progress on
these fronts.

Monitoring the Local Weather with Linux
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of websites that will give you a weather report for
your <br /> city, but what about your neighborhood? Ever wonder how hot
your attic got <br /> during the summer or how well your air conditioner
is working? Claude <br /> Felizardo will describe his 1-wire weather
station and how it has grown from a simple kit with a single temperature
sensor, wind speed, and direction to <br /> multiple sensors located
throughout his house and publishes the measurements <br /> to the
Internet.
</p>
<p>
About the Presenter:
</p>
<p>
Claude has over 15 years experience developing software on Unix
platforms and<br /> has been playing with Linux since the late 90’s. His
friends and family think<br /> he has too many gadgets, but he’s always
looking for something new to play <br /> with, especially if it works
with Linux.

MySQL replication. MySQL Replication is the means by which one or more
MySQL <br /> databases can keep data synchronized with a master server.
The scope of <br /> replicated data can cover any range, whether a
single table, or <br /> indiscriminately all the databases on the master
server. MySQL Replication is<br /> beginning to find progressively more
exposure in corporate production <br /> environments, where it sees use
from providing hot backups, to distributing <br /> access load amongst
large numbers of users. Solomon Chang will cover four main topics:
<br /> <em> Requirements of MySQL Replication <br /> </em> Concepts of
MySQL Replication <br /> <em> Configuring MySQL Replication <br /> </em>
Troubleshooting MySQL Replication
</p>
<p>
Soloman will provide a master to replicate from, so attendees are
encouraged <br /> to bring their own computers running MySQL (4.1 or
later, please) to configure as a hands-on slave. Attendees will also
have full access to Solomon’s master. If there is time, more advanced
topics will be discussed: <br /> <em> Pyramid Architectures <br /> </em>
Dual Masters <br /> <em> Circular Replication <br /> </em> Circular
Replication of Masters

A couple of “Core OS” developers from Linspire will be our guest
speakers, and they’ll talk about the interesting languages and
technologies they use in <br /> their distribution. When asked what they
will present in detail, Clifford <br /> responded, “The core OS group at
Linspire recently announced that we are <br /> standardizing on Haskell
as our primary development language, whenever <br /> appropriate. In
reality, we have been using both O’Caml and Haskell for years. Projects
include: <br /> <em> hardware detection and configuration, <br /> </em>
creation of installation CDs, <br /> <em> package dependancy checker,
<br /> </em> translation utilities for IRMA, and <br /> * many internal
CGI/Web applications.
</p>
<p>
“In the whirlwind of diversity that characterizes the Open Source
development<br /> model, functional programming provides us an eye of
tranquility. In <br /> particular, static typing has proven invaluable.
We will discuss the benefits<br /> of systems programming with
functional languages using the management of a <br /> Linux distribution
as an example.”

PGP is an amazing tool for verification and encryption. However, many
people <br /> don’t fully understand it-even people who use it. This
talk mostly will cover<br /> uses and effects of PGP. The discussion
will focus on PGP and e-mail, and <br /> other topics will be covered as
well. How cryptography works and the math <br /> behind it will not be
covered.
</p>
<p>
Keysigning party
</p>
<p>
One of the key features of PGP is the “web of trust” that grows out of
<br /> individuals signing each other’s keys as a way of validating that
the <br /> keyholder is indeed the “owner” of the key. We encourge you
to create a key <br /> (if you don’t already have one), post it to a
public keyserver, and bring your “fingerprint” to the meeting for a
keysigning party.

When you mention “running more than one operating system” on a computer,
most<br /> people will think “dual boot”, and for a wide variety of
tasks that is quite <br /> appropriate. But how many of you have thought
of running more than one system<br /> at the same time? Sure, you’re
only “one person,” so why should the computer <br /> act like you were
two people doing different things?
</p>
<p>
Well, you might not want to reboot your machine – especially if you have
a <br /> long-running task going on such as “seti at home” (since
rebooting will cause<br /> the “work unit” to be lost.) You might be a
developer, and you’re working on <br /> something intended to be “cross
platform” – if every “rebuild-and-test” cycle included “reboot the
machine”, you’d tire of it rather quickly. Or perhaps you have two
programs, each of which runs under a different OS, but you need to
<br /> refer to the output of one program while working on the other.
</p>
<p>

Samurai, work that helped them win a VES award for <br /> Best
Supporting Effects. CinePaint is the most popular open source
application in motion picture production.

Mark Echeverri, who has years of experience in traditional software and
systems engineering, says: “For the past couple of months, I’ve been
working with Plone. It’s an impressive system, and not exactly something
you pick up in a Saturday. Previously, I had never done any Web-related
development; Plone is a Zope tool that allows you to juggle Web portals
like bowling pins…provided you know how to take advantage of it. Quite
powerful.”
</p>
<p>
About Zope and Plone:
</p>
<p>
“Zope is an open source application server for building content
management systems, intranets, portals, and custom applications….Zope is
written in Python, a highly-productive, object-oriented scripting
language.”

<p>
“Plone is an out-of-the-box ready content management system that is
built on the powerful and free Zope Application server. It requires
minimal effort to set up, is deeply flexible, and provides you with a
system for managing web content that is ideal for project groups,
communities and intranets.”
