Take: Historical dramas prefer to preserve neo-aristocracy, romanticize
ruling class</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Jan. 15 at 7:48 p.m.</em> For a Hollywood
bathed in privilege, it’s far too easy to romanticize the glamour of
history. Recent years have brought about a wave of historical dramas
depicting clashes between aristocratic convention and revolutionary
upheaval, with Sir Ridley Scott’s 2023 biopic “Napoleon” and Netflix’s
Emmy-nominated historical series “The Crown” serving as just two recent
examples.</p>

<p><em>This post was updated Jan. 15 at 7:56 p.m.</em> The Television
Academy’s limited recognition of speculative fiction is far from
magical. With the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards airing Monday, fans of the
genre may be watching the ceremony in bittersweet spirits.</p>
