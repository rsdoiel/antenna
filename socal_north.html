2024: ‘I Saw the TV Glow’ actors discuss film’s script, connections to
upbringing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>“I Saw the TV Glow” is breaking through the static of the horror
genre. After making their narrative film debut at Sundance 2021 with
their lo-fi horror film “We’re All Going to the World’s Fair,”
writer-director Jane Schoenbrun returned to this year’s festival with “I
Saw the TV Glow.” The filmmaker’s A24-produced sophomore entry centers
on lonely teenagers Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Brigette
Lundy-Paine) who find solace in their favorite television show, “The
Pink Opaque.” Smith, Lundy-Paine and cast member Ian Foreman spoke with
the Daily Bruin’s Graciana Paxton at the Sundance Film Festival about
the ways in which the coming-of-age horror explores media obsessions,
isolation and identity.</p>
