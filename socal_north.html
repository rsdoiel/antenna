the end of the season means enjoying roses while acknowledging thorns.
“Our team just proved that they were fighters, and they were going to go
into each match and give it their all and let the chips where they did,”
the coach said.</p>

<p><em>This post was updated May 5 at 10:03 p.m.</em> The Bruins ranked
at the top of the country in rebounding margin last season. Beyond
6-foot-7 sophomore center Lauren Betts, UCLA women’s basketball’s roster
boasted six players standing at 6-foot-2 or higher that each contributed
to the team’s dominance on the glass.</p>

<p><em>This post was updated May 5 at 9:57 p.m.</em> The Bruins saw
double – in more ways than one.  After five long matches, all going to
set three, the national championship trophy slipped through their hands
on the same court and to the same pair – twins Nicole and Audrey Nourse
– that had previously secured the Trojans’ national championship in
2023.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated May 5 at 9:50 p.m.</em> LONG BEACH – A
huddle disbanded as limbs collapsed to Walter Pyramid’s floor in sheer
jubilation. Senior outside hitter Ethan Champlin, his final swing now
adorned in glory, side-stepped to his fall on the service line.  The
ball cradled in Skyler Varga’s palms at the net as he arced the ball
back toward the Bruins.  It took a moment.  The Beach’s outside hitter
paused for contemplation – followed by an unforgiving grasp of reality
as his eyes drank in a vibrant mound of blue and gold rejoicing on his
home floor.</p>
