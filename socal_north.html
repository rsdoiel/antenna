Ohtani’s Record Dodgers Contract — And Deferrals — Has California
Officials Talking Tax Reform</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, updated: 2024-01-09, from: The LAist</p>
<p>Ohtani’s 10-year contract pays him only $2 million a year, deferring
$680 million until after his time with the Dodgers — and possibly his
California residency — is over. If Ohtani collects that money after
returning to his native Japan, California would lose an estimated $98
million in tax revenue from him.</p>

men’s basketball falls to California for first time in 8 years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>For the first time since 2010, the Bruins failed to secure the win in
Pauley Pavilion against the Golden Bears. UCLA men’s basketball (6-9,
1-3 Pac-12) couldn’t overcome another lackluster offensive performance,
snapping an 11-game win streak against California (5-10, 1-3) with its
66-57 defeat Saturday night.</p>

shaky beam performance, UCLA gymnastics lands in last at Super 16
meet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS – The Bruins led at the halfway point. Competing in Olympic
order, only beam remained before finishing with a floor party. But at
the Mean Girls Super 16 meet, a not-so-fetch beam rotation sunk the
Bruins’ penultimate event, leaving them in last place, a full point
behind the Crimson Tide.</p>
