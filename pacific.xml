_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Hundreds of patients at Samoa&#39;s main hospital, the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital in the capital, Apia, went without meals after kitchen staff failed to show up for work in protest over unpaid wages.

The inpatient capacity of the national hospital is around 200 beds. According to local media reports, this is the first time such an incident has occurred.

Dr Tito Kamu, a senior doctor at the hospital, told TV1 Samoa that the hospital chefs did not show up for work on Thursday due to 11 weeks of unpaid overtime.

Patients admitted across all wards and the emergency unit did not receive any breakfast, he said.

Dr Kamu said kitchen staff at the hospital earned around WST$8,000 per year (approximately NZ$5000) — roughly WST$150 (NZ$92) per week.

The Samoa Observer reported that private companies had stepped in to provide meals for patients.

&#34;By 6pm Thursday, a Ministry of Health van was seen delivering pre-packed meals to the hospital, assisted by staff members who helped unload the food,&#34; the report stated.

Tagaloa Dr Robert Thomsen, the country&#39;s acting director-general for health, confirmed that two catering companies had been called in to provide meals for patients, the newspaper reported.

According to Tagaloa, the issue regarding overtime pay arose due to &#34;miscommunication&#34;.

&#34;The issue has been resolved, and they will return to work tomorrow,&#34; he was quoted as saying by the Samoa Observer.

        <p>Earlier this month, more than a thousand people from different Christian denominations, including members of Pentecostal and mainline churches, gathered in downtown Apia on Saturday, October 4, 2025, to publicly express their solidarity with Israel.</p>
        <p>It was a sight to behold. Israeli flags fluttered proudly alongside Samoan flags as participants dressed in blue and white, the colors of Israel’s flag and Samoa's national colors, assembled along Beach Road, stretching from the Sheraton Hotel to the Apia Protestant Church, for the “March for Israel”. The white banner emblazoned with the blue Star of David, framed by two blue stripes, stood out prominently amid the crowd. The sound of shofars, traditional Hebrew horns, blown by participants in biblical-style attire, echoed over the rhythm of gospel music booming from large speakers, creating a powerful and emotional atmosphere of faith and unity.</p>
        <p>It was a drizzly Saturday morning, and by 7am, the crowd, which had begun arriving as early as 5:30am, had swelled to more than a thousand enthusiastic marchers, all eager to show their support for Israel despite the gloomy weather.</p>
        <p>Children, youth, and adults lined both sides of Beach Road, many arriving in busloads from villages as far away as Satapuala and Falelatai on the western side of Upolu. A sense of anticipation and excitement filled the air as the crowd prepared for the short march toward the Government Building on Beach Road.</p>
        <p>The drizzle turned into a downpour just as the march began with the sounding of the shofar. Yet the rain did little to dampen the spirits of the marchers. Pastors and clergy, young and old alike, led the sea of blue-and-white-clad supporters who marched, sang joyfully, and waved the Samoan and Israeli flags as though it were a sun-kissed morning.</p>
        <p>Led by a police vehicle escort, the procession made its way along Beach Road, circling the town clock before continuing toward the Government Building. It was a peaceful, joyful, and deeply spiritual march in support of the State and people of Israel. There were no confrontations, no violence, no angry chants or threats, just the uplifting sound of singing and praise.</p>

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ As the world watches the unfolding events in the Middle East, including the emotional reunions between the last of the Israeli hostages and their loved ones, support for the State of Israel continues to resonate in Samoa, thousands of miles away from the Holy Land.

Earlier this month, more than a thousand people from different Christian denominations, including members of Pentecostal and mainline churches, gathered in downtown Apia on Saturday, October 4, 2025, to publicly express their solidarity with Israel.

It was a sight to behold. Israeli flags fluttered proudly alongside Samoan flags as participants dressed in blue and white, the colors of Israel’s flag and Samoa&#39;s national colors, assembled along Beach Road, stretching from the Sheraton Hotel to the Apia Protestant Church, for the “March for Israel”. The white banner emblazoned with the blue Star of David, framed by two blue stripes, stood out prominently amid the crowd. The sound of shofars, traditional Hebrew horns, blown by participants in biblical-style attire, echoed over the rhythm of gospel music booming from large speakers, creating a powerful and emotional atmosphere of faith and unity.

It was a drizzly Saturday morning, and by 7am, the crowd, which had begun arriving as early as 5:30am, had swelled to more than a thousand enthusiastic marchers, all eager to show their support for Israel despite the gloomy weather.

Children, youth, and adults lined both sides of Beach Road, many arriving in busloads from villages as far away as Satapuala and Falelatai on the western side of Upolu. A sense of anticipation and excitement filled the air as the crowd prepared for the short march toward the Government Building on Beach Road.

The drizzle turned into a downpour just as the march began with the sounding of the shofar. Yet the rain did little to dampen the spirits of the marchers. Pastors and clergy, young and old alike, led the sea of blue-and-white-clad supporters who marched, sang joyfully, and waved the Samoan and Israeli flags as though it were a sun-kissed morning.

Led by a police vehicle escort, the procession made its way along Beach Road, circling the town clock before continuing toward the Government Building. It was a peaceful, joyful, and deeply spiritual march in support of the State and people of Israel. There were no confrontations, no violence, no angry chants or threats, just the uplifting sound of singing and praise.

The scene stood in stark contrast to many of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations witnessed in Europe, Australia, and the United States, where crowds have chanted slogans such as “Death to Israel,” “Free Palestine,” and “From the river to the sea.”

The resounding blasts of the shofar and uplifting worship music heralded the crowd’s arrival in front of the Government Building. Tents had been set up in advance, and awaiting the procession were Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo, Members of Parliament, senior government officials, and prominent church leaders and clergy.

The atmosphere was electric, almost festive, as drenched marchers sang, danced, and waved their flags with unrestrained joy and excitement, seemingly oblivious to the rain, which by then had mercifully eased. A short service followed, during which the crowd worshipped together, praying for God’s blessing and protection upon His chosen people as they face growing persecution.

In his remarks, Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe praised the marchers for their steadfast support of Israel, noting that their stand reflects the official position of the Government of Samoa as publicly affirmed by Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt.

There was thunderous cheering and applause as Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe concluded his remarks by reaffirming Prime Minister Laauli’s declaration: “Samoa stands with Israel! God bless Israel! God bless Samoa!” The proclamation captured the spirit of the gathering — a powerful expression of faith, unity, and biblical conviction.

Subsequent speakers echoed his sentiments, delivering strong messages of solidarity with the God of Israel — and the God of Samoa — as they quoted from Scripture and reminded the crowd of the shared spiritual bond between the two nations.

“I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” (Genesis 12:3)

This is part of God’s covenant with Abraham, often interpreted by believers as a divine promise extending to Abraham’s descendants, the people of Israel.

“For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.&#34; (Zechariah 2:8)

“To God be the glory!” declared Pastor Leota Kosi Latu, one of the organizers of the march. “We have made our statement loud and clear, and I want to thank everyone who braved the elements this morning to publicly declare our support for Israel, God’s chosen people.”

Pastor Leota also voiced concern about the number of Samoans who, in his view, have been misled by what he described as biased international media coverage of the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.

“Some of our people, both here in Samoa and abroad, have become what Lenin once called ‘useful idiots’ — joining the thousands around the world taking part in pro-Palestinian protests, chanting death threats, and cursing Israel,” he said.

“It saddens me because they are protesting something they do not truly understand, chanting about a place they have never even seen. They call Israel’s actions ‘genocide,’ when in reality the nation is fighting to rescue its hostages and defend its very existence against hostile Arab neighbors.

“They curse Israel,” he added solemnly, “but they do not realize that in doing so, they bring that curse upon themselves.”

Pastor Leota clarified that their support for Israel is not political, but deeply spiritual.

“However,” he said, “we are witnessing in real time the unfolding of biblical prophecies — events the Scriptures foretold would occur in the ‘end times,’ just before the second coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”

“Right now, we are beginning to see the convergence of politics and the spiritual,” he continued. “What was once considered purely political is no longer just that — it has become profoundly spiritual. Heaven and earth are on a collision course, and Samoa must prepare herself for something divine and eternal — blessings from heaven that will endure forever.”

O le taeao na soso’o ai, na toe potopoto atu i le Ofisa a le Pulea’oga ia sui o le Komiti Faafoe a le A’oga faapea le Peresetene o le PTA a matua, e pei ona sa faatonuina ai i latou e le latou loia, ina ia soalaupuleina le mataupu i le tagi a matua a le tamaititi a’oga o Simeona.

Na mafua ona faia le tagi a le ulugalii ona o le faamatalaga a Simeona ia i la’ua, e uiga i le alii ave pasi o Paulo, lea ua maliu.  Lea sa fai atu ai Simeona, e usu atu lava ia Paulo, a le fa’asua’ava, o la e a’afia i vaega o fualaau faasaina.

O le loia lava na mulimuli taunu’u atu i le fonotaga ma sa leai seisi na pisa, ae ua ave uma o latou mata ma taliga i le loia, po o le a sana faamatalaga.

Sa amata le faamatalaga a le loia, i lona faapea mai, “E le o se mataupu faigofie lenei mataupu.  Ma sa fai sina umi o matou falo ma le Taitai Leoleo e tusa ai ma se fofo e fofoina ai lenei faafitauli ua tula’i mai.  Ae na o le pau le tulaga e tatou te fa’afetai ai, ona e le’i iai se loia a matua o le tamaititi a’oga.”

The Cold War is thawing, but far from over; the Nixon government is retreating from Vietnam in the face of an enormous anti-war movement; and a corporation called Deepsea Ventures is conducting the world’s first deep sea mining test on the Blake Plateau, 300 kilometers off the US east coast. There, the sea floor is littered with nuggets of valuable minerals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, some 60,000 of which will be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dredged up</a> from a test area spanning 43 kilometers.  </p>
        <p>The Deepsea Ventures test and the oil shock of 1973 heralded a <a href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/dreams-optimizing-ocean-1970-deepsea-ventures-mining-test-and-artificial-upwelling%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">flurry of investment</a> in seabed mining through the 1970s, as US <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2156&amp;context=jil%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">fears</a> about dependence on foreign sources of raw materials grew – the CIA even used one test to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77-00432R000100360006-2.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">hide an operation</a> to recover a wrecked Soviet submarine. But by the 1990s, the momentum behind the emerging industry had dissipated. Resource competition was incongruent with the post-Cold War “unipolar moment” of globalization and free trade and minerals were never extracted from the ocean floor on a commercial scale. </p>
        <p>Five and a half decades later, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">damage</a> inflicted on Blake Plateau by the Deepsea Ventures test remains. While scientists are still studying the real environmental toll of deep sea mining, available research paints <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">a concerning picture</a>: the release of carbon sequestered in seabeds, permanent ecosystem disruption and fishery contamination are just <a href="https://earth.org/protecting-uncharted-ecosystems-why-we-need-a-deep-seabed-mining-moratorium/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">some of the possible costs</a>. </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, with demand for critical minerals surging due to their role in <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">digital and renewable energy</a> (not to mention <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_231765.htm%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">military</a>) technologies, in April US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to restart the deep sea mining drive.</p>
        <p>Wherever resource extraction might augment US power, the second Trump government seems ruthlessly committed to pursuing it – be it <a href="https://earth.org/trump-to-open-up-59-million-acres-of-national-forest-to-logging-mining/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">opening 60 million acres of national forest for logging and mining</a>, repealing <a href="https://earth.org/100-days-of-trump-how-the-us-overturned-years-of-climate-progress/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">barriers to oil drilling in the Arctic</a> or <a href="https://earth.org/trumps-signs-executive-orders-to-revive-beautiful-clean-coal-in-blow-to-us-emissions-reduction-efforts/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">reinvigorating US coal production</a>. Its determination to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“unleash”</a> deep sea mining is just another expression of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra. </p>
        <p>But the geopolitical ambitions behind the move are not restricted to the Republican party. As Columbia University Professor Adam Tooze wrote in his <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“Bidenomics”</a> postmortem last year, a strategy of excluding China from key technology supply chains is now effectively bipartisan policy. In these terms, deep sea mining would be wholly consistent with Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, for instance. Just as the latter aimed to promote US economic independence from China by <a href="https://earth.org/chips-act/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">subsidizing domestic semiconductor production</a>, the Trump government presents deep sea mining as a matter of national security – of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control.”</a> Independent, in other words, of China, which currently <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dominates</a> the global critical mineral supply chain. </p>
        <p><strong>OPPOSITION</strong></p>
        <p>The waters of a far-flung US territory in the south Pacific are emerging as a forefront in this new drive to plunder the deep. </p>
        <p>Coinciding with Trump’s executive order, California-based firm Impossible Metals in April applied for a commercial mining lease in an <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/BOEM-2025-0035-0001%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">18 million-acre area</a> off the coast of American Samoa. Undaunted by the evidence of environmental risks, the company brands itself as a model of social responsibility. Its website is awash with references to sustainability, fairness and equity. Its number one “<a href="https://impossiblemetals.com/about/mission-and-culture/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">core value</a>” is “planet comes first: environment and people before profit.” It promises to deliver “seabed harvesting without destroying the habitat.”</p>
        <p>In a world where corporate <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-greenwashing/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">greenwashing</a> is rife, however, one would be forgiven for taking the firm’s claims with a pinch of salt – and the people of American Samoa, for one, are not convinced. Since making its application, Impossible Metals <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">has been on the ground</a> in the territory trying to win local support, presenting at public meetings and promising 1% of its profits to the islands. </p>
        <p>But the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s call for public comments on Impossible Metals’ application attracted not only an <a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/territories-join-american-samoa-in-fight-against-deep-sea-mining/article_8e6e17b4-4df7-41c2-a3af-fd423ab5ee51.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">overwhelmingly negative response</a> but also a substantial <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">petition of opposition</a>. American Samoa’s political leadership, too, is united in rejecting deep sea mining. In 2024 then-Governor Lemanu Mauga enacted a <a href="https://www.osas.as/_files/ugd/36d1c0_3789f4f26b4f4a41bdab6e87d36a9388.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">moratorium</a> on seabed extraction in American Samoan waters, and this year, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolao Pula, who took office in January, reiterated that opposition in a <a href="https://www.americansamoa.gov/leadershipunited%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">joint-statement</a> with other key leaders.</p>
        <p>American Samoans have good reasons to be circumspect of deep sea mining in their corner of the Pacific. As the American Samoa Resilience Office outlines in its <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0103%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">submission</a> on Impossible Metals’ application, the local tuna industry, which employs 5,000 people out of a total population of less than 50,000, “could be severely impacted by sediment plumes, toxins and habitat disruptions.” The material and economic risks are matched by social, cultural and spiritual ones. As another <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0104%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">submitter writes</a>, to Samoans “the ocean isn’t just a resource or commodity; it is our relative, an integral part of our culture, our provider, and our home… To threaten its health is to threaten who we are as Pasefika people.”</p>
        <p>But while American Samoans’ opposition seems emphatic, what influence this might have on US government decision-making is less clear. As author Daniel Immerwahr shows in his book <em>How to Hide an Empire</em>, American Samoa and the other US territories exist in an implicitly colonial relationship with Washington. American Samoans cannot vote for President and have no Senator, and their representative in the House is excluded from voting on legislation. </p>
        <p>Impossible Metals’ application must now pass a <a href="https://www.boem.gov/marine-minerals/american-samoa-activities%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">government environmental impact assessment</a> but if the Trump government proves resolute in its commitment to extraction, American Samoa may not have the power to stop it. As Immerwahr pithily puts it, “empire might be hard to make out from the mainland, but from the sites of colonial rule themselves, it’s impossible to miss.”                                                            </p>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Adam Tooze</a>, the “daunting historical significance of the [anti-China] policies that have been enacted under Biden” – and which are being extended under Trump – “is that they mark the definitive and self-conscious end of the globalizing post-Cold War moment.” It is logical, then, that this should be the moment when the prospect of deep sea mining, dormant since the end of US-Soviet competition in the late 1980s, should resurface.

Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —  July 1970. The Cold War is thawing, but far from over; the Nixon government is retreating from Vietnam in the face of an enormous anti-war movement; and a corporation called Deepsea Ventures is conducting the world’s first deep sea mining test on the Blake Plateau, 300 kilometers off the US east coast. There, the sea floor is littered with nuggets of valuable minerals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, some 60,000 of which will be [dredged up](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) from a test area spanning 43 kilometers.

The Deepsea Ventures test and the oil shock of 1973 heralded a [flurry of investment](https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/dreams-optimizing-ocean-1970-deepsea-ventures-mining-test-and-artificial-upwelling%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) in seabed mining through the 1970s, as US [fears](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2156&#38;context=jil%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) about dependence on foreign sources of raw materials grew – the CIA even used one test to [hide an operation](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77-00432R000100360006-2.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) to recover a wrecked Soviet submarine. But by the 1990s, the momentum behind the emerging industry had dissipated. Resource competition was incongruent with the post-Cold War “unipolar moment” of globalization and free trade and minerals were never extracted from the ocean floor on a commercial scale.

Five and a half decades later, the [damage](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) inflicted on Blake Plateau by the Deepsea Ventures test remains. While scientists are still studying the real environmental toll of deep sea mining, available research paints [a concerning picture](https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank): the release of carbon sequestered in seabeds, permanent ecosystem disruption and fishery contamination are just [some of the possible costs](https://earth.org/protecting-uncharted-ecosystems-why-we-need-a-deep-seabed-mining-moratorium/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank).

Nonetheless, with demand for critical minerals surging due to their role in [digital and renewable energy](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) (not to mention [military](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_231765.htm%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)) technologies, in April US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to restart the deep sea mining drive.

Wherever resource extraction might augment US power, the second Trump government seems ruthlessly committed to pursuing it – be it [opening 60 million acres of national forest for logging and mining](https://earth.org/trump-to-open-up-59-million-acres-of-national-forest-to-logging-mining/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), repealing [barriers to oil drilling in the Arctic](https://earth.org/100-days-of-trump-how-the-us-overturned-years-of-climate-progress/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) or [reinvigorating US coal production](https://earth.org/trumps-signs-executive-orders-to-revive-beautiful-clean-coal-in-blow-to-us-emissions-reduction-efforts/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). Its determination to [“unleash”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) deep sea mining is just another expression of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra.

But the geopolitical ambitions behind the move are not restricted to the Republican party. As Columbia University Professor Adam Tooze wrote in his [“Bidenomics”](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) postmortem last year, a strategy of excluding China from key technology supply chains is now effectively bipartisan policy. In these terms, deep sea mining would be wholly consistent with Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, for instance. Just as the latter aimed to promote US economic independence from China by [subsidizing domestic semiconductor production](https://earth.org/chips-act/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), the Trump government presents deep sea mining as a matter of national security – of [“securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control.”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) Independent, in other words, of China, which currently [dominates](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) the global critical mineral supply chain.

**OPPOSITION**

The waters of a far-flung US territory in the south Pacific are emerging as a forefront in this new drive to plunder the deep.

Coinciding with Trump’s executive order, California-based firm Impossible Metals in April applied for a commercial mining lease in an [18 million-acre area](https://www.regulations.gov/document/BOEM-2025-0035-0001%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) off the coast of American Samoa. Undaunted by the evidence of environmental risks, the company brands itself as a model of social responsibility. Its website is awash with references to sustainability, fairness and equity. Its number one “ [core value](https://impossiblemetals.com/about/mission-and-culture/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)” is “planet comes first: environment and people before profit.” It promises to deliver “seabed harvesting without destroying the habitat.”

In a world where corporate [greenwashing](https://earth.org/what-is-greenwashing/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) is rife, however, one would be forgiven for taking the firm’s claims with a pinch of salt – and the people of American Samoa, for one, are not convinced. Since making its application, Impossible Metals [has been on the ground](https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) in the territory trying to win local support, presenting at public meetings and promising 1% of its profits to the islands.

But the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s call for public comments on Impossible Metals’ application attracted not only an [overwhelmingly negative response](https://www.postguam.com/news/local/territories-join-american-samoa-in-fight-against-deep-sea-mining/article_8e6e17b4-4df7-41c2-a3af-fd423ab5ee51.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) but also a substantial [petition of opposition](https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). American Samoa’s political leadership, too, is united in rejecting deep sea mining. In 2024 then-Governor Lemanu Mauga enacted a [moratorium](https://www.osas.as/_files/ugd/36d1c0_3789f4f26b4f4a41bdab6e87d36a9388.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) on seabed extraction in American Samoan waters, and this year, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolao Pula, who took office in January, reiterated that opposition in a [joint-statement](https://www.americansamoa.gov/leadershipunited%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) with other key leaders.

American Samoans have good reasons to be circumspect of deep sea mining in their corner of the Pacific. As the American Samoa Resilience Office outlines in its [submission](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0103%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) on Impossible Metals’ application, the local tuna industry, which employs 5,000 people out of a total population of less than 50,000, “could be severely impacted by sediment plumes, toxins and habitat disruptions.” The material and economic risks are matched by social, cultural and spiritual ones. As another [submitter writes](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0104%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), to Samoans “the ocean isn’t just a resource or commodity; it is our relative, an integral part of our culture, our provider, and our home… To threaten its health is to threaten who we are as Pasefika people.”

But while American Samoans’ opposition seems emphatic, what influence this might have on US government decision-making is less clear. As author Daniel Immerwahr shows in his book _How to Hide an Empire_, American Samoa and the other US territories exist in an implicitly colonial relationship with Washington. American Samoans cannot vote for President and have no Senator, and their representative in the House is excluded from voting on legislation.

Impossible Metals’ application must now pass a [government environmental impact assessment](https://www.boem.gov/marine-minerals/american-samoa-activities%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) but if the Trump government proves resolute in its commitment to extraction, American Samoa may not have the power to stop it. As Immerwahr pithily puts it, “empire might be hard to make out from the mainland, but from the sites of colonial rule themselves, it’s impossible to miss.”

According to [Adam Tooze](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), the “daunting historical significance of the \[anti-China\] policies that have been enacted under Biden” – and which are being extended under Trump – “is that they mark the definitive and self-conscious end of the globalizing post-Cold War moment.” It is logical, then, that this should be the moment when the prospect of deep sea mining, dormant since the end of US-Soviet competition in the late 1980s, should resurface. Before us is a new abyss of great power politics, threatening to envelop in its callous gravity both the deepest places in nature and the Indigenous people closest to them.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ The Fijian Teachers Association (FTA) is advocating for &#34;some form&#34; of corporal punishment to enforce discipline in primary and secondary schools, but the government says physical punishment cannot be the solution to indiscipline.

The association&#39;s general secretary Paula Manumanunitoga told a forum on corporal punishment in Suva this week that teachers feel threatened in the classroom and parents are not playing their part.

He said teachers were being sworn at, had objects thrown at them, were verbally abused, and had their hair pulled.

He said it is a &#34;serious matter&#34; and the FTA is worried about the country.

&#34;FTA is proposing that there should be some form... we would not want to call it corporal punishment. Some have gone to the extent of calling it violence,&#34; Manumanunitoga said.

&#34;We are suggesting that it be only with the head of school and following the strict conditions of strapping a leather belt. It would be a deterrent for students. I was a primary school teacher, if I lay a belt on my table the students would not make a noise. But when that belt disappears, there&#39;s havoc in the classroom.&#34;

However, the country&#39;s Education Minister Aseri Radrodro said discipline must always be guided by law, compassion, and respect for the rights and dignity of every child.

Under Fiji&#39;s 2013 Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which Fiji ratified in 1993, all forms of inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited.

Radrodro said this was what guided the Education Ministry&#39;s approach to discipline and child protection in schools.

&#34;The Ministry of Education maintains a zero-tolerance policy on abuse, neglect, exploitation and corporal punishment,&#34; he said.

&#34;Our teachers must adhere to the Student Code of Conduct which promotes respect, safety and engagement and we encourage parents to take the lead as the first teachers in their homes.&#34;

Fiji&#39;s permanent secretary for justice and a psychologist Selina Kuruleca said when a child is struck — even lightly — the brain will register danger.

Citing a United Nations Children&#39;s Fund (Unicef) report, Kuruleca said 81 percent of Fijian children — eight out of 10 — experience violent discipline at home.

She told participants at the national dialogue discipline should not break a child&#39;s spirit, it should build it.

A letter published in The Fiji Times on Wednesday questioned the need for such a public dialogue on the issue.

&#34;Why have a national conversation on corporal punishment when it is common knowledge that classroom behavior had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment?&#34; wrote Wise Muavono from Lautoka.

&#34;It is inevitable that bad classroom behavior has filtered into life outside school. The no smacking rule is turning some children into monsters.&#34;

Another letter writer and teacher Rajnesh Lingam wrote, &#34;Dialogue is a must as we aim to address negative behavior in children.&#34;

&#34;We can&#39;t leave this unattended as it will have drastic consequences on teaching and learning in schools, communities and societies,&#34; he wrote.

Unicef Pacific chief of child protection Michael Copeland told ABC Pacific Beat the discussion about how to discipline children is a &#34;difficult&#34; one.

Copeland said calling for a return to hitting children &#34;is a cry for help&#34;.

He said there were other options to discipline children instead of corporal punishment.

These could be school counseling, mental health services for kids who were struggling, capacity building for teachers, and parenting training, he said.

&#34;Kids aren&#39;t born bad and disruptive,&#34; he said.

&#34;They&#39;re coming out in particular environments \[and\] we&#39;ve got gaps around more advanced and dedicated services, mental health services, and then alongside that, we&#39;ve got families who are really struggling.&#34;

The National Conversation on Corporal Punishment was organized by Fiji&#39;s Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. The event brought together key voices from the judiciary, education, psychology, faith communities, and development partners.

E tatou te tau fai si’faatasi le viiga ma le mua i lo tatou Tapa’au Sili i le Lagi, ona o Lana pule faasoifua ma Lana tausiga alofa ia i tatou taitoatasi, ua mafai ai ona o tatou toe fesilafa’i ma le manuia i lenei taeao fou.

Ia ae se’ese’e mai loa i ou se’etaga malu, ae o le a fa’aauau atu le tatou Fagogo – O LE AVE PASI A’OGA.

Sa fa’agata mai le tatou Fagogo i le vaiaso ua te’a atu, ina ua ta’ape le fono a le Pulea’oga ma sui o le Komiti Faafoe a le A’oga faapea le Peresetene o le PTA a matua, ina ua mae’a ona o latou valaau i le loia a le a’oga ma faamatala iai le mea ua tupu, e tusa ai ma le tagi a le aiga o le tamaititi a’oga, lea ua faia e faasaga i le a’oga, ona o le a’afia o fanau a’oga i le faalavelave na tupu, lea sa maliu ai le ave pasi a le a’oga.

Na fa’atonu mai e le loia ia le ‘au fono, ina ia tu’u atu sina taimi, se’i alu e su’esu’e le mataupu, ona fai mai lea o sana faamatalaga.

Ua ta’ape fiafia ia le ‘au fono, aua o lea ua tu’u atu le mataupu i lima o le loia.

A’o fa’atalitali le vaega lea mo se tala mai i le latou loia, ae o le faaiuga o le vaiaso, na toe alu atu ai le tama o le tamaititi a’oga o Simeona, i le ofisa a leoleo, e va’ai po o fea ua o’o iai lana mataupu.

Ina ua savali atu i totonu ia le tamaloa o Falani, o le tama lea a le tamaititi a’oga o Simeona, sa iloa mai o ia e le Ta’ita’i Leoleo, o lo’o saofa’i mai i lana kesi.

Na tu i luga le Taitai Leoleo ma savali mai ma fa’afeiloa’I mai i le tamaloa o Falani ma fesili mai iai, po o iai se mea o manaomia.

Ua ‘ata ia Falani ma faapea atu i le Ta’ita’i Leoleo, po o le a lea ituaiga fesili.  Aua o lo’o silafia lelei lava e le Ta’ita’i Leoleo, ia le mafua’aga na alu atu ai.

Na faapea mai loa iai le Ta’ita’i Leoleo, o ituaiga mataupu ia, e fai sina taimi o tau su’esu’e, ina ia fa’amautu ma fa’amaonia uma ia le tonu ma le sa’o o le tagi.

Na toe ‘ata ia Falani ma fai atu i le Ta’ita’i Leoleo, “Ai e te faapea, ou te valea, a ea?  O a’u ou te mativa, ae ou te le valea.  O le a tu’u atu le vaiaso lenei, a leai loa se tali i le vaiaso fou, o le a savalivali loa i le ofisa a le nusipepa ma le televise, lea e latalata mai, e fesili iai, e uiga i la’u mataupu.”

E fai lava le tala a le tamaloa o Falani ma liliu ma toe savali ese atu mai i le ofisa a leoleo.

Ua  toe fo’i le Ta’ita’i Leoleo i lana kesi ma ia tago i lana telefoni ma tu’u i lona taliga ma ia faapea atu i le tagata, o lo’o i leisi itu o le telefoni.  “O le fa’ai’uga o le vaiaso, e tatau ona maua ai se tali o lau mataupu.”

compiled by Samoa News staff

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Tonga&#39;s health ministry has launched its long-awaited National Mental Health Strategy and Policy at Vaiola Hospital.

Health officials have described the move as a milestone in strengthening mental health services and coordination across Tonga.

The nation&#39;s head psychiatrist Dr Mapa Puloka said &#34;mental health is everyone&#39;s responsibility&#34;.

A national survey released earlier this year found around six percent of Tongans reported notable psychological distress, yet 96 percent of those surveyed had never accessed mental health care.

The study also revealed that none of those identified with depression had previously seen a mental health professional.

Mental health challenges in Tonga are often compounded by stigma and limited service accessibility, especially in outer islands.

**“O LE MOGAMOGA POTO”**

Na iai ni mogamoga se tolu, ua leva ona fia ‘a’ai.  Na o latou o atu i se faifa’ato’aga ma aisi ai mo se latou mea’ai.  Ua ofo alofa mai iai e le faifa’ato’aga ia se falaoa ma sisi.  Ua a’ai nei mogamoga ma ua ma’o’ona, ona sefe lea o a latou toe’aiga, e ave mo a latou aiga.

Ae ina ua sauni nei mogamoga e toe fo’i atu i a latou aiga, na faapea atu le faifa’ato’aga ia i latou.  “Fa’alogo mai mogamoga, e a pe a ou tu’uina atu se galuega mo outou i la’u fa’ato’aga.  Ona outou le tau aisi ai lea i ni mea’ai, ae e mafai ona maua a outou mea’ai, mo la outou galuega.”

Ua fesili mai mogamoga, po o le a le galuega ae pe fia foi le latou totogi.

Ua tali atu le faifa’atoaga, “E fa ni avanoa faigaluega o lo’o iai nei i totonu o lo’u fa’ato’aga.  Ma e ‘ese’ese foi totogi.  E pule lava outou, po o le fea galuega e tou te fia galulue ai.  Ae o le galuega muamua, e manaomia se tasi e fa’ailoa i a’u moa le taimi ua saunia ai a latou mea’ai, ma o le totogi e $3,000 i le masina.  O le galuega lona lua, o lo’o manaomia seisi e na te fofo’eina ma fa’amama a’u Fiu, ma e $5,000 le totogi o lea galuega.  O le galuega lona tolu, o lo’o manaomia seisi e alu e tuli ‘ese ia pili lea ua fai ma fa’asoesa i totonu o lo’u fa’atoaga.  E $4,000 le totogi i le masina.  Ma le galuega mulimuli, e na’o le $250 i le masina.  Ua ou manaomia seisi e pese ma siva mo a’u ‘Oti.”

E le’i uma lelei mai le faamatalaga a le faifaato’aga, ae oso atu le mogamoga muamua ma faapea atu, “Aumai ma a’u le galuega e $5,000 lona totogi.  Lea o le a ou alu atu e fisi ma faamama lelei au Fiu.”

Ae oso mai le mogamoga lona lua ma fai mai, “Aumai ma a’u le galuega e $4,000 lona totogi.  O lea ua ou sauni ou te alu atu e tuli ‘ese ia pili na e fa’asoesa i lou faatoaga.”

Na fai si umi o tu le mogamoga lona tolu ma tau mafaufau.  Ona ia faapea mai lea, “Aumai ia te a’u le galuega na e na’o le $250 lona totogi.  E mafai ona ou pese ma faafiafia mo oe.”

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Compensation for communities affected by the grounding of the New Zealand Navy vessel HMNZS Manawanui will be confirmed once the national budget is passed, the Samoan government says.

Monday marked one year since the Manawanui ran aground and sank off the south coast of Upolu.

On the anniversary, New Zealand announced it had responded to a request from Samoa regarding the maritime disaster, with a payment of NZ$6 million — equivalent to around 10 million Samoan talā — to compensate communities in the Safata district, whose livelihoods were affected by the vessel sinking on the Tafitoala Reef.

Since the sinking of the Manawanui, Samoa&#39;s Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) has been leading the local government&#39;s response and liasing with affected communities.

In an email responding to questions from RNZ Pacific, after New Zealand&#39;s funding announcement, MWTI chief executive Fui Tupai Mau Simanu said this work is ongoing.

&#34;The next step is for us to meet with the community again. We are planning to have a consultation in mid-October as officials from NZ Navy want to join us.&#34;

He said compensation will be the main topic of discussion.

&#34;Process of compensation has not been decided yet but a couple of options have been suggested. One of the main items on the agenda when meeting the community is to discuss and agree on the process. Once the budget is approved the money will be available for distribution.&#34;

Fui also said the government is working with New Zealand to secure further funding.

&#34;The Government of Samoa is currently in the process of negotiating additional funds from the Government of New Zealand that will focus on the recovery and rehabilitation of the affected ecosystem.&#34;

The ill-fated Manawanui, a hydrographic and diving support vessel, was on deployment in Samoa as part of the security being provided for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last year.

King Charles&#39; accommodation for the international event is situated on the same coastline not far from where the wreck of the Manawanui lies.

All crew were safely evacuated from the doomed vessel, but the incident damaged approximately 5000 square metres of coral reef and spilled around 200,000 litres of diesel into the ocean affecting coastal fishing grounds, and forcing locals to have to travel to nearby districts, such as Siumu, to fish at considerable added expense.

Since then elders of the affected communities have been very vocal, demanding fair compensation and insisting the Manawanui wreck be removed from their reef despite the Samoa government declaring it will remain where it lies.

Foreign Minister Winston Peters says the payment this week was in response to a direct request from the Government of Samoa.

&#34;We have responded to the government of Samoa&#39;s request in full and with good faith. We have always said we will do the right thing,&#34; Peters says.

&#34;We recognize the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.&#34;

Peters said New Zealand continues to work with Samoa on decisions around the ship and its future.

Samoa&#39;s parliament recently held its first sitting since the general election, during which the first reading of the national budget was tabled.

Samoan Minister for Finance Mulipola Anarosa Molioo Ale thanked the New Zealand government &#34;for this very generous donation and other help yet to come&#34;.

Samoa&#39;s parliament is expected to reconvene next week to continue deliberations, including passing the budget that will allocate funds for Manawanui compensation.

\[O le a le lomia e le Lali ia suafa o i latou na a’afia ma molia i lenei mataupu, aua le puipuiga o le fanau\]

Ina ua o’o atu leoleo i le auala e latalata i le fale o le aiga sa tupu ai le fa’alavelave, na va’aia ia ni tamaiti se to’alua, o tamomo’e atu aga’i i le taavale a leoleo, a’o tuliloaina mai e se tamaloa fa’asua’ava.  Sa fa’atuina e leoleo le taavale ma lavea’i ia le fanau, ae ave faapagotaina le tamaloa se tuliloaina maia i la’ua.

        </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Radio NZ Pacific —</em> Reubenson and Martin Fugui have been boating around their island village their entire lives, but they'd never seen anything like this before.</p>
        <p>The cousins were on their usual morning boat run on Saturday to get supplies from a local market when they spotted it.</p>
        <p>"It was an object floating [in the water]," Reubenson told the ABC from his village, Fourau, in Solomon Islands' Malaita province.</p>
        <p>"We were scared at first, because we'd never seen a vessel [like this] in our lives."</p>
        <p>Isolated and in deep water, they were hesitant at first to board the "strange-looking" boat and waited for half an hour for any sign of life before they were convinced it was safe.</p>
        <p>As they got closer, they saw its engines were missing, and Reubenson, the older of the two, told Martin to climb aboard to find out what was inside.</p>
        <p>"There was a single cabin and it still had its steering wheel," Martin said.</p>
        <p>Other than that, the engines were gone and it was just filled with empty plastic water bottles.</p>
        <p>The cousins towed the strange 17m-long vessel back to their village.</p>
        <p>Later, on closer inspection, they discovered internal piping for the fuel system.</p>
        <p>"They had written on them 'Made in Colombia, 2024,'" Reubenson said.</p>
        <p>They didn't know it until they later reported it to police, but they had discovered a narco sub — the third such vessel found in Solomon Islands' waters over the past year.</p>
        <p>The Pacific's Growing Drug Problem</p>
        <p>Narco subs are ocean-going, semi-submersible or fully-submersible vessels, often custom-built by drug cartels to transfer huge amounts of product across oceans.</p>
        <p>The practice has been going on in the Americas for decades, but the newer vessels are often fully submersible in order to reduce detection by authorities' radar or sonar systems.</p>
        <p>This month, the Trump administration has started its own war on similar-type boats, bombing vessels it says were filled with drugs bound for the United States.</p>
        <p>But in the Pacific and Solomon Islands, these types of discoveries are new.</p>
        <p>Last year, a local doctor found the first narco sub in the region near Solomon Islands' isolated Ontong Java Atoll, and has now turned the 25m-long vessel into his personal boat.</p>
        <p>Local investigative team In-depth Solomons reported that an Ecuadorian voter ID card was found on board.</p>
        <p>And in July, the second narco sub, this one 21m long, was discovered floating in the ocean by a local MP near Ramos Island, which is about 75km north-west of the latest discovery.</p>
        <p>All three of the vessels found in Solomon Islands had no drugs on board, with experts saying the vessels are often abandoned after a successful mission.</p>
        <p>Local Police say they are investigating all three, and it is unclear whether these vessels drifted the 10,000km from South America, or they transferred the drugs closer to Solomon Islands.</p>
        <p>But the discoveries come as the Pacific grapples with a growing drug problem, with a string of recent busts highlighting how cartels are increasingly using the sparse and largely un-policed Pacific Islands as a transit point onto the more lucrative Australian and New Zealand markets — what experts call the "cash cows".</p>
        <p>"[These discoveries] definitely show a new trend being used by trans-criminal syndicates in South America and Mexico, to traffic drugs to Australia and New Zealand, the 'cash cows' in the region," transnational crime expert Jose Sousa-Santos told RNZ.</p>
        <p>"These vessels operate through the Pacific Islands or from island to island from a drop-off mothership to, say, the Solomon Islands.</p>
        <p>"Then a LPV (narco sub) is used to move to another island country to refuel, before moving towards the target markets of Australia and New Zealand."</p>
        <p>'Power Drug' Hits Solomon Islands</p>
        <p>The drug importation issue has become a new and increasing problem in the Pacific Islands, hitting communities in Tonga, Fiji, Samoa and PNG.</p>
        <p>Fiji, in particular, is grappling with a spike in HIV on the back of increased meth use in the country, with users sharing needles in what's known as “bluetoothing”.</p>
        <p>But in Solomon Islands, it is so new that authorities don't even have legislation to prohibit possession of methamphetamine, which locals are calling "the power drug".</p>
        <p>And local police say the discovery is beyond the current capabilities of law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele told local media this week that the government was working urgently to address the legal gaps, aiming to modernize outdated laws to ensure stronger measures against those in the production and distribution of illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>"As we speak the attorney general's chambers, together with other stakeholders including the police, are looking at these gaps," he said.</p>
        <p>"This is our priority, and we want to quickly bring the necessary amendments to parliament — hopefully by the end of this year, or if not, during the first session next year."</p>
        <p>Local lawyer and prosecutor Steward Tonowane said the discoveries of the narco subs and the lack of legislation in Solomon Islands were a "serious concern".</p>
        <p>"Reminds me of the saying: when there's smoke, there's fire," he said.</p>
        <p>"There must be a deliberate orchestrated operation that is happening.</p>
        <p>"And we must make amendments and prepare ourselves [so] that we may be able to attend to this issue."</p>
        <p>Back in Fourau village, the narco sub has become a major talking point in the community, with everyone in the community coming to check it out.</p>
        <p>Yet, local police have warned "the good citizens of Solomon Islands" to call police first in such encounters.</p>
        <p>"This is for the police to come and properly check to make sure the boat is safe," the police told the ABC in a statement.</p>
        <p>But for Reubenson, now that the narco sub has been abandoned, it's a matter of finders keepers.</p>
        <p>"If I find this thing that no one owns, then obviously it means I'm the new owner."</p>

_Radio NZ Pacific —_ Reubenson and Martin Fugui have been boating around their island village their entire lives, but they&#39;d never seen anything like this before.

The cousins were on their usual morning boat run on Saturday to get supplies from a local market when they spotted it.

&#34;It was an object floating \[in the water\],&#34; Reubenson told the ABC from his village, Fourau, in Solomon Islands&#39; Malaita province.

&#34;We were scared at first, because we&#39;d never seen a vessel \[like this\] in our lives.&#34;

Isolated and in deep water, they were hesitant at first to board the &#34;strange-looking&#34; boat and waited for half an hour for any sign of life before they were convinced it was safe.

As they got closer, they saw its engines were missing, and Reubenson, the older of the two, told Martin to climb aboard to find out what was inside.

&#34;There was a single cabin and it still had its steering wheel,&#34; Martin said.

Other than that, the engines were gone and it was just filled with empty plastic water bottles.

The cousins towed the strange 17m-long vessel back to their village.

Later, on closer inspection, they discovered internal piping for the fuel system.

&#34;They had written on them &#39;Made in Colombia, 2024,&#39;&#34; Reubenson said.

They didn&#39;t know it until they later reported it to police, but they had discovered a narco sub — the third such vessel found in Solomon Islands&#39; waters over the past year.

The Pacific&#39;s Growing Drug Problem

Narco subs are ocean-going, semi-submersible or fully-submersible vessels, often custom-built by drug cartels to transfer huge amounts of product across oceans.

The practice has been going on in the Americas for decades, but the newer vessels are often fully submersible in order to reduce detection by authorities&#39; radar or sonar systems.

This month, the Trump administration has started its own war on similar-type boats, bombing vessels it says were filled with drugs bound for the United States.

But in the Pacific and Solomon Islands, these types of discoveries are new.

Last year, a local doctor found the first narco sub in the region near Solomon Islands&#39; isolated Ontong Java Atoll, and has now turned the 25m-long vessel into his personal boat.

Local investigative team In-depth Solomons reported that an Ecuadorian voter ID card was found on board.

And in July, the second narco sub, this one 21m long, was discovered floating in the ocean by a local MP near Ramos Island, which is about 75km north-west of the latest discovery.

All three of the vessels found in Solomon Islands had no drugs on board, with experts saying the vessels are often abandoned after a successful mission.

Local Police say they are investigating all three, and it is unclear whether these vessels drifted the 10,000km from South America, or they transferred the drugs closer to Solomon Islands.

But the discoveries come as the Pacific grapples with a growing drug problem, with a string of recent busts highlighting how cartels are increasingly using the sparse and largely un-policed Pacific Islands as a transit point onto the more lucrative Australian and New Zealand markets — what experts call the &#34;cash cows&#34;.

&#34;\[These discoveries\] definitely show a new trend being used by trans-criminal syndicates in South America and Mexico, to traffic drugs to Australia and New Zealand, the &#39;cash cows&#39; in the region,&#34; transnational crime expert Jose Sousa-Santos told RNZ.

&#34;These vessels operate through the Pacific Islands or from island to island from a drop-off mothership to, say, the Solomon Islands.

&#34;Then a LPV (narco sub) is used to move to another island country to refuel, before moving towards the target markets of Australia and New Zealand.&#34;

&#39;Power Drug&#39; Hits Solomon Islands

The drug importation issue has become a new and increasing problem in the Pacific Islands, hitting communities in Tonga, Fiji, Samoa and PNG.

Fiji, in particular, is grappling with a spike in HIV on the back of increased meth use in the country, with users sharing needles in what&#39;s known as “bluetoothing”.

But in Solomon Islands, it is so new that authorities don&#39;t even have legislation to prohibit possession of methamphetamine, which locals are calling &#34;the power drug&#34;.

And local police say the discovery is beyond the current capabilities of law enforcement.

Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele told local media this week that the government was working urgently to address the legal gaps, aiming to modernize outdated laws to ensure stronger measures against those in the production and distribution of illegal drugs.

&#34;As we speak the attorney general&#39;s chambers, together with other stakeholders including the police, are looking at these gaps,&#34; he said.

&#34;This is our priority, and we want to quickly bring the necessary amendments to parliament — hopefully by the end of this year, or if not, during the first session next year.&#34;

Local lawyer and prosecutor Steward Tonowane said the discoveries of the narco subs and the lack of legislation in Solomon Islands were a &#34;serious concern&#34;.

&#34;Reminds me of the saying: when there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire,&#34; he said.

&#34;There must be a deliberate orchestrated operation that is happening.

&#34;And we must make amendments and prepare ourselves \[so\] that we may be able to attend to this issue.&#34;

Back in Fourau village, the narco sub has become a major talking point in the community, with everyone in the community coming to check it out.

Yet, local police have warned &#34;the good citizens of Solomon Islands&#34; to call police first in such encounters.

&#34;This is for the police to come and properly check to make sure the boat is safe,&#34; the police told the ABC in a statement.

But for Reubenson, now that the narco sub has been abandoned, it&#39;s a matter of finders keepers.

&#34;If I find this thing that no one owns, then obviously it means I&#39;m the new owner.&#34;

The PNG Prime Minister’s XIII will debut Gairo Voro at five-eighth this Sunday, a selection made after veteran Kyle Laybutt was unexpectedly ruled unavailable for his planned farewell match. The team is hyper-focused on securing a historic first-ever win against their Australian counterparts during PNG’s 50th year of independence.

Kumuls coach Jason Demetriou confirmed the key change in the spine, noting that the desire for a victory, coupled with the need for preparation ahead of the Rugby League World Cup, has shaped the squad.

Ma sa ia ta’ua le tele o se avanoa mo tulaga o le tamaoaiga, pe afai e mafai ona galulue faatasi Samoa ma Amerika Samoa.

**FAAMANINO O LE MATAUPU I FA’ATO’AGA MANU PAPALAGI**

Sa faapea foi ona saunoa le Palemia o Samoa i le mataupu sa va va o ai Samoa e lua, i le fanua e 400 eka i Togitogiga, lea sa tu’ua’ia ai o ia, i le ofoina atu i le malo o Amerika Samoa, e fai ai se pa povi.  O lea mataupu sa tula’i mai i le fonotaga o le Atoa o Samoa lea sa faataunu’uina i Amerika Samoa, i le 2023.

Ae peitai, sa tula’i mai se faafitauli, ina ua molimau le susuga ia Solia Mutini, lea sa avea ma Faatonu o le Ofisa o Fa’ato’aga i lena vaitaimi, i luma o se iloiloga a le Senate, ia le fa’ameaalofaina mai e le malo o Samoa ia se fanua e 400 eka i Togitogiga, mo se poloketi o se faato’aga povi, e faamautu ai le puipuiga o sapalai mea’ai mo Amerika Samoa.

O lea molimau sa faapea ona saunoa ai le ta’ita’i o le Itu Agai a le malo o Samoa, le afioga Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi ma ia fa’atula’i ai lenei mataupu i totonu o le Palemene.  Ma sa fa’asea ai Tuilaepa i le malo, ona o le leai o se fa’amalamalamaga na tu’uina atu e tusa ai ma lea fuafuaga, ae o lo’o a’afia ai se vaega tele o fanua.

I lena taimi, sa te’ena ai e le Afioga ia Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, lea sa avea ma Palemia, ia le iai o se maliliega po o se lisi, ma ia faapea mai ai, o ni faamatalaga pepelo.

O le vaiaso ua tuanai, sa fa’amanino mai ai e le Afioga Laaulialemalietoa lea mataupu e faapea, e ui ina sa talanoaina ia ni poloketi faifa’atasi mo fa’atoaga, ae peitai, ua na’o ni manatu e fa’asaga i le iloiloina o auala e mafai ai ona galulue fa’atasi malo e lua, ina ia fa’aitiitia ai le fa’alagolago i ‘a’ano o manu fasi, mai atunu’u i fafo.

Ma na saunoa foi La’auli, o le mafuaaga lea na foa’i mai ai e Samoa ia ni povi se 5, o ni mamoe se 5 ma faisua e 500, e amatamata ai se poloketi i Amerika Samoa, ma lona sini autu, ia fa’amalosia ai puipuiga o sapalai taumafa.

**FANUA MANA’OMIA ONA GALUEA’IINA**

O seisi mataupu na saunoa ai le Palemia, o le mana’omia lea ona fa’aaoga pe galuea’iina le fanua a Samoa lea o lo’o i Amerika Samoa, lea sa maua e Samoa mai i le fonotaga a Samoa na lua, i le tausaga e 2012.  Ae peitai, ua atoa le 13 tausaga, e le’i galuea’iina lava lea fanua, ae o lo’o fa’aauau pea ona nofo totogi le ofisa a le Konesula a Samoa, i fale totogi.

Sa saunoa le Afioga La’aulialemalietoa, ua tatau ona atina’eina lenei fanua, e le gata mo le ofisa o le Konesula ae faapea foi ni fale e mafai ona nonofo ai tagata Samoa, ia o lo’o faigaluega i totonu o Amerika Samoa, e pei o tagata faigaluega a le StarKist.

O le tausaga ua tuanai, sa tu’uina atu ai e Samoa ia se fanua i le Taumeasina, i Moata’a mo le malo o Amerika Samoa, e fausia ai ana ofisa i Apia, e fa’aalia ai le agaga o le galulue faatasi i le va o atunu’u e lua.

O le aso 21 o Setema, na tu’ua ai e le afioga i le Palemia ia Samoa mo si’iga gasegase i Niu Sila.  O lana malaga sa totogi atoa e lona lava aiga, talu ai tulaga sa iai le tala o le tupe a le malo, i lena vaitaimi.

\[Ua le lomia e le Lali ia suafa o i latou na a’afia ma molia i lenei mataupu, aua le puiipuiga o fanau iti.\]

E tusa ai ma fa’amaumauga a le faamasinoga, sa agai atu leoleo i le nofoaga na tupu ai le faalavelave ma talatalanoa ma le tina na a’afia faapea lona tina (molimau)

Ina ua mae’a lea, ona taumafai lea o leoleo e saili le na molia, ae peitai, sa le’i mauaina o ia.  Na fautuaina e leoleo ia le tina na a’afia, ina ia toe vala’au atu le ofisa a leoleo, pe a toe fo’i ane le na molia, i le fale.

O le aoauli o le aso lava lea e tasi, na toe maua ai e leoleo se valaau mai i le tina na a’afia, e fa’ailoa atu le toe fo’i atu o le tama a lona to’alua, i le fale.  Ma o le mea lea na toe agai atu ai leoleo i le fale, ma ave faapagotaina le na molia, ma aveina atu o ia i le ofisa o leoleo mo le fa’ataunu’uina o a latou su’esu’ega.

        </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-text field-label-inlinec clearfix field-label-inline"><div class="field-label">By&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Grace Tinetali-Fiavaai, RNZ Pacific journalist</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's longest-serving leader Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi says his time in parliament is drawing to a close after more than four decades in politics.</p>
        <p>"This is my last term, to the end of this term, not necessarily the leadership, but to continue," he told RNZ Pacific.</p>
        <p>A former pupil of St Paul's College in Auckland, Tuilaepa went on to earn a Master's degree in Commerce from the University of Auckland before returning to Samoa to begin his career in government.</p>
        <p>He first entered parliament in 1981, representing Lepā and rose through the ranks of the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) becoming prime minister in 1998, a role he held for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>The 80-year-old, who has now lost two consecutive elections at the helm of the HRPP, said he only stayed on to ensure the party continued to enjoy the benefit of his own contribution.</p>
        <p>"I have reached that stage where, really, I should retire," he said.</p>
        <p>Tuilaepa's tenure as prime minister of Samoa from 1998 to 2021 makes him the Pacific's longest-serving democratic leader.</p>
        <p>Other Pacific leaders with over a decade in power include the late Sir Michael Somare of Papua New Guinea, Fiji's Frank Bainimarama and the late Albert Henry of the Cook Islands.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on his political career, Tuilaepa acknowledged both the achievements and the challenges.</p>
        <p>Asked about the highlights, he said there were "so many of them" from the delivery of long-term infrastructure projects to introducing policies and legislation to improve gender equality in Samoa.</p>
        <p>"There are many other things that we did, like, for instance, lowering the cost of family events, we normally require goods like tinned fish and reduce the sizes from 48 to now about eight, reducing the cost of faalavelave.</p>
        <p>"I can't just give one highlight because there were so many of them," he said.</p>
        <p>During his tenure Tuilaepa also oversaw some significant changes which drew international attention, including switching the side of the road Samoans drive on from right to left, changing Samoa's timezone to better align with key trading partners in Australia and New Zealand and Samoa's transition to a parliamentary republic in 2007.</p>
        <p>"Others were the building of high-rise buildings through assistance from our partners.</p>
        <p>"As well as the promotion of gender equality, not only through issues relating to the support for women issues in the rite nations, but also passing laws to ensure that not less that's the 10 percent or six women to enter Parliament," he said.</p>
        <p>Tuilaepa also spoke about his efforts to improve education, culture and social development in Samoa.</p>
        <p>"There are so many on top of that; promoting the replating of our fine matts to the perfection that it was in the olden days, not the rubbish that we used to have, as well as education, the setting up of our own university, as well as for government to meet school fees for children in [primary schools]. We also moved to begin from next year, if we were elected, paying for university education fees, as well as paying for the teachers for private schools."</p>
        <p>The HRPP's decades-long hold on power ended in a narrow defeat at the hands of the FAST Party in the 2021 general election.</p>
        <p>In 2020, a year before that election, Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Fosi Schmidt, Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Leatinuu Wayne Fong, Olo Vaai fell out with Tuilaepa after breaking ranks to vote against three controversial government bills the Judicature Bill 2020, Lands and Titles Bill 2020, and the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020.</p>
        <p>One-by-one each of them left HRPP with Laaulialemalietoa, whose constituency advised him to leave the party, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/417909/former-cabinet-minister-quits-samoa-s-ruling-party">resigning first</a> and announcing he would be forming a new political party in the 2021 election.</p>
        <p>Thus the FAST party came into being, consolidating with two existing opposition parties, and one by one all of the other three former HRPP members joined, with Fiame <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/425809/samoa-s-deputy-prime-minister-quits-cabinet-over-controversial-bills">who was deputy prime minister at the time</a> being the last to do so.</p>
        <p>From there, FAST went on to win an historic first election with Fiame becoming prime minister.</p>
        <p>A split in the party resulted in Fiame's government collapsing with a year still to go in her tenure but the FAST party emerged from the ensuing early election with an even bigger mandate to lead than in 2021 with Laaulialemalietoa now prime minister of Samoa.</p>
        <p>When asked about the lowest point in his political career Tuilaepa said there was only the one.</p>
        <p>"Losing an election, not so much that I lost the leadership as well, but more for the people that depend so much on us to ensure that we inject the rule of law, that we follow the rule of law and good covenant principles of transparency and accountability.</p>
        <p>"As it is now we don't have that anymore, " Tuilaepa said.</p>

By

Grace Tinetali-Fiavaai, RNZ Pacific journalist

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Samoa&#39;s longest-serving leader Tuilaepa Sa&#39;ilele Malielegaoi says his time in parliament is drawing to a close after more than four decades in politics.

&#34;This is my last term, to the end of this term, not necessarily the leadership, but to continue,&#34; he told RNZ Pacific.

A former pupil of St Paul&#39;s College in Auckland, Tuilaepa went on to earn a Master&#39;s degree in Commerce from the University of Auckland before returning to Samoa to begin his career in government.

He first entered parliament in 1981, representing Lepā and rose through the ranks of the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) becoming prime minister in 1998, a role he held for more than 20 years.

The 80-year-old, who has now lost two consecutive elections at the helm of the HRPP, said he only stayed on to ensure the party continued to enjoy the benefit of his own contribution.

&#34;I have reached that stage where, really, I should retire,&#34; he said.

Tuilaepa&#39;s tenure as prime minister of Samoa from 1998 to 2021 makes him the Pacific&#39;s longest-serving democratic leader.

Other Pacific leaders with over a decade in power include the late Sir Michael Somare of Papua New Guinea, Fiji&#39;s Frank Bainimarama and the late Albert Henry of the Cook Islands.

Reflecting on his political career, Tuilaepa acknowledged both the achievements and the challenges.

Asked about the highlights, he said there were &#34;so many of them&#34; from the delivery of long-term infrastructure projects to introducing policies and legislation to improve gender equality in Samoa.

&#34;There are many other things that we did, like, for instance, lowering the cost of family events, we normally require goods like tinned fish and reduce the sizes from 48 to now about eight, reducing the cost of faalavelave.

&#34;I can&#39;t just give one highlight because there were so many of them,&#34; he said.

During his tenure Tuilaepa also oversaw some significant changes which drew international attention, including switching the side of the road Samoans drive on from right to left, changing Samoa&#39;s timezone to better align with key trading partners in Australia and New Zealand and Samoa&#39;s transition to a parliamentary republic in 2007.

&#34;Others were the building of high-rise buildings through assistance from our partners.

&#34;As well as the promotion of gender equality, not only through issues relating to the support for women issues in the rite nations, but also passing laws to ensure that not less that&#39;s the 10 percent or six women to enter Parliament,&#34; he said.

Tuilaepa also spoke about his efforts to improve education, culture and social development in Samoa.

&#34;There are so many on top of that; promoting the replating of our fine matts to the perfection that it was in the olden days, not the rubbish that we used to have, as well as education, the setting up of our own university, as well as for government to meet school fees for children in \[primary schools\]. We also moved to begin from next year, if we were elected, paying for university education fees, as well as paying for the teachers for private schools.&#34;

The HRPP&#39;s decades-long hold on power ended in a narrow defeat at the hands of the FAST Party in the 2021 general election.

In 2020, a year before that election, Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Fosi Schmidt, Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Leatinuu Wayne Fong, Olo Vaai fell out with Tuilaepa after breaking ranks to vote against three controversial government bills the Judicature Bill 2020, Lands and Titles Bill 2020, and the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020.

One-by-one each of them left HRPP with Laaulialemalietoa, whose constituency advised him to leave the party, [resigning first](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/417909/former-cabinet-minister-quits-samoa-s-ruling-party) and announcing he would be forming a new political party in the 2021 election.

Thus the FAST party came into being, consolidating with two existing opposition parties, and one by one all of the other three former HRPP members joined, with Fiame [who was deputy prime minister at the time](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/425809/samoa-s-deputy-prime-minister-quits-cabinet-over-controversial-bills) being the last to do so.

From there, FAST went on to win an historic first election with Fiame becoming prime minister.

A split in the party resulted in Fiame&#39;s government collapsing with a year still to go in her tenure but the FAST party emerged from the ensuing early election with an even bigger mandate to lead than in 2021 with Laaulialemalietoa now prime minister of Samoa.

When asked about the lowest point in his political career Tuilaepa said there was only the one.

&#34;Losing an election, not so much that I lost the leadership as well, but more for the people that depend so much on us to ensure that we inject the rule of law, that we follow the rule of law and good covenant principles of transparency and accountability.

&#34;As it is now we don&#39;t have that anymore, &#34; Tuilaepa said.

**TU’UA’IA SE ALII I LONA SAUAINA O SANA UO TEINE I SE SELEULU**

O le po o Aukuso 25, 2025, na valaau atu ai se alii i le ofisa a leoleo i Tafuna, e ripotia se tamaitai na oso mai i fafo o se taavale, ae o lo’o alu le taavale i luga o le alatele, ma e foliga mai na sauaina e se tasi le tamaitai, i se a’upega ma’ai.

Sa agai atu leoleo e tali le valaau mo se fesoasoani ma maua atu ai le tamaitai na a’afia ma le alii na valaau mai i le ofisa a leoleo, e latalata i le faleoloa a Misa i Iliili.  Na va’aia le ‘etu’etu o le vae a le tamaitai na a’afia, ae o lo’o tagi o ia i le tiga.  E e gata i lea, sa molimauina foi ni manu’a i lona ‘auvae, i ona lima ma lona vae tauagavale.

Na fa’afeso’ota’i e leoleo ia le vaega a le EMS ma aveina atu ai le tamaitai na a’afia i le falema’i tele a le malo, i Faga’alu.

Sa faatalanoaina e leoleo ia le alii na valaau i le ofisa a leoleo ma sa faamatalaina e lea alii, lona lagonaina o se tamaitai o tagi i tua atu o le fale faatali pasi, a’o ia savalivali atu i le latou fale.  Ma na alu atu e va’a, ma ia maua atu ai le tamaitai na a’afia, o faalagolago i le sima o le fale faatali, ma sa ia va’aia le toto o itu tino o le tamaitai.  Sa talosaga mai le tamaitai i le alii na valaau i leoleo, ina ia fa’afeso’ota’i se taavale a le EMS.

Na fa’ailoa atu e le alii na valaau i le ofisa a leoleo, sa ta’u atu e le tamaitai na a’afia, le sauaina o ia e lona to’alua, ma tia’i i tafatafa o le alatele.

O le susuga ia Tanu Taimaaiono lea sa molia i lenei faalavelave ma sa fa’ailoa atu i leoleo, o lo’o ia faafoeina se pikiapu lanu uliuli.  O lea na taumafai ai leoleo e saili le taavale a le na molia, i luga o le alatele, ae sa maua atu o tu i luma o se fale ta lavalava, i Nu’uuli.

Sa agai atu iai leoleo, ma avefaapagotaina Tanu (le na molia) i le ofisa a leoleo, i Tafuna, mo le fa’aauauina o a latou su’esu’ega.  Na va’aia e leoleo ia le pisia o le faitotoa i le itu o le pasese, i le toto ma se seleulu, o lo’o ta’atia i lalo.

Ina ua fa’atalanoaina e leoleo ia Tanu (le na molia), i le ofisa a leoleo, sa ia te’ena lona faia o se tulaga i lana uo teine (le tamaitai na a’afia).  Ae sa ia ta’ua e faapea, a’o la i luga o le auala, sa mana’o le tamaitai na a’afia, e pule i lona ola, ae sa fa’aauau pea ona faafoe lana taavale.

Sa ta’ua foi e Tanu (le na molia) na amata e lana uo teine (tamaitai na a’afia) ia se la tauga’upu ae na musu e auai ai.  Ma sa iai foi se tagata e suafa ia Lualima Taliu, i totonu o le taavale, ina ua amata ona fa’avesivesi atu lana uo teine (tamaitai na aafia).

A’o fa’agasolo le fa’atalanoaga o le na molia, sa fa’aauau ona ia fa’asea e tusa ai ma lona toto maualuga ma o lea na toe vala’au ai le vaega a le EMS mo se togafitiga, ma na ioe foi le na molia, e aveo ia i le falemai.

O se taimi mulimuli ane, na agai atu ai leoleo i le falemai, e faatalanoaina le tamaitai na a’afia, ona sa taofia o ia i le falemai mo le togafitiga o ona manu’a.

E tusa ai ma le faamatalaga a le tamaitai na a’afia, sa faia se la tauga’upu ma le na molia, i totonu o le taavale, a’o la iai i luga o le alatele.  Ma ina ua fa’aauau ona fa’ateteleina le la tauga’upu, sa ia tago i le tu’i le alii na molia, ma fa’aauau ai lava le la fusuga i le tu’i atu ma tu’i mai ma o’o ai lava ina tui o ia i se seleulu.

O le tui mulimuli na tau i lona tulivae taumatau, ma o iina sa ia se’i ese ai le seleulu mai lona tui, ma ia puna ai loa i fafo mai i le taavale.  Ae na fa’aauau pea ona alu le taavale.  Sa ta’ua e le tamaitai na a’afia, lona savali atu i le fale faatali pasi, a’o lavatoto lona tino ma le tiga ma ia talosagaina ai le alii lea na alu atu, e valaau ia le EMS.

Sa ta’ua foi e le tamaitai na a’afia, sa na’o la’ua ma le na molia, sa i totonu o le taavale.

O se taimi mulimuli ane, na mafai ona fa’atalanoaina ai e leoleo ia le susuga ia Lualima Taliu, lea sa ta’ua e le na molia, na i totonu o le taavale i le taimi na tupu ai le faalavelave.  E tusa ai ma le faamatalaga a Lualima, o ia sa i Nu’uuli, i le afiafi atoa, e le’i faatasi ma le na molia.

Ma sa ta’ua e Lualima, e savali atu i luma o le fale ta lavalava, o la e paka mai ai le taavale a le na molia.  Ma sa iai iina, ina ua taunu’u leoleo ma ave faapagota ia le na molia, ma e leai sona malamalama’aga i le faalavelave na tupu, i le va o Tanu (le na molia) ma lana uo teine (tamaitai na a’afia).

Sa ta’ua foi e Lualima, ia lona le malamalama i le mafua’aga na ta’u ai e Tanu (le na molia) ia lona igoa i leoleo, ae e le’i iai i le taimi na tupu ai le faalavelave.

Ina ua te’a i tua ia le na molia, mai i le falemai, sa aveina atu loa o ia i le to’ese i Tafuna, e faatalitali ai lona faamasinoga.

Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — French authorities in New Caledonia are investigating after a sea turtle was found tied to a tree.

The female turtle, about 25-30 years-old, was bound in rope in the Koutio mangrove swamp in Dumbéa and rescued on 14 September.

An Aquarium des Lagons spokesperson said she had deep cuts on her right swim leg from being tied up.

Despite this, she is doing well and is now under the care of the aquarium in Noumea.

If she keeps improving, she could be released in the next few weeks.

Head of the Aquariology and Maintenance Department at the Aquarium des Lagons told local media that the loggerhead turtle is a protected species, along with the green turtle and the hawksbill turtle.

Unlike the green turtle, it is not eaten locally.

Sylvain Govan said there is no doubt that this is &#34;poaching&#34;.

&#34;I think the person who grabbed it and tied it up there, had an idea in the back of his head. Either eat it or sell it to make money,&#34; she told Nouvelle-Calédonie La Première.

**DEFENSE AGREEMENT**

A newly signed defense agreement between the governments of Fiji and Solomon Islands will allow Fijian troops into Honiara during national emergencies.

It said the level of awareness is not matching the pace at which it gets more complex.

The Council&#39;s Ziyad Parvez told fijivillage.com that fraudsters are not above using the latest technology to execute the scams.

**MAN JAILED FOR RAPING DAUGHTER**

A man in Samoa was sentenced last week to 17 years&#39; imprisonment after he was convicted of seven incidents of sexual violation by way of rape and one representative charge of five incidents of incest.

The victim is the accused&#39;s biological daughter.

The accused, through his counsel, accepted the amended summary of facts dated 21 August 2025.

The accused&#39;s sexual abuse of his daughter began sometime between April 01 and May 31, 2021 following the general elections. The victim was 12 years old.

The accused’s sexual abuse of his daughter came to light when an aunt of the victim went to the home to visit the victim and her siblings and found the accused sleeping with the victim “like a couple”. The victim became pregnant but miscarried after a few months.

During sentencing, Justice Leiataualesa Darryl Clarke told the defendant that he was supposed to protect the victim from harm as her biological father.

&#34;No words can ever sufficiently condemn what you did to your daughter. You were duty-bound to protect her from harm, yet you were the perpetrator of the greatest betrayal any daughter could suffer: sexual abuse by her own father.&#34;

**GUAM BANS MANGO IMPORTS**

Guam has temporarily banned mango imports from the Northern Marianas, after an invasive insect was discovered on Saipan.

Researchers confirmed the mango fruit borer at the CNMI&#39;s Division of Agriculture compound in Kagman.

Kuam News reports Division of Agriculture director Jack Ogumoro saying the discovery was made earlier this year when visiting scientists sampled infected mangoes.

Invasive species coordinator Natasha Tomakane says the ban is a precautionary measure to protect regional agriculture.

**PNG SHORTWAVE**

The head of Papua New Guinea&#39;s national broadcaster is looking for ways to bolster the station&#39;s radio broadcast capability.

Kora Nou has been in Aotearoa inspecting Radio New Zealand Pacific&#39;s shortwave service.

It broadcasts right across the Pacific, providing lifeline utility support on request when natural disasters strike.

Nou said with a government mandate to have full coverage across PNG, he&#39;s looking for the right solution.

&#34;So the shortwave we want to build won&#39;t be analogue shortwave but we are thinking of digital shortwave,&#34; he said.

&#34;There is a lot of work to be done still but we are happy to come here to New Zealand to work with our friends here, and whatever we decide to build it will be for the good of the staff at NBC and for the good of the people of Papua New Guinea.&#34;

NBC&#39;s own shortwave service closed more than 20 years ago.

A’o fa’agasolo le iloiloga a le Seante i le aso Tofi o le vaiaso ua mavae, sa faamamafaina ai e le Afioga i le Senatoa Magalei Logovi’i, o ia foi o le sui Peresetene o le Senate, ia le pule ua tu’uina i le Tausitupe, i lalo o le tulafono.   Ma na ia fa’amanino ai le iai i le Tausitupe o le malosiaga, e faataga ai kamupani ma tagata ta’ito’atasi, ona togitogi a latou lafoga fa’ae’e, mo ta’avale ia o lo’o auina mai, i totonu o le teritori mai atunu’u i fafo.

O i latou na auai i lea iloiloga, na aofia ai le Tausitupe fa’aolioli ia Brett Butler, sui Tausitupe o Levi Reese ma le susuga ia Juliano Falaniko, lea o lo’o fa’auluulu iai le Ofisa o Tiute.

Sa auiliiliina e Magalei e faapea, mo pisinisi, e mana’omia ona totogi le 25% o lafoga fa’ae’e, ae mo le mamalu lautele, e tatau ona totogi le 10%, e fuafua lea i luga o le tau o le taavale.  Ma sa fa’alauiloa mai foi e Magalei, o le lisi lea o lo’o iai nei, o i latou e le’i mae’a ona totogi a latou lafoga fa’ae’e, na amata mai lava i le tausaga e 2017.  Ua fa’ailoa mai ai le mamao i tua o lafoga e le’i mae’a ona aoina.

Ae peitai, sa saunoa foi Magalei, e ui i lea fa’atagana mo le totogiina o lafoga, e le mafai ona tatalaina i tua ia taavale mai le Ofisa o Tiute, se’ia vagana ua mae’a ona totogi atoatoa lafoga.  Ma sa ia fa’aalia foi, o lea vaega o le tulafono, e tasi lava lona fa’auigaina.  Ma o lo’o ua iai faamaumauga o lo’o fa’amaonia ai le tatalaina i tua o nisi taavale, ae e le’i mae’a ona totogi atoa latou lafoga.

Sa saunoa le ulu o le ofisa o Tiute, ia Juliano Falaniko e faapea, o taavale ia na saunoa iai le afioga i Senatoa, sa tatalaina i tua, ae e le’i tula’i mai o ia i lona tofiga faaletaitai i totonu o le Ofisa o Tiute.  Ma na ia faamanino mai foi e faapea, o faaiuga e tusa ai ma le tatalaina i tua o taavale, e sau mai i le Tausitupe, ae le o le latou aufaigaluega, ma atonu o le mafua’aga lea o faafitauli, ia o lo’o ta’ua i totonu o le ripoti.

I le saunoaga a le Afioga i le Senatoa Togiola Tulafono, na ia faaleoina ai ni atugaluga i nisi o tulaga i le ripoti a le Ofisa o Tiute.  Aemaise ai lava le ripoti e faatatau i le lafoga mo se taavale (2019 Ford Ranger), e $3,209.  Na fesiligia ai e Togiola ia le sa’o o le auala na fa’aaogaina (valuation assessment), e maua ai le tau aofai o le lafoga mo lea taavale.

Sa fesiligia e Togiola ia le auala o lo’o fa’aaogaina e le Ofisa o Tiute, e saili ai le tau aofai o se taavale, mo tulaga tau lafoga.  Ma na fa’aleoina e Togiola sona talitonuga, i le fa’alagolago o le ofisa a le malo, i tau mai i ofisa va’a, ae le o le tau moni o lo’o fa’atauina ai se taavale.  Ma o se tulaga, ua talitonu le afioga i le Senatoa, e fa’aitiitia ai le aofa’i o lafoga fa’ae’e ma e ono o’o atu ai i soligatulafono.

E le gata i lea, sa taua e Togiola le tele o taavale o lo’o fa’aauau pea ona tatalaina i tua, ae e le’i mae’a ona totogi uma ia lafoga fa’ae’e, ma ua tele tausaga talu ona tupu lea tulaga.  Ma sa faapea ona faaleoina ai e Togiola sona popolega, i le le mataituina lelei e le Ofisa o Tupe a le malo, ia lenei tulaga.

E le gata i lea, sa faapea foi ona fia malamalama Togiola i le natura o maliliega o lo’o faia e le Ofisa o Tiute ma i latou o lo’o tau totogi a latou lafoga fa’ae’e.

Ina ua sauna mai Falaniko e tali mai i fesili a le Senatoa, sa faapea ona fa’atuina e le Peresetene o le Seante, le Tofa ia Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, ia se lafo, ina ia fa’aauauina lenei iloiloga na’o latou (sui faitulafono ma molimau ale malo), ina ia puipuia ai tagata ma pisinisi o le a talanoaina.

Na faapea ona lagolagoina lea lafo, e le Afioga i le Senatoa ia Gaoteote Tofau Palaie.

Ae peitai, sa fautuaina e Togiola ia ni fa’aeteetega o le faia o ni iloiloga fa’alilolilo faapenei.  Ma ia ta’ua ai lona malamalama, i le taua, o le puipuia o nisi o faamaumauga, aemaise i latou o lo’o a’afia ai, ae peitai, sa ia finau mai i le tatau pea i le taua o le nofo malamalama o le mamalu lautele, i a latou iloiloga o lo’o faataunu’uina.

Sa faamamafaina e Togiola e faapea, e ui ina o lo’o ua taulimaina e afioga i Senatoa ia lisi o suafa o tagata, ae o lo’o iai i le malo le tiutetauave, e faamautuina ai le pupunia o ia vaega o fa’amaumauga ae e le’i fa’ao’oina atu i le maota fono.  Ma sa ta’ua foi e Togiola, na tatau i le Ofisa o Tupe ona fa’afeso’ota’i a latou loia, e fa’amautu ai, le auala sa’o faaletulafono, ae e le’i tatalaina i tua ia nei faamaumauga.

Ma sa fa’aauau ona finau Togiola ina ia mulimulita’i pea le Senate i la latou tulafono, ina ia fa’aauau pea le latou iloiloga, ae le  se’e atu i tua o faitoto’a.

Na faamaonia e le peresetene o le Senate ia le tonu o atugaluga e pei ona fofogaina e Togiola, ae peitai, sa ia toe fa’aleoina le tatau i afioga i Senatoa ona nofo malamalama i ripoti e tusa ai ma pisinisi o lo’o nofo aitalafu i le malo, ona o lafoga fa’ae’e, o se tulaga e le mafai ona talanoaina fa’alauaitele.  Ma sa tapaina e Tuaolo ia se manatu mai i le loia a le fono mo le faafoeina o lea mataupu.

Ae i se manatu faaleo a le Afioga i le tama matua ia Senatoa Muagututi’a Tauoa, sa ia fa’aalia ai lona lagolagoina o le manatu a le Peresetene o le Senate, ma ia faamamafaina le mana’omia ona fa’alauiloa mai o pisinisi ia o lo’o nofo aitalafu i le malo, ma sa faapea foi ona faaleoina e Muagututi’a ia le tatau ona iai o se malo faamaoni, ma ia toe faamanatu atu i afioga i Senatoa, ia le a’afiaga mo fanau o le lumana’i.

Sa toe fa’amanino mai e Togiola, le leai o se manatu e ufiufi ia suafa o i latou o lo’o a’afia i lenei mataupu, ae peitai, i sona talitonuga, o le tiutetauave lea a le malo, o le puipuiga o nei ripoti.

Giles Dexter, RNZ Political Reporter

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ The Samoa government has paid $6 million in compensation to Samoa, to mark one year since the grounding and sinking of HMNZS Manawanui.

On 6 October, 2024, the vessel [ran aground on a reef off the South Coast of Upolu, and then sank](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/529979/hmnzs-manawanui-what-we-know-about-the-ship-s-sinking).

Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the payment - worth 10 million Samoan tālā - followed a request from the Samoan government, and was made in full and in good faith.

&#34;We have always said we will do the right thing,&#34; Peters said. &#34;We recognise the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.&#34;

Village elders told RNZ Pacific the once-rich fishing grounds have been destroyed, and they [want the wreck removed](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/574033/samoa-village-elders-still-seeking-compensation-want-manawanui-wreck-removed).

Peters said the two governments continued to work together on decisions around the ship and its future, with the priorities being minimising any possible environmental impacts and supporting the response.

Results of an inquiry released in April found the ship&#39;s crew [was undertrained and the vessel was not up to the task](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/557180/crew-on-manawanui-during-sinking-were-under-trained-ship-not-up-to-task-report).

All 75 passengers and crew survived. An investigation into whether there will be any disciplinary proceedings was in its closing stages.

Captain Rodger Ward, lead of the HMNZS Manawanui response, said much work had been carried out in the past 12 months to minimise the effects of the sinking and investigate the causes.

He said fallen shipping containers had been removed, and fuel, pollutants, weapons, ammunition and debris had been recovered.

&#34;Further work is required. That work includes progressing an independent wreck assessment together with environmental studies. This information will be essential in supporting decisions about the future work required,&#34; he said.

&#34;The priority remains, as it has been throughout, to minimise any environmental impacts of the sinking, and to support the government of Samoa in its response.&#34;

Reflecting on one year since the sinking, Ward said the Defence Force remained eternally grateful no lives were lost, and also recognised the impact the sinking has had on the people of Samoa.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Samoa has recorded more than 14,000 clinically diagnosed dengue cases since January, and its seventh death from the disease.

The latest report, released on September 29, covers the week of September 22- 28.

The Ministry of Health said for that period, cases were down 26 percent compared to the previous epidemiological week, with 378 clinically diagnosed dengue cases reported from all health facilities in Upolu and Savai&#39;i.

There have been seven confirmed dengue-related deaths in Samoa.

Seventy-four percent of all cases were reported from Upolu island.

American Samoa&#39;s Department of Health said there are 212 confirmed cases of dengue fever in the territory. No deaths are reported.

This figure is as of Monday, Sept. 29.

The local health department said most cases have recovered.

Cases continue to develop in other parts of the Pacific — the UN&#39;s ReliefWeb site showed Kiribati has reported 487 confirmed cases, as of 23 September, and another 1416 suspected, as well as one death.

As of Sept. 28, Tuvalu reported 690 suspected cases were tested, with 213 confirmed positive.

The dengue cases are widely distributed along Fongafale and two outer islands, Nanumaga (eight cases) and Nukufetau (10 cases).

There&#39;s better news in the Cook Islands, with Secretary of Health Bob Williams saying he believes [there was only one case for the last two weeks and none in the outer islands](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/574847/dengue-nearly-eliminated-as-cases-drop-to-one-in-rarotonga).

&#34;I think with the responses and the clean-ups, the Tutaka programs, I think we are, hopefully, close to eliminating dengue here in Rarotonga,&#34; he said.

**“O LE TAMALOA MAU’OA”**

I le ‘a’ai pisi o Niu Ioka, e nofo ai se tamaloa e igoa ia Sosene.  Ma e ui ina e le mau’oa pe lauiloa lenei tamaloa, ae peitai, o se tagata tausinio.  O se tasi aso, a’o faatopetope atu Sosene i le malaevaalele, sa toe oso mai i lona mafaufau, lona mana’o e fa’atau sana nusipepa e faitau i le malae vaalele, e fa’aalu ai le taimi.

O lea na agai atu i le laulau o lo’o fa’atau ai nusipepa e faatau sana nusipepa, ae ina ua ia tago atu i lana taga, ua leai sana tupe.

Ae ina ua va’ai mai le alii faatau nusipepa, o tau su’e se tupe a si tamaloa o Sosene, na oso mai le faatau nusipepa ma faapea mai, “Ave lau nusipepa.”  Ua te’i le tamaloa o Sosene ma ia tilotilo atu i le alii faatau nusipepa, ae ua faapea mai le alii faatau nusipepa, “O la’u meaalofa lena mo oe.”

O ni nai masina mulimuli ane, sa toe o’o atu ai Sosene i le malae vaalele lava lea e tasi.  Ia ma toe tupu foi le mea lava e tasi, E tago atu i le taga, ua leai se tupe.  Ae o le fa’atau nusipepa lava lea e tasi, sa ia tu’uina fa’ameaalofa mai foi le nusipepa mo Sosene.  Ma le tala lava e tasi, “O la’u meaalofa mo oe.”

Ua alu aso, sau aso ae ua suia ia le tulaga o le soifuaga o Sosene.  Ua avea o ia ma se tasi o alii pito sili ona mau’oa i le lalolagi ma ua avea lea ma tulaga ua ta’uta’ua ai ma lauiloa i le lalolagi atoa.

O se tasi aso, sa manatua ai e Sosene ia le alii faatau nusipepa agalelei, i le malae vaalele ma na a’e ai se mana’o ia Sosene, e fia alu e totogi le agalelei o lea alii.

Sa atoa lelei le masina ma le afa, o tau saili e le ‘aufaigaluega a Sosene ia le alii fa’atau nusipepa, ae na i’u lava ina maua o ia.

I le aso o le la feiloaiga ma Sosene, sa fesili atu ai Sosene i le alii fa’atau nusipepa, “O e manatua a’u?”

Sa tilotilo toto’a mai le alii faatau nusipepa ia Sosene ma i’u ina ia faapea mai, “Ioe, o oe o le alii lea e masani ona alu atu e faatau nusipepa i le malae vaalele, ae e leai se tupe.”

Ua ‘ata leotele ia Sosene ma lue atu lona ulu ma ia faapea atu loa i si alii faatau nusipepa, “Ou te mana’o e taui lou alofa ia te a’u.  Ta’u mai po o le a le mea e te mana’o ai lava i lenei olaga.”

Ua toe pupula toto’a atu le alii faatau nusipepa ia Sosene ma ia faapea atu, “Lau susuga, e mafai faapefea ona e faatusatusa mai i la’u auaunaga sa faia?  Na ou fesoasoani atu ia te oe, a’o o’u mativa, na’o se tagata faatau nusipepa.  Ae o lea ua e ofoina mai lau fesoasoani, aua o lea ua avea nei oe ma alii pito sili ona mau’oa i le lalolagi.   E mafai faapefea ona tutusa a ta auaunaga?”

O le taimi lea na goto ai i le loto ma le mafaufau o Sosene, le moni o le faamatalaga a le alii faatau nusipepa.  O lana auaunaga, sa sau mai i lona alofa, e aunoa ma se ‘oa po o ni tupe se tele.  O iina na malamalama ai Sosene, o tagata pito sili ona mau’oa, o i latou e tumu i le alofa ma le loto foa’I, e aunoa ma se tupe.

Mai lava i lena aso, sa tau’ave ai e Sosene lea lesona i lona fatu:  E fua lo tatou tamao’aiga i mea tatou toe foa’i atu, ae le o mea tatou te maua.  E sili atu le taua o le iai o se mafaufau ma se agaga foa’I ma le alofa, nai lo tupe uma o le lalolagi.

Papua New Guinea’s national flag carrier, Air Niugini, has significantly enhanced its onboard customer service, offering passengers a new taste in flight with the introduction of upgraded catering on its domestic services.

Travelers on the inaugural flight of the new Airbus A220-300 (Flight PX100) to Lae were among the first to experience this change. The new catering features a savory treat of two medium pies, a Beef pie and a Chicken pie, alongside the traditional Pure Orange Juice.

        <p>— Matthew McConaughey plays the real bus driver who drove 22 elementary school students to safety during 2018’s Camp Fire that engulfed Paradise, California, in the new film “The Lost Bus,” streaming Friday, Oct. 3 on Apple TV+. America Ferrera co-stars as the teacher who went along for the ride, expecting it to be a straightforward drop off at a nearby school. Paul Greengrass directed the film like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/movie-review-lost-bus-18471922ec0515e5e6382b2703e9d720">an old-fashioned disaster movie</a>, I wrote in my review, adding, “it’s impossible to take your eyes off the screen, away from the inferno and the sense of our own smallness and helplessness to ‘battle it.’”</p>

The film, which hits Netflix on Friday, Oct. 3, is based on Max Porter’s novella “Shy.” “Steve” was directed by Belgian filmmaker Tim Mielants who also directed Murphy in the terrific Claire Keegan adaptation <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cillian-murphy-film-small-things-like-these-842460b018a2c7f37533e2ed088a3f56">“Small Things Like These,”</a> (currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+) which focused on the Magdalene laundries in Ireland.

Powell plays Russ Holliday, a college football quarterback at the top of his game, until he makes an embarrassing mistake that ruins his career. Instead of giving up, Holliday decides to transform himself into an alter ego named Chad Powers, who is a walk-on player at a different school. The show is based on a character created by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nfl-sports-football-ccd23299d289c063eff6bf150aec49f5">Eli Manning for his 2022 ESPN docuseries “Eli’s Places,”</a> where he changed his look to take part in walk-on tryouts at Penn State.

All three episodes drop Friday, Oct. 3. The show’s voice cast includes Amy Adams as Charlotte, Elijah Wood as adult Wilbur, Cynthia Erivo as goose and Jean Smart as the narrator.</p>
        <p>— Charlie Hunnam also transforms himself for Netflix’s true crime dramatization called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8FeHSoTHs8%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“Monster: The Ed Gein Story.”</a> Hunnam plays Gein, a convicted murderer and suspected serial killer from the 1950s. Cocreated by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, the “Monster” anthologies tend to illustrate the impact of true crime on pop culture. In this “Monster,” Tom Hollander plays <a href="https://apnews.com/arts-and-entertainment-a2fc34c2afb44087bb77a7dfe2f06b9a">Alfred Hitchcock,</a> whose movie “Psycho” was inspired by Gein.

        <p>— On Sunday, Oct. 5, we’re introduced to Jules Maigret, a detective created by author Georges Simenon. His first Maigret novel was published in 1931 but a new PBS Masterpiece series about the investigator takes place in modern day. Benjamin Wainwright stars as the titular character who — along with his team — use unorthodox methods to solve crimes. “Maigret” will also will be available on pbs.org and the PBS App.</p>

        <p><strong>NEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
        <p>— Atsu, the protagonist of <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Ghost of Yotei</a>, was just a girl when the renegade Lord Saito killed the rest of her family. Sixteen years later, she’s returned to northern Japan to exact vengeance against Saito and his minions. She’s learned some mad samurai skills in the meantime, so expect plenty of katana-swinging mayhem. This new adventure from Sony’s Sucker Punch studio is the follow-up to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, and it builds on that game’s sprawling scope and lush graphics while blending 1600s history with Japanese folklore. Atsu’s mission begins Thursday on PlayStation 5.</p>

**NEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5**

— Atsu, the protagonist of [Ghost of Yotei](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), was just a girl when the renegade Lord Saito killed the rest of her family. Sixteen years later, she’s returned to northern Japan to exact vengeance against Saito and his minions. She’s learned some mad samurai skills in the meantime, so expect plenty of katana-swinging mayhem. This new adventure from Sony’s Sucker Punch studio is the follow-up to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, and it builds on that game’s sprawling scope and lush graphics while blending 1600s history with Japanese folklore. Atsu’s mission begins Thursday on PlayStation 5.

I think of her as a gentle disrupter. One of her greatest gifts was her ability to make everyone, at any age, feel that they have the power to change the world.</p>
        <p><strong>DISCOVERING TOOL USE IN ANIMALS</strong></p>
        <p>In her pioneering studies in the lush rainforest of Tanzania’s Gombe Stream Game Reserve, <a href="https://www.tanzaniaparks.go.tz/national_parks/gombe-national-park">now a national park</a>, Goodall noted that the most successful chimp leaders were gentle, caring and familial. Males that tried to rule by asserting their dominance through violence, tyranny and threat <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2016/11/02/gombe-gets-new-alpha-fall-ferdinand/">did not last</a>.</p>
        <p>I also am <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mireya-I-Mayor-78099910">a primatologist</a>, and Goodall’s groundbreaking observations of chimpanzees at Gombe were part of my preliminary studies. She famously recorded chimps taking long pieces of grass and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/2011264a0">inserting them into termite nests</a> to “fish” for the insects to eat, something no one else had previously observed.</p>
        <p>It was the first time an animal had been seen using a tool, a discovery that altered how scientists differentiated between humanity and the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>
        <p>Renowned anthropologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Leakey">Louis Leakey</a> chose Goodall to do this work precisely because she was not formally trained. When she turned up in Leakey’s office in Tanzania in 1957, at age 23, Leakey initially hired her as his secretary, but he soon spotted her potential and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees-jane-goodalls-story/1911/">encouraged her to study chimpanzees</a>. Leakey wanted someone with a completely open mind, something he believed most scientists lost over the course of their formal training.</p>
        <p>Because chimps are humans’ closest living relatives, Leakey hoped that understanding the animals would <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/">provide insights into early humans</a>. In a predominantly male field, he also thought a woman would be more patient and insightful than a male observer. He wasn’t wrong.</p>
        <p>Six months in, when Goodall wrote up her observations of chimps using tools, Leakey wrote, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine Man, or <a href="https://nhm.org/stories/chimpanzees-redefining-what-it-means-be-human">accept chimpanzees as human</a>.”</p>
        <p>Goodall spoke of animals as having emotions and cultures, and in the case of chimps, communities that were almost tribal. She also named the chimps she observed, an unheard-of practice at the time, <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/">garnering ridicule from scientists</a> who had traditionally numbered their research subjects.</p>
        <p>One of her most remarkable observations became known as the <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/a-brief-history-of-the-gombe-chimpanzee-war">Gombe Chimp War</a>. It was a four-year-long conflict in which eight adult males from one community killed all six males of another community, taking over their territory, only to lose it to another, bigger community <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2018/07/10/top-bottom-chimpanzee-social-hierarchy-amazing/">with even more males</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>CONFIDENCE IN HER PATH</strong></p>
        <p>Goodall was persuasive, powerful and determined, and she often advised me not to succumb to people’s criticisms. Her path to groundbreaking discoveries did not involve stepping on people or elbowing competitors aside.</p>
        <p>Rather, her journey to Africa was motivated by her wonder, her love of animals and a powerful imagination. As a little girl, she was entranced by Edgar Rice Burroughs’ 1912 story “<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/78">Tarzan of the Apes</a>,” and she loved to joke that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cS3BA0GwWM">Tarzan married the wrong Jane</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>STORYTELLER AND TEACHER</strong></p>
        <p>Goodall was an incredible storyteller and saw it as the most successful way to help people understand the true nature of animals.

        <p>Goodall inspired and advised world leaders, celebrities, scientists and conservationists. She also touched the lives of millions of children.</p>
        <p>Through the <a href="https://janegoodall.org/">Jane Goodall Institute</a>, which works to engage people around the world in conservation, she launched <a href="https://janegoodall.org/our-work/our-approach/roots-shoots/">Roots &amp; Shoots</a>, a global youth program that operates in more than 60 countries.

        <p>Along with Goodall’s warmth, friendship and wonderful stories, I treasure this comment from her: “The greatest danger to our future is our apathy.

        <p>It’s a radical notion from a one-of-a-kind scientist.</p>

For The Conversation

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — An_ yone proposing to offer a master class on changing the world for the better, without becoming negative, cynical, angry or narrow-minded in the process, could model their advice on the life and work of pioneering animal behavior scholar [Jane Goodall](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jane-Goodall).

Goodall’s life journey stretches from marveling at the somewhat unremarkable creatures – though she would never call them that – in her English backyard as a wide-eyed little girl in the 1930s to challenging the very definition of what it means to be human through her [research on chimpanzees in Tanzania](https://janegoodall.ca/what-we-do/africa-programs/gombe-stream-research-centre/).

I know this because I have been fortunate to spend time with her and to share insights from [my own scientific career](https://www.mireyamayor.com/). To the public, she was a world-renowned scientist and icon. To me, she was Jane – my inspiring mentor and friend.

Despite the massive changes Goodall wrought in the world of science, [upending the study of animal behavior](https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/nat16.sci.lisci.goodall/how-jane-goodall-changed-the-study-of-animal-behavior/), she was always cheerful, encouraging and inspiring.

        <p>In its latest forecasts, the Bank puts economic growth at 4.1 percent regionwide, while projecting a dip in inflation.</p>
        <p>But the region is expected to slow to 3.4 percent growth in 2026, as the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/565605/what-does-the-us-remittance-tax-mean-for-the-pacific">United States tariffs</a> begin to set in and revenue from tourism, fisheries and other important sectors take a hit.</p>
        <p>ADB's lead economist for the Pacific region Aminur Rahman told Pacific Waves the region stands out from the rest of the world for its bump in growth this year.</p>
        <p>He said unlike much of the developing world, the Pacific is relatively less reliant on US trade, dampening any direct pressure from the tariffs.</p>
        <p>"We don't expect the direct effects of the tariff would be that prominent... but we tend to factor in that because of the tariff on some of the major trading partners of the Pacific countries, there may be indirect effects related to tourism in particular."</p>
        <p>"If because of the tariff, the growth slows down in some of the countries that are the providers of tourism for the Pacific, the effect could boil down through that channel of indirect effect."</p>
        <p>Rahman said island nations are expected to largely sidestep the US's one percent tax on remittances. Fiji, for example, is seeing remittances increase by 11.5 percent to F$692.6 million in the first half of 2025.</p>
        <p>"We expect that effect also to be quite negligible, because the main destinations where Pacific labor goes are Australia and New Zealand, and obviously, the North Pacific countries have free access to the US."</p>
        <p>It's an upward revision from ADB's April forecasts for 2025, which projected a flatter growth rate of 3.9 percent.</p>
        <p>Rahman said this more optimistic forecast can be put down to record mineral and resource output from Papua New Guinea, propping up an otherwise subdued winter economy.</p>
        <p>According to the report, PNG's economy is forecast to grow by 4.6 percent in 2025, slowing to 3.6 percent in 2026 as resource output eases.</p>
        <p>Minerals, liquefied natural gas and cash crops dominate PNG's economic offering, Rahman said: particularly gold.</p>
        <p>According to the report, the Porgera mine had its highest half-year gold output since reopening in 2023, while Lihir, K92 and Ok Tedi have far surpassed expectations.</p>

By

Kaya Selby, RNZ Pacific journalist

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is offering a sunny outlook on the Pacific economy, but with clouds on the horizon.

In its latest forecasts, the Bank puts economic growth at 4.1 percent regionwide, while projecting a dip in inflation.

But the region is expected to slow to 3.4 percent growth in 2026, as the [United States tariffs](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/565605/what-does-the-us-remittance-tax-mean-for-the-pacific) begin to set in and revenue from tourism, fisheries and other important sectors take a hit.

ADB&#39;s lead economist for the Pacific region Aminur Rahman told Pacific Waves the region stands out from the rest of the world for its bump in growth this year.

He said unlike much of the developing world, the Pacific is relatively less reliant on US trade, dampening any direct pressure from the tariffs.

&#34;We don&#39;t expect the direct effects of the tariff would be that prominent... but we tend to factor in that because of the tariff on some of the major trading partners of the Pacific countries, there may be indirect effects related to tourism in particular.&#34;

&#34;If because of the tariff, the growth slows down in some of the countries that are the providers of tourism for the Pacific, the effect could boil down through that channel of indirect effect.&#34;

Rahman said island nations are expected to largely sidestep the US&#39;s one percent tax on remittances. Fiji, for example, is seeing remittances increase by 11.5 percent to F$692.6 million in the first half of 2025.

&#34;We expect that effect also to be quite negligible, because the main destinations where Pacific labor goes are Australia and New Zealand, and obviously, the North Pacific countries have free access to the US.&#34;

It&#39;s an upward revision from ADB&#39;s April forecasts for 2025, which projected a flatter growth rate of 3.9 percent.

Rahman said this more optimistic forecast can be put down to record mineral and resource output from Papua New Guinea, propping up an otherwise subdued winter economy.

According to the report, PNG&#39;s economy is forecast to grow by 4.6 percent in 2025, slowing to 3.6 percent in 2026 as resource output eases.

Minerals, liquefied natural gas and cash crops dominate PNG&#39;s economic offering, Rahman said: particularly gold.

According to the report, the Porgera mine had its highest half-year gold output since reopening in 2023, while Lihir, K92 and Ok Tedi have far surpassed expectations.

&#34;The gold price is very high currently, overall in the global market, and that certainly drove the positive outlook of the gold mines,&#34; Rahman said.

&#34;Beside the gold, there is also a growth in LNG production that also contributed to the better-than-initially-estimated growth.&#34;

A supply increase for core PNG exports comes amid a 10 percent tariff from the US, much lower than many of its South-East Asian neighbours, making for a milder-than-expected impact, the report said.

Rahman acknowledged the size of PNG&#39;s economy relative to other island nations could obscure economic struggles regionwide.

Samoa, for example, is seeing visitor growth plummet, from 40.9 percent in 2024 to 2.8 percent in 2025.

Meanwhile, drier weather conditions could slow agricultural and fishing output in the South and Central Pacific, leading to greater reliance on imported food products, and weakening their offering for signature goods, like kava.

Less reliable revenue sources for Pacific governments are worsening delays to public infrastructure, with post-disaster reconstruction projects in Vanuatu significantly impacting overall growth rates.

&#34;We see that, in some of the countries, there are still challenges for growth to pick up or catch up, even coming from recent disasters, project implementation or capacity constraint issues in some of the smaller Pacific countries, and so forth.&#34;

      <source:markdown>_Dear Amata,_

I&#39;m not a Dem, but I strongly oppose using Federal monies for veterans to promote the Republican agenda.

Email excerpt I received today from VA:

&#34;How the government shutdown impacts VA

Oct 1 at 8:21 AMAs you may be aware, funding for some government agencies, including portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, expired at midnight this morning.

President Trump opposes a lapse in appropriations, and on September 19, the House of Representatives passed, with the Trump Administration’s support, a clean continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands ....&#34;

There are laws against using Federal money, especially Veteran&#39; monies, to promote a political agenda?

How about &#34;Republicans are refusing to compromise and allow medical care to the low income workforce, and are instead reprogramming the money to the top 0.01%&#34;?

I fought to defend the Constitution and the rule of law, and this person is tearing it all up —  what are you going to do about it?

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ The public assassination of American conservative commentator Charlie Kirk earlier last month sent shockwaves throughout the United States — and around the world.

The 31-year-old CEO of Turning Point USA was shot in the neck and killed during a debate at Utah Valley University on 10 September.

Reactions were swift and polarized.

Vigils and rallies honored his life, while debate simultaneously erupted over his legacy.

Some hailed him as a martyr for Christian values and free speech, while others saw a divisive figure whose rhetoric sowed seeds of hate.

In Aotearoa, Deputy Prime Minister David Seymour praised Kirk&#39;s commitment to &#34;the free exchange of ideas&#34;.

Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki called Kirk a &#34;man executed because he loved Christ&#34; and compared their values.

On the other hand, Labour and Green MPs refused to support a parliamentary motion honoring Kirk.

Among Pacific communities, support surged.

Social media was flooded with tributes hailing Kirk as a &#34;man of God&#34;, &#34;bold Christian&#34; and &#34;defender of truth&#34;.

In the Northern Marianas, leaders called his death &#34;a profound loss in our national conversation&#34;.

Guam&#39;s Speaker Frank Blas Jr said Kirk died &#34;doing what he did best... persuading, not dividing&#34;.

At Kirk&#39;s Arizona memorial, American-Samoan Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence, said, “Charlie stood in the arena armed with superior arguments, with truth, reason, propelled by love for God, love for others, and love for our great nation... His words were his weapons.&#34;

But as praise poured in, so did criticism.

Prior to Kirk&#39;s assassination, he had been criticized for blaming the 2023 Maui wildfires on &#34;pagan Hawaiian culture&#34;.

&#34;There is blood on the hands of the waterworshipers. Christianity broke us free of Pagan slavery. Maui did not have to burn if they did not believe such whacky, goofy, Pagan stuff,&#34; Kirk had said on the Charlie Kirk show.

In response, popular TikTok user @Hapi\_117 said, &#34;He&#39;s blaming the Islanders, or native Hawaiians, for causing the Maui fires because they &#39;worship water..&#39; It has nothing to do with Hawaiian culture.&#34;

“WHEN PASIFIKA WEEP FOR EMPIRE”

Conversations continued when Samoan-Fijian American writer Marli Olive Wesley ignited debate with her Substack essay, When Pasifika Weep for Empire.

She argued that Kirk&#39;s conservative views — anti-immigrant, anti-queer, pro-policing, pro-empire — run counter to the values of the Pacific communities now mourning him.

&#34;We are a people who have endured land theft, blackbirding, nuclear testing, deportation, and exile,&#34; Wesley wrote.

“Yet again and again, we align ourselves with those who uphold the very systems that shrink us.”

Wesley suggested the outpouring of grief was not just about faith, but obedience. Obedience &#34;drilled in by mission schools, reinforced in pews, and exported through migration.&#34;

Speaking to RNZ Pacific, Wesley said she started writing her article well before Kirk&#39;s death.

“I’ve been unsettled for a long time by the contradictions I see in our communities... I&#39;d hear people say they stand on Christian values — love, compassion, justice, care for the vulnerable — but then watch their politics align more with American conservative values like exclusion, nationalism, punishment, and individualism,” she told RNZ Pacific.

Wesley said Kirk&#39;s death only laid those contradictions bare.

&#34;I don&#39;t think most Pasifika who mourned him agreed with every policy. What I saw was the reflex of loyalty… to church, to tradition, to a version of Christian authority that tells us who to follow and what to believe.&#34;

Not all backlash has been entirely critical, with Fijian Reverend James Bhagwan calling for nuance.

&#34;A man&#39;s life was taken. I will not cheer that... But grief shouldn&#39;t become amnesia. We can lament a death without canonizing politics that wounded many.&#34;

Bhagwan urged Pacific communities to reflect rather than react.

&#34;Support for Kirk often stemmed from familiar teachings, promises of order, diaspora longing for security. I don&#39;t see those people as enemies — it&#39;s a formation task.&#34;

&#34;Pray before posting. Verify before sharing. Guard dignity… especially of those we disagree with.&#34;

Tongan theologian and academic Rev Nāsili Vaka&#39;uta said Wesley&#39;s criticism was not only justified, but necessary.

&#34;Her essay reveals how colonial Christianity conditions us to mourn power figures…even those who oppose our dignity. We inherit doctrines of love but deploy them selectively.&#34;

He called it &#34;delusional religiosity&#34;, a result of settler-colonial logics that shape how Pasifika read faith, politics, and authority.

&#34;Death doesn&#39;t create new problems. It exposes old wounds.&#34;

President Donald Trump called Kirk &#34;a giant of his generation&#34; at his memorial service, saying he was &#34;violently killed because he spoke for freedom and justice&#34;.

Authorities say Kirk&#39;s suspected killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was captured after a 33-hour manhunt.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox has not ruled out the death penalty.

The investigation is ongoing.

**Vaega e 36**

_Taeao Manuia. Taeao Totoa, i le mamalu o le tatou aufaitau nusipepa i lenei taeao fou. Tatou te tau fai sii le Viiga ma le Faamanu i le Silisili Ese i Lana tausiga alofa ma Lana tausiga mamana, ia i tatou uma, ua mafai ai ona o tatou toe fesilafai i luma o nuu, ae le o tua o nuu, i lenei taeao fou._

_E faafeiloai atu foi i tina ma tama matutua ua mafai ona aulia mai lenei taeao matagofie i le pule alofa a lo tatou Tapaau i le Lagi._

_Ae sagai mai loa mo le fa’aauauina  o le tatou Fagogo, “O LE AVE PASI A’OGA” i lona vaega e 36._

\\*\\*\\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Ua va’aia foliga popole i le ‘au fono, ona o le ripoti fa’aleo a le Taitai Leoleo, e tusa ai ma le tulaga i le tino maliu o le alii ave pasi ma vaega o fualaau faasaina, ae o lea fa’ato’a latou fa’alogo foi lea i se vaega o le ripoti e fa’atatau i le nofoaga na tupu ai le faalavelave.

Na fa’aauau le faamatalaga a le ta’ita’i leoleo ma ia faapea atu i le ‘au fono, “Sa faia se faamatalaga a le inisinia o taavale a le tou aoga, ma sa ia ta’ua foi lona fesiligia o le alii ave pasi lea ua maliu.  I le mafua’aga na o’o atu ai lana pasi i lea vaega o le alatele, ae e le o se vaega lea o i luga o lana fa’afanua, e alu ai lana pasi, i le momoliina mai o fanau aoga, i le aoga ma le toe aveina atu o i latou i le fale.”

“Ma o se tulaga sa ou fa’afesiligia ai foi lea tulaga.   Ma ua mae’a ona ou su’esu’eina ia ata vitio o masini pu’eata a le malo, i luga o le alatele ma sa va’aia ai le fa’afoeina e le alii ave pasi ua maliu, ma le le fa’autauta o le pasi a’oga i lea taeao.  E foliga mai, sa taumafai o ia, ina ia fa’atupu se faalavelave i luga o le alatele.”

Ua tau fai nonofo le ‘aufono aemaise le Pulea’oga, ua le toe iai seisi e toe gagana.  Ae ua na o le mata’i o le ta’ita’i leoleo, a’o fa’aauau ona tautala.

        <![CDATA[<div class="field field-name-field-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Letter to the Fono – Part 3</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Honorable Leaders and Members of the Fono</em>,   </p>
        <p>In Letter #1, I warned that the Fund cannot survive without honesty about the $13.9 million debt and the principle of fiduciary duty. In Letter #2, I outlined reforms aimed at restoring fairness and sustainability.</p>
        <p>This third letter turns to the heart of governance: the budget process itself.</p>
        <p><strong>THE ZERO-SUM REALITY</strong></p>
        <p>Every year, as the Fono reviews the Administration’s budget, revenues are allocated across competing needs. But revenues are finite. Every dollar directed to one purpose is a dollar denied to another. When pensions, education, or healthcare are shortchanged, it is not because revenues vanished — it is because choices were made.</p>
        <p>In this zero-sum reality, government indulgence is paid for by public sacrifice. When the Fono protects its own allowances, travel, or discretionary spending while insisting others “tighten their belts,” it sends a dangerous message: rules for you, exceptions for us.</p>
        <p>This contradiction was on full display in recent hearings. The Attorney General was questioned for receiving taxable housing and utility benefits that were merely intended to restore her previous judicial salary. Yet members of the Fono themselves receive a $65,000 “office allowance” — often without actual offices — which they may treat as non-taxable or convert into pensionable compensation. This means legislators effectively enjoy $90,000 to $95,000 in income, while criticizing others for far lesser benefits. That is not accountability; it is hypocrisy.</p>
        <p><strong>WHO REVIEWS THE FONO’S BUDGET?</strong></p>
        <p>As the Fono meticulously questions the Administration’s departments, the question arises: who applies the same scrutiny to the Fono’s own budget? In practice, the Fono reviews itself. This undermines credibility. Oversight that spares itself but spares no one else is not oversight — it is self-dealing.</p>
        <p>Consider also the treatment of the Treasurer. When pressed on the $14 million now owed to the Fund, he was faulted for not recommending that the Governor use ARPA interest earnings to repay the debt. Yet the Treasurer correctly noted that ARPA has its own director, who administers ARPA funds per strict federal guidelines. Instead of addressing the real problem — the government’s chronic failure to meet its obligations — the Senate leadership appears to have shifted blame to one individual. The Treasurer has since been removed from his position.</p>
        <p>This pattern — criticizing others for practices that pale next to legislative privileges, or shifting blame away from structural failures — is not accountability. It is narrative manipulation: a repetition of claims designed to distract from reality and make the public question what they see plainly before them.</p>
        <p><strong>THE PENSION EQUATION IN CONTEXT</strong></p>
        <p>As I reminded in Letter #1: C + I = B + E. Contributions plus investments must equal benefits plus expenses. This equation is universal, not optional. When contributions fall short, investments stagnate, or expenses balloon, the balance is disrupted.</p>
        <p>The same truth applies to the government budget. Revenues + Grants = Services +</p>
        <p>Obligations. Overspending on operations inevitably starves obligations, such as pensions. That is the disease. Political justifications, temporary stimulus, or creative accounting are only symptoms.</p>
        <p><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY IN ACTION</strong></p>
        <p>I urge the Fono to act on five fronts:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>         Apply equal scrutiny to itself — review legislative allowances, salaries, and pension treatment with the same rigor demanded of the Administration.</li>
        <li>         Integrate actuarial evidence into budget law — let contribution rates be driven by actuarial necessity, not political negotiation.</li>
        <li>        Prioritize debt repayment — set aside revenues specifically for retiring the $14 million owed, whether through Enterprise (ASPA, ASTCA, others) surpluses, dedicated tax streams, or phased transfers.</li>
        <li>         End the Allowance Loophole — Amend the law so that the $65,000 office allowance is treated as salary. This would result in member salaries of $90,000 and leadership salaries of $95,000 — transparent, equitable, and fully taxable, like every other government paycheck. 5. Respect the Separation of Powers — The Senate leadership and legal counsel should focus on their legislative duties and step aside from direct roles in ASGERF governance. The Fund must be overseen independently, free from conflicts of interest, so that trustees can act solely in the best interests of active members, retirees, and beneficiaries. Restoring this separation will strengthen both the Senate and the Fund.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>SIGNS OF PROGRESS</strong></p>
        <p>It is essential to acknowledge that the Fono has taken some constructive steps during recent hearings. In a House Committee on the Retirement Fund hearing, House leadership corrected the Fund’s Executive Director after he tried to shift blame for the contribution rate increase onto the previous Governor, affirming that it was the Fund itself that asked for higher contributions. House leadership also pressed the Fund’s Vice Chair on my removal, reminding both him and the Executive Director that the Board has no legal authority to terminate a trustee — only the Governor does.</p>
        <p>During budget hearings, the Fono also displayed diligence in addressing the</p>
        <p>Administration’s flawed submission. The proposed budget blurred the lines between established departments, semi-autonomous authorities, and line agencies, with inconsistent salaries and titles. Faced with this confusion, the Fono worked diligently to request clarifications, sort through the confusion, and adjust salaries in a manner it deemed more consistent and justifiable.</p>
        <p>In addition, the House demonstrated proper accountability by paying for the expenses of its Retirement Committee Chairman to attend the recent NCPERS conference. This is as it should be: Fund-related travel by Fono members should be covered by the Fono’s own budget, not the Retirement Fund budget. This practice rightly places responsibility with the legislature and avoids burdening the Fund with costs unrelated to its fiduciary obligations. These examples prove the Fono can exercise oversight when it chooses to. The challenge — and the opportunity — is to apply that same rigor to itself.</p>
        <p><strong>THE STAKES</strong></p>
        <p>Markets rise and fall — but for three straight fiscal years (ending September 30, 2025), the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have delivered double-digit gains. The Fund, which reflects the performance of the financial markets, has posted positive gains over the past three years. Yet despite these gains, the Fund’s net position has been stagnant for over a decade. The threat is not Wall Street — it is Fagatogo and Utulei. </p>
        <p>The promise of retirement is not a favor; it is an earned right. If leaders cannot model accountability, how can they expect the public to make sacrifices?</p>
        <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
        <p>Letter #1 called out fiduciary breaches. Letter #2 laid out reforms. Letter #3 makes plain: accountability must begin at home.</p>
        <p>The Fono must lead by example. Anything less would betray the trust of those who built this government and still depend on it.</p>

      <source:markdown>Letter to the Fono – Part 3

_Honorable Leaders and Members of the Fono_,

In Letter #1, I warned that the Fund cannot survive without honesty about the $13.9 million debt and the principle of fiduciary duty. In Letter #2, I outlined reforms aimed at restoring fairness and sustainability.

This third letter turns to the heart of governance: the budget process itself.

**THE ZERO-SUM REALITY**

Every year, as the Fono reviews the Administration’s budget, revenues are allocated across competing needs. But revenues are finite. Every dollar directed to one purpose is a dollar denied to another. When pensions, education, or healthcare are shortchanged, it is not because revenues vanished — it is because choices were made.

In this zero-sum reality, government indulgence is paid for by public sacrifice. When the Fono protects its own allowances, travel, or discretionary spending while insisting others “tighten their belts,” it sends a dangerous message: rules for you, exceptions for us.

This contradiction was on full display in recent hearings. The Attorney General was questioned for receiving taxable housing and utility benefits that were merely intended to restore her previous judicial salary. Yet members of the Fono themselves receive a $65,000 “office allowance” — often without actual offices — which they may treat as non-taxable or convert into pensionable compensation. This means legislators effectively enjoy $90,000 to $95,000 in income, while criticizing others for far lesser benefits. That is not accountability; it is hypocrisy.

**WHO REVIEWS THE FONO’S BUDGET?**

As the Fono meticulously questions the Administration’s departments, the question arises: who applies the same scrutiny to the Fono’s own budget? In practice, the Fono reviews itself. This undermines credibility. Oversight that spares itself but spares no one else is not oversight — it is self-dealing.

Consider also the treatment of the Treasurer. When pressed on the $14 million now owed to the Fund, he was faulted for not recommending that the Governor use ARPA interest earnings to repay the debt. Yet the Treasurer correctly noted that ARPA has its own director, who administers ARPA funds per strict federal guidelines. Instead of addressing the real problem — the government’s chronic failure to meet its obligations — the Senate leadership appears to have shifted blame to one individual. The Treasurer has since been removed from his position.

This pattern — criticizing others for practices that pale next to legislative privileges, or shifting blame away from structural failures — is not accountability. It is narrative manipulation: a repetition of claims designed to distract from reality and make the public question what they see plainly before them.

**THE PENSION EQUATION IN CONTEXT**

As I reminded in Letter #1: C + I = B + E. Contributions plus investments must equal benefits plus expenses. This equation is universal, not optional. When contributions fall short, investments stagnate, or expenses balloon, the balance is disrupted.

The same truth applies to the government budget. Revenues + Grants = Services +

Obligations. Overspending on operations inevitably starves obligations, such as pensions. That is the disease. Political justifications, temporary stimulus, or creative accounting are only symptoms.

**ACCOUNTABILITY IN ACTION**

I urge the Fono to act on five fronts:

1.          Apply equal scrutiny to itself — review legislative allowances, salaries, and pension treatment with the same rigor demanded of the Administration.
2.          Integrate actuarial evidence into budget law — let contribution rates be driven by actuarial necessity, not political negotiation.
3.         Prioritize debt repayment — set aside revenues specifically for retiring the $14 million owed, whether through Enterprise (ASPA, ASTCA, others) surpluses, dedicated tax streams, or phased transfers.
4.          End the Allowance Loophole — Amend the law so that the $65,000 office allowance is treated as salary. This would result in member salaries of $90,000 and leadership salaries of $95,000 — transparent, equitable, and fully taxable, like every other government paycheck. 5. Respect the Separation of Powers — The Senate leadership and legal counsel should focus on their legislative duties and step aside from direct roles in ASGERF governance. The Fund must be overseen independently, free from conflicts of interest, so that trustees can act solely in the best interests of active members, retirees, and beneficiaries. Restoring this separation will strengthen both the Senate and the Fund.

**SIGNS OF PROGRESS**

It is essential to acknowledge that the Fono has taken some constructive steps during recent hearings. In a House Committee on the Retirement Fund hearing, House leadership corrected the Fund’s Executive Director after he tried to shift blame for the contribution rate increase onto the previous Governor, affirming that it was the Fund itself that asked for higher contributions. House leadership also pressed the Fund’s Vice Chair on my removal, reminding both him and the Executive Director that the Board has no legal authority to terminate a trustee — only the Governor does.

During budget hearings, the Fono also displayed diligence in addressing the

Administration’s flawed submission. The proposed budget blurred the lines between established departments, semi-autonomous authorities, and line agencies, with inconsistent salaries and titles. Faced with this confusion, the Fono worked diligently to request clarifications, sort through the confusion, and adjust salaries in a manner it deemed more consistent and justifiable.

In addition, the House demonstrated proper accountability by paying for the expenses of its Retirement Committee Chairman to attend the recent NCPERS conference. This is as it should be: Fund-related travel by Fono members should be covered by the Fono’s own budget, not the Retirement Fund budget. This practice rightly places responsibility with the legislature and avoids burdening the Fund with costs unrelated to its fiduciary obligations. These examples prove the Fono can exercise oversight when it chooses to. The challenge — and the opportunity — is to apply that same rigor to itself.

**THE STAKES**

Markets rise and fall — but for three straight fiscal years (ending September 30, 2025), the S&#38;P 500 and Nasdaq have delivered double-digit gains. The Fund, which reflects the performance of the financial markets, has posted positive gains over the past three years. Yet despite these gains, the Fund’s net position has been stagnant for over a decade. The threat is not Wall Street — it is Fagatogo and Utulei.

The promise of retirement is not a favor; it is an earned right. If leaders cannot model accountability, how can they expect the public to make sacrifices?

**CONCLUSION**

Letter #1 called out fiduciary breaches. Letter #2 laid out reforms. Letter #3 makes plain: accountability must begin at home.

The Fono must lead by example. Anything less would betray the trust of those who built this government and still depend on it.

_Respectfully submitted,_

**VAEGA 35**

_E toe fa’atalofa atu i a tatou pa’aga i so’o se tulimanu o le kelope o lo’o maua mai ai lenei auaunaga, aemaise i nai o tatou tama ma tina matutua i Amerika Samoa. E fa’atalofa atu i le faaopoopoga fou o le tatou Fagogo. E tatou te tau fai si’faatasi le viiga ma le mua i lo tatou Tapa’au Sili i le Lagi, ona o Lana pule faasoifua ma Lana tausiga alofa ia i tatou taitoatasi, ua mafai ai ona o tatou toe fesilafa’i ma le manuia i lenei taeao fou._

_Ia ae se’ese’e mai loa i ou se’etaga malu, ae o le a fa’aauau atu le tatou Fagogo – O LE AVE PASI A’OGA._

\\*\\*\\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Sa fa’agataina mai le tatou Fagogo i le vaiaso ua mavae, i le taimi o  faia ai le fonotaga a le Pulea’oga ma totino o le Komiti Faafoe a le a’oga faapea le Peresetene o le PTA a matua, ma le Taitai Leoleo.

“O le mafua’aga lena ua ou sau ai i le taeao lenei.  E fa’ailoa atu ia te outou, ua mae’a ona fa’aulu e le loia a matua o Simeona ia sa latou tagi e faasaga i le a’oga, o lau susuga i le Puleaoga, o la outou Komiti Faafoe faapea le  PTA a matua, ona o le fa’alavelave na tupu, lea ua a’afia ai mafaufau ma lagona o fanau aoga.”

O le fa’aaliga lea a le Taitai Leoleo i le ‘aufono.

Na pei ua fai se maliu i totonu o le potu a le Pulea’oga le liua o foliga o le Puleaoga, le komiti ma le peresetene o le PTA, i le faamatalaga a le Taitai Leoleo.

“Ae o le a le mea o le a a’afia ai fua matou i le tagi a lena aiga?  Ma leisi mea, e le’i iai se tamaititi po o se teineititi aoga na a’afia pe na lavea i le faalavelave.”  O le tau fai feosofi mai lea o le ‘au fono ma faaleo lo latou tete’e i le tagi lea ua ta’ua e le Ta’ita’i Leoleo.

“Atonu e tou te le’i talitonu pe na tou nofo malamalama i le ripoti mai i le foma’i faapitoa lea na gafa ma su’esu’ega o le tino maliu a le alii ave pasi, ina ua mae’a le faalavelave,” o le faamatalaga lea a le Ta’ita’I Leoleo.

“O iina sa fa’amaonia ai le tumu o le tino o le alii ave pasi, i vaega o fualaau faasaina, i le taimi na tupu ai le faalavelave i luga o le alatele.”

“Ma leisi tulaga,  e leai ma seisi o outou na mafaufau i le nofoaga na tupu ai le faalavelave.  O se vaega o le alatele, na matua’i mamao ese atu lava ma le auala e nonofo ai fanau aoga ia sa a’afia.  O le fesili la sa tula’i mai, pe aisea na o’o ai le pasi a’oga i luga o lea vaega o le alatele.”

A’o fa’aauau le faamatalaga a le Ta’ita’i Leoleo, ua na’o le fetilofa’i o le ‘au fono ua le iloa se faamatalaga o le a tali mai ai.  Ae o le taimi lea i le Pulea’oga, ua na o le punou lava i lalo.

_Apia, SAMOA —_(September 30, 2025) A State of Emergency has been declared in Samoa, effective from September 30 to October 29, 2025, to authorize the release of funds from the Treasury to address an ongoing economic emergency.

The proclamation was signed on Sept 26 by the Head of State, His Highness Tuimalealiifano Vaaletoa Sualauvi II, and enacted under Article 105 of the Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa.

The use of an Emergency Budget was approved by Cabinet during its first meeting on Sept 17, 2025, the day after the official opening of the 18th Parliament and formal swearing-in of the Prime Minister and newly elected Members of Parliament.

Following Cabinet consultation under directive F.K. (25) 36, Samoa’s Head of State has declared a grave economic emergency, citing threats to the nation’s financial stability due to an internal disturbance. The crisis stems from the government’s inability to lawfully access Treasury funds after Parliament failed to pass an Appropriation Bill for the current financial year.

Since the budget’s collapse in May, the caretaker administration has been operating on just 25% of the previous year’s allocation, approximately $250 million tala, leaving critical services and obligations under strain.

Acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mulipola Anarosa Ale Molio’o last Friday revealed that when the new administration assumed office on Sept 16, available funds for public sector salaries were only sufficient to cover one more week, excluding overtime payments that had already been delayed for several months.

In response, the Government advised the Head of State to invoke Article 105 of the Constitution, enabling emergency access to Treasury funds to ensure salaries are paid and essential operations continue. The Ministry of Finance is now preparing an interim budget to be presented to Parliament, aimed at sustaining government functions until the full national budget is introduced in June 2026.

Finance Minister Mulipola told reporters that the current State of Emergency is not expected to extend beyond Oct 29, as Parliament is anticipated to pass a new budget before that date.

She outlined the Cabinet’s funding priorities under the Emergency Budget, which include public sector salaries and overtime, pensions for the elderly, disability benefits, overseas medical referrals, ongoing contractual projects, the national scholarship program, pharmaceutical supplies, core government operations, and agricultural initiatives in Atele and Savaii.

      <source:markdown>TONGA AIRPORT UPGRADE

[![Tonga airport](https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/tonga_airport.jpg?itok=xK7j4npM)](https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/tonga_airport.jpg?itok=8zWIQh5W)

compiled by Samoa News staff

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Japan is providing Tonga with a US$17.7million airport upgrade.

PMN reported the initial request for the upgrade was made by Tonga in 2022, following a detailed study by Japan. A grant aid of US$17.7m was approved in August for Fua&#39;amotu International Airport in Tongatapu.

The upgrade includes expanding and renovating the passenger terminal building and a passenger boarding air-bridge and elevator.

The international apron will also be expanded.

Japan is also giving Tonga a US$6m e-passport grant.

**TAIWAN PROMISE**

Taiwan media is reporting a promise to assist Palau in preparing for next year&#39;s Pacific Islands Forum.

Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said Taiwan would do so as part of the diplomatic allies prosperity project, to showcase the results of bilateral cooperation to the world.

Lin said Palau is Taiwan&#39;s closest diplomatic-ally.

Taiwan has diplomatic relations with 11 UN member states.

According to a report from the Lowy Institute in January, nearly three-quarters of countries supported Beijing&#39;s position that Taiwan is part of China.

**FIJI BRIBERY ARREST**

A 41-year-old man has been arrested in Fiji after allegedly trying to bribe a police officer.

The man was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped for a routine check, and is accused of offering FJ$200 to the officer to release the vehicle.

A search resulted in the discovery of dried leaves believed to be marijuana.

The seized substances were sent for analysis.

**PALAU ELECTION**

Koror State voters in Palau will head to the polls in mid-November to elect members of the state&#39;s Legislature and the governor.

The Island Times reported this has been confirmed by the Palau Election Commission

The Legislature is made up of one representative from each hamlet and five at-large seats, totaling 17.

The governor&#39;s race will also be on the ballot, with incumbent governor Eyos Rudimch seeking re-election against challenger Alan Marbou, a former contender for the seat.

As of 24 September there were 5,971 registered voters in Koror

**SAMOA’S CLIMATE VISION**

Samoa has validated its third nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment CEO Lealaisalanoa Frances Brown-Reupena said it&#39;s not just a policy exercise but &#34;a shared vision for a resilient, low-carbon Samoa&#34;.

She said Samoa&#39;s emissions are less than 0.01 percent of global totals, but by advancing a credible, inclusive, and ambitious NDC, the country strengthens its moral authority in international climate negotiations.

**CLIMATE, CONFLICT AND PEACE**

Pacific Island leaders took turns addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, speaking on a range of issues — from local to global — that impact their countries.

From stating their positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict to deep sea mining, climate change and plastic pollution, the region&#39;s heads of government spoke about the issues that matter most to them and their people.

Samoa Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo said Samoa&#39;s geographical isolation and insularity no longer shields or protects it from the increasingly complex and dynamic security challenges.

These challenges include transnational crime especially drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, challenges to sovereignty, growing geopolitical tensions in our region and humanitarian crises.

He said the rules based international system is being bent out of shape.

The deputy prime minister said continuous inaction on climate change means detrimental effects on all aspects of Samoan life.

&#34;Climate change remains the greatest existential threat to Samoa and other Pacific SIDS. Its impacts are more extensively felt by SIDS due to our special circumstances, and the lack of capacity to respond quickly and effectively.&#34;

He said energy is both a driver and accelerator for Samoa&#39;s sustainable development ambition.

He noted digital transformation — including AI and data analytics — offer real opportunities to drive an inclusive, just energy transition, particularly through off-grid solutions and smarter energy planning.

&#34;However, Samoa&#39;s level of indebtedness, often worsened by natural disasters, remains a pressing challenge.&#34;

Ina ua mae’a ona talatalanoa leoleo ma le tuafafine o le na molia, sa agai atu loa e talatalanoa ma le Aunty po o le tuaoi.  Ma sa ia faamaonia le faamatalaga a le tuafafine, e faapea, e le o se taimi muamua lea ua tupu ai se faalavelave faapea.  Ma ua fai so’o le amio a le na molia, i l e sauaina o ia e tala ma upu, ae ona o le na molia, o se tagata o lona aiga, e na te fa’amagalo lava iai.

Sa ta’ua foi e le tuaoi/Aunty, o le tele o aso e tusitusi ai e se tagata ia ni faaupuga mataga i puipui, po o sitepu o lona fale, ma e na te masalomia ai lava le na molia.  E le gata i lea, e le gata ina palauvale atu le na molia, ae faapea ona lafo atu nisi o upu mamafa ma le mataga, ia te ia (tuaoi/Aunty).

Ae a tago le tuaoi/Aunty i le faamatala i lana fanau tama, e o lana fanau tama talanoa i le na molia, ae ita ai le na molia ma atili ai ona faatetele ana gaioiga, i le tau’aia o le latou fale, i ma’a po o le fufusu ma lana fanau tama.

O le 9:23 i lea lava afiafi, sa toe valaau atu ai le tuafafine o le na molia, i le ofisa a leoleo, e fa’ailoa atu iai le toe fo’i ifo o le na molia, i le fale.  Ma na agai atu ai loa leoleo ma aumai faapagotaina o ia, i le ofisa a leoleo.

Ina ua faatalanoaina o ia e leoleo, sa ta’ua e le na molia, e mafua ona ia faia ia tulaga, ona o le faia e lona tuaoi/Aunty ia faamatalaga leaga, e uiga ia te ia.  Ma ua matamuli o ia e toe fealuai i le latou nu’u, ona o faamatalaga leaga e faia e ona tuaoi ma lona aiga, e uiga ia te ia.  Ae e iai sona talitonuga, na amata mai e lona tuaoi/Aunty.

Sa fa’amaonia e le na molia, ia lona tusia o ni faaupuga mataga i puipui ma fasitepu o le fale a lona tuaoi/Aunty.  Ma na ia fa’aalia lona salamo e tusa ai ma ana gaioiga sa faia, ma ia faato’ese e tusa ai ma lana amioga.

        <p>In this country we have a tendency to talk about big things. Matters like the need for public toilets in our cities and towns are not a common topic of conversation, even though we all use the facilities.</p>

Salt Lake City, UTAH — Communities worldwide are mourning the passing of Russell M.

President Nelson passed away peacefully at his home in Salt Lake City shortly after 10 p.m. MDT on Saturday at the age of 101, according to the Church.

      <title>“RESPONSE TO DR. ELORA RAYMOND’S OPINION”</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Talofa lava,   </em></p>
        <p>I thank Dr. Elora Raymond for her thoughtful contribution and her vigilance in tracing how powerful legal interests have affected Indigenous peoples across the United States and its territories. Her research offers American Samoa an important reminder: the same lawyers and law firms who undermined Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, CHamoru, and Native American control over their lands are now circling our shores through repeated “voting rights” lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Dr. Raymond is right to sound the alarm. These cases are rarely about equality alone; too often, they are doorways to challenge the very foundations of Indigenous land tenure and sovereignty. In American Samoa, we know that fa‘a Samoa and communal lands are the heart of our culture, and we must continue to guard them with the same unity shown by the Fono, our leaders, and our people during the Tuaua and Fitisemanu cases.</p>
        <p>But as we recognize these external threats, we must also look inward. Our Constitution, statutes, and the Deeds of Cession give us unique protections that other territories do not have. Article I, Section 3 of our Constitution explicitly empowers the government to safeguard Samoan lands and customs. The Deeds of Cession promise respect for our land rights, and our courts, through decisions like Craddick, have already upheld the half-Samoan blood rule as a compelling state interest. These are strong shields against civil rights lawsuits that would strip away our protections.</p>
        <p>Yet, the more pressing challenge we face today is not always from Washington, but from within our own families. Too many disputes arise from our land laws, disagreements over inheritance, misunderstandings of matai authority, and conflicts in communal allocations. These disputes erode unity, create costly litigation, and weaken the very fa‘a Samoa our laws are meant to protect.</p>
        <p>If we wish to continue enjoying the protections we have against outside legal intrusion, we must also consider reforming and modernizing how our land laws function among ourselves. This could mean clearer rules for succession and allocation, greater use of mediation before cases reach the Lands &amp; Titles Court, and investments in proper land registration so that families are not left fighting over boundaries and oral histories. Protecting our land must also mean reducing the discord it causes among our people.</p>
        <p>Dr. Raymond reminds us that we must remain mataala, alert to outside wolves. But we must also be courageous enough to heal the divisions inside our own fale. Only then can we preserve both our rights under U.S. law and the deeper unity that comes from fa‘a Samoa.</p>
        <p><em>Fa‘afetai tele,</em></p>

Dr. Raymond is right to sound the alarm. These cases are rarely about equality alone; too often, they are doorways to challenge the very foundations of Indigenous land tenure and sovereignty. In American Samoa, we know that fa‘a Samoa and communal lands are the heart of our culture, and we must continue to guard them with the same unity shown by the Fono, our leaders, and our people during the Tuaua and Fitisemanu cases.

But as we recognize these external threats, we must also look inward. Our Constitution, statutes, and the Deeds of Cession give us unique protections that other territories do not have. Article I, Section 3 of our Constitution explicitly empowers the government to safeguard Samoan lands and customs. The Deeds of Cession promise respect for our land rights, and our courts, through decisions like Craddick, have already upheld the half-Samoan blood rule as a compelling state interest. These are strong shields against civil rights lawsuits that would strip away our protections.

Yet, the more pressing challenge we face today is not always from Washington, but from within our own families. Too many disputes arise from our land laws, disagreements over inheritance, misunderstandings of matai authority, and conflicts in communal allocations. These disputes erode unity, create costly litigation, and weaken the very fa‘a Samoa our laws are meant to protect.

If we wish to continue enjoying the protections we have against outside legal intrusion, we must also consider reforming and modernizing how our land laws function among ourselves. This could mean clearer rules for succession and allocation, greater use of mediation before cases reach the Lands &#38; Titles Court, and investments in proper land registration so that families are not left fighting over boundaries and oral histories. Protecting our land must also mean reducing the discord it causes among our people.

Dr. Raymond reminds us that we must remain mataala, alert to outside wolves. But we must also be courageous enough to heal the divisions inside our own fale. Only then can we preserve both our rights under U.S. law and the deeper unity that comes from fa‘a Samoa.

_Fa‘afetai tele,_

**David Tuinei**

Grateful Citizen of American Samoa
