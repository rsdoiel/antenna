_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Monday, January 19, 2026, will be observed as a public holiday in American Samoa.

Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata released the following statement in recognition of the day:

“Martin Luther King Jr. gave our nation a lasting example of moral courage rooted in faith, love of neighbor, and respect for human dignity. His leadership demonstrated that meaningful change is achieved not through division or force, but through persuasion, perseverance, and peaceful action.

“Dr. King’s speeches and writings continue to speak clearly across generations because they appeal to our highest ideals — equality under the law, opportunity for all, and unity grounded in mutual respect. His life reminds us that standing for what is right requires both conviction and compassion.

“As we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., we are reminded that the work of building a stronger nation is never finished. His example calls each of us to act with integrity, to treat one another with kindness, and to pursue justice in a way that brings people together, not apart.”

All government offices will be closed, and normal operations will be suspended for the day.

        <p> Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — The American Samoa Government (ASG) formally announced that it was joining the Pacific Connect Initiative, a strategic collaboration with Google, yesterday in a formal ceremony held at the Gov. H. Rex Lee Auditorium, which included signing of the agreement with Google, and an ava ceremony.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the initiative is Le Vasa cable, an independent next-generation subsea fiber-optic system, which will interconnect with the Bulikula cable with connections to Fiji and French Polynesia, according to the ASTCA press release.</p>
        <p>It noted that “by leveraging existing construction operations in the region for Bulikula, American Samoa will benefit from reduced costs and accelerated installation timelines.”</p>
        <p>Le Vasa cable was first announced by Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula during his State of the Territory Address delivered during the opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 39th Legislature of American Samoa one Monday, January 12, 2026.</p>
        <p>Attending the ceremony included Google officials and the Prime Minister of Samoa and his delegation.</p>
        <p>Samoa's Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt and his delegation is visiting American Samoa this week as a special guest for the launch of the Le Vasa submarine cable with the historic agreement signing with Google.</p>
        <p>ASTCA explains that “Le Vasa, meaning “The Ocean” or “The Vast Sea,” holds deep cultural significance to the American Samoan people. Once a highway for trade and connection across the Pacific, it now symbolizes a modern voyage — carrying information, innovation, and opportunity across the digital seas.”</p>
        <p>It continues that “Le Vasa cable is more than infrastructure; it reflects our identity. We are rooted in voyaging, resilience, and are deeply connected to our waters.</p>
        <p>“Our ancestors once navigated Le Vasa guided by stars and instinct. Today, we navigate the digital ocean guided by vision and purpose. This cable honors that legacy while opening new pathways.</p>
        <p>According to ASTCA, “Le Vasa cable will help enable the delivery of secure, high-speed, affordable internet, and greater network resiliency, even during natural disasters and in times of emergencies. This project also aligns with federal priorities to expand broadband access in underserved and unserved communities.”</p>
        <p>In explaining its funding, ASTCA points out that “while multiple funding sources are anticipated, the American Samoa Government has confirmed it will receive funds from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to support the development of Le Vasa to diversify and strengthen the economy of American Samoa and other nations in the region.”</p>
        <p>Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, in his response to Gov. Pulaali’i’s State of the Territory Address, on behalf of the Fono, noted that while ARPA funding is expected to cover $15 million of the costs for the critical Google cable installation project, the total project budget is $45 million. He raised concerns about the remaining $30 million needed to complete the project — from where will the additional funds come, he asked.</p>
        <p>“Together with Google, it is a historic step in securing a connected future for the people of American Samoa,” said Governor Pulaalii, during the ceremony yesterday. “Our Administration is committed to economic advancement, and this project strengthens our strategic role in the Pacific while ensuring future generations benefit from the Le Vasa cable project.”</p>
        <p>“I’m excited to see our close collaboration with American Samoa and ASTCA come to fruition with the Le Vasa cable,” said Brian Quigley, VP, Global Network Infrastructure, Google Cloud. “Le Vasa will establish a foundation for long-term economic diversification and growth, and it will strengthen redundancy, expand economic opportunity, and bridge the digital divide between the Pacific and the United States.”</p>
        <p>The American Samoa Telecommunications Authority (ASTCA) is the official contractual party and project coordinator for this major infrastructure investment, the press release states.</p>
        <p>As the implementing agency, ASTCA will own and operate Le Vasa and lead its integration into the Territory’s existing telecom infrastructure, manage landing points, coordinate with global partners, and align with global technical standards.</p>
        <p>Through technical collaboration with ASTCA, Google optimized the Bulikula cable path to route closer to the Territory and accelerate Le Vasa’s delivery timeline, establishing a high-capacity pathway that will strengthen resilience in the region and drive economic diversification.</p>
        <p>“The Board is proud to support the American Samoa Government in this groundbreaking endeavor,” said Avamua Dave Haleck, Chairman of the ASTCA Board of Directors. “Connectivity is not just about speed. It is about access and secure access. We commend the Pula and Pulu Administration, and our dedicated ASTCA team for bringing this vision to life.”</p>
        <p>ASTCA concludes that “once completed, the Le Vasa’s interconnection with the Bulikula cable system will position American Samoa within a robust Pacific communications network.</p>
        <p>“It will strengthen redundancy, expand opportunity, and bridge the digital divide between the Pacific and the United States. From remote education to tele-health and digital entrepreneurship enabled by cloud computing, Le Vasa establishes a foundation for long-term digital equity and regional leadership in connectivity.”</p>

Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — The American Samoa Government (ASG) formally announced that it was joining the Pacific Connect Initiative, a strategic collaboration with Google, yesterday in a formal ceremony held at the Gov. H. Rex Lee Auditorium, which included signing of the agreement with Google, and an ava ceremony.

At the heart of the initiative is Le Vasa cable, an independent next-generation subsea fiber-optic system, which will interconnect with the Bulikula cable with connections to Fiji and French Polynesia, according to the ASTCA press release.

It noted that “by leveraging existing construction operations in the region for Bulikula, American Samoa will benefit from reduced costs and accelerated installation timelines.”

Le Vasa cable was first announced by Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula during his State of the Territory Address delivered during the opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 39th Legislature of American Samoa one Monday, January 12, 2026.

Attending the ceremony included Google officials and the Prime Minister of Samoa and his delegation.

Samoa&#39;s Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt and his delegation is visiting American Samoa this week as a special guest for the launch of the Le Vasa submarine cable with the historic agreement signing with Google.

ASTCA explains that “Le Vasa, meaning “The Ocean” or “The Vast Sea,” holds deep cultural significance to the American Samoan people. Once a highway for trade and connection across the Pacific, it now symbolizes a modern voyage — carrying information, innovation, and opportunity across the digital seas.”

It continues that “Le Vasa cable is more than infrastructure; it reflects our identity. We are rooted in voyaging, resilience, and are deeply connected to our waters.

“Our ancestors once navigated Le Vasa guided by stars and instinct. Today, we navigate the digital ocean guided by vision and purpose. This cable honors that legacy while opening new pathways.

According to ASTCA, “Le Vasa cable will help enable the delivery of secure, high-speed, affordable internet, and greater network resiliency, even during natural disasters and in times of emergencies. This project also aligns with federal priorities to expand broadband access in underserved and unserved communities.”

In explaining its funding, ASTCA points out that “while multiple funding sources are anticipated, the American Samoa Government has confirmed it will receive funds from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) to support the development of Le Vasa to diversify and strengthen the economy of American Samoa and other nations in the region.”

Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, in his response to Gov. Pulaali’i’s State of the Territory Address, on behalf of the Fono, noted that while ARPA funding is expected to cover $15 million of the costs for the critical Google cable installation project, the total project budget is $45 million. He raised concerns about the remaining $30 million needed to complete the project — from where will the additional funds come, he asked.

“Together with Google, it is a historic step in securing a connected future for the people of American Samoa,” said Governor Pulaalii, during the ceremony yesterday. “Our Administration is committed to economic advancement, and this project strengthens our strategic role in the Pacific while ensuring future generations benefit from the Le Vasa cable project.”

“I’m excited to see our close collaboration with American Samoa and ASTCA come to fruition with the Le Vasa cable,” said Brian Quigley, VP, Global Network Infrastructure, Google Cloud. “Le Vasa will establish a foundation for long-term economic diversification and growth, and it will strengthen redundancy, expand economic opportunity, and bridge the digital divide between the Pacific and the United States.”

The American Samoa Telecommunications Authority (ASTCA) is the official contractual party and project coordinator for this major infrastructure investment, the press release states.

As the implementing agency, ASTCA will own and operate Le Vasa and lead its integration into the Territory’s existing telecom infrastructure, manage landing points, coordinate with global partners, and align with global technical standards.

Through technical collaboration with ASTCA, Google optimized the Bulikula cable path to route closer to the Territory and accelerate Le Vasa’s delivery timeline, establishing a high-capacity pathway that will strengthen resilience in the region and drive economic diversification.

“The Board is proud to support the American Samoa Government in this groundbreaking endeavor,” said Avamua Dave Haleck, Chairman of the ASTCA Board of Directors. “Connectivity is not just about speed. It is about access and secure access. We commend the Pula and Pulu Administration, and our dedicated ASTCA team for bringing this vision to life.”

ASTCA concludes that “once completed, the Le Vasa’s interconnection with the Bulikula cable system will position American Samoa within a robust Pacific communications network.

“It will strengthen redundancy, expand opportunity, and bridge the digital divide between the Pacific and the United States. From remote education to tele-health and digital entrepreneurship enabled by cloud computing, Le Vasa establishes a foundation for long-term digital equity and regional leadership in connectivity.”

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Samoa&#39;s Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt is visiting American Samoa this week as a special guest for the launch of the Le Vasa submarine cable with a historic agreement signing with Google, fostering stronger digital connectivity and collaboration between the two Samoas. The Prime Minister was welcomed by  Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula upon arrival.

The Prime Minister’s delegation includes the Minister of Communications and Information Technology Hon. Agaseata Tanuvasa Valelio Peto, Chief Executive Officer of M.C.I.T. Leasoiloafaleuplou Ronnie Aiolupotea, Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Prime Minister and Cabinet Agafili Tomaimanō Shem Leo, Acting Police Commissioner Leiātaua Samuelu Afamasaga, and Apulu Lance Polu.

The Prime Minister, Gov. Pulaali’i and their advisors will be holding discussions with Google officials.

**BACKGROUND**

The Le Vasa cable and forthcoming collaboration with Google was publicly announced by Governor Pulaali’i’s during his State of the Territory Address delivered on Monday, Jan. 12, 2026, at the opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 39th Legislature of American Samoa. It was highlighted as one of his administration’s most important economic developments to help diversify the local economy.

Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, in his response to Gov. Pulaali’i’s on behalf of the Fono, pointed out that while ARPA funding is expected to cover $15 million of the costs for the critical Google cable installation project, the total project budget is $45 million.

He said this raises significant concerns about the remaining $30 million needed to complete the project, prompting Tuaolo to question from where the additional funds will come.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ TAOA&#39;s hot meal program is resuming this week, beginning Wednesday (Jan 14, 2026), and continuing through Thursday (Jan 15, 2026) and Friday (Jan 16, 2026) at regular locations.

For Aunuu next week: the food distribution schedule will resume on the usual days.

For the rest of Tutuila: West Coast (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) East Coast (Tuesday, Thursday, Friday).

Samoa News understands the meal program has not been happening since December 2025 due to the participating food vendors not willing to continue because they had not being paid in a timely manner — with arrears of at least 3- 5 months. While partial payments have since been made, the government is also insisting that food vendors must fulfill their contractual obligations.

Samoa News was told that the current contracts for the food vendors run through May 2026, but, they currently have no legal assurance they will be paid in a timely manner.

Food vendors have long been frustrated with the delayed payments, saying they cannot afford, as small businesses, to carry the cost of goods, including the overheads to deliver the hot meals for the program for an unlimited amount of time. They also point to the hot meal program being fully funded by the federal government and don’t understand why the more than 45-day payment delay.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula delivered the State of the Territory Address on Monday, Jan. 12, 2026, when the 39th Legislature of American Samoa convened its Third Regular Session at the Gov. H. Rex Lee Auditorium. Following the Governor’s address, Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean spoke on behalf of the Fono, offering a counter balance to the governor’s highlights of his admin’s economic development efforts.

Attending the event were members of the Senate and House of Representatives,  which included the President of the Senate Tuaolo, Speaker of the House Savali Talavou Ale; and, Lieutenant Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr., Cabinet members, and honorary guests.

Invocation for the event was offered by Reverend Elder Faigata Manase of CCCAS Malaeloa, with their choir&#39;s beautiful voices resonating throughout the event.

**STATE OF THE TERRITORY ADDRESS**

In his Address, Governor Pulaalii highlighted economic development in the territory as their top priority, pointing to their efforts to diversify the economy, strengthen local businesses, and build long-term resilience following the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that federal recovery funding has been strategically used to improve infrastructure and public services, and commended the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Office and partner agencies for their teamwork and progress.

In particular, Gov. Pualaali’i noted a forthcoming collaboration with Google —the &#34;Le Vasa&#34; cable — with it in the works to improve internet reliability, reduce service disruptions, and will expand access to online education, healthcare, and digital services.

In closing, Governor Pulaali’i encouraged the three branches of government — Judiciary, Legislature and Executive to continue collaboration, responsible leadership, and service to the people of American Samoa. He emphasized that lasting progress is achieved through unity and a shared dedication to building a stronger future for the Territory.

“Let us have a great year of love, respect, and hope,” the governor concluded.

**FONO RESPONSE**

The Senate President’s response on behalf of the Fono expressed concern that legislators had not yet received any substantive documentation or evidence to support the numerous accomplishments cited by the governor in his address. He said the State of the Territorial Comprehensive Report which should be available in the coming weeks would allow the Fono to respond accordingly.

_(The State of the Territorial Comprehensive Report comprises detailed information of the progress from all ASG departments.)_

Tuaolo continued that to date, no new revenue measures or financial proposals have been submitted for the Fono&#39;s review and approval. This lack of transparency, he said, raises questions about fiscal responsibility and legislative oversight, both crucial to maintaining the integrity of government operations.

In light of these issues, Tuaolo urged the government to explore new revenue sources, including the possibility of introducing sales taxes, to ensure the long-term sustainability of vital government services and infrastructure.

In addition to revenue concerns, Tuaolo reminded attendees that funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is expected to expire at the end of 2026, prompting urgent consideration of the territory&#39;s financial strategies.

He further pointed out that while ARPA funding is expected to cover $15 million of the costs for the critical Google cable installation project, the total project budget is $45 million. This raises significant concerns about the remaining $30 million needed to complete the project, prompting Tuaolo to question from where the additional funds will come.

Another issue raised by Tuaolo concerned the immigration bond for foreign nationals seeking to reside in American Samoa.

He urged the Attorney General to consider raising the bond to $10,000, given the increasing number of immigrants arriving in the territory, which has implications for local resources and community dynamics.

**BACKGROUND**

In November, the Attorney General’s office announced new immigration bond fees, which have significantly affected fees across various countries. These new regulations have led to bond amounts doubling for many countries, while approximately 30 others will retain their existing lower bond levels.

Notably, China&#39;s immigration bond remains capped at $2,300, while in contrast, Portugal has the highest bond fees exceeding $5,000, followed by Iran, Israel, and Slovenia, each with bond amounts surpassing $4,000.

        <p>“It’s incredibly important to not become confused over this: U.S. nationals cannot vote outside our elections in American Samoa.

        <p>“Until we are certain that we have widespread 100 percent awareness of this fact, it’s helpful to have a reminder to be sure the word is out, and protect friends and family from a legal nightmare. It’s very important to make sure your graduating high schoolers who are still U.S. nationals know this clearly when they turn 18 and potentially go away to jobs and college,” Aumua Amata continued. “For those choosing citizenship, I have a bill to help that process for U.S. nationals, but nationals risk prosecution by voting in any state that requires U.S. citizenship to be eligible to vote, unless state law were to expressly provide that U.S. nationals also may vote in that state’s elections.”</p>
        <p>Amata has introduced the American Samoa Statutory Nationality and Citizenship Act (H.R. 6158) to help individual U.S. nationals more readily transfer into U.S. citizenship as a personal choice, while not affecting American Samoa’s current status, which for over 125 years has protected the family land and chiefly (matai) systems within the traditional fa’a Samoa (Samoan way). </p>
        <p>The bill protects both collective self-determination for American Samoa and the individual rights of U.S. nationals, by enabling elective United States citizenship for individuals, and she will be posting more information about the bill in the months ahead. </p>
        <p>“I am saddened by the voting case in Alaska, and I hope the wonderful people of Alaska, where I’ve visited many times, will be forgiving of this mistake by the local U.S. nationals in their community,” Amata concluded. “Rather, I hope that this can become an educational moment, that the Lord can ‘work together for good’ by preventing future problems through public awareness while restoring our people in Alaska with compassion.” </p>

_Washington, D.C. —_(January 9, 2026) Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata is reminding U.S. nationals from American Samoa that under current U.S. and state laws they absolutely cannot vote in elections outside of American Samoa unless they personally become U.S. citizens before voting.

“It’s incredibly important to not become confused over this: U.S. nationals cannot vote outside our elections in American Samoa. Even if the poll workers do not stop you from voting, and you have a state driver’s license, it’s still not allowed, and can lead to huge legal problems,” said Congresswoman Amata. “If you want to vote in the United States, you must become a citizen first, even if you’ve lived in a U.S. community for many years.”

“Until we are certain that we have widespread 100 percent awareness of this fact, it’s helpful to have a reminder to be sure the word is out, and protect friends and family from a legal nightmare. It’s very important to make sure your graduating high schoolers who are still U.S. nationals know this clearly when they turn 18 and potentially go away to jobs and college,” Aumua Amata continued. “For those choosing citizenship, I have a bill to help that process for U.S. nationals, but nationals risk prosecution by voting in any state that requires U.S. citizenship to be eligible to vote, unless state law were to expressly provide that U.S. nationals also may vote in that state’s elections.”

Amata has introduced the American Samoa Statutory Nationality and Citizenship Act (H.R. 6158) to help individual U.S. nationals more readily transfer into U.S. citizenship as a personal choice, while not affecting American Samoa’s current status, which for over 125 years has protected the family land and chiefly (matai) systems within the traditional fa’a Samoa (Samoan way).

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ As the federal government considers opening U.S. territorial waters to deep sea mining, Pacific Island communities and territorial governments are going on record to oppose the imposition of these activities, warning of irreversible harm to ocean ecosystems, cultural lifeways, and the democratic rights of island peoples.

Just hours before the comment period closes this week, Right to Democracy, in partnership with the America the Beautiful for All Coalition, will host a virtual panel examining the federal call to open the waters of the Marianas to deep sea mining and its implications for island communities, ocean ecosystems, and self-determination.

The panel will feature Andra Samoa, Maria Hernández, and Sheila Babauta, all of whom are Right to Democracy Environment &#38; Democracy Fellows, and will be co-moderated by Neil Weare, Co-Director of Right to Democracy, and Angelo Villagomez, Ocean Co-Lead for the America the Beautiful for All Coalition.

Local and national civil society organizations will announce the results of their respective outreach efforts and successes in submitting petitions, letters, and comments to the federal register.

Special guests include Lt. Governor Joshua Tenorio, Speaker Frank Blas, Jr., and others.

The Virtual Panel Will Take Place:

-           Monday, January 12th at 5:00pm EST, 6:00pm AST, 11:00 am SST (American Samoa)
-           Tuesday, January 13th at 8:00am ChST (Guam / Northern Mariana Islands)

National Capital District (NCD) Governor Powes Parkop was on hand to receive the Baton, marking a key milestone in the Port Moresby leg of the relay. The ceremony highlighted the village&#39;s unique sporting heritage, with the Baton at one point travelling by water to navigate the sprawling overwater.

The campaign, which will focus on promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment, is being hailed as a critical step in addressing one of Papua New Guinea&#39;s most deep-seated social crises.

Madang Governor and Provincial Member Ramsey Pariwa clarified this following recent arrests in Madang town after enforcement began on Thursday, January 1, 2026. Governor Pariwa said the law was enacted by Parliament and carries the same legal weight and penalties as other national laws.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Customers of the Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) have been actively voicing their concerns on social media about a troubling cash-trapping scheme reported at the bank&#39;s Automated Teller Machine (ATM) located within the Laufou Shopping Center in Nuʻuuli.

Several social media accounts have surfaced, detailing allegations that certain individuals have strategically applied tape to the ATM’s cash dispenser. This disturbing tactic is designed to misappropriate customer withdrawals. One account described a troubling incident in which a customer attempted to withdraw funds from an ATM. Although he received a receipt indicating that the transaction was successful, he was shocked to find that no physical cash was dispensed. Upon closer inspection of the cash dispenser, he discovered tape blocking the exit, with the cash he had attempted to withdraw stuck to it.

This alarming incident has since been reported to TBAS management. Cash-trapping scams have become a troubling trend, reported in communities across the United States and internationally. These schemes typically involve placing a device or obstruction over the cash dispenser slot to prevent the release of funds. In these scenarios, the customer’s account is debited, yet no cash is dispensed. Victims often assume the ATM is malfunctioning and leave, allowing the perpetrator to return, remove the obstruction, and claim the trapped cash.

In response to these concerns, TBAS President and Chief Executive Officer Owen Perry addressed local media, confirming the bank&#39;s awareness of the troubling reports. He indicated that TBAS is actively investigating the situation, which appears to be limited to this ATM location for now. “Upon learning about the issue, the bank quickly contacted the Department of Public Safety and is cooperating fully while conducting an internal review,” Perry stated.

Perry further emphasized, “Our ATMs undergo regular monitoring and inspections, and we are continually evaluating and enhancing our security protocols across all locations.” TBAS strongly encourages any customer who experiences difficulties at a TBAS ATM or notices any anomalies to contact the bank immediately, enabling a swift response and resolution.

Due to the ongoing investigation, Perry noted that the bank cannot share specific details about the incidents at this time. “Our top priority is to ensure the safety of our customers while maintaining the integrity of our banking services,” he remarked.
