_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Monday, January 19, 2026, will be observed as a public holiday in American Samoa. This day provides an opportunity to honor the life and enduring legacy of Dr. King whose leadership and unwavering commitment to equality, justice, and community service continue to inspire us all.

Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata released the following statement in recognition of the day:

“Martin Luther King Jr. gave our nation a lasting example of moral courage rooted in faith, love of neighbor, and respect for human dignity. His leadership demonstrated that meaningful change is achieved not through division or force, but through persuasion, perseverance, and peaceful action.

“Dr. King’s speeches and writings continue to speak clearly across generations because they appeal to our highest ideals — equality under the law, opportunity for all, and unity grounded in mutual respect. His life reminds us that standing for what is right requires both conviction and compassion.

“As we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., we are reminded that the work of building a stronger nation is never finished. His example calls each of us to act with integrity, to treat one another with kindness, and to pursue justice in a way that brings people together, not apart.”

All government offices will be closed, and normal operations will be suspended for the day.

Those whose services are required will receive holiday compensation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Samoa&#39;s Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt is visiting American Samoa this week as a special guest for the launch of the Le Vasa submarine cable with a historic agreement signing with Google, fostering stronger digital connectivity and collaboration between the two Samoas. The Prime Minister was welcomed by  Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula upon arrival.

The Prime Minister’s delegation includes the Minister of Communications and Information Technology Hon. Agaseata Tanuvasa Valelio Peto, Chief Executive Officer of M.C.I.T. Leasoiloafaleuplou Ronnie Aiolupotea, Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Prime Minister and Cabinet Agafili Tomaimanō Shem Leo, Acting Police Commissioner Leiātaua Samuelu Afamasaga, and Apulu Lance Polu.

The Prime Minister, Gov. Pulaali’i and their advisors will be holding discussions with Google officials.

**BACKGROUND**

The Le Vasa cable and forthcoming collaboration with Google was publicly announced by Governor Pulaali’i’s during his State of the Territory Address delivered on Monday, Jan. 12, 2026, at the opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 39th Legislature of American Samoa. It was highlighted as one of his administration’s most important economic developments to help diversify the local economy.

Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, in his response to Gov. Pulaali’i’s on behalf of the Fono, pointed out that while ARPA funding is expected to cover $15 million of the costs for the critical Google cable installation project, the total project budget is $45 million.

He said this raises significant concerns about the remaining $30 million needed to complete the project, prompting Tuaolo to question from where the additional funds will come.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ TAOA&#39;s hot meal program is resuming this week, beginning Wednesday (Jan 14, 2026), and continuing through Thursday (Jan 15, 2026) and Friday (Jan 16, 2026) at regular locations.

For Aunuu next week: the food distribution schedule will resume on the usual days.

For the rest of Tutuila: West Coast (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) East Coast (Tuesday, Thursday, Friday).

Samoa News understands the meal program has not been happening since December 2025 due to the participating food vendors not willing to continue because they had not being paid in a timely manner — with arrears of at least 3- 5 months. While partial payments have since been made, the government is also insisting that food vendors must fulfill their contractual obligations.

Samoa News was told that the current contracts for the food vendors run through May 2026, but, they currently have no legal assurance they will be paid in a timely manner.

Food vendors have long been frustrated with the delayed payments, saying they cannot afford, as small businesses, to carry the cost of goods, including the overheads to deliver the hot meals for the program for an unlimited amount of time. They also point to the hot meal program being fully funded by the federal government and don’t understand why the more than 45-day payment delay.

        <p><strong>FONO RESPONSE</strong></p>
        <p>The Senate President’s response on behalf of the Fono expressed concern that legislators had not yet received any substantive documentation or evidence to support the numerous accomplishments cited by the governor in his address.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula delivered the State of the Territory Address on Monday, Jan. 12, 2026, when the 39th Legislature of American Samoa convened its Third Regular Session at the Gov. H. Rex Lee Auditorium. Following the Governor’s address, Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean spoke on behalf of the Fono, offering a counter balance to the governor’s highlights of his admin’s economic development efforts.

Attending the event were members of the Senate and House of Representatives,  which included the President of the Senate Tuaolo, Speaker of the House Savali Talavou Ale; and, Lieutenant Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr., Cabinet members, and honorary guests.

Invocation for the event was offered by Reverend Elder Faigata Manase of CCCAS Malaeloa, with their choir&#39;s beautiful voices resonating throughout the event.

**STATE OF THE TERRITORY ADDRESS**

In his Address, Governor Pulaalii highlighted economic development in the territory as their top priority, pointing to their efforts to diversify the economy, strengthen local businesses, and build long-term resilience following the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that federal recovery funding has been strategically used to improve infrastructure and public services, and commended the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Office and partner agencies for their teamwork and progress.

In particular, Gov. Pualaali’i noted a forthcoming collaboration with Google —the &#34;Le Vasa&#34; cable — with it in the works to improve internet reliability, reduce service disruptions, and will expand access to online education, healthcare, and digital services.

In closing, Governor Pulaali’i encouraged the three branches of government — Judiciary, Legislature and Executive to continue collaboration, responsible leadership, and service to the people of American Samoa. He emphasized that lasting progress is achieved through unity and a shared dedication to building a stronger future for the Territory.

“Let us have a great year of love, respect, and hope,” the governor concluded.

**FONO RESPONSE**

The Senate President’s response on behalf of the Fono expressed concern that legislators had not yet received any substantive documentation or evidence to support the numerous accomplishments cited by the governor in his address. He said the State of the Territorial Comprehensive Report which should be available in the coming weeks would allow the Fono to respond accordingly.

_(The State of the Territorial Comprehensive Report comprises detailed information of the progress from all ASG departments.)_

Tuaolo continued that to date, no new revenue measures or financial proposals have been submitted for the Fono&#39;s review and approval. This lack of transparency, he said, raises questions about fiscal responsibility and legislative oversight, both crucial to maintaining the integrity of government operations.

In light of these issues, Tuaolo urged the government to explore new revenue sources, including the possibility of introducing sales taxes, to ensure the long-term sustainability of vital government services and infrastructure.

In addition to revenue concerns, Tuaolo reminded attendees that funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is expected to expire at the end of 2026, prompting urgent consideration of the territory&#39;s financial strategies.

He further pointed out that while ARPA funding is expected to cover $15 million of the costs for the critical Google cable installation project, the total project budget is $45 million. This raises significant concerns about the remaining $30 million needed to complete the project, prompting Tuaolo to question from where the additional funds will come.

Another issue raised by Tuaolo concerned the immigration bond for foreign nationals seeking to reside in American Samoa.

He urged the Attorney General to consider raising the bond to $10,000, given the increasing number of immigrants arriving in the territory, which has implications for local resources and community dynamics.

**BACKGROUND**

In November, the Attorney General’s office announced new immigration bond fees, which have significantly affected fees across various countries. These new regulations have led to bond amounts doubling for many countries, while approximately 30 others will retain their existing lower bond levels.

Notably, China&#39;s immigration bond remains capped at $2,300, while in contrast, Portugal has the highest bond fees exceeding $5,000, followed by Iran, Israel, and Slovenia, each with bond amounts surpassing $4,000.

        <p>“Until we are certain that we have widespread 100 percent awareness of this fact, it’s helpful to have a reminder to be sure the word is out, and protect friends and family from a legal nightmare.

_Washington, D.C. —_(January 9, 2026) Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata is reminding U.S. nationals from American Samoa that under current U.S. and state laws they absolutely cannot vote in elections outside of American Samoa unless they personally become U.S. citizens before voting.

“It’s incredibly important to not become confused over this: U.S. nationals cannot vote outside our elections in American Samoa.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ As the federal government considers opening U.S. territorial waters to deep sea mining, Pacific Island communities and territorial governments are going on record to oppose the imposition of these activities, warning of irreversible harm to ocean ecosystems, cultural lifeways, and the democratic rights of island peoples.

Just hours before the comment period closes this week, Right to Democracy, in partnership with the America the Beautiful for All Coalition, will host a virtual panel examining the federal call to open the waters of the Marianas to deep sea mining and its implications for island communities, ocean ecosystems, and self-determination.

The panel will feature Andra Samoa, Maria Hernández, and Sheila Babauta, all of whom are Right to Democracy Environment &#38; Democracy Fellows, and will be co-moderated by Neil Weare, Co-Director of Right to Democracy, and Angelo Villagomez, Ocean Co-Lead for the America the Beautiful for All Coalition.

Local and national civil society organizations will announce the results of their respective outreach efforts and successes in submitting petitions, letters, and comments to the federal register.

Special guests include Lt. Governor Joshua Tenorio, Speaker Frank Blas, Jr., and others.

The Virtual Panel Will Take Place:

-           Monday, January 12th at 5:00pm EST, 6:00pm AST, 11:00 am SST (American Samoa)
-           Tuesday, January 13th at 8:00am ChST (Guam / Northern Mariana Islands)

National Capital District (NCD) Governor Powes Parkop was on hand to receive the Baton, marking a key milestone in the Port Moresby leg of the relay. The ceremony highlighted the village&#39;s unique sporting heritage, with the Baton at one point travelling by water to navigate the sprawling overwater.

The campaign, which will focus on promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment, is being hailed as a critical step in addressing one of Papua New Guinea&#39;s most deep-seated social crises.

Madang Governor and Provincial Member Ramsey Pariwa clarified this following recent arrests in Madang town after enforcement began on Thursday, January 1, 2026. Governor Pariwa said the law was enacted by Parliament and carries the same legal weight and penalties as other national laws.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Customers of the Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) have been actively voicing their concerns on social media about a troubling cash-trapping scheme reported at the bank&#39;s Automated Teller Machine (ATM) located within the Laufou Shopping Center in Nuʻuuli.

Several social media accounts have surfaced, detailing allegations that certain individuals have strategically applied tape to the ATM’s cash dispenser. This disturbing tactic is designed to misappropriate customer withdrawals. One account described a troubling incident in which a customer attempted to withdraw funds from an ATM. Although he received a receipt indicating that the transaction was successful, he was shocked to find that no physical cash was dispensed. Upon closer inspection of the cash dispenser, he discovered tape blocking the exit, with the cash he had attempted to withdraw stuck to it.

This alarming incident has since been reported to TBAS management. Cash-trapping scams have become a troubling trend, reported in communities across the United States and internationally. These schemes typically involve placing a device or obstruction over the cash dispenser slot to prevent the release of funds. In these scenarios, the customer’s account is debited, yet no cash is dispensed. Victims often assume the ATM is malfunctioning and leave, allowing the perpetrator to return, remove the obstruction, and claim the trapped cash.

In response to these concerns, TBAS President and Chief Executive Officer Owen Perry addressed local media, confirming the bank&#39;s awareness of the troubling reports. He indicated that TBAS is actively investigating the situation, which appears to be limited to this ATM location for now. “Upon learning about the issue, the bank quickly contacted the Department of Public Safety and is cooperating fully while conducting an internal review,” Perry stated.

Perry further emphasized, “Our ATMs undergo regular monitoring and inspections, and we are continually evaluating and enhancing our security protocols across all locations.” TBAS strongly encourages any customer who experiences difficulties at a TBAS ATM or notices any anomalies to contact the bank immediately, enabling a swift response and resolution.

Due to the ongoing investigation, Perry noted that the bank cannot share specific details about the incidents at this time. “Our top priority is to ensure the safety of our customers while maintaining the integrity of our banking services,” he remarked.

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ The Governor’s Office has officially given notice that parking and driving on the Malae o le Talu will no longer be tolerated. However, there is “no teeth” to the notice, as no fines for the offense are posted and the question of enforcement arises, as the Department of Public Safety has been seen as one of the worst offenders — using the Malae as a parking zone for their vehicles.

In the notice posted on the Office of the Governor’s webpage and addressed to the Secretary of Samoan Affairs, CEOs, Presidents and Executive Directors of Authorities, Directors. Agency and Office Heads — it says in part, “This prohibition applies to all ASG employees, contractors, and agents operating government vehicles, regardless of purpose or duration.”

Effective immediately, the following measures are hereby implemented:

a)      All American Samoa Government (ASG) vehicles and privately owned and operated vehicles are strictly prohibited from driving or parking on the Malae. This prohibition applies to all ASG employees, contractors, and agents operating government vehicles, regardless of purpose or duration.

b)      The Department of Parks and Recreation shall provide technical assistance, resources, and operational support to the village Pulenu’u and Leoleo Nuu in their efforts to protect the Malae.

c)      All ASG personnel and privately owned vehicles must utilize designated or alternate parking areas in proximity to the Malae.

Emergency vehicles responding to actual emergencies may access the Malae only to the extent absolutely necessary to address the emergency situations.

All agency heads, directors, and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that employees under their supervision are informed of and comply with this directive.

Preserving the cultural, historical, and recreational use of the Malae is a matter of territorial significance and requires the full cooperation of all ASG personnel.

A memo, dated December 23, 2025, and signed by Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula notes that “the Malae o le Talu (Malae) has been a central gathering place of profound historical, cultural, and ceremonial significance to the people of American Samoa for over 125 years, hosting village events, governmental functions, and community recreation.

“Vehicular traffic has severely damaged the Malae, compacting soil, destroying grass, and creating unsafe divots, hindering full use and enjoyment of this communal gathering place.”

Samoa News has published photos of the “No Parking” signs on the Malae, especially when the Governor’s Office moved into their new location at the newly renovated old ASB-ANZ Bank building — the Malae o le Talu is located directly across the street. Photos published also included the Department of Public Safety parking their vehicles on the Malae.

There we are, the biggest blackest dot shaded in the region.

Just this week, Congress sent next year’s 3.8 percent pay raise for our military to the President to be signed into law, as part of a busy December.

“We look forward together to all the possibilities for a wonderful new year. May each of us celebrate this special season with joyful and charitable hearts.”

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ In observance of the New Year holiday, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula has announced that the government will officially take two days off — Thursday, January 1, 2026 and Friday, January 2nd. However, Wednesday, while not a holiday, will be a half day, with an early release from work at 12p.m.

As per usual on a government holiday all government offices will be closed, and normal operations will be suspended. Employees of the American Samoa Government who are not required to perform essential services shall be excused from duty. Those employees whose duties are essential and are required to work on these holidays shall receive holiday compensation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

“Government operations shall resume under normal business hours on Monday, January 5th 2026.

“The New Year marks a time of renewal, reflection, and hope as we look ahead to new opportunities and responsibilities. It is also a moment to give thanks for God’s guidance and blessings throughout the past year. Employees are encouraged to spend this time with family and loved ones, reflect on the yer past, and prepare for the year ahead with renewed purpose, unity, and commitment in serving our community.”

Governor Puaali’i extends his sincere appreciation for their continued service and dedication to the people of the Territory. “May the New Year bring you good health, success, and prosperity.

Samoa News should note that the governor is currently off island, with no return date currently announced.

The US Post Office Service will be closed New Year’s Day, returning on Friday, Jan. 2nd, as per normal federal holiday.

The Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) will close early at 12 pm, on Wednesday, December 31, 2025; on Thursday, Jan 1, 2026 it will be closed; and, it will be open on Friday, Jan. 2nd for full service.

Don’t forget American Samoa is the last “inhabited” country to ring in the New Year — if you want to see the last sunset of 2025 in the Territory, take a ride out to Poloa. On the other hand, if you want to experience the first New Year celebration in the world, you need to fly to Samoa, with the holidays experiencing some of the the busiest flight times for the inter-island airlines.

For StarKist Samoa its cannery shutdown continues for the Christmas and New Year holidays. The shutdown allows for major maintenance work and prepares the cannery for the new year, with the company slated to begin production of pet food in 2026.

With more than 80% of the cannery workforce of more than 2,000 being from Samoa, they have headed home for the holidays. The cannery did arrange for a charter of the Lady Samoa ferry to take its employees to Samoa during Christmas week. It’s unknown if a return-trip ferry has been chartered.

The company’s first day of production for 2026 is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 5th.

Usually New Year in the Territory highlights its NY Eve’s church services before the bars begin to fill to ring in the brand new year.

On New Year Day, look for family or company barbecues at the public beaches and parks. Most grocery stores will be open, with specialty stores and companies usually closing on that day, with all returning to full service on Friday.

According to the National Weather Service- Pago Pago, the weather forecast for New Year’s Day is partly cloudy, isolated showers, highs in the upper 80s, and variable winds up to 10 mph. It looks like mostly a sunny day.

From Thursday night through to Friday, its still partly cloudy however, scattered showers are forecast.

Friday night through Sunday, the weather is mostly cloudy with numerous showers — definitely expect rain throughout the weekend.

For the public’s safety, the police are continuing their Enforcement initiative that began about 2 weeks ago, marking the beginning of a focused effort to enhance road safety during the busy festive season.

Commissioner of Public Safety Taaga Saite Moliga announced the Enforcement initiative noting the deployment of strategically placed roadblocks throughout the community to identify and evaluate drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
