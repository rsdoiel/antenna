There we are, the biggest blackest dot shaded in the region. All our teeny tiny neighbours in the Pacific shining bright like diamonds are part of more than 150 countries moving forward while we take a different path we anticipate with this.</p>

Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — In this beautiful photo, Congresswoman Uifa’atali Aumua Amata remembered our loved ones far away due to military service, collegiate studies, or careers in the states.

“May God especially bless and each of them and these families, with ‘many happy returns’ to our island home. This Christmas, we keep our Toa o Samoa especially in our prayers – thank you to each one for your service and sacrifice! Just this week, Congress sent next year’s 3.8 percent pay raise for our military to the President to be signed into law, as part of a busy December.

        <p>As per usual on a government holiday all government offices will be closed, and normal operations will be suspended.

        <p>“The New Year marks a time of renewal, reflection, and hope as we look ahead to new opportunities and responsibilities.

        <p>Governor Puaali’i extends his sincere appreciation for their continued service and dedication to the people of the Territory. “May the New Year bring you good health, success, and prosperity.</p>
        <p>Samoa News should note that the governor is currently off island, with no return date currently announced.</p>

        <p>Don’t forget American Samoa is the last “inhabited” country to ring in the New Year — if you want to see the last sunset of 2025 in the Territory, take a ride out to Poloa.

        <p>With more than 80% of the cannery workforce of more than 2,000 being from Samoa, they have headed home for the holidays.

        <p>In a historic breakthrough for the Motu-Koitabu people, more than ten homebrew producers in Hanuabada have voluntarily surrendered their distillation equipment, marking a major step toward ending the village’s long-standing struggle with illicit alcohol.</p>
        <p>The voluntary surrender followed a targeted operation spearheaded by the Chairman of the Motu-Koitabu Assembly (MKA), Russell S. Wavik, aimed at dismantling the rampant sale of "faiya-wara" and the illegal display of alcohol at the Hanuabada roadside market.</p>

In a historic breakthrough for the Motu-Koitabu people, more than ten homebrew producers in Hanuabada have voluntarily surrendered their distillation equipment, marking a major step toward ending the village’s long-standing struggle with illicit alcohol.

The voluntary surrender followed a targeted operation spearheaded by the Chairman of the Motu-Koitabu Assembly (MKA), Russell S. Wavik, aimed at dismantling the rampant sale of &#34;faiya-wara&#34; and the illegal display of alcohol at the Hanuabada roadside market.

They are now scheduled to face the Ohio State ‘Buckeyes’ (No.2) in the Cotton Bowl that is set to kick off on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2025.</p>
        <p>Mauigoa was named Consensus All-American, by the NCAA last Friday. The 6’6, 335lbs anchors a 11-2 Miami Hurricanes team who have much improved from their 10-3 record from last season.</p>
        <p>To be named a Consensus All-American, a student-athlete must receive First Team All-America honors from at least three of the five NCAA-recognized selectors: the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.</p>
        <p>According to the University of Florida’s recent media release, Mauigoa, received First Team honors from The Sporting News, the Associated Press and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. He anchored an offensive line that powered one of the ACC’s most productive rushing attacks, as Miami totaled 2,456 rushing yards while averaging 188.9 yards per game and 5.7 yards per carry. The Hurricanes also scored 30 rushing touchdowns and limited negative plays, allowing just 203 yards lost on the ground throughout the season.</p>
        <p>Francis graduated earlier this month with his Bachelor of Science degree in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s in just three years. Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive.</p>

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ Son of American Samoa – Francis Mauigoa from the village of Ili’ili, continues to wreak havoc on the football field with the University of Miami “Hurricanes” (No.10), who defeated the Texas A&#38;M (No.7) in a historic 10 - 3 victory this past weekend. They are now scheduled to face the Ohio State ‘Buckeyes’ (No.2) in the Cotton Bowl that is set to kick off on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2025.

Mauigoa was named Consensus All-American, by the NCAA last Friday. The 6’6, 335lbs anchors a 11-2 Miami Hurricanes team who have much improved from their 10-3 record from last season.

To be named a Consensus All-American, a student-athlete must receive First Team All-America honors from at least three of the five NCAA-recognized selectors: the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.

According to the University of Florida’s recent media release, Mauigoa, received First Team honors from The Sporting News, the Associated Press and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. He anchored an offensive line that powered one of the ACC’s most productive rushing attacks, as Miami totaled 2,456 rushing yards while averaging 188.9 yards per game and 5.7 yards per carry. The Hurricanes also scored 30 rushing touchdowns and limited negative plays, allowing just 203 yards lost on the ground throughout the season.

Francis graduated earlier this month with his Bachelor of Science degree in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s in just three years. Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive.

**_University of Miami graduate Francis Mauigoa, posing with his parent Fa’alialia and Telesia Mauigoa, during his graduation earlier this month, (December 11, 2025). Francis graduated with his Bachelor’s of Science in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s degree in three years – Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive. \[photo: courtesy\]_**

Mauigoa who is rumored to be a first round draft pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, is the son of Telesia and Fa’alialia Mauigoa of Ili’ili. His older brother and former teammate, Francisco Mauigoa currently plays linebacker for the New York Jets Football Team.

**KEIKI MISIPEKA — PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI**

Adding to the significant changes within the University of Miami football program is another Son of Samoa, Keiki Misipeka. Misipeka works in recruiting and personnel and has been part of the program for nearly a year.

During his career, Misipeka has helped and assisted numerous student-athletes from American Samoa, guiding them to Division I and junior college football opportunities. He previously served as the General Manager of Football at the University of Hawaiʻi, taking over the role for the Rainbow Warriors in 2024 after spending two seasons as the running backs coach.

Prior to his time coaching in the Mountain West Conference, Misipeka served as an NFL International Scout for the International Player Pathway (IPP) Program, where he was responsible for scouting the Pacific region, including American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand.

Misipeka is the son of the late Kelemete and Iolani Misipeka of Fagatogo.

        <p>IT was the night before Christmas, when of all the places to speed around a bend from, this driver decided to speed into the drain just outside our office. An alcohol fuelled mishap that caused him to skid into our drain ready for our cameras on Christmas coverage operations. Only thing going for him this Christmas was the cops eventually letting him off the hook to recover what looked like a very brand new slick ride now wrecked beyond recognition. We hope the cops are not as forgiving of other naughty motorists tonight.</p>

_Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —_ The Department of Public Safety officially launched its Holiday Enforcement initiative last Friday, marking the beginning of a focused effort to enhance road safety during the busy festive season.

The sobriety roadblock was held in front of the CBT building in Nu’uuli, where close to 20 police officers were working.

Commissioner of Public Safety Taaga Saite Moliga has announced the deployment of strategically placed roadblocks throughout the community to identify and evaluate drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

These roadblocks will be strategically placed in response to real-time traffic patterns, focusing on high-traffic areas during peak travel periods to maximize visibility and effectiveness.

The last weekend before Christmas typically sees a surge in social gatherings, as numerous businesses host their annual holiday parties and end-of-year celebrations. This increase in festivities correlates with a heightened risk of impaired driving, underscoring the importance of vigilance during this critical time.

In response to these concerns, Commissioner Moliga is urging all community members to collaborate in fostering a culture of safety and awareness. The goal is to ensure the holiday season remains celebratory while minimizing the risks of impaired driving.

To support this initiative, the Department of Public Safety will maintain its Holiday Enforcement program, which will extend through January 3, 2026.

DPS says this initiative underscores its unwavering commitment to safeguarding public safety throughout the festive season and beyond, ensuring that all community members can enjoy a joyous, accident-free holiday period.

        <![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to toughen military helicopter safety rules and rescind a provision in the annual defense bill that critics said would have weakened aviation safety. Republican Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz on Wednesday won unanimous consent to approve a revised version of legislation that would require aircraft operators by the end of 2031 to equip their fleets with an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system, also known as ADS-B. The bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, also boosts oversight of commercial jet and helicopter traffic and flight routes near commercial airports. Aviation safety in the Washington area has come under scrutiny after the January 29 collision near Reagan Washington National Airport of an American Airlines regional jet and Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people. Cruz said the bill will save lives and &#8220;be a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River.&#8221;</p>]]>

Air Niugini is positioning its new Airbus A220 aircraft as a key strategic tool for expanding its international reach and increasing market competition, particularly on the busy Australian routes. The A220s are seen as vital to the future of the nation&#39;s aviation sector, facilitating the movement of business people, workers, and students, and opening up tourism and shipping goods to market.

The added advantage of the A220 is its versatility; it carries more passengers and cargo than the older Fokker aircraft and has the range necessary for extensive travel.

        <p>In a joint press release issued by the Ministry of Customs and Revenue and the Samoa Police, it was revealed that the first incident involved a targeted operation in which Customs officials identified a suspect upon arrival on the final flight from American Samoa on Friday, December 12, 2025.</p>
        <p>A body search was initiated under the legal provisions of the Customs Act, with police assistance required due to the suspect’s reluctance to cooperate. During the search, officers discovered a small bag concealed inside the suspect’s underwear containing five packages. All packages subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine, with a combined weight of 141 grams.</p>

/></p>
        <p>Authorities noted that the successful interception highlights the determination of criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa using any concealment method, including hiding substances in private areas.</p>
        <p>The suspect, a 32‑year‑old male from Vaitele and Nu’u, has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of methamphetamine carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
        <p>The second incident occurred on Saturday morning, December 13, 2025, when Customs officials intercepted 6.032 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken at Matautu Wharf. The shipment, which originated from American Samoa, had been flagged for inspection based on intelligence.</p>
        <p>During the search, officers uncovered two vacuum‑packed packages of methamphetamine hidden within the frozen chicken. Authorities noted that this concealment method reflects the continued attempts by criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa disguised as ordinary goods.</p>
        <p>A 59‑year‑old male from To’omatagi has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of Class A narcotics carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
        <p>These two cases represent the seventh methamphetamine interception at Samoa’s borders this year, following the historic seizure of 9.4 kilograms of methamphetamine in January.</p>
        <p>The Chief Executive Officer of Customs and the Commissioner of Police jointly expressed deep concern over the continued attempts to smuggle methamphetamine into Samoa. They emphasized the devastating impact of the drug on families, particularly young people, noting that addiction is escalating and can result in severe harm and even fatalities.</p>
        <p>Both leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to protecting Samoa’s borders and safeguarding the well-being of its people.</p>
        <p>“Customs and Police remain steadfast in our determination to identify and dismantle drug networks,” they declared in the joint press release. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all those <u>responsible face justice</u>, and to secure a safe, secure, and prosperous Samoa.”</p>
        <p>They cautioned individuals involved in illicit drug activities to desist from bringing narcotics into the country, warning that anyone who persists will face severe penalties, including lengthy prison terms.</p>
        <p>These operations underscore the importance of close interagency collaboration in combating transnational crime, as highlighted in the joint campaign “Say No to Illegal Drugs / Tete’e atu i Fuala’au Fa’asaina.”</p>
        <p>Both leaders commended the professionalism and vigilance demonstrated by all officers involved, noting that the successful operations reflect the continued effectiveness of Samoa’s joint border security efforts.</p>
        <p>Of the seven methamphetamine interceptions recorded by Samoan authorities in 2025, four were linked to shipments from American Samoa, while the others originated from the United States.</p>
        <p>November 27, 2025: 10 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a can of milk powder (Coffee Mate) were discovered in a shipment from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
        <p>November 28, 2025: 99 grams of methamphetamine were intercepted during a routine cargo inspection of goods from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
        <p>The other two American Samoa cases — the 141 grams concealed in underwear and the 6.032 kilograms hidden in frozen chicken — are detailed earlier in this article.</p>
        <p>There has been speculation that methamphetamine smuggling into Samoa from the Territory had been occurring for some time before the first official interception on November 27, 2025.</p>
        <p>This speculation may have prompted then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo to remark to the media in July this year, that American Samoa was the most common route for methamphetamine entering the country. However, he did not provide specific details or evidence to substantiate his claims.</p>
        <p>The remarks by Samoa’s former Police Commissioner did not sit well with Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, who argued that the government should investigate the matter thoroughly. He emphasized that such claims reflect poorly on American Samoa and must not go unchallenged.</p>
        <p>The issue was also raised in the House of Representatives, prompting the Chairman of the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Avagafono Vaimaga Maiava, to write to Samoa’s then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo. In his letter, Rep. Avagafono stressed that “such claims are serious and, unless supported by concrete evidence, are highly damaging to the reputation of American Samoa, a United States territory that upholds strict drug enforcement policies and border control procedures.”</p>
        <p>Rep. Avagafono, himself a former Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, noted in his August 11 letter that the Commissioner’s “comments unfortunately appear to be baseless and not grounded in verifiable facts.” He informed Samoa’s Police leadership that the Legislature had convened a hearing to investigate the claims, during which testimony was received from relevant government departments, including Customs, Public Safety, and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
        <p>“It was clearly stated that American Samoa is neither a producer of methamphetamine nor a known point of origin for its export to Samoa or any other country,” he wrote.</p>
        <p>Despite his criticism, Rep. Avagafono urged cooperation rather than division between the two Samoas in tackling the drug problem.</p>
        <p>“Going forward, we believe this shared issue of transnational drug trafficking requires deeper cooperation, not division, between the two Samoas. We encourage the establishment of structured and regular consultations between our respective law enforcement and customs agencies. Collaboration, intelligence sharing, and joint task force efforts are far more effective than unilateral public statements.”</p>
        <p>“The fight against drugs is a mutual responsibility that requires trust, open dialogue, and coordinated action. We hope this matter can serve as an opportunity to strengthen our working relationship, rather than weaken it,” Rep. Avagafono concluded.</p>

_Apia, SAMOA —_(December 15, 2025) A combined total of 6.173 kilograms of methamphetamine, smuggled from American Samoa, was intercepted by Samoa Customs officials in two separate operations at the independent state’s international air and sea ports over the weekend.

In a joint press release issued by the Ministry of Customs and Revenue and the Samoa Police, it was revealed that the first incident involved a targeted operation in which Customs officials identified a suspect upon arrival on the final flight from American Samoa on Friday, December 12, 2025.

A body search was initiated under the legal provisions of the Customs Act, with police assistance required due to the suspect’s reluctance to cooperate. During the search, officers discovered a small bag concealed inside the suspect’s underwear containing five packages. All packages subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine, with a combined weight of 141 grams.

Authorities noted that the successful interception highlights the determination of criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa using any concealment method, including hiding substances in private areas.

The suspect, a 32‑year‑old male from Vaitele and Nu’u, has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of methamphetamine carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

The second incident occurred on Saturday morning, December 13, 2025, when Customs officials intercepted 6.032 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken at Matautu Wharf. The shipment, which originated from American Samoa, had been flagged for inspection based on intelligence.

During the search, officers uncovered two vacuum‑packed packages of methamphetamine hidden within the frozen chicken. Authorities noted that this concealment method reflects the continued attempts by criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa disguised as ordinary goods.

A 59‑year‑old male from To’omatagi has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of Class A narcotics carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

These two cases represent the seventh methamphetamine interception at Samoa’s borders this year, following the historic seizure of 9.4 kilograms of methamphetamine in January.

The Chief Executive Officer of Customs and the Commissioner of Police jointly expressed deep concern over the continued attempts to smuggle methamphetamine into Samoa. They emphasized the devastating impact of the drug on families, particularly young people, noting that addiction is escalating and can result in severe harm and even fatalities.

Both leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to protecting Samoa’s borders and safeguarding the well-being of its people.

“Customs and Police remain steadfast in our determination to identify and dismantle drug networks,” they declared in the joint press release. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all those responsible face justice, and to secure a safe, secure, and prosperous Samoa.”

They cautioned individuals involved in illicit drug activities to desist from bringing narcotics into the country, warning that anyone who persists will face severe penalties, including lengthy prison terms.

These operations underscore the importance of close interagency collaboration in combating transnational crime, as highlighted in the joint campaign “Say No to Illegal Drugs / Tete’e atu i Fuala’au Fa’asaina.”

Both leaders commended the professionalism and vigilance demonstrated by all officers involved, noting that the successful operations reflect the continued effectiveness of Samoa’s joint border security efforts.

Of the seven methamphetamine interceptions recorded by Samoan authorities in 2025, four were linked to shipments from American Samoa, while the others originated from the United States.

November 27, 2025: 10 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a can of milk powder (Coffee Mate) were discovered in a shipment from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.

November 28, 2025: 99 grams of methamphetamine were intercepted during a routine cargo inspection of goods from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.

The other two American Samoa cases — the 141 grams concealed in underwear and the 6.032 kilograms hidden in frozen chicken — are detailed earlier in this article.

There has been speculation that methamphetamine smuggling into Samoa from the Territory had been occurring for some time before the first official interception on November 27, 2025.

This speculation may have prompted then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo to remark to the media in July this year, that American Samoa was the most common route for methamphetamine entering the country. However, he did not provide specific details or evidence to substantiate his claims.

The remarks by Samoa’s former Police Commissioner did not sit well with Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, who argued that the government should investigate the matter thoroughly. He emphasized that such claims reflect poorly on American Samoa and must not go unchallenged.

The issue was also raised in the House of Representatives, prompting the Chairman of the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Avagafono Vaimaga Maiava, to write to Samoa’s then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo. In his letter, Rep. Avagafono stressed that “such claims are serious and, unless supported by concrete evidence, are highly damaging to the reputation of American Samoa, a United States territory that upholds strict drug enforcement policies and border control procedures.”

Rep. Avagafono, himself a former Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, noted in his August 11 letter that the Commissioner’s “comments unfortunately appear to be baseless and not grounded in verifiable facts.” He informed Samoa’s Police leadership that the Legislature had convened a hearing to investigate the claims, during which testimony was received from relevant government departments, including Customs, Public Safety, and other law enforcement agencies.

“It was clearly stated that American Samoa is neither a producer of methamphetamine nor a known point of origin for its export to Samoa or any other country,” he wrote.

Despite his criticism, Rep. Avagafono urged cooperation rather than division between the two Samoas in tackling the drug problem.

“Going forward, we believe this shared issue of transnational drug trafficking requires deeper cooperation, not division, between the two Samoas. We encourage the establishment of structured and regular consultations between our respective law enforcement and customs agencies. Collaboration, intelligence sharing, and joint task force efforts are far more effective than unilateral public statements.”

“The fight against drugs is a mutual responsibility that requires trust, open dialogue, and coordinated action. We hope this matter can serve as an opportunity to strengthen our working relationship, rather than weaken it,” Rep. Avagafono concluded.

• Mia Mottley is the prime minister of Barbados

The timing is brutal. Just as the world celebrates the [10th anniversary](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary) of the adoption of the Paris climate agreement this month, new evidence shows that the world is crashing through the main defence that was constructed against climate catastrophe.

The three-year temperature average is – for the first time – set to exceed the Paris guardrail of 1.5C above preindustrial levels. According to the [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record), 2025 will join 2023 and 2024 as the three warmest since the Industrial Revolution, reflecting the accelerating pace of the climate crisis.
