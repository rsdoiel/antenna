      <h1>Developers’ fireside chat – 10th January</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>The opportunity has once again come around for people involved or interested in software development on, for, or even of RISC OS to gather together and discuss matters relevant to the topic. The next friendly fireside chat is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 10th January. The meetings – which are held online, using the Zoom video conferencing system – don’t follow a set agenda. Instead, the discussion topics are down to those people present, and what they wish to bring up or ask about. For example, at the last…</p>

      <h1>Celebrate ten years of the Titanium with WROCC – 7th January</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>Back in October 2015, there was a surprise announcement something visitors to that year’s London Show could expect to see – a new motherboard, designed by Rob Sprowson, with RISC OS in mind; the Titanium. The board itself became available through Rob’s company Elesar Ltd in December of that year, allowing people to build DIY machines around it, and it wasn’t long before there were complete Titanium-based computer systems available from both R-Comp and CJE Micro’s. That was a touch over a decade ago, and Rob Sprowson will be taking…</p>

The first-person shooter and the real-time-strategy game, those two genres that had come to absolutely dominate mainstream computer gaming by the end of the 1990s, were surprisingly different in their core technologies. The FPS was all about 3D graphics, as aided and abetted by the […]</p>

      <h1>FlagQuiz 1.02 released</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Kevin Wells has released another new version of FlagQuiz, his application that allows users to test their knowledge and recognition of national flags. Version 1.02 addresses a fairly basic issue in the program, whereby the sprites file containing the various flags used by the program were loaded into the WIMP sprite pool. Unless a program specifically needs its sprites held there, this is bad practice because it risks an application’s sprites being used in place of ones used by the system. Kevin has therefore updated FlagQuiz to store its sprites…</p>
