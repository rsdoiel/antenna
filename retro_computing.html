The next friendly fireside chat is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 10th January. The meetings – which are held online, using the Zoom video conferencing system – don’t follow a set agenda.

The board itself became available through Rob’s company Elesar Ltd in December of that year, allowing people to build DIY machines around it, and it wasn’t long before there were complete Titanium-based computer systems available from both R-Comp and CJE Micro’s. That was a touch over a decade ago, and Rob Sprowson will be taking…</p>

      <p>
      <p>Kevin Wells has released another new version of FlagQuiz, his application that allows users to test their knowledge and recognition of national flags. Version 1.02 addresses a fairly basic issue in the program, whereby the sprites file containing the various flags used by the program were loaded into the WIMP sprite pool. Unless a program specifically needs its sprites held there, this is bad practice because it risks an application’s sprites being used in place of ones used by the system. Kevin has therefore updated FlagQuiz to store its sprites…</p>

      <h1>Stewart Cheifet has died</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Very sorry to hear about <a href="https://obits.goldsteinsfuneral.com/stewart-cheifet">the death of Stewart Cheifet</a> at 87, long-time host of Computer Chronicles, which for a long time was the undisputed best show on computers on American public broadcasting. I watched it on PBS TV as a kid, and candidly I didn't understand much of what was going on at the time, but I learned a lot and rewatching the episodes now really demonstrates what a treasure trove of pithy information and industry commentary they were. Gary Kildall, of Digital Research fame, was his co-host in many 1980s episodes and the most notable of an august crew that also included George Morrow and Paul Schindler, but Cheifet was the linchpin and carried the show on his formidable shoulders from its 1984 start until the final episode in 2002. The most amazing part of his work, however, is what happened after: the vast majority of the program is <a href="https://archive.org/details/Computer_Chronicles">preserved for posterity at the Internet Archive</a>, not just with his blessing, but with his active participation. For any computer historian and student of the early industry, the show is not to be missed. Rest in peace.</p>

      <h1>Transform a Commodore 1541 into a KIM-1</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>By replacing the ROM(s) of a Commodore 1541 disk drive it can be made in a KIM-1. Well, it runs the KIM-1 ROM modified to use the 6522 driving the IEC bus as TTY serial input/output. The ROM is also moved to E000 for obvious reasons (the 1541 is unchanged!). Only serial TTY, no LED, […]</p>

      <p>The MCS6530-005 was known to me only by some lines in MOS pricelist and a remark in an OSI appnote as a 6530 without ROM. It is therefore no RRIOT but a RIOT (RAM I/O Timer). I have acquired several MCS6530-005 ICs and tested with the Backbit Pro Chiptester V2 and indeed it passes all […]</p>

      <h1>A Christmas 2007 video present from Old VCR with Jack Tramiel et al</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>A very happy holiday season and Merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate it (timezone may vary). Also, I don't think I nearly say thanks enough to my regular patrons through Ko-fi, and I want to also thank them on behalf of the geriatric systems their generosity — and all of you who have chipped in at one time or another — helps keep running. I've got more projects to finish in 2026 and I hope you enjoy them.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a gift for <em>you</em> which I forgot I still had kicking around. This is a raw cut from the 2007 Computer History Museum 25th anniversary symposium of the Commodore 64, with Jack Tramiel himself, plus Steve Wozniak, William Lowe and others (like Lee Felsenstein and Al Alcorn from the audience). I was fortunate enough to get into what was a sell-out standing-room only crowd with my trusty JVC DV camera and tape the whole thing, then dash back to So Cal and quickly dump and title it on the Power Mac Quad G5. Any camera glitches, plus a couple dropouts where I had to quickly change DV tapes, and bad titles are of course totally my fault. (In fact, there are indeed at least two errors. Can you find them?) This video is so old that it was actually originally uploaded to Google Video — some of you may remember it — and had been quietly transferred automatically to YouTube, which I had forgotten even happened. So here it is in its original strictly standard definition format. If you want to use clips from it in your own video, please give me a holler first in the comments. Enjoy.</p>

      <h1>Custom Cross Compiler with Nix</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>This post is about trying to do something seemingly simple. You have an unusual
system that you want to write code for. You even have a cross compiler! But
how can you get this working with nix? Although the answer turned out to be
simple, the journey to getting there was super long and undocumented. I hope
this post saves you a lot of time!</p>
<h2>My Motivations  <a href="#my-motivations">Link to heading</a></h2>
<p>I have a deep love for an operating system called <a href="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/">Risc Os</a>. It is a really old operating system made by Acorn Computers Ltd. for their Archimedes range of computers
and you can still run it on Raspberry Pi! I love it for a few reasons:</p>
