write a bytecode interpreter in… many programming languages!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-11, from: Paola Zaino’s blog</p>
<p>In my career, quite a few of my co-workers have had wild dreams of
creating their own bytecode interpreter virtual machine (VM). Some have
actually taken the plunge and attempted it. The allure of this magical
endeavor still captivates many. And let’s not forget about “that
colleague” who’s convinced that everything needs to be rewritten […]</p>

Because the LTS Linux kernel releases are so important to Android,
Google has decided to extend the support period beyond that offered by
the kernel development team.

Visions of the Impossible – 15th July</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>They’ll see things you people wouldn’t believe. The RISC OS User
Group of London (ROUGOL) next meets up on Monday, 15th July, and this
month they’ll be hallucinating. No, wait, I meant they’ll have Nathan
Atkinson from Visions of the Impossible as their guest speaker. Visions
of the Impossible (or VotI) were a programming group active in the
1990s, and brought a number of titles to the RISC OS platform, including
games, demos, and utilities. One of their more well known games was
Sunburst, a game in which you may…</p>

meeting – 11th July</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>The next meeting of Bristol RISC OS Users (BRU) will take place on
Thursday, 11th September. The group meets on an informal basis for a
chat over a meal, a drink and bite to eat, so there is usually no set
topic or formal speaker; it’s usually a case of discussing the latest
RISC OS news and developments, and often beyond into the wider world.
However, sometimes members might bring along their own latest projects –
or problems – for the group to look at. If you live in or…</p>

support for multiple languages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>A new version of StreetFix has been released by Kevin Wells. The
software provides a means for RISC OS users to report and check upon
local issues, such as damaged street furniture, potholes in the road,
and so on – all from within an application on the RISC OS desktop,
rather than via a web browser. The updated application now stands at
version 1.08, and the two changes Kevin has highlighted with this
release are the addition of Australia as a country in which the software
can be used, and…</p>

<a href="/content/sales/risc-os-epic/epic-contents">huge bundle</a> of

<p>The title probably caught your attention: Snow Leopard on a PowerPC
Mac… wait a minute, Apple didn’t support that combination! This is true,
but like so many other unsupported hardware/software configurations,
this combination is possible. This post describes how I was able to get
a developer preview of Snow Leopard up and running on my […]</p>
