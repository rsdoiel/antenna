2 TB HDD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: Happy Macs site</p>
<p>I recently pgraded my PowerMac G5 DP 2.3 GHz with a WD Blue 2 TB HDD
(spinner, not SSD). I had not planned to post about it, but the results
were impressive enough that I thought I should pass them on. Upgrading
an HDD is a fairly low impact way to achieve significant performance
improvements. […]</p>

Leopard and AquaFox – A Winning Combination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: Happy Macs site</p>
<p>Post Body: In a recent post, I introduced AquaFox, a revived
TenFourFox-based PPC web browser. In my initial testing of it, AquaFox
looked very promising indeed and so I decided to put it to the ultimate
test – accessing a banking web site. This may sound like a very ordinary
task, but banking web sites […]</p>

<p>Previous posts have detailed how to install Sorbet Leopard and
explained why it is superior to the base Leopard release itself. So,
with Sorbet Leopard now installed and operational, what can you DO with
it? Well, it turns out that you can do a LOT! The lineup of applications

<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: Happy Macs site</p>
<p>In the 17 years since Apple stopped sales of the last PowerPC
Macintoshes in favor of Intel equivalents, PowerMac enthusiasts have
kept the platform alive with regular software updates, new apps and
more. A classic example of this was TenFourFox, a G4/G5-targeted version
of Mozilla Firefox. Cameron Kaiser kept TenFourFox current for a great

Users meeting – 12th September</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>The next meeting of Bristol RISC OS Users (BRU) will take place on
Thursday, 12th September. The group meets on an informal basis for a
chat over a meal, a drink and bite to eat, so there is usually no set
topic or formal speaker; it’s usually a case of discussing the latest
RISC OS news and developments, and often beyond into the wider world.
However, sometimes members might bring along their own latest projects –
or problems – for the group to look at, and this month Chris Hall…</p>

<p>If you use VATGST from Kevin Wells, there is a new version for you to
download. Version 1.03 of the software is only a small update, adding
recognition of and response to the F3 key to pop up a Save dialogue box
if there is anything to be saved. The application offers a handy way to
check if an entity that is charging either Value Added Tax (VAT) or
Goods and Services Tax (GST) in those countries is legitimately
registered. If they are, they should provide a registration number,

<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Format is a disk formatting program. It creates FAT file systems and
low-level formats floppy disks. Jeremy has shared FreeDOS Format 0.92a
(a test release) with these new features: - fix failure formatting on
first diskette access (GitHub issue #5) - initial translated message
support; currently supports most of messages in FR and TR (some have
been added since last updated) thanks to cardpuncher (Berki Yenigün).
Translations are done using kitten, but in a format compatible with
Tom’s kittenc implementation. See NLS.EN for all currently supported
messages for translation, about 462 strings. Get the new version at

0.92a</a> on GitHub.

<em>This is a test release based on the new Format 0.92. From the August
8 announcement:</em> Jeremy has published a new version of FreeDOS
Format to fix several reported bugs, and merged a pull request adding
128KB cluster support. You can download the new version from
