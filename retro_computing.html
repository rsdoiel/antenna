North</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-27, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Having software to run on your RISC OS computer is all well and good
– but every one knows the most important type of software of all is the
type that entertains, and engages in an interactive way: Games Even if
you don’t play computer games yourself, and might want to sit down with
a spreadsheet, or while away the hours with a word processor, there’s a
good chance you have family members who would prefer to just play. So
here’s a quick round up of possible sources of computer…</p>

to RISC OS North: ECOS5 – FAST Linux Inside Your RISC OS World</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-27, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>With just two days to go until RISC OS North, another announcement
has landed on the virtual doormat of the relocated RISCOSitory bunker –
so with no further ado, it’s over to Andy Marks from RISCOSbits:
Building on the ‘award-winning’ success of Wispy, and ECOS (easy
concurrent operating system) RISCOSbits is proud to unveil ECOS5 – an
upgraded internal hardware solution that brings the full power of Linux
into your RISCOSbits ITX-based FAST NVMe and SATA systems. Harnessing
the raw power of the Compute Module 5, ECOS5 delivers 4GB RAM…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>The list of exhibitors lined up for RISC OS North isn’t limited to
just the world of modern RISC OS computing. Some will also cater to
older platforms – and that doesn’t just mean older RISC OS platforms. If
you have an Acorn Electron, for example, you should make your way to the
Retro Hardware stand, where you’ll be able to find “all things
Electron”. For slightly newer machines, Retro Hardware will also have a
32-bit DMA EIDI hard drive interface for A7000, A7000+, and RiscPCs –
and some software,…</p>

<p>The Soft Rock Software ‘Collection’ – available on USB flash drive or

the new RISC OS North event on Saturday, 29th March in Warrington. The
Collection gathers together all of the software currently available to
download for free from Soft Rock’s website, and adds more to it. The
first edition included a number of budget games written by Vince Hudd
from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, website maintenance tool WebChange

<p>As with any computer system, when using RISC OS you’ll need software
to run on it – and you’ll be certain to have some already. As an
existing user you’ll have built up a collection of applications you use,
and may want to add to it. And as a new user you’ll have discovered that
there is some supplied with the operating system – though how much
depends on how you got started – and you almost certainly will want to
add to it. So where do you go for…</p>

<h2 id="xcopy-version-1.8b">Xcopy version 1.8b</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Xcopy is a standard DOS command that copies a directory tree. Jeremy has
fixed several bugs in Xcopy and has released version 1.8b. Fixed this
release: rework recursive xcopy to not use as much stack space, increase
stack size when built with Open Watcom, and the <em>listmode</em> ‘/L’
option should not create directory structure (only simulate). Get the
new version from Jeremy’s

Jeremy has released an updated version of the FreeDOS Move command,

<p>RISC OS Developments are behind the next announcement in my queue, so
over to Richard and Andrew for this joint announcement: RISC OS
Developments is pleased to announce the release of two new software
updates ahead of the RISC OS North show next weekend. Pinboard 2.07
Pinboard 2.07 is the latest version of the enhanced Pinboard/desktop
which we launched last year. It adds the ability to “iconise” sticky
notes so that they don’t take as much desktop space, and improves saving
of stickies for more natural behaviour. Occasional icon drift…</p>

<p>Another announcement from Andrew Rawnsley of R-Comp, this time with
his RCi hat on: We are pleased to announce that Pi 5 technology is now
available in our Hydra computers, and as an optional add-on for N.Ex.T
boxes. The 64-bit only Pi 5 offers a significant performance boost over
the previous generation, with improvements to processing, but also
storage and general server capabilities. As such, it offers a noticeable
upgrade to the Hydra, making additional heads both faster and smoother,
as well as improving file sharing performance. Sadly RISC OS…</p>

that means two things. Firstly, things are hectic here in the bunker as
I prepare for the show myself – and to make matters worse, I will be
temporarily relocating the bunker. And let me tell you, that is not an
easy task. Secondly, it means all the announcements start landing in my

writing about them. Here’s the first in my queue, from R-Comp:…</p>

operating system is to attend your local user group – and a few will be
represented at this event: The Wakefield RISC OS User Group (WROCC) is a
particularly notable one. It was WROCC that organised the Wakefield Show
and, with it not possible this year for them to run it again, they have
chosen to sponsor this event. They hold regular online meetings (so
being local to them isn’t an issue), with guest speakers, and…</p>
