<h2 id="so-thieves-broke-into-your-storage-unit---again">So thieves
broke into your storage unit - again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: Old Ventage Computing Research</p>
If you’ve been wondering why entries have been a little slow lately, let
me tell you a story.
<p>
All collectors tend to be a bit obsessive by nature, and us classic
computer nerds probably pick up more hardware than we can (or should)
store in our residence — especially if the loves of our lives aren’t as
enthusiastic about the hobby than we are — and thus have storage units
for the overflow. I have two small “cold” climate control units, kept
small so that I can be out of one or both relatively quickly, as well as
a larger “hot” conventional unit at ambient temperature. The hot unit is
indoors and not exposed directly to the sun, so it’s not particularly
hot for sunny southern California, but I keep working spare electronics,
hard disks, tapes, etc. in the cold units as a precaution and use the
hot unit for non-working parts units, books, magazines and other
household items.
<p>
Of course, climate control units cost more, sometimes substantially, and
thieves use this as a signal that more valuable stuff is likely to be
kept there:
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
Both times I’ve been burglarized, they were the cold units. August was
the second time. So, with crime being a nationwide topic, let’s talk
about what happens when your storage unit gets broken into and how to
recover from it.
<p>
<a name='more'></a> The first time was not quite two decades ago at a
now defunct national chain. I was obviously rather younger then and
didn’t recognize that these units were incredibly poorly secured: they
had simple plywood doors that opened out as opposed to metal roll-ups,
the “latch” (such as it was) was just a regular safety hasp your padlock
went on, and the door hinges were completely exposed. The exterior door
to the climate control units (because there must be one to keep the
climate controlled air in) was a regular unlocked door without any
security cameras. According to the police, a couple of tweekers decided
to use the climate units as free air conditioned apartments and
intermittently took up residence in many of them, including mine. I had
the good sense to use a disc lock instead of a regular padlock, but
while they may have been drug-addled they turned out to be smarter than
I was. Instead of attacking the lock they just pulled the hinge pins
(only two) and got in without even touching the door, the lock or the
hasp, and then were able to pull the door closed and escape discovery on
walkthrus. By moving around they apparently weren’t noticed for days.
<p>
When a storage unit is hit, the police report that the facility files
and any insurance claim they make are completely separate from yours.
They may or may not use information from you, but you still have to file
your own. During their vacation in my two units they stole and likely
hocked my family’s Panasonic VHS video camera, which didn’t have any
tapes we cared about but would have been fun to keep, as well as my
first digital camera, an Olympus Camedia something or other that used
SmartMedia and still had some photos on it I realized later I never
downloaded, a Fisher-Price PXL2000 (the famous pixelicious video camera
that uses regular audio cassettes instead of videotape) I had in its
original box that I got to use exactly once, and my spare boxed Mattel
Intellivision. They also stole a few items from my highway signs
collection and even spray-painted a couple I suppose for lulz, and
generously left some rather grotty drug paraphernalia and dirty blankets
in trade which the police took as evidence.
<p>
Only one of those items was recovered, the Intellivision (the one item I
cared about <em>least</em> since that was a totally spare unit). It
turned up at a pawn shop on the other side of the freeway. California
law, at least at that time, said that the pawn shop had to be reimbursed
what they paid: they couldn’t sell it to you at retail, but they also
were to be made whole. I went over with someone from the police
department and I think it cost me $60 to recover it; I still have it.
The cop also quietly pointed out all the things that were wrong with the
storage units and told me to get out the rest of my stuff and leave at
my earliest opportunity since they would almost certainly be hit again.
<p>
But what about making <em>me</em> whole? I was required to have
insurance on the units, but I just had an apartment at the time and
didn’t carry renter’s insurance, so I paid a premium as part of my
rental fees to the chain’s “insurance partner.” If this smells like a
kickback deal, you’re right, and virtually every self-storage company
engages in it. The idea is to offer you something cheap so that the
insurance company will then protect the storage company by deflecting
claims. The insurance is cheap because it sucks. I had a police report,
obviously, but when I tried to submit the claims for each unit — on
paper, as we did in the Dark Ages at the beginning of the 21st century —
they were rejected for insufficient documentation (because who keeps a
receipt for the Intellivision you bought five years ago from a thrift
store?) and I was hardly in a position to sue them over it.
<p>
As the cop instructed, I bailed out of there a couple months later. The
doors had not been upgraded, there was still no lock on the exterior
entrance, and the manager said installing cameras would be too
expensive. I made sure to note on my “exit survey” that I was leaving
because their security was worse than a Russian garrison after a vodka
waffle party. The chain subsequently folded and got sold to some other
megastorage company and I imagine they’re still too cheap to do anything
about it.
<p>
The current break-in was a bit more professional because the facility I
moved to was obviously more serious about security (they could hardly
have been less). When I first moved in, the climate control section had
proper roll-up doors and sliding security latches, and there were
cameras scattered around the premises, but the exterior door was also
just a regular door and usually left unlocked. One of the local unhoused
encampments noticed this and moved in, leaving a mess and requiring
forcible eviction by the police, though they didn’t manage to get into
any occupied units. After that the management installed a cipher
lock-type door handle and issued unique codes to each tenant.
<p>
We own a house now, but my particular homeowner’s insurance policy
doesn’t cover rental units (I read every page, believe me). Even though
the “partner” insurance was useless the first time around, I still went
with the company this facility was getting kickbacks from since it was
the cheapest alternative. After all, I figured if I got hit again they
wouldn’t pay off this time either, so I might as well spend as little
money as possible on it.
<p>
The door handle only controlled the latch; there was no deadbolt. So
what do you do to attack a door like that? You crowbar it and pry the
latch open (see also <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">the well-known
xkcd</a>). The picture at the beginning was what it looked like when I
came to survey the damage. The manager had effected some emergency
repairs and installed a temporary keyed deadbolt, requiring me to go to
the office to get inside.
<p>
And what do you do to attack disc locks? Well, if you’re not handy with
a pick, you drill them.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
The drilled lock is on the right where you can see the small hole in the
keyway. This lock was on the first unit, in which they upended several
items and ended up stealing my Atari Portfolio in a camera bag (the good
one, of course, not the flaky spare), a boxed set of Agenda VR3 PDAs
(the famous MIPS Linux-based one), and an 867MHz Titanium PowerBook G4
in its original box. This unit was somewhat defective in that it has an
iffy LCD CCFL that starts up pink. Later after submitting the claim and
police report I also noticed they stole a box of Apple Pro Speakers
(wait until they try to hook them up to anything).
<p>
For some reason they didn’t drill the lock on the second unit and
instead took several whacks at it with some sort of sharp instrument,
but this only made the lock completely inoperable. They then pried the
latch off, but the shelves in that unit interfere with the roll-up door
unless you know the trick and they apparently weren’t able to get
inside. (The manager had also replaced the latch before I arrived.) In
the process, however, they did succeed in knocking some items around
including a couple of hard disks off the shelf from my Outbound laptop
systems. They were fortunately backed up before storage and should be
replaceable with some other 2.5” IDE equivalent device because they
won’t spin up now.
<p>
Having learned my lesson from the first burglary, I had nothing
irreplaceable in the units, though I did have some items from my Tomy
Pyuuta collection in the second one temporarily. They also didn’t go
through any boxes, likely because they didn’t have any time: the next
scheduled security patrol arrived about ten or fifteen minutes after
they gained access and discovered the theft, so no doubt they hauldassed
when they saw the guard coming back on rounds. I also wasn’t the only
person burglarized, though the manager wouldn’t tell me exactly how many
other units were hit. For the units that were hit, he provided us with
covers that slide onto the latch:
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
I can see how this would make it very difficult to use boltcutters or an
angle grinder on the lock shackle, but if you can get a key in it, you
can get a wrench or a drill bit in it, so I’m not sure if it adds any
meaningful security otherwise. I wandered around to see if the covers
were on other units and I counted a few, though I couldn’t say if
everyone who got one was using it.
<p>
This time, same city, the police never showed for my units and I don’t
know if they came to the premises at all. (Before you ask, I have
absolutely no idea if
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_California_Proposition_47">Proposition
47</a> has anything to do with it.) I submitted the police reports
online and got my case numbers, one for each unit as usual, and then did
an online submission with the insurance company including the photos
that I had.
<p>
The insurance company took about a week to assign an adjuster. Despite
having itemized the missing items twice on the police report and in the
initial submission, I was asked to complete <em>and notarize</em>
another inventory sheet for each unit <em>on paper</em>. The adjuster
also wanted any proof of purchase or ownership, such as “a receipt,
invoice, order or shipping confirmation, or debit/credit statement.”
Naturally, these items are so old and have been in there so long that
none of this exists. The situation sounded suspiciously like I was going
to get stiffed again and I complained to the adjuster that if I had to
pay a notary to notarize two documents that may never result in a
payout, I’d be out even more money as well as time. (A fairly cynical
way of discouraging claims by people for whom that amount of money is
more significant.)
<p>
To my surprise, although it took several E-mails and another ten days,
the adjuster agreed to waive the notarization requirement. (I’m not even
sure what the notarization step was accomplishing: the inventory sheets
aren’t affidavits.) The documents wanted purchase price and location,
which I could only do from memory, and a replacement cost, which I did
by eBay searches for comparable items. My insurance limit is $2,000 each
unit with a $100 deductible, waived if you have a disc lock installed,
which I did. I made sure the destroyed disc locks were listed as part of
the claim and I determined a total replacement cost of $512.23 in the
first unit and $57.23 in the second one.
<p>
I didn’t hear anything for a month and E-mailed the adjuster again. The
next day they paid off on the claim: $269.40 and $48.96. “The policy you
have is based on the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of your items, which means
depreciation needs to be applied to the item(s) based on their age. I’ve
adjusted the loss presented and added in the applicable sales tax.”
Since I figured the alternative was $0 and extra vitriol for this blog
post, I agreed. The checks arrived this week and we deposited them. They
do not make me whole, though of course none of these items are critical.
<p>
Here’s the lessons learned for those of us with classic computers in
storage:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The quality of the facility’s security matters. The best burglary is the
one that never happens. If one does, higher quality facilities are more
likely to work with less unreasonable partner insurance agencies.
<p>
<li>
Store nothing you really care about in a storage unit. Real burglars
notwithstanding, the other kind of theft you may have to worry about is
an unscrupulous manager who says you didn’t pay your bill and auctions
it off. Such horror stories aren’t common, but I know people who say
this has happened to them, keeping in mind I’m only hearing their side
of the story. For example,
<a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my original
Tomy Tutor</a>, the actual computer I got when I was seven in its actual
box with its actual accessories that actually still works, will never go
in storage. Neither will my first suitcase Commodore KIM-1.

<em>Use a disc lock.</em> They’re certainly better than the cheapo
padlocks you buy at the store, but most insurance companies will also
reduce or waive your deductable if you have what they consider to be a
proper lock, and that usually means a disc lock. If you use the disc
lock the storage facility sells, you’ll likely pay an additional markup
on it, but it’s also guaranteed to be acceptable to their partner
insurance company. Plus, you can claim the replacement cost.
<p>
<li>
How you do inventory may not have much effect on the success of your
claim. The advice that you should take photos of your storage unit each
time you’re in it is a good one and you might as well do it if you have
the presence of mind, but it’s not really what they’re asking for on
claims (“you could have lost it, you could have misplaced it, that’s not
proof of ownership,” etc.), and there’s no guarantee you’ll have
photographed what in fact got taken. A beautiful spreadsheet doesn’t
prove ownership either. In both cases they wanted receipts and I didn’t
have any of those. In the first case, the insurance company told me to
pound sand. In the second case, they paid off. I’ll let you know if a
pattern ever emerges, but the photos didn’t have anything to do with it
in either situation.
<p>
<li>
Bulky and heavy items are ignored. Fortunately, many classic computing
items are bulky and heavy, and they take up space in a truck. If it’s
going to slow them down and it’s not clear they can fence it, they might
damage it but they probably won’t take it. By the way, claim damaged
items too, not just stolen ones. You might as well ask.
<p>
<li>
Something neat-looking that’s light and portable might get nicked. The
Portfolio was in a camera bag, so they probably figured it was a camera
and yoinked it. Moreover, anything with an Apple logo that’s light and
portable <em>will</em> get nicked. These aren’t usually technologically
savvy people and they know that Apple makes this cool thing called an
iPhone and some watch thing and people like those. So they took the
PowerBook and Pro Speakers, even though they probably didn’t fetch much
when they tried to sell them.
<p>
<li>
Conversely, if you make the thieves’ job harder, they’ll take less.
Gangs that hit self-storage units aren’t generally the ones that do a
whole lot of preplanning and research. Other than maybe renting a unit
themselves to look around and get a gate code, they usually won’t know
the exact interior layout or what units are occupied, and since they
won’t know what time window they have before any guards or staff come
around they’ll prefer to grab what’s obvious. In my case, the door on
the second unit won’t fully open without a bit of particular fiddling,
so they obviously gave up. Messy units are harder to work in but also
harder to steal from. Put high value items in the back and out of view
behind big heavy ones. Hide production packaging in non-descript boxes:
they <em>didn’t</em> get any of
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/palm-os-and-the-devices-that-ran-it-an-ars-retrospective/">my
Palm Pilot collection</a>, for example, despite being small, portable,
frequently in their original boxes and looking like something of value,
because they were all in plain cardboard boxes with opaque descriptions
in Sharpie marker. But they got the Agenda VR3 box because it was out on
the shelf.
<p>
<li>
You don’t get what you don’t ask for, and you won’t get what you don’t
constantly get on their case about. The adjuster was clearly not a
malignant person, just overworked, because this is a cut-rate insurance
company who tries to screw their employees just as much as their covered
individuals. The squeaky wheel gets the check.
<p>
<li>
You will never get the full replacement value of your items. Ever. In
the end, it’s just stuff. I’m not happy it got broken into, but I’m not
going to shrivel up or shoot myself in the head over it either. Nothing
was in there I can’t live without.
<p>
</ul>
<p>Since the break-in occurred, the temporary deadbolt was replaced with
a new cipher lock, but this one controls a full deadbolt, not just a
door latch. The facility is also gradually converting the roll-up doors
to pick-resistant cylinder locks and dispensing with padlocks
altogether. I’m hopeful I won’t be writing a third blog post on this
topic in a few years.</p>
