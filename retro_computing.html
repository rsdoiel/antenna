Initiative to Secure the Future of the OS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-28, from: RiscOS Open</p>
<p>
Cambridge, UK – 28-Mar-2025 – <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Open
Limited (<span class="caps">ROOL</span>) is calling on the global
technology community to support a bold new initiative to secure the
long-term future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. The company today
announced the launch of its Moonshots programme – a strategic shift away
from incremental development, towards large-scale engineering efforts
aimed at modernising the operating system for next-generation Arm
architectures.
</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/risc_os_open/moonshot-logo-sm-black.png" alt="" />
</center>
<p>
<span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, originally developed alongside the
first Arm chips in Cambridge, remains a uniquely simple and efficient
desktop operating system. It has found renewed interest in recent years
thanks to its availability on the Raspberry Pi and its open-source
licensing model. However, the platform now faces an existential
challenge.

<p>date: 2025-03-28, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>In the run up to RISC OS North, which is taking place on 29th March,
in Warrington, RISCOSitory has featured a series of posts giving an
overview of the sorts of things you can expect to find at the show, and
covering broad areas of interest, such as software, publications,
hardware, and so on. However, there are a small number of exhibitors
that either don’t fall into those broad categories, or where they do
it’s only a small part of what they do, and they have much more of
interest.…</p>

<p>Having software to run on your RISC OS computer is all well and good
– but every one knows the most important type of software of all is the
type that entertains, and engages in an interactive way: Games Even if
you don’t play computer games yourself, and might want to sit down with
a spreadsheet, or while away the hours with a word processor, there’s a
good chance you have family members who would prefer to just play. So

<p>The list of exhibitors lined up for RISC OS North isn’t limited to
just the world of modern RISC OS computing. Some will also cater to
older platforms – and that doesn’t just mean older RISC OS platforms. If
you have an Acorn Electron, for example, you should make your way to the
Retro Hardware stand, where you’ll be able to find “all things
Electron”. For slightly newer machines, Retro Hardware will also have a
32-bit DMA EIDI hard drive interface for A7000, A7000+, and RiscPCs –
and some software,…</p>

<p>As with any computer system, when using RISC OS you’ll need software
to run on it – and you’ll be certain to have some already. As an
existing user you’ll have built up a collection of applications you use,
and may want to add to it. And as a new user you’ll have discovered that
there is some supplied with the operating system – though how much
depends on how you got started – and you almost certainly will want to
add to it. So where do you go for…</p>

Xcopy is a standard DOS command that copies a directory tree. Jeremy has

Pinboard 2.07 is the latest version of the enhanced Pinboard/desktop

notes so that they don’t take as much desktop space, and improves saving
of stickies for more natural behaviour. Occasional icon drift…</p>

his RCi hat on: We are pleased to announce that Pi 5 technology is now
available in our Hydra computers, and as an optional add-on for N.Ex.T
boxes. The 64-bit only Pi 5 offers a significant performance boost over
the previous generation, with improvements to processing, but also
storage and general server capabilities. As such, it offers a noticeable

operating system is to attend your local user group – and a few will be
represented at this event: The Wakefield RISC OS User Group (WROCC) is a
particularly notable one. It was WROCC that organised the Wakefield Show
and, with it not possible this year for them to run it again, they have
