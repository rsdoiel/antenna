His main focus will most decidedly NOT be on people who consider themselves to be elite, and how they network amongst themselves, and instead on how he has added network &#8211; specifically Econet &#8211; support to Elite, beginning&#8230;

      <h1>Screen grab websites with Webshot from Kevin Wells</h1>

(date: 2025-08-16, from: <a href="https://www.riscository.com/2025/screen-grab-websites-webshot/">RiscOS Story</a>)
      <p>
      Kevin Wells has released a new application, called Webshot, which aims to take screen grabs of web pages. However, what it doesn&#8217;t do is simply save the screen (or browser window), which you could achieve anyway using Paint&#8217;s snapshot facility, or a third party application such as Snapper. Instead, you give it the address of the page you want a snapshot of, and using Wget, Webshot sends that information off to the application programmer interface of a website called Screenshot API, and what the site feeds back is an image&#8230;

      This article tells part of the story of Bullfrog Productions. In January of 1995, Electronic Arts bought the prestigious British games studio Bullfrog Productions for an undisclosed sum that was rumored to be in the neighborhood of $45 million. The lives of the 35 or so people who worked at Bullfrog were transformed overnight. Peter [&#8230;]

      I got hold a about 10 cm of MTU documents. Several I already had in PDF format, some not available yet. I took the opportunity to scan/rescan/repair what I have online until now. All documents in the MTU pages are now clean and higher quality, about 50 new PDFs. Noteworthy are the new revised K-1008 [&#8230;]
