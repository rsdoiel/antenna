<h2 id="how-to-mount-a-balcony-awning">How to Mount a Balcony
Awning</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: Low-tech magazine</p>
<p>
Hi Kris,
</p>
<p>
I’ve been reading your website for quite a while. It’s one of my
favourite blogs. Thank you for what you are doing!
</p>
<p>
We are currently experiencing a heat wave in Germany, so I drew
inspiration from Low-tech Magazine’s article
“<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/06/dressing-and-undressing-the-home/">How
to Dress and Undress your Home</a>” and built an awning on my balcony. I
documented the process so that other readers can install one themselves.
</p>
<p>
The overall cost for my build was around 50 Euros, but you can do it
much cheaper by using upcycled materials. It requires only a few tools
to build, so almost anyone can reproduce it.
</p>
<h2 id="required-materials">
Required materials
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Steel cable (or rope). I went with a 4 mm galvanized steel cable. I want
the build to be sturdy and be able to withstand strong winds. A 3 mm
cable would probably work as well. Warning: Some inexpensive steel
cables have a plastic outer shell, which may reduce their strength due
to the smaller diameter of the steel cable. For example, a 3mm cable
would have a 2mm or 1.5mm steel core. You could also use rope instead of
steel cable, which will be cheaper.
</li>
<li>
1 x turnbuckle
</li>
<li>
2 x cable thimbles
</li>
<li>
8 x cable clamps. There are different styles of clamps. The one I’ve
chosen is also used in heavy construction.
</li>
<li>
1m petrol hose with 6mm inner diameter.
</li>
<li>
1m x 3m awning fabric. The distance between eyelets should be 50 cm.
</li>
<li>
7 carabiners. This number depends on the number of eyelets you have and
the number of attachment points you will use.
</li>
<li>
Some paracord. It comes with the awning fabric, and I have no idea how
long it was.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The required cable length is the distance between the posts plus one or
one and a half meters. It’s better to have a little more cable than you
need. It’s easy to cut extra wires, but it isn’t very easy to join
cables if you don’t have enough. In my case, the distance is 3.8 m, and
I used just under 5 m of cable.
</p>
<h3 id="prepare-the-cable">
Prepare the cable
</h3>
<p>
The upper support for the awning consists of two pieces. The shorter
piece is attached to the left post and has an eyelet. The longer piece
is fixed to the right post and has a turnbuckle attached to the other
end.
</p>
<p>
Tip: Wrap the area where you plan to cut the cable with electrical tape
to prevent fraying. See
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzUhIlnvwZg">this video</a>.
</p>
<p>
The images below illustrate an example of how to use a thimble and cable
clamps to secure the turnbuckle. You are probably fine using just one
clamp, but for safety, I opted for two clamps. You should tighten the
clamps very well until you see some deformation on the cable. Always
place the loaded end of the wire on the base of the clamp and the free
end on top of it.
</p>
<p>
The image at the bottom shows how the shorter piece of cable should look
before the installation. The hose has two functions. It prevents damage
to the posts and provides a perfect grip to avoid slipping. The image in
the top right corner shows how the turnbuckle is attached to the longer
piece of cable.

<p>
At this point, I finished all the preparations I could do inside the
house.
</p>
<h3 id="assembling">
Assembling
</h3>
<p>
Now it’s time to move outside and start final assembling. When
tightening the cable around the post, leave some slack. You should be
able to adjust the cable up and down to suit your needs later.
</p>
<p>
You need to unscrew the turnbuckle fully. There should be no tension on
the cable between the posts. You should be able to get the hook on and
off easily. Now, you are ready to position it as desired. Use the
turnbuckle to put tension on the cable.

<p>
Use carabiners on every top eyelet. You can use carabiners or rope to
secure the bottom of the fabric to the railings.

<p>
I’m happy with the outcome. I can finally spend time on my balcony, even
on sunny days. There was way too much sun in the summer as my balcony
faced south.

<h3 id="what-went-well">
What went well?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Excellent protection from the sun, and I saved quite some money
</li>
<li>
The choice of materials was quite good in terms of quality
</li>
<li>
It’s easy to operate. It takes less than 30 seconds to fold and unfold
it.
</li>
<li>
The build is very sturdy and can withstand wind. It handles
medium-strength wind without any issues. I’m waiting for a strong wind
to test.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-be-improved">
What can be improved?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
I purchased an awning fabric that was slightly too small. It would be
better to have a 1.5m x 3m area. I had to experiment to find the best
position for the awning.
</li>
<li>
I have some leftover hardware, including hose clamps and turnbuckles. I
could save some money by buying everything separately in the local shop.
</li>
<li>
I’m still thinking about how to fasten the bottom of the fabric in a
better way. An elastic cord might be a good option.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wall-and-ceiling-mounts">
Wall and ceiling mounts
</h2>
<p>
If you don’t have a post to attach the cable, your only option is to
attach the cable to the wall or ceiling. Wall and ceiling mounts come in
many different forms and shapes. It should be able to handle at least
100 kg, as wind gusts might be pretty intense. Generally, the stronger
it is, the better. It uses screws and dowels to attach to the wall. It
will require tools for drilling, such as a hammer drill and a drill bit
suitable for the type of wall material being used.
</p>
<p>
You can use the keywords “ceiling hook,” “hanging chair mount,” or
“eyelet plate” to find it online. 
</p>
<p>
Below is an example of a complete set from the Toldoro manufacturer.

<h2 id="safety-precautions">
Safety precautions
</h2>
<p>
Learn how to safely use all tools before starting. Read manuals or watch
quick guides if needed.
</p>
<p>
Wear gloves when handling steel cables. Frayed ends can cause cuts or
puncture wounds on your skin.
</p>
<p>
Use a stable stepladder for installing upper lines. Place it on flat
ground and don’t overreach. Consider having someone nearby to assist.
