about to get violent with Beatstreets</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>With the release of a second edition of Code the Classics from the
Raspberry Pi stable (Side note; there’s apparently now a Code the
Classics Volume II from Raspberry Pi Press, with their interpretations
of another five classic games!) Jeroen Vermeulen has set his sights once
again on creating RISC OS versions of the games included within its
covers – and the first of these is now available. Bringing violence to a
RISC OS computer near you, the objective in Beatstreets is to work your
way through the streets, where…</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Kevin Wells has updated two of his handy applications that use Wget
to relay information back and forth to remote APIs (application
programmer interfaces), allowing RISC OS users to access, lookup, and
retrieve information from the desktop. The first of the updates was to
CardInfo, the initial release of which came back in October 2024. The
purpose of the software is to look up information about everyone’s
flexible friend1 – the plastic in your wallet. Given the first six
digits of a bank card number, CardInfo will communicate with BIN…</p>

<p>Fred Graute has released version 2.00 of his Pinboard support module,
ToggleBD, which can be used to raise the background of your desktop to
the top of the window stack – effectively bringing it to the front of
the display, with any open windows behind it – so that you can access
anything pinned to it, such as iconised windows, shortcuts to files, and
so on. Once you’ve got at what you need, the backdrop can be lowered
again so that all your open windows can be accessed as normal.…</p>

<p>
Zerofill writes zeros on the empty disk space for the selected drive. It
can help virtual machine and disk compression software to better compact
the allocated space in the volume, and so on, reducing its disk usage.
Javier has released Zerofill 2.01 with several new features: + Support
extended FAT32 drives with 7305 DOS service if available + Increased
speed by generating temporary 1GB files (instead of 500MB files as in
previous version) + Changed temporary file naming convention + Added a
question to confirm deletion of temporary files + other smaller code
updates. You can find it on the

<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
If you’re following along with the latest development tools, you may be
interested in JWasm, a MASM-compatible assembler. Version 2.19 was
released today and includes several bugfixes and other changes. A few
highlights: format mz: stack segment was never written, format mz,pe:
start offset for first segment may have resulted in an invalid binary,
write listing reworked, PUSHW will emit warning “magnitude of offset
exceeds 16-bit” if operand is a 32-bit offset, and using ‘option
oldmacros’ will cause a warning only. You can find it at
