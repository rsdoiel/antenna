<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
DosView is an image file viewer and converter for DOS. SuperIlu recently
updated DosView to version 1.6. This is a minor update, but it works
really well. DosView can read 16 different file formats (and write to 12
image formats) including BMP, PCX, JPG, PNG, WEBP, TIFF, and GIF.
DosView is available under the MIT license, and libraries under other
open source licenses. Download the new version from the
<a class="" href="https://github.com/SuperIlu/DosView/releases/tag/v1.6" rel="nofollow">DosView

<h2 id="wrocc-to-perform-some-nicanatomy-8th-january">WROCC to perform
some NICanatomy – 8th January</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>The Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) usually meets on the
first Wednesday of each month, with the occasional exception. One such
change often happens in January, when the regular day is often very
close to New Year’s Day – and it doesn’t get much closer than it did
this year. The group’s first meeting will therefore take place on
Wednesday, 8th January – a week later – at which they will be using one
of Elesar Ltd’s NIC designs as a case study to follow the process that
leads…</p>

<h2 id="look-up-bank-information">Look up bank information</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>A new piece of software – BankInfo – has been released by Kevin
Wells, following his tried and trusted approach of using Wget as an
interface between the RISC OS desktop and a web-based application
programmer interface (API). The new application makes use of the remote
API at Bank Data, and provides a way to look up basic information about
banks from a selection of source data. You can input one of the
following to perform a lookup: International Bank Account Number (IBAN).
SWIFT code, sometimes called a Bank Identifier…</p>

1</h2>

The official FreeDOS distribution has a slow update cycle because
FreeDOS is already pretty complete. We released FreeDOS 1.3 in February
2022. But we’ve continued to work on it behind the scenes, including the
monthly “test releases” with all the latest updates. And thanks to
everyone who contributes to FreeDOS, we are excited to share the
<strong>FreeDOS 1.4 Release Candidate 1 is now available!</strong> This
has a ton of new changes and fixes since FreeDOS 1.3. This includes
updates to the installer and version updates on many programs including
fdisk, format, jemm, ldebug, bwbasic, dojs, dog, nasm, curl, mkeyb,
edlin, blocek, htmlhelp, fdnet, more, fdimples, .. the list goes on -
read the
<a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/test/changes.log" rel="nofollow">change
log</a> for the complete list. These updates should address many
annoying bugs that folks have reported since version 1.3.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Please help test the new FreeDOS 1.4 release candidate.</strong>
Download
<a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/test/" rel="nofollow">FreeDOS
1.4 RC1</a> and test it out, and
<a class="" href="https://www.freedos.org/bugs/" rel="nofollow">report
any bugs</a>. We look forward to testing the new version, and including
more updates for FreeDOS 1.4 RC2 next month.

<h2 id="freecom-0.86">FreeCOM 0.86</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-01, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Jeremy Davis and others have been working to update FreeCOM (the FreeDOS
<em>command.com</em> shell) and have released
<a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/freecom/releases/tag/com086" rel="nofollow">FreeCOM
version 0.86</a>. Thanks to everyone who has helped with this version -
including Jeremy (maintainer) and contributors TK Chia, Bitigchi,
Andrewbird, Joshux, Boeckmann, and Jmalak. This has a bunch of new fixes
and additions, too many to list here - please see the release notes for
full details. You’ll also find a bunch of translations including Dutch,
English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Serbian,
Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukr. For each language
supported, a zip archive is provided with the following versions:
<strong>xms-swap</strong> with XMS-only swap support (for computers with
lots of memory and an XMS manager), <strong>kswap</strong> for basic
swapping support (for 8086/8088 computers), <strong>plainedt</strong>
without command line editing, and <strong>debug</strong> with debug
information added.
</p>
<p>
We’ve also mirrored FreeCOM 0.86 in the
<a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/" rel="nofollow">FreeDOS
Files Archive</a> at Ibiblio, under
<a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/command/0.86/" rel="nofollow">/dos/command/0.86</a>.
To install this on your existing FreeDOS system, unzip the file for your
preferred language. To test it, just run the <em>command.com</em> you
want to use. To make it a permanent replacement for your FreeDOS system,
edit the SHELL= line in your <em>fdconfig.sys</em> to point to the new
version.
