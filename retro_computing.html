<h2 id="desktop-designer">Desktop Designer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: C64 OS Blog</p>
<p><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.c64os.resources/weblog/desktopdesigner/icon_desktopdesigner.png'>
C64 OS v1.07 is currently in beta testing. It will hopefully be released
soon, and is another free system update to all licensed users of Version
1.0 and up. A whole pile of cool new things are coming in v1.07.
However, today I wanted to talk about something a little less well
known, but nonetheless I think is pretty cool. It’s a new Application
that I created for C64 OS called Desktop Designer. In the very first
release of C64 OS, version 1.0, there was a handful of tools included
for creating different types of image data that C64 OS consumes. For
instance, there was (and still is) a set of two programs found in the
//os/desktop/ directory for creating desktop backdrops. How they work is
very basic. You load and run screenedit. It clears the screen and
installs a very simple listener for PETSCII control characters. It
supports one to invert the characters on the screen, one to reload the
screen from a filename that you specify, and another to save the screen
to that filename by invok. . .</p>

If you prefer the Plasma desktop environment and the Fedora

is listed on the same level as the Fedora Workstation edition.

MC6847: Deciphering the Interface</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: Retro Innovations blog</p>
<p>Having found some external fonts used with a MC6847 lowercase
modification from “back in the day” (the lowerkit product from Green
Mountain Micro) and converting them into ROM-burnable images, I
determined a ROM font was composed of 12 bytes of font bitmap data, with
4 bytes of “padding” to align font data on 16 byte …
