Here is a blog post about some general programming theory and practice
on the C64, that I personally find useful and hopefully you’ll find it
useful too. I recently updated a tool that I use to help me with C64 OS
development from being written in BASIC to being written as a hybrid of
BASIC and 6502 Assembly. I’m sure there are many books and many magazine
articles that have been published on this subject, but there can never
be too much information on programming tips and ideas for the Commodore
64. I should set the stage by explaining my development environment. I
decided from the beginning that I wanted to develop C64 OS using a C64
(or C128), and not by cross development on a Mac or PC. I know that
isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but since I would be spending years working
on the project, I wanted to spend those years becoming intimately
comfortable again with the C64’s keyboard, and the storage devices, and
all the various commands in BASIC and in the DOSes of the drives. I
think tha. . .</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>PhotoDesk is a comprehensive photo editing package dating back to the
1990s, when it was first released by Spacetech. These days, the software

R-Comp handling sales and updates. The latest version of the software is
3.23b, and R-Comp has now made a new version of the manual available to

<p>Kevin Wells has updated another of his handy applications – this time
TrainTimes, which now stands at version 2.05. This version of the
application adds a couple of user interface improvements – one a small
visual indicator, and the other an additional way to access some
information. The visual indicator is that the mouse pointer now changes
to a menu when it passes over a menu icon in the main and future station
time table window. The new access method is on the station info window,
where you can now…</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Originally given the working title Escape to the Light, with some of
its inspiration coming from a strange recording found in a charity shop,
the latest AMCOG Games title – Light Gate – is now available to purchase
from !Store. When AMCOG’s Tony Bartram picked up the tape and went on to
give it a listen, he could potentially have released demons and other
malevolent spirits into our world, demonic possessions of those around
him, in turn leading to a gory nightmare made real. That didn’t happen,
though, and instead…</p>
