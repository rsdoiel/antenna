      <div class="markdown_content"><p>DOSLFN is a program to provide the long file name (LFN) API in plain DOS (without Windows). Thanks to Jason Hood for version 0.42 that provides a workaround to avoid corruption issues on FreeDOS, such as can happen when using FDNPKG on some packages. This update resets the drive before creating the LFN. Also in this release: uses <code>LANG</code> (instead of <code>-l</code>) to read message files in an NLS directory. See the release notes for other changes. Download it from Jason's <a class="" href="http://adoxa.altervista.org/doslfn/" rel="nofollow">DOSLFN website</a>. We've also mirrored it in the FreeDOS Files Archive at ibiblio, under <a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/util/system/doslfn/0.42/" rel="nofollow">/files/util/system/doslfn</a>. If you use DOSLFN for long file names on FreeDOS, you should download this update.</p></div>

Now approaching its 6th year, DOSember participants spend the entire month of December celebrating DOS games, and their surrounding communities. This is a great opportunity to experiment with writing a new DOS game that you can share! More info from the website: "Requirements: Participants make a game that runs in DOS and/or a DOS emulator. That's it. When: The jam itself runs from September to the end of November (three months)." They also note that generative AI (aka "vibe coding") is not allowed.</p></div>

His main focus will most decidedly NOT be on people who consider themselves to be elite, and how they network amongst themselves, and instead on how he has added network &#8211; specifically Econet &#8211; support to Elite, beginning&#8230;

      <p>
      Kevin Wells has released a new application, called Webshot, which aims to take screen grabs of web pages. However, what it doesn&#8217;t do is simply save the screen (or browser window), which you could achieve anyway using Paint&#8217;s snapshot facility, or a third party application such as Snapper. Instead, you give it the address of the page you want a snapshot of, and using Wget, Webshot sends that information off to the application programmer interface of a website called Screenshot API, and what the site feeds back is an image&#8230;

      This article tells part of the story of Bullfrog Productions. In January of 1995, Electronic Arts bought the prestigious British games studio Bullfrog Productions for an undisclosed sum that was rumored to be in the neighborhood of $45 million. The lives of the 35 or so people who worked at Bullfrog were transformed overnight. Peter [&#8230;]
