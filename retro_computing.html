<h2 id="web2pdf-a-new-application-from-kevin-wells">Web2PDF – a new
application from Kevin Wells</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Kevin Wells has found another remote application programmer interface
(API) to make use of for the benefit of RISC OS users, and as a result
has released a new application: Web2PDF. Like a lot of Kevin’s software,
Web2PDF makes use of Wget to relay information input into the program’s
RISC OS window to the remote API, and then feed the results back to the
user. Usually those results are presented to the user via the
application itself, but this time there is a subtle difference. The
remote API used by…</p>

form</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Some time back, Karl Clark released ArcMouse, an interface that could
be plugged in to the mouse port on Archimedes-era ARM-based computers
from Acorn and allowed a more standard USB mouse to be used. Karl has
now improved on the design, and has launched ArcMouse version 2. The new
design is that at just 12mm wide, it’s notably smaller than the older
version, which makes it more compatible with the ‘all in one’ style of
RISC OS computer from Acorn (such as the A3000, on which the mouse port
is…</p>

<p>
If you need to transfer data between DOS and another system, here’s
another option: NetMount enables DOS systems to access shared
directories from remote machines as if they were local drives. It
operates over the UDP protocol. It has two parts: <code>netmount</code>
that runs on the DOS client, and <code>netmount-server</code> that runs
on Linux, Mac, or Windows. The source code is available at
<a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount" rel="nofollow">NetMount
on GitHub</a> and is available under the GNU GPL. NetMount

1.5.0 and server 1.4.1</a> were released a few days ago, and include
several fixes.
