      An update has been released by Kevin Wells to one of his newest applications, Web2PDF. The purpose of the software is to convert web pages to PDF files, which can then be opened by any PDF reader you have available. It does this by sending the address of the page, using Wget, to a remote application programmer interface (API) provided by API Layer for the purpose, called Web Page to PDF. The API then feeds back a PDF file which shows the contents of the web page, which can either&#8230;

(date: 2025-09-05, from: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freedos/news/2025/09/microsoft-6502-basic/">FreeDOS News</a>)
      <p>
      <div class="markdown_content"><p>It's not DOS, but it's good to see Microsoft re-release some of its classic products under an open source license. Recently, Microsoft released the source code for 6502 BASIC. From <a class="" href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/03/microsoft-open-source-historic-6502-basic/" rel="nofollow">the announcement</a>: "Microsoft BASIC began in 1975 as the company’s very first product: a BASIC interpreter for the Intel 8080, written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen for the Altair 8800. That codebase was soon adapted to run on other 8-bit CPUs .. The 6502 port was completed in 1976 by Bill Gates and Ric Weiland. In 1977, Commodore licensed it ... a deal that placed Microsoft BASIC at the heart of Commodore’s PET computers and, later, the VIC-20 and Commodore 64."</p>
<p>If you're curious: yes, this is the same source code that became Applesoft BASIC on the Apple II computers. And that's very interesting to me, because I learned BASIC on an Apple II. - Also check out this video from our YouTube channel, showing how to draw the "Sierpinski Triangle" by <a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxolyi7yUaM" rel="nofollow">programming in Applesoft BASIC</a></p></div>

      <h1>Microsoft makes 6502 BASIC open source</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/09/microsoft-makes-6502-basic-open-source.html">Old Ventage Computing Research</a>)
      <p>
      It was probably going to happen sooner or later, but Microsoft has <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/03/microsoft-open-source-historic-6502-basic/">officially released the source code for 6502 BASIC</a>. The specific revision is very Commodore-centric: it's the 1977 "8K" BASIC variant "1.1," which Commodore users know better as BASIC V2.0, the same BASIC used in the early PET and with later spot changes from Commodore (including removing Bill Gates' <a href="https://www.pagetable.com/?p=43#comment-1033">famous Easter egg</a>) in the VIC-20 and Commodore 64. I put "8K" in quotes because the 40-bit Microsoft Binary Format version, which is most familiar as the native floating point format for most 8-bit BASICs derived from Microsoft's and all Commodore BASICs from the PET on up, actually starts at 9K in size. In the C64, because there is RAM and I/O between the BASIC ROM and the Kernal ROM, there is an extra <tt>JMP</tt> at the end of the BASIC ROM to continue to the routine in the lowest portions of the Kernal ROM. The jump doesn't exist in the VIC-20 where the ROM is contiguous and as a result everything past that point is shifted by three bytes on the C64, the length of the instruction.
<p>
This is, of course, the same BASIC that Gates wanted a percentage of but Jack Tramiel famously refused to budge on the $25,000 one-time fee, claiming "I'm already married." Gates yielded to Tramiel, as most people did then, but I suspect the slight was never forgotten. Not until the 128 did Microsoft officially appear in the credits for Commodore BASIC, and then likely only as a way to push its bona fides as a low-end business computer. Microsoft's source release also includes changes from Commodore's own John Feagans, who rewrote the garbage collection routine, and was the original developer of the Commodore Kernal <a href="/2025/06/see-jane-128-by-arktronics-run.html">and later Magic Desk</a>.
<p>
The source code is all in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502/blob/main/m6502.asm">one big file</a> (typical for the time) and supports <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502/blob/main/m6502.asm#L10">six machine models</a>, the first most likely a vapourware 6502 system never finished by Canadian company Semi-Tech Microelectronics (<tt>STM</tt>) better known for the CP/M-based Pied Piper, then the Apple II, the Commodore (in this case PET 2001), the Ohio Scientific (OSI) Challenger, <a href="/search/label/kim-1">the Commodore/MOS KIM-1</a>, and most intriguingly a PDP-10-based simulator written by Paul Allen. The source code, in fact, was cross-assembled on a PDP-10 using MACRO-10, and when assembled for the PDP-10 emulator it actually emits a PDP-10 executable that traps on every instruction into the simulator linked with it &mdash; an interesting way of effectively accomplishing threaded code. A similar setup was used for their 8080 emulator. Unfortunately, I don't believe Allen's code has been released anywhere, though I'd love to be proven wrong if people know otherwise. Note that they presently don't even mention the STM port in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502">the Github README</a>, possibly because no one was sure what it did. 
<p>
While MACRO-10 source for 6502 BASIC has circulated before and been analysed in detail, <a href="https://www.pagetable.com/?p=774">most notably by Michael Steil</a>, this is nevertheless the first official release where it is truly open-source <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502/blob/main/LICENSE">under the MIT license</a> and Microsoft should be commended for doing so. This also makes it much easier to pull a BASIC up for your own 6502 homebrew system &mdash; there's nothing like the original.

      <p>
      n 1975 MOS Technology started delivery of 65XX ICs. So 2025 marks the 50 year anniversary of the 6502! The earliest mentions of the KIM-1 are from January 1976. The date of the first edition of the User Manual, and first mentions in e.g. Byte. So I propose to declare January 2026 as the 50th [&#8230;]

      <h1>How to use the time in the 6530/6532</h1>

      <p>
      When I acquired a KIM-1 Rev A, obviously sold by NCE/Compumart, it came with some documentation that may interest any programmer working with the MOS Technology (R)RIOT 6530 and 6532. The timer description the datasheet is a bit vague about how to use. What may help is the document &#8216;KIM-1 Application Note 2 Interval Timer [&#8230;]

      PLEASE is a very small package for a standard KIM-1. It has a tiny monitor, command interpreter and many handy subroutines. PLEASE INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE LISTING See also:KIM-1 connectors: beware the Chinese cheap variants!The KIM-1 needs 2 edge connectors. The specifications are: card edge; PIN: 44; 3.96mm When you search for those, ...Magazines: Compute! and Compute [&#8230;]
