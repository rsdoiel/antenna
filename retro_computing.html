If you run FreeDOS (or any DOS) on real hardware, you will have problems
getting sound to work with DOS games. That’s because DOS doesn’t have a
‘hardware abstraction layer’ like modern operating systems; DOS programs
talked to the hardware directly, which is why you had to tell each game
about your sound card. But since about 1997, PC hardware moved to Intel
audio, so games that used SoundBlaster for sound won’t work. That’s why
you need
<a class="" href="https://github.com/crazii/SBEMU" rel="nofollow">SBEMU</a>
.. or Japheth’s fork,
<a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/VSBHDA" rel="nofollow">VSBHDA</a>
.. to emulate SoundBlaster. Now there’s a fork of VSBHDA that “adds
support for using soundfonts for MPU-401 emulation using TinySoundFont,
and properly fixes it to make it work with games like Duke Nukem 3D.”
You can find it at

choice.I found a article in MICROTREK magazine 1977 with a review of
this computer. See also:Focal-65 V3D for TIM and KIM-1Focal on the 6502,

from Outer Space</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-25, from: James Hobson blog</p>
<p>This post serves three purposes, one is to plug my new, cool library,
next is to talk a bit about free monad transformers and finally, to
spread some knowledge and love for the Plan 9 operating system.
Algebraic effects have become my go-to tool when developing new
applications and libraries and my usage of monad transformers has fallen
to the wayside so it’s not a surprised that the two technologies are
often presented as in some way competing ways of dealing with effects,
but I don’t think this is true.</p>

Fontana is a bitmap font editor (with ability to import from some vector
formats) which allows you to create, convert and edit fonts stored in
many file formats. It is mostly intended for developers. Ladislav
recently released Fontana version 1.1 with thes changes: can be now used
also as command line utility which loads text mode VGA font +
possibility to load the edited font into VGA character generator when
shelling to DOS + supports FNT subformat used in libraries GRX, MGRX and
Allegro + bug fixes. Get the new release at the
<a class="" href="https://www.laaca.borec.cz/blocek/" rel="nofollow">Blocek

This was announced in 2022 but it came up again recently. If you use the
Open Watcom compilers, you might be interested in PMODE/W v1.33, a
32-bit Protected Mode DOS extender for the Watcom C/C++ Compiler.
PMODE/W is a DOS extender for the Watcom C/C++ package. It allows DOS
programs to run in full 32 bit protected mode, with access to all memory
available in the system. PMODE/W replaces DOS/4GW extender in the Watcom
C/C++ package. This was originally released in 1997, but was released
under the MIT license in 2023. You can find it at the official
<a class="" href="http://www.sid6581.net/pmodew/" rel="nofollow">PMODE/W
website</a> by Charles Scheffold and Tomasz Pytel. Another developer has
also made a copy at

If you pay attention to the news in the Linux-sphere, you’ve probably
heard that the open source operating system recently crashed through a

computers from RISCOSbits</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>If you’re on certain social media websites, you may have noticed a
couple of polls run by RISCOSbits recently. These formed a part of the
company’s research and development, as they decided exactly which
direction to take for some new kit that was in the works – and that new
hardware can now be revealed: There are two shiny new toys in the range,
both of which are ‘companion’ systems designed to work alongside
existing RISC OS computers – with one version of one of the two machines
actually intended…</p>
