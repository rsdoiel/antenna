– 12th October</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>This coming Saturday – 12th October – is the next opportunity for
anyone with an interest in RISC OS and software development to gather
together in front of the virtual fire for an informal chat. These
meetings, which take place more or less monthly using the Zoom video
conferencing system, are a way for people with that interest to get
together and discuss anything related to programming on and for RISC OS.
There is no pre-set agenda for these meetings, and no speaker arranged
ahead of time. Instead, their informal…</p>

just three weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Issues with the venue at which it has been hold since its inception
meant that the RISC OS London Show hasn’t been held for a couple of
years, and that following one brief reappearance after the hiatus caused
by COVID. However, this year it’s back in a new location, and it’s time
to get your travel plans sorted if you wish to attend – and why wouldn’t
you? Getting the most important information out of the way first, the
show is set to take place on Saturday, 26th October –…</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>An updated version of the Hexen port to RISC OS is now available from
R-Comp. Version 1.08 of the port has been released to resolve a number
of issues reported by players, and also brings the code into line with
that of the updated Heretic. Players with very high resolution screens
will enjoy the support for up to 8K screens, but there are also a number
of fixes – such as improvements to the enhanced widescreen support that
appeared in versions 1.07, which extends the view horizontally, filling

<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Kevin Wells has released a new version of TimeZones, his application
that can be used to establish whether, if you called someone elsewhere
in the world, it’ll be stupid o’clock in their time. Version 2.00 of the
software marks a rewrite, which Kevin undertook due to changes to the
application programmer interface (API) that the application uses (by way
of Wget to communicate with a remote site – in this case WorldTimeAPI to
relay the information requested by the user. In addition to supporting
the revised API, when launched the…</p>
