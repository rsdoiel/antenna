<p>date: 2024-09-25, from: Lispmachine-org blog</p>
<p>
My parrot, “Mister Blossom”, I have had since 2019 when his owner, my
older sister, passed away suddenly.  I have taken care of Mr B (and my
elderly father) since then.   My dad passed away this past February,

For the last few months I have been super hard at work on the next major
update to C64 OS, version 1.07. It will be released as a free update to
all licensed users of C64 OS v1.x, and will be made available for
download from the C64 OS System Updates page. The big new technology
coming to C64 OS is networking. It’s been a long time coming, but up

completed first. And now I’m very excited to finally be at the point
where I can work on the networking layer, which I think will really bust

implementing a number of smaller items on the list and fixing a bunch of
annoying bugs. Here’s a short list of some of the updates and
improvements that are coming in v1.07: Improved NMI handling and
behavior of STOP+RESTORE New Network Utility for configuring C64 OS
networking Settings Utility now offers to open the Network Utility
TKInput fields gain support for. . .</p>
