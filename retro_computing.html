(date: 2025-08-12, from: Hans Otten's Retro blog)
      <p>
      I got hold a about 10 cm of MTU documents. Several I already had in PDF format, some not available yet. I took the opportunity to scan/rescan/repair what I have online until now. All documents in the MTU pages are now clean and higher quality, about 50 new PDFs. Noteworthy are the new revised K-1008 [&#8230;]
