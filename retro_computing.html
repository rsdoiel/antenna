<h2 id="the-living-computers-museum-finally-isnt">The Living Computers
Museum finally isn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Old Ventage Computing Research</p>
First off, apologies for a quiet month as I’ve been dealing with family
matters which hopefully are now on a better footing (more articles are
in the hopper). Unfortunately, the same apparently can’t be said for the
once-great Living Computers Museum + Labs in Seattle, established by the
late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and closed in 2020 during the COVID
pandemic after his death,
<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattles-living-computers-museum-logs-off-for-good-as-paul-allen-estate-will-auction-vintage-items/">at
least some of which is going up for auction</a>. The specific pieces
have not yet been announced by Christie’s, but will ostensibly include
<a href="https://www.christies.com/en/stories/gen-one-innovations-from-the-paul-g-allen-collection-1f0df60a726e4dcbabef3a91a57ef7ee#section-mx815mb7Yb">his
personal DECsystem-10</a>, a 1971 KI10 DEC PDP-10 from the MIT AI Lab
which is the first computer he and Bill Gates ever used. (There’s just
something about your first. I still have
<a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my actual first
computer</a> too, and with only around 1500 systems built the unit at
the LCM was apparently the exact machine they used also. Here’s a
picture of it from <a href="https://obsolescence.dev/pidp10.html">when
it was in residence</a> at the LCM and used to develop a replica.)
<p>
Obviously, while I think it’s a crying shame, the estate can do what it
likes with its own stuff and I hope the machine, plus the other 149
pieces reportedly to be auctioned off, goes to someone who appreciates
it. (Bill Gates himself perhaps.) What’s more problematic is the people
who donated systems and peripherals with the expectation they would
remain there in some capacity, especially since the museum reportedly
didn’t accept items as long-term loans. (Wikipedia has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs">a
substantially complete list of those items</a>.) That’s not <i>per
se</i> an unreasonable position, and one that helps protect the museum,
but it’s also one that leaves their prior owners with no firm recourse
for recovery before they get liquidated or scrapped in a situation like
this. Throwing them away is bad enough but if those items also go up for
sale, though doing so <em>may</em> be technically legal depending on how
the transfer was written up, it’s pretty darn sleazy. Allen’s estate,
notably his sister Jody who is the trustee and executrix, would then be
profiting off items donated in good faith on the understanding that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmhRLiYho0">they would be in a
museum</a>. That’s bad and they should feel bad.
<p>
But then perhaps museums aren’t what they used to be. On <tt>cctalk</tt>
someone mentioned the now defunct? National Museum of Communications in
Irving, TX which downsized in 1998 by taking about five commercial
dumpsters’ worth of radios and other items to the dump. It looks like
<a href="https://www.museumsusa.org/museums/info/15631">one guy ran that
shop</a> and it probably became too large for him to handle, a story
which is probably more common than most of us know, though it’s still
bad news for the equipment that got junked — some of which was almost
certainly rare or irreplaceable, even if specific items themselves
weren’t particularly valuable. Every collector has had well-intentioned
dreams at one time or another of opening our own museums, not realizing
that they turn into massive sinks of time and money and regulatory
filings, and they’re never as much fun to operate as the private
computer room or display case you used to have in your house. Situations
like this should also remind us that donating our own beloved items to
any institution in the hopes they’ll “survive” us is no guarantee
they’ll remain there either.
<p>
<p>We’re amateurs, though. Paul Allen, on the other hand, was not an
amateur and was an incredibly wealthy man who had to have some awareness
of estate planning, and one who knew his cancer was likely to return. It
is widely reputed that the LCM was expensive to run and hard to manage
even with his sizeable fortune and a lot of diligent volunteers. Now his
collection and quite a few artifacts I imagine some folks would like
back are in the hands of his sister, who allegedly doesn’t have any
interest in them other than the price they might fetch. Let that be a
lesson to us that no one and nothing lives forever.</p>

<p>
As we get closer to the 30th anniversary on June 29, we’re starting to
see news items and articles about FreeDOS. Here’s a quick roundup from
the last week: {1} SourceForge posted an
<a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/articles/freedos-30th-anniversary-interview-with-jim-hall-from-the-freedos-project/">interview
with Jim</a> about FreeDOS at 30 years. It’s a long read but full of
great notes and history. {2} Slashdot ran a story about
<a class="" href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/06/21/1516255/30-years-of-freedos" rel="nofollow">30
years of FreeeDOS</a> with a link to a February article about
<a class="" href="https://www.both.org/?p=3991" rel="nofollow">looking
ahead</a> to 30 years of FreeDOS. {3} Hackaday also wrote about
<a class="" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/06/23/nearly-30-years-of-freedos-and-looking-ahead-to-the-future/" rel="nofollow">nearly
30 years of FreeDOS</a> and looking ahead to the future. If you know of
other places that have written about FreeDOS, let us know.
