<h2 id="the-biography-of-a-discovery">The Biography of a Discovery</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Computer History: Stores</p>
<p>
One item in a new collection fascinated CHM curator David Brock—an early
video recording, made in 1968, with explanatory notes by industrial
psychologist Robert Dunlop. The notes told of an inventive computer
system at IBM headquarters that Brock had never heard anything about. A
demo of the system was captured on the long obsolete video. Could it be
restored, and would it change history?

<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Hans Otten’s Retro blog</p>
<p>Thanks to Eric Dennison I can show photos of the RNB Enterprises
VAK-1 motherboard. The large motherboard and the huge case with
homebuilt 16K static RAM memory card are representative for the KIM-1
systems then! See also:Focal-65 V3D for TIM and KIM-1Focal on the 6502,

Developments comes to WROCC – 6th November</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>In the run up to the recent London Show, RISC OS Developments
released an updated version of RISC OS Direct, their customised and more
user-enticing distribution of RISC OS – and it was a very important
update, because it also marked the first public release of their web
browser, Iris, which is now bundled in the distro. Andrew Rawnsley from
RISC OS Developments will be joining the Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club
(WROCC) as their guest speaker for their next meeting to talk about RISC

<h2 id="kclocks-version-number-ticks-over-for-the-first-time">Kclock’s
version number ticks over for the first time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Released over twenty years ago, Kclock is a simple clock application
by Keven Wells that displays the time and date in a window – and it has
now received its first ever update, making it version 1.01. The main
functional change is that for systems running RISC OS 3.50 or later, a
button can be pressed to invoke the system date and time configuration.
Behind the scenes, another change is that it now uses the latest version
of the Dr Wimp BASIC library. If you find any of Kevin’s software,…</p>
