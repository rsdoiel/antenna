<p>Issues with the venue at which it has been hold since its inception
meant that the RISC OS London Show hasn’t been held for a couple of
years, and that following one brief reappearance after the hiatus caused

software marks a rewrite, which Kevin undertook due to changes to the
application programmer interface (API) that the application uses (by way
of Wget to communicate with a remote site – in this case WorldTimeAPI to
