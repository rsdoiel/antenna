mTCP provides TCP/IP applications for your PC compatible

allows mTCP programs to operate at the same time NetDrive is active. (If
you know how packet drivers work, that is no small trick.)” The mTCP
NetDrive programs are also now included in mTCP. (The mTCP NetDrive

<h2 id="new-dos-version-of-make">New DOS version of Make</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-24, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Make is a standard tool for developers, to automate when to compile or
build new parts of the program, without compiling everything. This is
extremely useful for large programs. Gregory Pietsch has started writing
a new version. From the announcement: “This is my attempt at writing a
better make for FreeDOS than all the makes out there. This includes
dmake (a toy make) and even GNU make if I can. After two weeks of
writing, I came up with this. .. Other PD versions of make use a singly
linked list as the primary data structure. I wanted to get away from
that, especially in places where I’d have to go over the whole list to
find something. This version uses a map, with an AVL tree as the
internal data structure. The program also uses dynamic arrays and
dynamic strings to simplify the handling of macros.” This is version
“0.0” so is pre-alpha and “may be buggy, missing a few parts, or not
have proper documentation, but at least it runs and could convince
others that it could be something good.” You can download it from
<a class="" href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/devel/make/make/" rel="nofollow">/devel/make/make</a>

<p>
WDE is a modular disk editor capable of allowing users to manipulate
data stored in various ways on different kinds of storage. The new
version 1.1 was recently released, which includes these features: *
fixed: mounting logical drives from image files didn’t adjust the “last
sector”, thus cluster numbers beyond logical disk size weren’t rejected.
* fixed: if current device was an image file, hitting Ctrl-Enter while
in sector 0 of a logical drive did switch to a real physical disk. *
save file chain: last update date &amp; time now copied. * cmdline
option -n added. * file AND directory names are accepted. You can read

What are the real experiences after a few months of use? The lecture
