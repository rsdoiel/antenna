<p>If you have chatted to Richard Brown at recent RISC OS Shows you will
know that he has been planning to migrate the servers Orpheus Internet
uses from Intel Xeon systems to pure ARM. This has now been completed
and the 2 Xeon boxes have been replaced by a cluster of 16/17 Raspberry
Pi 5 boxes.</p>

Mac G5 Quad – Which is Faster, PC2-3200U-288 or PC2-4200U-444 RAM?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, from: Happy Macs site</p>
<p>I have always wondered whether equipping your Power Mac G5 Quad with
PC2-4200U-444 RAM would make for a faster machine than if the same
machine were equipped with PC2-3200U-288 RAM. It seems obvious that the
faster RAM ought to make for a faster machine, but as we shall see in a
moment, it doesn’t really […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Or play audio of any kind, really The Hydra computer range from
R-Comp Interactive is so named because, like the creature of Greek myth,
it is multi-headed – it’s a computer that can hold up to six Raspberry
Pi-based boards, each running its own OS, and all concurrently. Being
from R-Comp, it’s a RISC OS computer first and foremost – that’s the
operating system running on the ‘first’ head, while any of the others
that are in use (the full six don’t have to be enabled) would most
likely be…</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Happy Macs site</p>
<p>Many of you may have revived or upgraded a Power Mac G5 (any of the
models, all the way up through the G5 Quad). You purchased a shiny new
SATA HDD (spinner or SSD) to give it more storage and faster access but
your Power Mac steadfastly refuses to “see” the new HDD, even in […]</p>

<p>The Achilles heel of most late 2005 Power Mac G5 Quads is the Liquid
Cooling System (LCS), a largely invisible part of the G5 Quad, tucked
discretely behind the shiny G5 face plate you will see when you open up
your Quad. That faceplate is prominently visible in the photo below:
