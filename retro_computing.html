<p>
Japheth has posted an update to the ancient CauseWay DOS extender
(originally written mostly by Michael Devore). A DOS extender lets DOS
programs run in a protected mode; CauseWay was originally Watcom’s DOS
extender, released as open source from Open Watcom. The sources are in
Masm v6 syntax, but can be built with Masm/JWasm. Quite a few bugs have
been fixed in this release, and DOS conventional memory footprint is
significantly lower, especially in DPMI mode. More details at the
