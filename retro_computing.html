Magic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Digital Antiquarian</p>
<p>This article tells part of the story of New World Computing. Some
passions are lifelong, but many others fade away over the course of a
life, to be replaced by others. Not long after Jon Van Caneghem, the
founder of New World Computing, sold his company to 3DO, it started to
become obvious to everyone […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: RiscOS Open</p>
<p>
The period between stable releases is the perfect time to try out some
experimental changes to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. If you’ve
bought one of the top-of-the-range
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry
Pi 4’s</a> with 4GB or 8GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> the good
news is that that extra memory can now be unlocked by dropping the

RPi <span class="caps">ROM</span> (8GB Support)</a> onto your SD card.

R-Comp’s Andrew Rawnsley talking about new 5stuff (and I expect some

5erving up info about new kit to ROUGOL – 21st July</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>R-Comp recently announced two new systems, both based around the
Raspberry Pi 5 compute module – the 5idekick, and the Pi5erve – and on
Monday, 21st July Andrew Rawnsley will be talking to the RISC OS User
Group of London (ROUGOL) about these machines and other recent
developments and updates. Andrew plans to begin his talk on the subject
of NVMe and the block drivers, venturing in the direction of the
multi-headed Hydra systems available from R-Comp, and that will in turn
bring the talk around to 5idekick (which in…</p>

A developer discovered that the Plasma Bigscreen feature had been
sitting untouched, so he decided to do something about it.

<h2 id="web2pdf-a-new-application-from-kevin-wells">Web2PDF – a new
application from Kevin Wells</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Kevin Wells has found another remote application programmer interface
(API) to make use of for the benefit of RISC OS users, and as a result
has released a new application: Web2PDF. Like a lot of Kevin’s software,
Web2PDF makes use of Wget to relay information input into the program’s
RISC OS window to the remote API, and then feed the results back to the
user. Usually those results are presented to the user via the
application itself, but this time there is a subtle difference. The
remote API used by…</p>

<h2 id="arcmouse-shrinks-into-a-v2-form">ArcMouse shrinks into a v2
form</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Some time back, Karl Clark released ArcMouse, an interface that could
be plugged in to the mouse port on Archimedes-era ARM-based computers
from Acorn and allowed a more standard USB mouse to be used. Karl has
now improved on the design, and has launched ArcMouse version 2. The new
design is that at just 12mm wide, it’s notably smaller than the older
version, which makes it more compatible with the ‘all in one’ style of
RISC OS computer from Acorn (such as the A3000, on which the mouse port
is…</p>

and server 1.4.1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
If you need to transfer data between DOS and another system, here’s
another option: NetMount enables DOS systems to access shared
directories from remote machines as if they were local drives. It
operates over the UDP protocol. It has two parts: <code>netmount</code>
that runs on the DOS client, and <code>netmount-server</code> that runs
on Linux, Mac, or Windows. The source code is available at
<a class="" href="https://github.com/jrohel/NetMount" rel="nofollow">NetMount
on GitHub</a> and is available under the GNU GPL. NetMount
