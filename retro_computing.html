<p>There are many different methods for making coffee, some more energy-efficient than others. However, there are no coffee makers that you can power with a small solar PV panel. For example, a commercially available 12V DC drip coffee maker requires a solar panel of 300 watts to brew coffee and keep it warm.</p>
<p>The key to making a more energy-efficient coffee maker is insulation. Regardless of which conventional coffee maker you purchase, it will typically have little to no heat insulation, and most of the heat generated by the energy source will be wasted into the environment. Therefore, we made an insulated solar electric coffee maker ourselves.</p>
<p>Our coffee maker operates on the same principles as our <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-solar-powered-electric-oven/">solar-powered oven</a> and runs on a 100W solar panel. We embedded an Italian coffee maker—a moka pot—in a mortar slab, surrounded by cork insulation and a layer of ceramic tiles.</p>

<p>The cooker has an <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/10/how-to-build-an-electric-heating-element-from-scratch/">electric resistance heating element</a> integrated inside, which is directly connected to the solar panel without a battery, solar charge controller, or voltage regulator in between. Although it’s solar-powered, the coffee maker can be located inside your kitchen or next to your bed—only the solar panel needs to be outside.</p>

<p>The moka pot was invented in 1933 and uses pressure rather than gravity or a pump to brew coffee. It consists of a bottom chamber (a boiler that acts as a base), a funnel filter with a plate and a rubber joint, and an upper chamber where the coffee is collected. Just before the water boils, the steam increases the pressure inside the heating vessel, pushing the water through the filter and the ground coffee. The moka pot is an energy-efficient appliance, comparable to a pressure cooker for food.</p>
<h2>How to brew solar-powered coffee</h2>
<p>Once the solar panel receives sunlight in the morning, the coffee maker will start heating up. Consequently, if you put water and coffee in the machine in the evening, the sun will brew your coffee in the morning. Coffee is often a collective beverage and our coffee maker is most practical when several people use it. The first coffee takes roughly one and a quarter hours to make. However, once the mortar slab is warm, subsequent brews take only 20-25 minutes.</p>
<p>Preparing the coffee works similarly to a regular moka pot. You unscrew the top part and remove the funnel, fill the bottom part with water until the valve, place the funnel back, fill it with ground coffee, and then screw the top part back on. To serve the coffee, you unscrew the top part using the longer handle we attached to the moka pot. The handle was inspired by the Arabic raqweh.</p>

<p>Our coffee maker is the first insulated cooking device we built, and there is room for improvement. It doesn’t produce the characteristic gurgling noise when the coffee is ready, probably because the temperature isn’t high enough.</p>
<p>Also, not all water evaporates. Therefore, cleaning involves placing the base under the tap, letting water run in, shaking, and then turning the coffee maker upside down to empty the base. That’s a bit impractical, because the appliance weighs 10 kg.</p>
<p>Because the coffee collects in the upper chamber, it is not kept warm by the mortar slab and the cork insulation. We solve this by wrapping one or more towels around the top part to keep it warm. Alternatively, you could incorporate heat insulation into the design, for example, with a tea cozy.</p>

</figure>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Moka pot</em>. Choose the size you need. If you get a second-hand device, make sure that the rubber seal is still in good condition. Also, ensure you can easily take off the handle to replace it with a longer, straight handle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mortar</em>. Any construction mortar will work. Make sure it’s not too coarse. Read more about mortar in our <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-solar-powered-electric-oven/">solar oven manual</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Metal reinforcement</em>. We pour quite a big chunk of mortar, so we reinforce it with a metal mesh to prevent it from breaking. We use a frying sieve. Chicken wire mesh shaped in a cylinder will work as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cork</em>. For thermal insulation, we use cork sheets available at home decor shops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tiles</em>. Read more about tiles and tiling in our <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-solar-powered-electric-oven/">solar oven manual</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chimney</em>. Because the water chamber of the coffee pot is sunk in mortar, you need a way to maintain an opening around the valve to release pressure if the coffee maker overheats. We use a metal pastry bag tip, but any metal tube will work. You can also cut a piece out of an aluminum can and roll it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nichrome wire, heat-resistant electric cable</em>. These are the components for building an electric resistance heater (see our <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/10/how-to-build-an-electric-heating-element-from-scratch/">separate manual</a>).</p>

</figure>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 1 —</strong> Start by making a mold for the mortar base. Since the moka pot is circular, we decided to shape our cooker’s heating element into a larger cylinder. Get a wooden board. Use a plastic sheet to form a cylinder and tape it to the board with duct tape. We use an old plastic office folder and shape it around a round cork pad that we place on the wooden board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 2 —</strong> Prepare some mortar and pour a layer of about 2 cm at the bottom of the mold. Let it cure for a couple of hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the meantime, prepare your electric resistance circuit <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2025/10/how-to-build-an-electric-heating-element-from-scratch/">based on the instructions in our manual</a>. We made a circuit with two nichrome wires in parallel (2 x 64 cm) for a resistance of 3.2 Ohms at 18V. It draws around 5.5 Amps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 3 —</strong> Make two holes in the plastic mold to weave the heat-resistant electric cables through. Distribute the resistance wires evenly on the surface of the mortar layer. Make sure they do not touch each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 4 —</strong> Prepare some more mortar and pour it on top of the first layer so that the electric heating circuit is completely submerged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the metal mesh. Gently press it into the mortar. Ensure it doesn’t touch the nichrome wire and that there is sufficient space in the center for the pot to fit. Add a bit more mortar if necessary so that the mesh is trapped at the bottom. Wait for a couple of hours for it to set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 5 —</strong> Cut the chimney tube at an angle to fit snugly around the coffee pot valve while pointing up. Attach it to the moka pot body with hot glue or clay to ensure it stays in place while pouring mortar. It will later be submerged in mortar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 6 —</strong> Place the coffee pot on top of the mortar layer, in the center. Remove the handle; otherwise, its tip would get stuck in the next mortar layer. We’ll replace it with another handle later in the building process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 7 —</strong> Prepare more mortar and pour it into the mold, around the coffee maker. Fill the mold up to the screw rim of the coffee pot. Let the mortar cure for at least 24 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 8 —</strong> Once hardened, remove the plastic mold sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 9 —</strong> Let the base dry for an additional 48 hours. Position the base on top of a grid to allow the bottom to dry as well. The mortar should feel completely dry to the touch.</p>
</li>

<h2>Step 2: Insulation</h2>

</a>
<figcaption><p>Image: Step-by-step instructions (figures 10 to 15). Illustration by Marie Verdeil.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We insulate the mortar slab with a 2 cm thick cork layer on all sides (including the top and bottom). We use rectangular and circular cork sheets, 4 mm thick, which means we use five layers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 10 —</strong> Layer 5 circular cork pads for the bottom part. Use wood glue to secure them together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 11 —</strong> Use another five cork pads for the top. Cut out a circle in the middle, about 2 cm wider than the coffee pot, so that there is room to add a plaster protection to the cork. Glue them together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 12 —</strong> Start cutting and layering cork sheets around the cylinder, using painter’s tape to keep them in place. In each layer, make two holes to weave the electric wires through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 13-15 —</strong> Before adding the last sheet, decide where you want to route the cables from the electric heating resistance. You can cut away a path into the last but one layer of cork to allow the wires to pass. We let them out at the bottom. Add the last sheet of cork (fig 15.). Use some tape to secure it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this stage, you can run a test. We used water only, in order not to stain the cork with coffee. Test how long it takes for the water to reach the top chamber.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Tiling</h2>
<figure>

</a>
<figcaption><p>Image: Step-by-step instructions (figures 16 to 21). Illustration by Marie Verdeil.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We chose to cover our coffee maker in glazed tiles. They are waterproof, easy to clean, and commonly used in kitchen furniture, walls and counter tops. Tiles are easy to adapt to various shapes and are aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, they are easy to obtain and tiling doesn’t require expensive tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 16 —</strong> First, prepare the surface for tiling. Adhesive mortar doesn’t stick well on cork, so start by covering the cork with plaster. We used plaster bands, similar to those used for medical casts. The bands also help to keep the cork sheets together and fill the air gaps. At this stage, protect the coffee maker with painter’s tape to prevent it from getting plastered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the plaster to dry for 24 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 17 —</strong> Once the plaster has dried, you can tile the surface. We found vintage glazed tiles on the street that we cut into strips and sanded off their sharp edges. For the top part, we use tile fragments from tiles that shattered during the cutting process. Mix approximately a cup of adhesive mortar for walls (which is stronger than adhesive mortar for floors). Using a spatula, spread some mortar at the back of each tile before pressing it against the cylinder. Leave a gap of a few millimeters between each tile for grouting. Repeat this process for the top, and ensure the chimney entrance remains clear. Leave everything to dry as indicated on the mortar packaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 18 —</strong> Now it’s time to grout the tiles. The aim of grouting is to seal the joints between the tiles to avoid moisture and dirt getting in. Mix the grout with water following the instructions on the package. With a scraper, or an old plastic card, press the paste in between the tiles. After about 20 minutes, clean up the excess grout with a damp sponge. Smooth out each grout line with a wet finger or sponge. Leave everything until it’s dry.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<h2>Step 4: Finishing touches</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 19 —</strong> Add a handle. Remove the original handle of the moka pot, as it has a vertical design that would get stuck in the mortar. Replace it with a horizontal handle, which gives leverage to screw and unscrew the top chamber and helps to serve the coffee. We made a handle out of wood and attached it with a bolt and nut to the coffee pot using the metal attachment welded on the cylinder. A length of about 20 cm is ideal. Use strong wood because the handle needs to withstand significant stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 20 —</strong> Wiring. Extend the short heat-resistant cable with a longer 1.5 mm² regular electric cable. Use shrink tape to prevent water or coffee from coming in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base. Add a 20 mm thick wood base and cork layer to the underside of the structure. It creates room to lift the coffee maker more easily, and protects the tiles from damaging the countertop surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fig. 21 —</strong> Done! Brew your first solar-powered coffee.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other ideas</h2>
<p>You could also fit the coffee pot in mortar in an existing box, like an old wooden crate or a scavenged metal drum. Instead of tiles, you could use other kinds of coating with a cement, lime or plaster base. You could also decide to integrate the pot in the kitchen furniture counter.</p>

      <h1>The Space Sim’s Last Hurrah</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>This article tells part of the story of space sims. Amidst so much else, the 1990s saw the rise and fall of the narrative-driven space sim. The sub-genre was effectively invented in 1990, when Wing Commander dared to add a set-piece story line to the sturdy foundation of the more open-ended British classic Elite. It […]</p>

<p>For most of history, the multifunctional fire was the only source of energy in the household. It served as a cookstove, toaster, heating device, lighting source, hot water boiler, clothes dryer, and refrigerator, among other functions. During the twentieth century, the fire was replaced by a wide range of appliances plugged into central infrastructures.</p>
<p>In this series of articles, LOW←TECH MAGAZINE critically examines the efficiency, sustainability, health, and safety of the fire and its flame- and smoke-free modern alternatives. What are we saying when we argue that electrical appliances are “better” than a traditional fire?</p>

      <h1>They call it Mister Pibb (again)</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>As Pibb is the official beverage of Old Vintage Computing Research, no doubt to the profound chagrin of the Coca-Cola Company, I feel compelled to offer a public service announcement.</p>
<p>Old and busted:</p>

<p>New hotness:</p>

<p>Yes, Mr Pibb (technically mr P!BB, though Coca-Cola is <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/mr--pibb-returns-with-bold-flavor-and-more-caffeine">inconsistent on their own brand name</a>) is back and Pibb Xtra, the face of Pibb since 2001, is relegated to the dust heap with Peppo. This explains why I had been unable to buy any more Pibb Xtra for the past month or so — Coke was probably depleting their stocks for the switchback. Since Old VCR's northern HQ is relatively close to a Coke bottling plant, I was able to pick up two fridge packs at Safeway today, though not exactly what I was expecting!</p>

<p>Besides the new can, the additional caffeine (30% more, though 54mg/can vs 40mg/can is probably not physiologically relevant for most people) and the additional ten calories, the other change is the taste. Now, Coke's marketdroids play the usual crap here and describe it in almost contradictory terms as &quot;a comeback&quot; yet possessing &quot;a bold, spicy cherry taste with hints of caramel.&quot; But actually ...</p>

<p>... this tastes mostly like the original. Although I'm disappointed it's HFCS and not cane sugar, it tastes like I remember classic Pibb tasting when McDonald's had it on fountain back in the day. Yes, this is also what my dad would water down with Coke to make a &quot;Poke&quot; because he found it too sweet, but even my wife, who is not a fan of any Pepper-style beverage generally, prefers this flavour to Xtra. The only other mark against it is a mildly spicy aftertaste that lingers a touch longer than it should, though Xtra does that a little bit too.</p>
<p>Overall I like them both, but clearly Xtra is on the way out. It's kind of funny given that Coke not too long ago released those limited edition Stranger Things New Coke cans:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MVbR-c0k0i0T2rdsXgB5yhE-4QW06fMDl_HH6lm7bmC75ahe0ArvHaOZ9oOFstYG6n19wPStEO6I9zPr-ncTfNqQz6K2sPS2WrS0xfVCVwPu1Bxwy380tOCHxrj29nj5T2AQWXQ53jxb/s2048/IMG_20190622_105621.jpg"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MVbR-c0k0i0T2rdsXgB5yhE-4QW06fMDl_HH6lm7bmC75ahe0ArvHaOZ9oOFstYG6n19wPStEO6I9zPr-ncTfNqQz6K2sPS2WrS0xfVCVwPu1Bxwy380tOCHxrj29nj5T2AQWXQ53jxb/w240-h320/IMG_20190622_105621.jpg" alt="Even New Coke is better than New Blogger!"></a></p>
<p>I actually didn't mind New Coke and the Stranger Things reformulation tasted approximately correct to my fuzzy memories of the original New Coke despite being good to have Classic (this is also true of early versions of Mac OS X). Still, both drinks are retro throwbacks in their own ways, one to the new and busted and the other to the old hotness, though this move implies Coca-Cola has more confidence in reviving old Pibb than New Coke — or at least is more willing to sink Pibb than Coke if they end up guessing wrong. I'll be putting a can of Pibb Xtra in my collection for posterity along with my last bottle of Dublin Dr Pepper, the finest Dr Pepper variant ever made.</p>
<p>For the sake of my day job, I should also officially state you should consume Mr Pibb/Pibb Xtra or any other sugar-sweetened beverage in moderation. After all, as Steve Jobs famously said to John Sculley, &quot;Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me [from Pepsi] and change the world?&quot; If you don't have a Coke bottling plant in your vicinity, which is probably where the &quot;select markets&quot; are, Coke says you'll get it in the &quot;national rollout&quot; sometime <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/mr--pibb-returns-with-bold-flavor-and-more-caffeine">in 2026</a> — and it may also be coming to <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/coca-cola-mr-pibb-revival-11840005">a soda fountain near you</a>.</p>

The application was first developed in the late 1990s by Jonathan Duddington, and Martin will go into detail about its history, leading up to it becoming open source and still maintained even though its creator has moved on to other things. He will also demonstrate a new installation of Pluto, along with…</p>

      <p>It’s now the end of October, and this year’s London Show has come and gone – hopefully it was a successful event for exhibitors, and an enjoyable one for visitors. It was certainly successful for RISCOSbits, according to a post-show announcement from Andy Marks. The first thing he mentioned were the slate coasters hinted at almost two weeks before the show, and revealed the day before. Describing them as very popular (I can see why), Andy says they are now a regular product and can be ordered online, individually or…</p>

      <h1>Packet Drivers Collection for FreeDOS</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>In 1986 FTP Software Inc. created the PC/TCP Packet Driver specification which defined an API for sending and receiving packets over networking devices. Inside the packet driver is code to talk to a specific piece of hardware. That hardware might be a network adapter, an Ethernet chipset connected through the parallel port, or even just a plain serial port. A packet driver makes the hardware and network accessible in an easy manner. Omar Yabar has collected a ton of DOS-era packet drivers in one place, so you can easily download the one you want. Find them at the <a href="https://packetdriversdos.net/">Packet Drivers Collection</a>. We can't include these in the FreeDOS distribution because they are not open source, but we <em>really</em> appreciate the hard work Omar has done to collect these for DOS fans to use!</p>

      <h1>FDNPKG16 ver. 0.99.8249</h1>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>FreeDOS developer 'sparky4' has been working on an updated version of the FreeDOS package manager, FDNPKG16, which runs as a 16-bit program. There's a new release to try out, here are the release notes (slightly edited for readability): &quot;Merged fdnpkg16 and fdnpkg86 to one program that uses httpget externally. too many issues with them separate and running like before. The older fdnpkg16 will eat memory and you cannot install hundreds of packages when it eats memory (6400) every time it called httpget, so I call it in an external simple program. Note: this does break international support for that particular area. There's a problem in fdnpkg86 with downloading files - on my recently acquired Toshiba T1200 system, it just takes too long, like over 2 hours for it to fail. But this should work now on all systems with more than 480kB of memory.&quot; You can get the latest version at <a href="https://github.com/sparky4/fdnpkg16/releases">FDNPKG16 releases on GitHub</a> or more directly from <a href="https://github.com/sparky4/fdnpkg16/releases/tag/0.99.8249">FDNPKG16 ver. 0.99.8249</a>.</p>

      <h1>The Apple Network Server MacOS ROMs have resurfaced</h1>

<p>The 1996 Apple Network Server was Apple's first true Unix-through-and-through server (the Apple Workgroup Server 95, actually a Quadra 950 with a special PDS card limited to A/UX, doesn't really count) and <a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">through a complex history</a> came to run <a href="/2025/05/harpoom-of-course-apple-network-server.html">IBM's AIX</a> as its native operating system. I actually had an ANS 500 when it was almost new, in 1998, and it ran Floodgap until 2012. It is still in my collection and still runs, along with an ANS 700 I later acquired and a (sadly battery bombed) <a href="/2021/10/shiner-esb-apple-network-server.html">&quot;Shiner ESB&quot; prototype that used to be at Netscape</a>. AIX was your only choice — no other operating system was supported.</p>
<p>Still, it was a relatively open secret that the ANS was heavily derived from existing Power Macintosh hardware, most closely the Power Macintosh 9500, and early &quot;Shiner&quot; prototype systems were even demonstrated with MacOS. This was apparently the underpinning of <a href="/2023/12/when-power-macintosh-ran-netware.html">Apple's brief flirtation with NetWare as a server OS</a>, variously codenamed Wormhole, Deep Space Nine and most famously Cyberpunk. Then-CEO Michael Spindler made public statements supporting NetWare on Apple hardware; Wormhole was reportedly demonstrated on an early prototype likely of <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ans/9150/">the Workgroup Server 9150</a> and Cyberpunk was explicitly meant for Shiner. Cyberpunk will no longer run on an ANS with production ROMs, but reportedly did run on ANSes with pre-production ROMs that could still boot MacOS, and <em>does</em> run on early NuBus Power Macs like the Power Macintosh 6100, which is <a href="/2023/12/when-power-macintosh-ran-netware.html">how we demonstrated it</a>. However, potential customers strongly preferred a Unix option and Apple had an arrangement with IBM around AIX, and so as the last operating system still standing that's what <a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">the ANS ended up running</a>. Production ANSes as sold with the standard Open Firmware 1.1.22 ROMs lock MacOS out entirely and you get a message like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyyGBIzsArRSoYnNDVPaQ3emOSH43BJC5G9fXJ0_ZVRJZgc_1XYHSHBYgSsP04WEvvysJnGxyz1XY2T9l4VJcnzOd2dQ78mAUH94mu7lbZG0GIw67kk-JLBwnOj7zdhkLrPextWfHBBQS2jviPUtsn1atO3TDmAtFHavpwHDLptoSJdXdVfRYv1jIQYEs/s4080/PXL_20231117_205759318.jpg"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyyGBIzsArRSoYnNDVPaQ3emOSH43BJC5G9fXJ0_ZVRJZgc_1XYHSHBYgSsP04WEvvysJnGxyz1XY2T9l4VJcnzOd2dQ78mAUH94mu7lbZG0GIw67kk-JLBwnOj7zdhkLrPextWfHBBQS2jviPUtsn1atO3TDmAtFHavpwHDLptoSJdXdVfRYv1jIQYEs/s320/PXL_20231117_205759318.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Although an old nerds' tale circulated at the time saying you could pull 9500 ROMs, put in a video card and boot from an external hard disk (because the video chip and internal SCSI controller are unique to the ANS and weren't supported by the 9500 or MacOS), this couldn't possibly have worked because among other things the Bandits in the ANS are mapped differently. Lots of people, including yours truly, had certainly tried. Still, I was used to AIX as an AIX administrator since the 3.2.5 days on real RS/6000 hardware and the ANS ran it splendidly, so today mine still runs it (4.1.5 is the last AIX release supported).</p>

<p>But to me the best thing about the ANS was that I got a big beefy RISC server for a summer's work, so I didn't have to plump down a credit card. For everyone else, the ANS was expensive (starting at <span class="math inline">\(10,000+ in 1996, a cool \)</span>20 grand in 2025 dollars) and Apple wasn't moving many. CEO Gil Amelio had lured Ellen Hancock away from National Semiconductor as Apple's new CTO and tasked her with finding a new path for the MacOS, though in the meantime Apple had this big hulking midrange server that wasn't selling. So, as an attempt to juice sales, Hancock announced at Comdex 1996 that the ANS would be able to run other operating system choices, not just AIX. MacOS was an obvious one because it already had before, but Hancock also proposed Windows NT to the great surprise of attendees. While Windows NT was built to be system-agnostic and versions already ran on PowerPC hardware, and people have since <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/maciNTosh">hacked it to run on Power Macs</a>, this would have been the first time it could officially ever run on an Apple machine.</p>
<p>Hancock's assertion was a simple ROM change would do it, and as it happens the ROMs on the ANS are conveniently on a small daughtercard that can be replaced. However, it seems that the market was sceptical this could work — heck, <em>I</em> was sceptical while doing the story research, since I knew no such ROMs were ever publicly sold — and the recently-returned Steve Jobs talked Amelio into cancelling the ANS line <a href="/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">and OpenDoc</a> both on the same day in 1997. Nothing more ever turned up about either option.</p>

<p>Recently a former employee who was on the business development team for Apple's server products <a href="https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/erics-apple-network-server-700-tinker-log.3987/#post-37621">posted on the Tinker Different boards</a>: not only did he have the mythical MacOS ROM, he had it installed in a Deep Dish booting the MacOS. Deep Dish was the code name for the planned but unreleased ANS 300, a small rackmountable version (as opposed to the rackmount plates Apple sold for the 500 and 700 which take up a whopping 19U), so here was a prototype machine running development ROMs booting an operating system it was never actually sold with. More to the point, he confirmed the Windows NT ROMs actually did exist and worked as well.</p>
<p>Though he didn't have the NT ROMs, he did dump the two development ROMs he had (a third is in progress) which included the MacOS ROM — and now we have them for analysis. What's interesting is that both the explicit MacOS ROM and the Open Firmware 2.26b6 ROM he dumped seem capable of booting MacOS, though the 2.2 ROM has strings saying <code>MacOS is unsupported, use at your own risk.</code> and <code>MacOS requires PCI video card and external SCSI boot disk.</code> (which may lend credence to that old nerds' tale, assuming you had the right ROMs, not the 9500's). However, the full MacOS ROM reportedly &quot;just works,&quot; all the way to Mac OS 9; one wonders if with XPostFacto you could drag it into OS X that way, giving it another Unix option besides AIX, Linux and NetBSD, the driver issue notwithstanding. Though the MacOS ROM does not use the ANS's front-mounted LCD, which is one of its best features, it wouldn't seem difficult to come up with an INIT extension for it. A particularly tantalizing thought is this might also get Cyberpunk running on a Shiner for the first time since 1996, the very machine it was intended for.</p>
<p>To make all that happen, of course, we next need to get the MacOS ROM on an actual ROM card. The ROMs this individual had were flashable and I need to do some looking at mine, and the connectors aren't common. Nevertheless, the first step is to actually <em>have</em> the ROM and now we do. I'm hopeful that this breakthrough might encourage further exploration of my favourite Apple server and that someone out there has the NT ROMs and steps forward. The Apple Network Server was always a cult favourite as one of Apple's more notorious white elephants and now almost 30 years after its introduction there may be even more fun things to do on it. If you know where to find them, post in the comments or drop me a line at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com (happy to keep you anonymous if you prefer which I have done for other former Apple engineers in the past).</p>

      <h1>London is closer than you think</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>This year’s <a href="https://www.riscoslondonshow.co.uk/">London show</a> organised by <a href="https://rougol.jellybaby.net/">ROUGOL</a> is this Saturday the 25th October from 11am. Shows are the perfect opportunity to meet and talk to fellow RISC OS users and developers about what they’re doing with our favourite operating system.</p>
<p><img src="/images/risc_os_open/shows/rougol2025.png" alt="Show banner"></p>
<h3>Venue details</h3>
<p>A short distance by public transport, around ten miles from Heathrow airport, less than four miles from the M1 motorway, the Harrow District Masonic Centre is closer than you think; see this Google <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vqigUNhWUqDjfXEH6">map</a> for directions.</p>
<p>Please note: engineering work means <strong>the Bakerloo tube line is closed</strong> this weekend.</p>
<h3>See BASIC in action</h3>
<p>See the alpha version of BBCBASIC rewritten in C, running natively on both RISC OS 5 and Windows x64, and find out what’s required to get it all finished. It’s a considerable technical effort, and will pave the way for all kinds of language extensions in future.</p>
<p>Want to know why nightly builds of BASIC gained a new <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/Programmer/BASIC/-/merge_requests/16">SYS-as-a-function keyword</a> recently? It’s all part of the <a href="/content/documents/risc-os-moonshots">mission to the moon</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)

      <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.c64os.resources/weblog/petsciiasciiconversion/icon-petsciiascii.jpg" alt=""> Let's talk about PETSCII and ASCII, what they are and how to convert between them properly and losslessly. There are some examples on the internet that are not right, and there are some nuances that make it more complicated than it seems at first glance. ASCII was developed to standardize the codes used by different types of early computers and teletype (and teletype-like) machines. At this time, computers generated output by printing to paper. Although it is an &quot;American&quot; standard code of information interchange, several of the characters were designed for internationalization, by combinations that can only be done on paper. For example, the &quot;Back Space&quot;, which became ubiquitous on PCs for &quot;delete,&quot; on paper truly is a back &quot;space.&quot; It causes the print head to move back one space so that it's positioned above where the previous character was printed. Symbols like, caret (^), tilde (~), and backtick (`), which we use today to mean or perform certain technical functions, are actually me. . .</p>
