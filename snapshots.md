## Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now stable and generally available

date: 2025-07-22, updated: 2025-07-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-25-flash-lite-is-now-stable-and-generally-available/">Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now stable and generally available</a></strong></p>
The last remaining member of the Gemini 2.5 trio joins Pro and Flash in General Availability today.</p>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is the cheapest of the 2.5 family, at $0.10/million input tokens and $0.40/million output tokens. This puts it equal to GPT-4.1 Nano on my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> comparison table.</p>
<p>The preview version of that model had the same pricing for text tokens, but is now cheaper for audio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have also reduced audio input pricing by 40% from the preview launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.24">llm-gemini 0.24</a> with support for the new model alias:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm -m gemini-2.5-flash-lite \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pelican-joke-request.mp3
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote more <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/17/gemini-2-5/">about the Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite preview model</a> last month.

## Bartz v. Anthropic: Judge Alsup Certifies Class for Rightsholders of 7 Million Books Used by Anthropic

date: 2025-07-22, from: Authors Union blogs

Late last week Judge Alsup, presiding over the Bartz v. Anthropic copyright AI litigation, granted a motion to certify a class representing authors and rightsholders of nearly 7 million books. If you are a book author (or a publisher, or an heir to an author), you should be paying attention because there is a good chance that you could be included in this class.

## Textual v4.0.0: The Streaming Release

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/releases/tag/v4.0.0">Textual v4.0.0: The Streaming Release</a></strong></p>
Will McGugan may <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2025/05/07/the-future-of-textualize/">no longer be running</a> a commercial company around Textual, but that hasn't stopped his progress on the open source project.</p>
<p>He recently released v4 of his Python framework for building TUI command-line apps, and the signature feature is <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/pull/5950">streaming Markdown support</a> - super relevant in our current age of LLMs, most of which default to outputting a stream of Markdown via their APIs.</p>
<p>I took an example <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/03b94706399f110ff93fa396d4afbc79c3738638/tests/snapshot_tests/test_snapshots.py#L4378-L4400">from one of his tests</a>, spliced in my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#async-models">async LLM Python library</a> and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/687c3a6a-4e1c-8006-83a2-706b4bf04067">got some help from o3</a> to turn it into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/916b16cd7dfd3c23315d0a4ed02172878feafa45/python/streaming_textual_markdown.py">a streaming script</a> for talking to models, which can be run like this:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/tidwall/pogocache">tidwall/pogocache</a></strong></p>
New project from Josh Baker, author of the excellent <code>tg</code> C geospatial libarry (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Sep/23/tg-polygon-indexing/">covered previously</a>) and various other <a href="https://github.com/tidwall">interesting projects</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pogocache is fast caching software built from scratch with a focus on low latency and cpu efficency.</p>
<p>Faster: Pogocache is faster than Memcache, Valkey, Redis, Dragonfly, and Garnet. It has the lowest latency per request, providing the quickest response times. It's optimized to scale from one to many cores, giving you the best single-threaded and multithreaded performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faster than Memcache and Redis is a big claim! The README includes a <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/pogocache/blob/main/README.md#design-details">design details</a> section that explains how the system achieves that performance, using a sharded hashmap inspired by Josh's <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/shardmap">shardmap</a> project and clever application of threads.</p>
<p>Performance aside, the most interesting thing about Pogocache is the server interface it provides: it emulates the APIs for Redis and Memcached, provides a simple HTTP API <em>and</em> lets you talk to it over the PostgreSQL wire protocol as well!</p>

## Advanced version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/">Advanced version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad</a></strong></p>
OpenAI beat them to the punch in terms of publicity by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">publishing their results on Saturday</a>, but a team from Google Gemini achieved an equally impressive result on this year's International Mathematics Olympiad scoring a gold medal performance with their custom research model.</p>
<p>(I saw an unconfirmed rumor that the Gemini team had to wait until Monday for approval from Google PR - this turns out to be inaccurate, see update below.)</p>
<p>It's interesting that Gemini achieved the <em>exact same score</em> as OpenAI, 35/42, and were able to solve the same set of questions - 1 through 5, failing only to answer 6, which is designed to be the hardest question.</p>
<p>Each question is worth seven points, so 35/42 cents corresponds to full marks on five out of the six problems.</p>
<p>Only 6 of <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2025">the 630 human contestants</a> this year scored all 7 points for question 6 this year, and just 55 more had greater than 0 points for that question.</p>
<p>OpenAI claimed their model had not been optimized for IMO questions. Gemini's model was different - emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We achieved this year’s result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think – an enhanced reasoning mode for complex problems that incorporates some of our latest research techniques, including parallel thinking. This setup enables the model to simultaneously explore and combine multiple possible solutions before giving a final answer, rather than pursuing a single, linear chain of thought.</p>
<p>To make the most of the reasoning capabilities of Deep Think, we additionally trained this version of Gemini on novel reinforcement learning techniques that can leverage more multi-step reasoning, problem-solving and theorem-proving data. <strong>We also provided Gemini with access to a curated corpus of high-quality solutions to mathematics problems, and added some general hints and tips on how to approach IMO problems to its instructions</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gemini team, like the OpenAI team, achieved this result with <a href="https://x.com/fredzhang0/status/1947364744412758305">no tool use or internet access</a> for the model.</p>
<p>Gemini's solutions are listed <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/IMO_2025.pdf">in this PDF</a>. If you are mathematically inclined you can compare them with OpenAI's solutions <a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Last year Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">achieved a silver medal in IMO</a>, solving four of the six problems using custom models called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand. In the official competition, students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year's result, scoring gold with a single model, within the allotted time and with no manual step to translate the problems first, is much more impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Concerning the timing of the news, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis <a href="https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337618787615175">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Btw as an aside, we didn’t announce on Friday because we respected the IMO Board's original request that all AI labs share their results only after the official results had been verified by independent experts &amp; the students had rightly received the acclamation they deserved</p>
<p>We've now been given permission to share our results and are pleased to have been part of the inaugural cohort to have our model results officially graded and certified by IMO coordinators and experts, receiving the first official gold-level performance grading for an AI system!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI's <a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947398538662437306">Noam Brown</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we shared our results, we spoke with an IMO board member, who asked us to wait until after the award ceremony to make it public, a request we happily honored.</p>
<p>We announced at ~1am PT (6pm AEST), after the award ceremony concluded. At no point did anyone request that we announce later than that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell the Gemini team was participating in an official capacity, while OpenAI were not. <a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947398532899738064">Noam again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~2 months ago, the IMO emailed us about participating in a formal (Lean) version of the IMO. We’ve been focused on general reasoning in natural language without the constraints of Lean, so we declined. We were never approached about a natural language math option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither OpenAI nor Gemini used <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a> in their attempts, which would have counted as tool use.

## Quoting Daniel Litt

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://x.com/littmath/status/1946987909439017108"><p>An AI tool that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">gets gold on the IMO</a> is obviously immensely impressive. Does it mean math is “solved”? Is an AI-generated proof of the Riemann hypothesis clearly on the horizon? Obviously not.</p>
<p>Worth keeping timescales in mind here: IMO competitors spend an average of 1.5 hrs on each problem. High-quality math research, by contrast, takes month or years.</p>
<p>What are the obstructions to AI performing high-quality autonomous math research? I don’t claim to know for sure, but I think they include many of the same obstructions that prevent it from doing many jobs: Long context, long-term planning, consistency, unclear rewards, lack of training data, etc.</p>
<p>It’s possible that some or all of these will be solved soon (or have been solved) but I think it’s worth being cautious about over-indexing on recent (amazing) progress.</p></blockquote>

## How I write docs quickly

date: 2025-07-21, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’ve been writing documentation and technical articles for more than a decade now. One piece of feedback I consistently got from managers and peers during all these years is how <em>fast</em> I am when producing and releasing docs. For example, I was once asked to document a new feature from a team I wasn’t serving two weeks ahead of launch. Everything was new to me, but I had most of the docs drafted after four days. By launch, the docs had been deemed ready to go live.</p>

## Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update)

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://antirez.com/news/154">Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update)</a></strong></p>
Salvatore Sanfilippo describes his current AI-assisted development workflow. He's all-in on LLMs for code review, exploratory prototyping, pair-design and writing "part of the code under your clear specifications", but warns against leaning too hard on pure vibe coding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But while LLMs can write part of a code base with success (under your strict supervision, see later), and produce a very sensible speedup in development (or, the ability to develop more/better in the same time used in the past — which is what I do), when left alone with nontrivial goals they tend to produce fragile code bases that are larger than needed, complex, full of local minima choices, suboptimal in many ways. Moreover they just fail completely when the task at hand is more complex than a given level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of useful tips in there, especially around carefully managing your context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When your goal is to reason with an LLM about implementing or fixing some code, you need to provide extensive information to the LLM: papers, big parts of the target code base (all the code base if possible, unless this is going to make the context window so large than the LLM performances will be impaired). And a brain dump of all your understanding of what should be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salvatore warns against relying too hard on tools which hide the context for you, like editors with integrated coding agents. He prefers pasting exactly what's needed into the LLM web interface - I share his preference there.</p>
<p>His conclusions here match <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">my experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will be able to do things that are otherwise at the borders of your knowledge / expertise while learning much in the process (yes, you can learn from LLMs, as you can learn from books or colleagues: it is one of the forms of education possible, a new one). Yet, everything produced will follow your idea of code and product, and will be of high quality and will not random fail because of errors and shortcomings introduced by the LLM. You will also retain a strong understanding of all the code written and its design.</p>

BlogIt is a command I've written many times over the years. At it's core
is did a two simple things. 

1. Copy CommonMark files into a blog directory three
2. Use Front Matter as a source for aggregated blog metadata

In it the new incarnation it is primarily focus on curating the front matter
followed by copying the document into the blog directory structure. 

1. Curate CommonMark file front matter
2. Copy CommonMark files into the blog directory tree

Other tools can aggregate blog metadata like [FlatLake](https://flatlake.app).

## Quoting Armin Ronacher

date: 2025-07-20, updated: 2025-07-20, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/20/the-next-generation/"><p>Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to make ChatGPT build something. Lucky for us: in many of those cases the AI picks Python. We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate an expansion in the kinds of people who might want to attend a Python conference. Yet many of these new programmers are not even aware that programming communities and conferences exist. It’s in the Python community’s interest to find ways to pull them in.</p></blockquote>

## Quoting Tim Sweeney

<blockquote cite="https://x.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1946721961746608267"><p>There’s a bigger opportunity in computer science and programming (academically conveyed or self-taught) now than ever before, by far, in my opinion. The move to AI is like replacing shovels with bulldozers. Every business will benefit from this and they’ll need people to do it.</p></blockquote>
