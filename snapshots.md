## Revisiting ZFS for Mac

date: 2025-04-28, from: Michael Tsai

Hacker News is highlighting Adam Leventhal&#8217;s 2016 post (2016 comments) about Apple&#8217;s Leopard-era support for ZFS: A few weeks before WWDC 2007 nerds like me started to lose their minds: Apple really was going to port ZFS to Mac OS X.[&#8230;]ZFS was to bring to Mac OS X data integrity, compression, checksums, redundancy, snapshots, etc, [&#8230;]

## Synology Hard Drive Locking

date: 2025-04-28, from: Michael Tsai

Patrick Kennedy (via Hacker News): According to HardwareLuxx, Synology is on a rough course with generations-old sub-par NAS hardware and now appears to be locking its NAS units to its own branded hard drives in its upcoming 2025 Plus models. This is a shame since a few years ago, Synology had neat hardware.[&#8230;]Without scale, and [&#8230;]

This article that calls for the razing of HUD's bldg and talks in awful ways about HUD employees. 

TIL that HUD was in the Murrah Building (1995 OKC bombing). They lost many people that day. 

This is not normal. This is traumatizing and awful.

<p><strong>AI isn't just a productivity boost</strong>. It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn't scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP. [...]</p>
<p>We'll be rolling out a few constructive constraints to help guide this shift:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle</li>
<li>﻿﻿AI use will be part of what we look for in hiring</li>
<li>﻿﻿AI use will be part of what we evaluate in performance reviews</li>
<li>﻿﻿Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work</li>

## Qwen2.5 Omni: See, Hear, Talk, Write, Do It All!

date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-omni/">Qwen2.5 Omni: See, Hear, Talk, Write, Do It All!</a></strong></p>
I'm not sure how I missed this one at the time, but last month (March 27th) Qwen released their first multi-modal model that can handle audio and video in addition to text and images - and that has audio output as a core model feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We propose Thinker-Talker architecture, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. We propose a novel position embedding, named TMRoPE (Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE), to synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Omni/blob/main/assets/Qwen2.5_Omni.pdf">Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report PDF</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell nobody has an easy path to getting it working on a Mac yet (the closest report I saw was <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B/discussions/30#67efc2fea84839de3a73b275">this comment</a> on Hugging Face).</p>
<p>This release is notable because, while there's a pretty solid collection of open weight vision LLMs now, multi-modal models that go beyond that are still very rare. Like most of Qwen's recent models, Qwen2.5 Omni is released under an Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<p><strong>Qwen 3</strong> is expected to release within the next 24 hours or so. <a href="https://twitter.com/jianxliao/status/1916814915463200953">@jianxliao captured</a> a screenshot of their Hugging Face collection which they accidentally revealed before withdrawing it again which suggests the new model will be available in 0.6B / 1.7B / 4B / 8B / 30B sizes. I'm particularly excited to try the 30B one - 22-30B has established itself as my favorite size range for running models on my 64GB M2 as it often delivers exceptional results while still leaving me enough memory to run other applications at the same time.

## Giving software away for free

date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>If you want to create completely <strong>free software</strong> for other people to use, the absolute best delivery mechanism right now is static HTML and JavaScript served from a free web host with an established reputation.</p>
<p>Thanks to WebAssembly the set of potential software that can be served in this way is vast and, I think, under appreciated. <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> means we can ship client-side Python applications now!</p>
<p>This assumes that you would like your gift to the world to keep working for as long as possible, while granting you the freedom to lose interest and move onto other projects without needing to keep covering expenses far into the future.</p>
<p>Even the cheapest hosting plan requires you to monitor and update billing details every few years. Domains have to be renewed. Anything that runs server-side will inevitably need to be upgraded someday - and the longer you wait between upgrades the harder those become.</p>
<p>My top choice for this kind of thing in 2025 is GitHub, using GitHub Pages. It's free for public repositories and I haven't seen GitHub break a working URL that they have hosted in the 17+ years since they first launched.</p>
<p>A few years ago I'd have recommended Heroku on the basis that their free plan had stayed reliable for more than a decade, but Salesforce took that accumulated goodwill and <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter">incinerated it in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>It almost goes without saying that you should release it under an open source license. The license alone is not enough to ensure regular human beings can make use of what you have built though: give people a link to something that works!</p>

## o3 Beats a Master-Level Geoguessr Player—Even with Fake EXIF Data

date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://sampatt.com/blog/2025-04-28-can-o3-beat-a-geoguessr-master">o3 Beats a Master-Level Geoguessr Player—Even with Fake EXIF Data</a></strong></p>
Sam Patterson (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/geoguessr/">previously</a>) puts his GeoGuessr ELO of 1188 (just short of the top champions division) to good use, exploring o3's ability to guess the location from a photo in a much more thorough way than <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/">my own experiment</a>.</p>
<p>Over five rounds o3 narrowly beat him, guessing better than Sam in only 2/5 but with a higher score due to closer guesses in the ones that o3 won.</p>
<p>Even more interestingly, Sam experimented with feeding images with fake EXIF GPS locations to see if o3 (when reminded to use Python to read those tags) would fall for the trick. It spotted the ruse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those coordinates put you in suburban Bangkok, Thailand—obviously nowhere near the Andean coffee-zone scene in the photo. So either the file is a re-encoded Street View frame with spoofed/default metadata, or the camera that captured the screenshot had stale GPS information.</p>
</blockquote>

## New dashboard: alt text for all my images

date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/alt-text/">New dashboard: alt text for all my images</a></strong></p>
I got curious today about how I'd been using alt text for images on my blog, and realized that since I have <a href="https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/">Django SQL Dashboard</a> running on this site and PostgreSQL is capable of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">parsing HTML with regular expressions</a> I could probably find out using a SQL query.</p>
<p>I pasted <a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/schema/">my PostgreSQL schema</a> into Claude and gave it a pretty long prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give this PostgreSQL schema I want a query that returns all of my images and their alt text. Images are sometimes stored as HTML image tags and other times stored in markdown.</p>
<p><code>blog_quotation.quotation</code>, <code>blog_note.body</code> both contain markdown. <code>blog_blogmark.commentary</code> has markdown if <code>use_markdown</code> is true or HTML otherwise. <code>blog_entry.body</code> is always HTML</p>
<p>Write me a SQL query to extract all of my images and their alt tags using regular expressions. In HTML documents it should look for either <code>&lt;img .* src="..." .* alt="..."</code> or <code>&lt;img alt="..." .* src="..."</code> (images may be self-closing XHTML style in some places). In Markdown they will always be <code>![alt text](url)</code></p>
<p>I want the resulting table to have three columns: URL, alt_text, src - the URL column needs to be constructed as e.g. <code>/2025/Feb/2/slug</code> for a record where created is on 2nd feb 2025 and the <code>slug</code> column contains <code>slug</code></p>
<p>Use CTEs and unions where appropriate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It almost got it right on the first go, and with <a href="https://claude.ai/share/e3b996d3-b480-436d-aa40-9caa7609474f">a couple of follow-up prompts</a> I had the query I wanted. I also added the option to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/alt-text/?search=pelican">search</a> my alt text / image URLs, which has already helped me hunt down and fix a few old images on expired domain names. Here's a copy of <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5b44a662354e124e33cc1d4704cdb91a">the finished 100 line SQL query</a>.

## Episode 156 - RPG, a Different Paradigm?

date: 2025-04-27, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">How do you make a computer act less like a computer? It sounds like some kind of riddle, but in the early 1960s it was an actual problem. As IBM customers transitioned from tabulators to computers they ran into all sorts of practical issues. Programmers became a hot commodity. But how do you find a programmer in 1959? And how can you even afford such a luxury? Wouldn't it be better if you could just use your new computer as a tabulator? Well, with RPG, all that and more was possible.</p>

We’ve modernized legacy government systems. We know what it takes. DOGE’s plan to migrate SSA’s COBOL systems without understanding is a disaster waiting to happen.

Here’s why DOGE will fail — and why it matters.

## MCP is Unnecessary

date: 2025-04-27, updated: 2025-04-27, from: Tom Kellog blog

I can’t think of any strong technological reasons for MCP to exist. There’s a lot
of weak technological reasons, and there’s strong sociological reasons. I still strongly
feel that, ironically, it is necessary. I’m writing this post to force myself to clarify
my own thoughts, and to get opinions from everyone else.
