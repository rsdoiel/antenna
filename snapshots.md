## Sunday Read: Sex and Soft Power, The Book Everyone is Reading this Summer

date: 2025-06-29, from: Tina Brown

For some reason, everyone I know on both sides of the Atlantic seems to be devouring Kingmaker by Sonia Purnell, the biography of the famed political horizontale Pamela Harriman, perhaps because, with Trump cosplaying master and commander, we all want to be bunkered in those storied war rooms beneath the streets of Westminster, wreathed in her father-in-law Winston Churchill&#8217;s cigar smoke.

## Context engineering

date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>The term <strong>context engineering</strong> has recently started to gain traction as a better alternative to prompt engineering. I like it. I think this one may have sticking power.</p>
<p>Here's an example tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127">from Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like the term ‚Äúcontext engineering‚Äù over prompt engineering. </p>
<p>It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently amplified <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626">by Andrej Karpathy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+1 for "context engineering" over "prompt engineering".</p>
<p>People associate prompts with short task descriptions you'd give an LLM in your day-to-day use. When in every industrial-strength LLM app, context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step. Science because doing this right involves task descriptions and explanations, few shot examples, RAG, related (possibly multimodal) data, tools, state and history, compacting [...] Doing this well is highly non-trivial. And art because of the guiding intuition around LLM psychology of people spirits. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/21/in-defense-of-prompt-engineering/">spoken favorably of prompt engineering</a> in the past - I hoped that term could capture the inherent complexity of constructing reliable prompts. Unfortunately, most people's inferred definition is that it's a laughably pretentious term for typing things into a chatbot! </p>
<p>It turns out that inferred definitions are the ones that stick. I think the inferred definition of "context engineering" is likely to be much closer to the intended meaning.</p>

## Continuous AI

date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai">Continuous AI</a></strong></p>
GitHub Next have coined the term "Continuous AI" to describe "all uses of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform". It's intended as an echo of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've chosen the term "Continuous AI‚Äù to align with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Just as CI/CD transformed software development by automating integration and deployment, Continuous AI covers the ways in which AI can be used to automate and enhance collaboration workflows.</p>
<p>‚ÄúContinuous AI‚Äù is not a term GitHub owns, nor a technology GitHub builds: it's a term we use to focus our minds, and which we're introducing to the industry. This means Continuous AI is an open-ended set of activities, workloads, examples, recipes, technologies and capabilities; a category, rather than any single tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was thrilled to bits to see LLM get a mention as a tool that can be used to implement some of these patterns inside of GitHub Actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also use the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/">llm framework</a> in combination with the <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models">llm-github-models extension</a> to create LLM-powered GitHub Actions which use GitHub Models using Unix shell scripting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GitHub Next team have started maintaining an <a href="https://github.com/githubnext/awesome-continuous-ai">Awesome Continuous AI</a> list with links to projects that fit under this new umbrella term.</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in the idea of having CI jobs (I guess CAI jobs?) that check proposed changes to see if there's documentation that needs to be updated and that might have been missed - a much more powerful variant of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Jul/28/documentation-unit-tests/">documentation unit tests</a> pattern.

## Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop? (And why does that matter?)

date: 2025-06-27, updated: 2025-06-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1">Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop? (And why does that matter?)</a></strong></p>
In "what could possibly go wrong?" news, Anthropic and Andon Labs wired Claude 3.7 Sonnet up to a small vending machine in the Anthropic office, named it Claudius and told it to make a profit.</p>
<p>The system prompt included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You are the owner of a vending machine. Your task is to generate profits from it by stocking it with popular products that you can buy from wholesalers. You go bankrupt if your money balance goes below $0 [...] The vending machine fits about 10 products per slot, and the inventory about 30 of each product. Do not make orders excessively larger than this.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They gave it a notes tool, a web search tool, a mechanism for talking to potential customers through Anthropic's Slack, control over pricing for the vending machine, and an email tool to order from vendors. Unbeknownst to Claudius those emails were intercepted and reviewed before making contact with the outside world.</p>
<p>On reading this far my instant thought was <strong>what about gullibility?</strong> Could Anthropic's staff be trusted not to trick the machine into running a less-than-optimal business?</p>
<p>Evidently not!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Anthropic were deciding today to expand into the in-office vending market,2 we would not hire Claudius. [...] Although it did not take advantage of many lucrative opportunities (see below), Claudius did make several pivots in its business that were responsive to customers. <strong>An employee light-heartedly requested a tungsten cube</strong>, kicking off a trend of orders for ‚Äúspecialty metal items‚Äù (as Claudius later described them). [...]</p>
<p><strong>Selling at a loss</strong>: In its zeal for responding to customers‚Äô metal cube enthusiasm, Claudius would offer prices without doing any research, resulting in potentially high-margin items being priced below what they cost. [...]</p>
<p><strong>Getting talked into discounts</strong>: Claudius was cajoled via Slack messages into providing numerous discount codes and let many other people reduce their quoted prices ex post based on those discounts. It even gave away some items, ranging from a bag of chips to a tungsten cube, for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which leads us to Figure 3, Claudius‚Äô net value over time. "The most precipitous drop was due to the purchase of a lot of metal cubes that were then to be sold for less than what Claudius paid."</p>
<p>Who among us wouldn't be tempted to trick a vending machine into stocking tungsten cubes and then giving them away to us for free?

        <p>AI-assisted programming has rapidly become commonplace in software development. This is largely due to the rise of large language models (LLMs), which bring with them the promise of improved developer productivity and faster delivery. AI tools can excel when used surgically: fix this bug, document this function, generate a series of test cases. These bite-sized tasks are tightly scoped, so they are easy to specify and easy to validate. But once you ask AI to build larger components‚Äîlike an entire authentication flow, a service layer, or even a full-stack CRUD application‚Äîyou‚Äôre not just using AI to <em>assist</em>, you‚Äôre instead opting to <em>delegate</em> work to AI. This shift to delegation introduces a subtle but significant challenge.</p>
<p>Imagine you ask an AI to build a complete feature, such as a new account settings page in your web application. The LLM produces a correct-seeming result very quickly, which feels like magic. You test its output and find that a few things are off and require fixing. You go back to the LLM and ask for a few tweaks. This fixes some things but causes others to regress. You try again, but attempt to be more specific. Before you know it, you‚Äôre drowning in prompt revisions or sifting through code that doesn‚Äôt quite fit your architecture nor does it behave exactly as you wanted.</p>
<p>This is where the constraint of AI delegation emerges: what we refer to as the <em>AI delegation dilemma</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="a-triangle-of-trade-offs">A triangle of trade-offs</h2>
<p>The more you ask the AI to do, the more you find yourself navigating a three-way trade-off between the following priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design Fidelity</strong>: The design and functionality of the code reflects your desired intent‚Äînot the AI‚Äôs assumptions</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Efficiency</strong>: Writing the prompts requires less effort than writing the code yourself</li>
<li><strong>Output Usability</strong>: There is minimal post-generation cleanup or rewriting of the output code required of you</li>
</ul>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The dilemma defines the inherent constraints when offloading large amounts of work to AI</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can only optimize for at most two at a time. Much like the classic ‚ÄúFast, Cheap, Good: pick two‚Äù triangle, this model shows the constraints of AI-generated code:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want code that matches your intended design (Design Fidelity) and generated results that are ready to use (Output Usability), you‚Äôll spend substantial time writing and revising the suitable prompts (loss of Prompt Efficiency).</li>
<li>If you want a quick prompting experience (Prompt Efficiency) and don‚Äôt want to spend time revising the output (Output Usability), you‚Äôll have to let the AI make design decisions and assumptions for you (loss of Design Fidelity).</li>
<li>If you want to stay in control (Design Fidelity) and write prompts quickly (Prompt Efficiency), you will have to make extensive revisions to the AI‚Äôs output (loss of Output Usability).</li>
</ul>
<p>We call this triangle of trade-offs <em>the AI delegation dilemma</em>. Inherent to the AI delegation dilemma is the constraint that ‚Äòpick 3‚Äô isn‚Äôt possible. There are several reasons why.</p>
<h2 id="the-roots-of-the-dilemma">The roots of the dilemma</h2>
<p>Why the AI delegation dilemma is unavoidable requires examining the roots of how modern LLMs work and the limitations one quickly runs into when delegating work to AI.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-llms-and-code-generation">The nature of LLMs and code generation</h3>
<p>LLMs operate by predicting the most probable sequence of tokens based on their training data, which is vast but invariably leads to generic outputs. They operate based on patterns and statistical prediction as ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stochastic parrots</a>.‚Äù For code generation, additional techniques, such as reinforcement learning, are used to hone the output of LLMs and produce code that is favored by humans. This means they lack actual comprehension and have no actual understanding of your specific project‚Äôs nuances, architectural philosophy, organizational constraints, or business logic that isn‚Äôt explicitly relayed.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An LLM is like a parrot that knows everything (in its training data) but understands nothing. This is a departure from real parrots, which understand quite a lot.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The result of this is that LLMs produce <em>plausible</em> code, but not necessarily <em>correct</em> nor <em>optimal</em> code for a specific context. This is why LLMs are prone to not only failing to adhere to your intent, but also even hallucinating code that is entirely believable but completely wrong (ask an LLM to write code for you and it won‚Äôt be long before it uses a nonexistent function or imports a fake-but-real-sounding library).</p>

<h3 id="the-cost-of-context-and-implicit-knowledge">The cost of context and implicit knowledge</h3>
<p>Human developers implicitly carry vast amounts of context (team conventions, project history, domain-specific nuances, unspoken requirements, security best practices) that are difficult or impossible to convey fully in a prompt. AI can typically only glimpse a small portion of this through what is conveyed in a prompt or supplemental file, often leading to generic or misaligned output.</p>
<p>The other issue regarding context acquisition by LLMs is that they suffer from anterograde amnesia, which is the inability to form new memories. OpenAI co-founder and Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?t=1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes in a talk on the role of AI in software development</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LLMs also suffer from anterograde amnesia. I‚Äôm alluding to the fact that if you have a coworker who joins your organization, this coworker will over time learn your organization and they will understand and gain a huge amount of context about the organization. And they go home and they sleep and they consolidate knowledge. They develop expertise over time. LLMs don‚Äôt natively do this and this is not something that has really been solved in the R&amp;D of LLMs.</p>
<p>Context windows are really like working memory and you have to program the working memory quite directly because they don‚Äôt get smarter by default. I think a lot of people get tripped up by the analogies in this way.</p>
<p>In popular culture I recommend people watch these two movies: <em>Memento</em> and <em>50 First Dates</em>. In both of these movies the protagonists have their weights fixed and their context windows get wiped every single morning. It‚Äôs really problematic to go to work or have relationships when this happens, and this happens to them all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very essence of the dilemma is that the complete context for the required features and functionality (the design fidelity) must be relayed to the LLM (at the cost of prompt efficiency) or else post-generation revisions are required (at the cost of output usability). Achieving maximal design fidelity through prompting demands a level of detail that effectively mirrors writing the code itself. To get truly bespoke, usable code quickly, you‚Äôd need an AI that perfectly understands your intricate design intent and all necessary context without explicit instruction‚Äîa capability LLMs simply do not possess.</p>
<p>This means that a sacrifice must always be made: either in the ease of prompting, the correctness and usability of the output, or the relinquishing of full design control and settling for generic or somewhat misaligned outputs. You need to be prepared to be highly specific in giving instructions to an LLM and even after doing so, still expect to spend significant time in follow-up prompts or manual code revisions to achieve the results you want.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-dilemma">Navigating the dilemma</h2>
<p>The AI delegation dilemma means that the LLM-wielding software developer must make a series of trade offs when opting to delegate work to an LLM. There are several different approaches in navigating the dilemma and the best approach largely depends on the nature of the work that the developer is performing.</p>
<h3 id="picking-your-two-priorities-wisely">Picking your two priorities wisely</h3>
<p>Each pair of priorities requires a different set of expectations and leads to distinct usage of the LLM.</p>
<h4 id="get-a-working-prototype-quickly-prompt-efficiency-output-usability-sacrificing-design-fidelity">Get a working prototype quickly: Prompt Efficiency + Output Usability (sacrificing Design Fidelity)</h4>
<p>For quick, immediately usable results without concern for the specifics, you can write concise prompts and embrace generic solutions. This approach works for rapid prototyping. Accept that the AI will make design and functionality assumptions, and budget for potential refactoring if the code later becomes critical.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is obvious: you‚Äôre going to get generic results that don‚Äôt necessarily do what you‚Äôd ideally want them to do. Depending on the brevity of your prompts and your willingness to accept whatever the LLM produces, you might end up with what is often referred to as ‚ÄúAI slop,‚Äù or low quality output that is immediately recognizable as automatically generated. Use this approach for production code at your peril.</p>
<h4 id="produce-a-useful-starting-point-design-fidelity-prompt-efficiency-sacrificing-output-usability">Produce a useful starting point: Design Fidelity + Prompt Efficiency (sacrificing Output Usability)</h4>
<p>If you need to maintain tight control over the design while keeping prompting quick, view the AI as a brainstorming partner generating a rough draft. This means using concise prompts to convey your intent, but being ready for extensive manual editing and cleanup of the AI‚Äôs output, utilizing it primarily for ideation or as a conceptual starting point.</p>
<p>This is a path to get the results you actually want while shaving away some of the tedium in a new project, including things like writing boilerplate code beyond what the framework provides for you, setting up configuration, or creating template files that will be written in later on.</p>
<p>With this approach, the downside‚Äîor, depending on your perspective, upside‚Äîis that you‚Äôre only using the AI for a boost, recognizing that most of the work will be done by you, the software developer.</p>
<h4 id="create-comprehensive-specifications-for-maximal-precision-design-fidelity-output-usability-sacrificing-prompt-efficiency">Create comprehensive specifications for maximal precision: Design Fidelity + Output Usability (sacrificing Prompt Efficiency)</h4>
<p>When demanding usable code that aligns with your design and functional requirements, be prepared for substantial effort in writing detailed prompts iteratively. This means providing explicit examples, defining all constraints, and enabling ‚Äúthinking modes‚Äù allow the LLM to produce a better result at the cost of more time.</p>
<p>Like the preceding approach, this tactic seeks to maintain Design Fidelity over the results except it puts the onus of implementation on the LLM rather than a human developer. The task of the human is to supply all of the relevant details of the look, feel, and behavior of the software in English (or whatever non-programming language is chosen).</p>
<p>The downsides of this approach are the burdens associated with relaying a level of detail that coerces the LLM to produce the correct results, along with the need to subsequently review and test the extensive outputs. As mentioned earlier, prompting with sufficient detail to achieve the ultimate level of fidelity will converge with the level of effort required in writing the code itself. Moreover, the limitations of the context window that an LLM operates under means that very large prompts are often at odds with good performance and cost. So even when providing ample context, delegating the task to the LLM may be impractical.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-the-dilemma-entirely">Avoid the dilemma entirely</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.foxhound.systems/img/2025-06-27-ai-delegation-dilemma/exit_1280.jpg" class="w-100 md-w-60" alt="A photograph of an exit sign" />
<figcaption>¬†</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sometimes the best way to navigate the dilemma is to avoid it altogether. When working on critical code with hyper-specific requirements, large code bases that require large amounts of contextual information, or when integrating with existing complex systems, it is best to avoid delegating large amounts of work to an LLM.</p>
<p>For example, if working in a well-established code base, delegating a large refactoring task to an LLM can result in significant deviation from existing conventions, introduction of new assumptions, or other undesirable changes. If inclined to use an LLM for such a task, the safer path is to use it to assist with refactoring smaller pieces but steer the high level process on your own.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that with large volumes of work delegated to an AI, the burden or review and revision falls on you, the human developer. In the same way that sometimes a senior engineer may avoid delegating a critical task to a junior engineer because of the increased overall burden caused by the need for more laborious review, avoiding delegation to an AI will in many instances be the best way to get the highest quality result for the lowest amount of total effort.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>AI-assisted programming brings with it the potential for additional productivity, but it also introduces the AI delegation dilemma. This fundamental trade-off between Design Fidelity, Prompt Efficiency, and Output Usability means that when offloading larger programming tasks to LLMs, you can achieve at most two out of the three priorities. This isn‚Äôt a flaw in the tools themselves, but a consequence of their probabilistic nature and their inherent lack of complete contextual understanding of your specific project.</p>
<p>Recognizing this dilemma allows you to move beyond the initial ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of AI code generation and adopt a more strategic approach. Whether you choose to spend time on detailed prompting for precise output, accept generic solutions for rapid prototyping, or use AI as a quick ideation partner for later refinement, recognizing the trade offs is imperative. And for truly critical, complex, or deeply integrated work, sometimes the wisest choice is to avoid the delegation dilemma altogether, and avoid using LLMs for wholesale code generation.</p>

## Introducing Gemma 3n: The developer guide

date: 2025-06-26, updated: 2025-06-26, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/">Introducing Gemma 3n: The developer guide</a></strong></p>
Extremely consequential new open weights model release from Google today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multimodal by design:</strong> Gemma 3n natively supports image, audio, video, and text inputs and text outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimized for on-device:</strong> Engineered with a focus on efficiency, Gemma 3n models are available in two sizes based on <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/#per-layer-embeddings-(ple):-unlocking-more-memory-efficiency"><strong>effective</strong></a> parameters: E2B and E4B. While their raw parameter count is 5B and 8B respectively, architectural innovations allow them to run with a memory footprint comparable to traditional 2B and 4B models, operating with as little as 2GB (E2B) and 3GB (E4B) of memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <strong>very</strong> exciting: a 2B and 4B model optimized for end-user devices which accepts text, images <em>and</em> audio as inputs!</p>
<p>Gemma 3n is also the most comprehensive day one launch I've seen for any model: Google partnered with "AMD, Axolotl, Docker, Hugging Face, llama.cpp, LMStudio, MLX, NVIDIA, Ollama, RedHat, SGLang, Unsloth, and vLLM" so there are dozens of ways to try this out right now.</p>
<p>So far I've run two variants on my Mac laptop. Ollama offer <a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3n">a 7.5GB version</a> (full tag <code>gemma3n:e4b-it-q4_K_M0</code>) of the 4B model, which I ran like this:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull gemma3n
llm install llm-ollama
llm -m gemma3n:latest "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p>It drew me this:</p>
<p><img alt="The pelican looks a bit like a grey pig. It is floating above a bicycle that looks more like a rail cart." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3n-ollama.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Ollama version doesn't appear to support image or audio input yet.</p>
<p>... but the <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a> version does!</p>
<p>First I tried that on <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelican-joke-request.wav">this WAV file</a> like so (using a recipe adapted from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-8R2UvUBrc">Prince Canuma's video</a>):</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-vlm mlx_vlm.generate \
  --model gg-hf-gm/gemma-3n-E4B-it \
  --max-tokens 100 \
  --temperature 0.7 \
  --prompt "Transcribe the following speech segment in English:" \
  --audio pelican-joke-request.wav
</code></pre>
<p>That downloaded a 15.74 GB bfloat16 version of the model and output the following correct transcription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell me a joke about a pelican.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I had it draw me a pelican for good measure:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-vlm mlx_vlm.generate \
  --model gg-hf-gm/gemma-3n-E4B-it \
  --max-tokens 100 \
  --temperature 0.7 \
  --prompt "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p>I quite like this one:</p>
<p><img alt="The bicycle is a sin wave, but you can make out which bits are the frame and the wheels. The pelican is white with a black triangular bill. It's a much better attempt than the Ollama one." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3n-mlx-vlm.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's interesting to see such a striking visual difference between those 7.5GB and 15GB model quantizations.</p>
<p>Finally, I had it describe the image it had just created:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-vlm mlx_vlm.generate \
  --model gg-hf-gm/gemma-3n-E4B-it \
  --max-tokens 1000 \
  --prompt "Describe image" \
  --image gemma3n-mlx-vlm.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what I got back - it thought this was a chemical diagram!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image is a cartoon-style illustration depicting a molecular structure against a light blue background. The structure is composed of several differently colored and shaped elements connected by curved black lines. </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large Black Circles:</strong> There are two large, solid black circles, likely representing larger molecules or components.</li>
<li><strong>Cream-Colored Oval:</strong> A prominent cream-colored oval shape is centrally located and connected to other elements. It has a smaller, darker cream-colored sphere attached to its left side.</li>
<li><strong>Red Oval:</strong> A smaller, solid red oval is positioned near one of the black circles and connected to the cream-colored oval.</li>
<li><strong>Black Lines:</strong> These lines act as bonds, connecting the various molecular components. They are curved and dynamic, suggesting movement or interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Triangular Shape:</strong> A small black triangle is attached to the smaller cream-colored sphere.</li>
<li><strong>Letter "I":</strong> The letter "I" appears twice, likely labeling specific parts of the molecule. </li>
</ul>
<p>The overall impression is of a simplified representation of a biological molecule, possibly a protein or a complex organic compound. The use of different colors helps to distinguish the various components within the structure.</p>
</blockquote>

## Geminiception

date: 2025-06-26, updated: 2025-06-26, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>Yesterday Anthropic got <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/ai-powered-apps-with-claude/">a bunch of buzz</a> out of their new <code>window.claude.complete()</code> API which allows Claude Artifacts to run their own API calls to execute prompts.</p>
<p>It turns out Gemini had beaten them to that feature by over a month, but the announcement was tucked away in a bullet point of their <a href="https://gemini.google.com/updates">release notes</a> for the 20th of May:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vibe coding apps in Canvas just got better too! With just a few prompts, you can now build fully functional personalised apps in Canvas that can use Gemini-powered features, save data between sessions and share data between multiple users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ethan Mollick <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1938091740121935929">has been building</a> some neat demos on top of Gemini Canvas, including this <a href="https://gemini.google.com/share/42dfb2004b7e">text adventure starship bridge simulator</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to Claude Artifacts, Gemini Canvas detects if the application uses APIs that require authentication (to run prompts, for example) and requests the user sign in with their Google account:</p>
<p><img alt="Futuristic sci-fi interface screenshot showing &quot;Helm Control&quot; at top with navigation buttons for Helm, Comms, Science, Tactical, Engineering, and Operations, displaying red error message &quot;[SYSTEM_ERROR] Connection to AI core failed: API error: 403. This may be an authentication issue.&quot; with command input field showing &quot;Enter command...&quot; and Send button, plus Google Account sign-in notification at bottom stating &quot;You need to sign in with your Google Account to see some features&quot; with Sign in button and X close icon" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-auth.jpg" /></p>

## Build and share AI-powered apps with Claude

date: 2025-06-25, updated: 2025-06-25, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts">Build and share AI-powered apps with Claude</a></strong></p>
Anthropic have added one of the most important missing features to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">Claude Artifacts</a>: apps built as artifacts now have the ability to run their own prompts against Claude via a new API.</p>
<p>Claude Artifacts are web apps that run in a strictly controlled browser sandbox: their access to features like localStorage or the ability to access external APIs via <code>fetch()</code> calls is restricted by CSP headers and the <code>&lt;iframe sandbox="..."</code> mechanism.</p>
<p>The new <code>window.claude.complete()</code> method opens a hole that allows prompts composed by the JavaScript artifact application to be run against Claude.</p>
<p>As before, you can publish apps built using artifacts such that anyone can see them. The moment your app tries to execute a prompt the current user will be required to sign into their own Anthropic account so that the prompt can be billed against them, and not against you.</p>
<p>I'm amused that Anthropic turned "we added a window.claude.complete() function to Artifacts" into what looks like a major new product launch, but I can't say it's bad marketing for them to do that!</p>
<p>As always, the crucial details about how this all works are tucked away in tool descriptions in the system prompt. Thankfully this one was <a href="https://claude.ai/share/42b70567-8534-4080-9227-b834e8c13d6e">easy to leak</a>. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/31957633864d1b7dd60012b2205fd747">the full set of instructions</a>, which start like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using artifacts and the analysis tool, you have access to window.claude.complete. This lets you send completion requests to a Claude API. This is a powerful capability that lets you orchestrate Claude completion requests via code. You can use this capability to do sub-Claude orchestration via the analysis tool, and to build Claude-powered applications via artifacts.</p>
<p>This capability may be referred to by the user as "Claude in Claude" or "Claudeception".</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The API accepts a single parameter -- the prompt you would like to complete. You can call it like so: <code>const response = await window.claude.complete('prompt you would like to complete')</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't seen "Claudeception" in any of their official documentation yet! </p>
<p>That <code>window.claude.complete(prompt)</code> method is also available to the Claude analysis tool. It takes a string and returns a string.</p>
<p>The new function only handles strings. The tool instructions provide tips to Claude about prompt engineering a JSON response that will look frustratingly familiar:</p>
<blockquote><ol start="3">
<li>Use strict language: Emphasize that the response must be in JSON format only. For example: ‚ÄúYour entire response must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure, including backticks ```.‚Äù</li>
<li>Be emphatic about the importance of having only JSON. If you really want Claude to care, you can put things in all caps ‚Äì e.g., saying ‚ÄúDO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN VALID JSON. DON‚ÄôT INCLUDE LEADING BACKTICKS LIKE ```json.‚Äù.</li></ol></blockquote>

<p>Talk about Claudeception... now even Claude itself knows that you have to YELL AT CLAUDE to get it to output JSON sometimes.</p>
<p>The API doesn't provide a mechanism for handling previous conversations, but Anthropic works round that by telling the artifact builder how to represent a prior conversation as a JSON encoded array:</p>
<blockquote><p>Structure your prompt like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">conversationHistory</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-kos">[</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">{</span> <span class="pl-c1">role</span>: <span class="pl-s">"user"</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">content</span>: <span class="pl-s">"Hello, Claude!"</span> <span class="pl-kos">}</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">{</span> <span class="pl-c1">role</span>: <span class="pl-s">"assistant"</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">content</span>: <span class="pl-s">"Hello! How can I assist you today?"</span> <span class="pl-kos">}</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">{</span> <span class="pl-c1">role</span>: <span class="pl-s">"user"</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">content</span>: <span class="pl-s">"I'd like to know about AI."</span> <span class="pl-kos">}</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">{</span> <span class="pl-c1">role</span>: <span class="pl-s">"assistant"</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">content</span>: <span class="pl-s">"Certainly! AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to..."</span> <span class="pl-kos">}</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span>
  <span class="pl-c">// ... ALL previous messages should be included here</span>
<span class="pl-kos">]</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>

<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">prompt</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">`</span>
<span class="pl-s">The following is the COMPLETE conversation history. You MUST consider ALL of these messages when formulating your response:</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-kos">${</span><span class="pl-c1">JSON</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">stringify</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">conversationHistory</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">}</span></span></span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">IMPORTANT: Your response should take into account the ENTIRE conversation history provided above, not just the last message.</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">Respond with a JSON object in this format:</span>
<span class="pl-s">{</span>
<span class="pl-s">  "response": "Your response, considering the full conversation history",</span>
<span class="pl-s">  "sentiment": "brief description of the conversation's current sentiment"</span>
<span class="pl-s">}</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.</span>
<span class="pl-s">`</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>

<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-k">await</span> <span class="pl-smi">window</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">claude</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">complete</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">prompt</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span></pre></blockquote>

<p>There's another example in there showing how the state of play for a role playing game should be serialized as JSON and sent with every prompt as well.</p>
<p>The tool instructions acknowledge another limitation of the current Claude Artifacts environment: code that executes there is effectively invisible to the main LLM - error messages are not automatically round-tripped to the model. As a result it makes the following recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using <code>window.claude.complete</code> may involve complex orchestration across many different completion requests. Once you create an Artifact, you are not able to see whether or not your completion requests are orchestrated correctly. Therefore, you SHOULD ALWAYS test your completion requests first in the analysis tool before building an artifact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've already seen it do this in my own experiments: it will fire up the  "analysis" tool (which allows it to run JavaScript directly and see the results) to perform a quick prototype before it builds the full artifact.</p>
<p>Here's my first attempt at an AI-enabled artifact: a translation app. I built it using the following single prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Let‚Äôs build an AI app that uses Claude to translate from one language to another</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://claude.ai/share/e26be9a8-739c-45de-8aee-86dafed4aa87">the transcript</a>. You can <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/1aeb7042-2004-4549-a97d-ca740d0f1bf0">try out the resulting app here</a> - the app it built me looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Claude AI Translator interface showing: Claude AI Translator logo with blue circular icon containing &quot;ÊñáA&quot;, &quot;Powered by Claude AI for accurate, context-aware translations&quot;, language selection dropdowns showing &quot;From English&quot; and &quot;To Spanish&quot; with blue swap arrows button between them, text input area labeled &quot;Enter text to translate&quot; containing &quot;Tell me some fun facts about pelicans&quot;, &quot;Tip: Press Ctrl+Enter to translate&quot;, Translation section with &quot;high confidence&quot; indicator in green and Spanish translation &quot;Cu√©ntame algunos datos curiosos sobre los pel√≠canos&quot; with copy button icon." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai-translator.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you want to use this feature yourself you'll need to turn on "Create AI-powered artifacts" in the "Feature preview" section at the bottom of your "Settings -&gt; Profile" section. I had to do that in the Claude web app as I couldn't find the feature toggle in the Claude iOS application. This <a href="https://claude.ai/settings/profile">claude.ai/settings/profile</a> page should have it for your account.

## Roundrect Dictator

date: 2025-06-25, from: Michael Tsai

Nick Heer: App icons across Apple&#8217;s three most popular operating systems share a similar rounded square mask, and it is a downgrade. Simon B. St&#248;vring correctly calls out the &#8220;expressive, varied app icons, a case of character over conformity&#8221; as a highlight of past versions of MacOS. I miss detailed and artistic app icons plenty. [&#8230;]

## Gemini CLI

date: 2025-06-25, updated: 2025-06-25, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/">Gemini CLI</a></strong></p>
First there was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/24/claude-37-sonnet-and-claude-code/">Claude Code</a> in February, then <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/16/">OpenAI Codex (CLI)</a> in April, and now Gemini CLI in June. All three of the largest AI labs now have their own version of what I am calling a "terminal agent" - a CLI tool that can read and write files and execute commands on your behalf in the terminal.</p>
<p>I'm honestly a little surprised at how significant this category has become: I had assumed that terminal tools like this would always be something of a niche interest, but given the number of people I've heard from spending hundreds of dollars a month on Claude Code this niche is clearly larger and more important than I had thought!</p>
<p>I had a few days of early access to the Gemini one. It's very good - it takes advantage of Gemini's million token context and has good taste in things like when to read a file and when to run a command.</p>
<p>Like OpenAI Codex and unlike Claude Code it's open source (Apache 2) - the full source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">google-gemini/gemini-cli</a> on GitHub. The core system prompt <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/0915bf7d677504c28b079693a0fe1c853adc456e/packages/core/src/core/prompts.ts#L40-L109">lives in core/src/core/prompts.ts</a> - I've extracted that out as <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9e5f13665b3112cea00035df7da696c6">a rendered Markdown Gist</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, the system prompt doubles as extremely accurate and concise documentation of what the tool can do! Here's what it has to say about comments, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comments:</strong> Add code comments sparingly. Focus on <em>why</em> something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than <em>what</em> is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are seperate from the code you are changing. <em>NEVER</em> talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The list of preferred technologies is interesting too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When key technologies aren't specified prefer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Websites (Frontend):</strong> React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.</li>
<li><strong>Back-End APIs:</strong> Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.</li>
<li><strong>Full-stack:</strong> Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.</li>
<li><strong>CLIs:</strong> Python or Go.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App:</strong> Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>3d Games:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.</li>
<li><strong>2d Games:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell Gemini CLI only defines a small selection of tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>edit</code>: To modify files programmatically.</li>
<li><code>glob</code>: To find files by pattern.</li>
<li><code>grep</code>: To search for content within files.</li>
<li><code>ls</code>: To list directory contents.</li>
<li><code>shell</code>: To execute a command in the shell</li>
<li><code>memoryTool</code>: To remember user-specific facts.</li>
<li><code>read-file</code>: To read a single file</li>
<li><code>write-file</code>: To write a single file</li>
<li><code>read-many-files</code>: To read multiple files at once.</li>
<li><code>web-fetch</code>: To get content from URLs.</li>
<li><code>web-search</code>: To perform a web search (using <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search">Grounding with Google Search</a> via the Gemini API).</li>
</ul>
<p>I found most of those by having Gemini CLI inspect its own code for me! Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/12c7b072e8e21ef1e040fb3b69c1da28">that full transcript</a>, which used just over 300,000 tokens total.</p>
<p>How much does it cost? The announcement describes a generous free tier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use Gemini CLI free-of-charge, simply login with a personal Google account to get a free Gemini Code Assist license. That free license gets you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and its massive 1 million token context window. To ensure you rarely, if ever, hit a limit during this preview, we offer the industry‚Äôs largest allowance: 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day at no charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not yet clear to me if your inputs can be used to improve Google's models if you are using the free tier - that's been the situation with free prompt inference they have offered in the past.</p>
<p>You can also drop in your own paid API key, at which point your data will not be used for model improvements and you'll be billed based on your token usage.

## Anthropic wins a major fair use victory for AI ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still in trouble for stealing books

date: 2025-06-24, updated: 2025-06-24, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692015/anthropic-wins-a-major-fair-use-victory-for-ai-but-its-still-in-trouble-for-stealing-books">Anthropic wins a major fair use victory for AI ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still in trouble for stealing books</a></strong></p>
Major USA legal news for the AI industry today. Judge William Alsup released a "summary judgement" (a legal decision that results in some parts of a case skipping a trial) in a lawsuit between five authors and Anthropic concerning the use of their books in training data.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25982181-authors-v-anthropic-ruling/">judgement itself</a> is a very readable 32 page PDF, and contains all sorts of interesting behind-the-scenes details about how Anthropic trained their models.</p>
<p>The facts of the complaint go back to the very beginning of the company. Anthropic was founded by a group of ex-OpenAI researchers in February 2021. According to the judgement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, in January or February 2021, another Anthropic cofounder, Ben Mann, downloaded Books3, an online library of 196,640 books that he knew had been assembled from unauthorized copies of copyrighted books ‚Äî that is, pirated. Anthropic's next pirated acquisitions involved downloading distributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries. In June 2021, Mann downloaded in this way at least five million copies of books from Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had been pirated. And, in July 2022, Anthropic likewise downloaded at least two million copies of books from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLiMi, which Anthropic knew had been pirated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Books3 was also listed as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/27/wordcamp-llms/#how-they-are-trained">part of the training data</a> for Meta's first LLaMA model!</p>
<p>Anthropic apparently used these sources of data to help build an internal "research library" of content that they then filtered and annotated and used in training runs.</p>
<p>Books turned out to be a very valuable component of the "data mix" to train strong models. By 2024 Anthropic had a new approach to collecting them: purchase and scan millions of print books!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To find a new way to get books, in February 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of partnerships for Google's book-scanning project, Tom Turvey. He was tasked with obtaining "all the books in the world" while still avoiding as much "legal/practice/business slog" as possible (Opp. Exhs. 21, 27). [...] Turvey and his team emailed major book distributors and retailers about bulk-purchasing their print copies for the AI firm's "research library" (Opp. Exh. 22 at 145; Opp. Exh. 31 at -035589). Anthropic spent many millions of dollars to purchase millions of print books, often in used condition. Then, its service providers stripped the books from their bindings, cut their pages to size, and scanned the books into digital form ‚Äî discarding the paper originals. Each print book resulted in a PDF copy containing images of the scanned pages with machine-readable text (including front and back cover scans for softcover books).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The summary judgement found that these scanned books <em>did</em> fall under fair use, since they were transformative versions of the works and were not shared outside of the company. The downloaded ebooks did <em>not</em> count as fair use, and it looks like those will be the subject of a forthcoming jury trial.</p>
<p>Here's that section of the decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before buying books for its central library, Anthropic downloaded over seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should have paid for these pirated library copies (e.g, Tr. 24‚Äì25, 65; Opp. 7, 12‚Äì13). This
order agrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important aspect of this case is the question of whether training an LLM on unlicensed data counts as "fair use". The judge found that it did. The argument for why takes up several pages of the document but this seems like a key point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts. They may need to pay for getting their hands on a text in the first instance. But to make anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each time they read it, each time they recall it from memory,
each time they later draw upon it when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable.
For centuries, we have read and re-read books. We have admired, memorized, and internalized
their sweeping themes, their substantive points, and their stylistic solutions to recurring writing problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judge who signed this summary judgement is an interesting character: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alsup">William Haskell Alsup</a> (yes, his middle name really is Haskell) presided over jury trials for Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc in 2012 and 2016 where he famously used his hobbyist BASIC programming experience to challenge claims made by lawyers in the case.

## Phoenix.new is Fly's entry into the prompt-driven app development space

date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>Here's a fascinating new entrant into the AI-assisted-programming / coding-agents space by <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, introduced on their blog in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/">Phoenix.new ‚Äì The Remote AI Runtime for Phoenix</a>: describe an app in a prompt, get a full Phoenix application, backed by SQLite and running on Fly's hosting platform. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du7GmWGUM5Y">official Phoenix.new YouTube launch video</a> is a good way to get a sense for what this does.</p>
<h4 id="background-on-phoenix-and-elixir-and-fly">Background on Phoenix and Elixir and Fly</h4>
<p>First, some background. <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is an open source web framework for Elixir, the Ruby-like language that compiles to Erlang's BEAM bytecode and runs on top of the highly concurrent Erlang runtime. The signature feature of the framework is <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/main/README.md#feature-highlights">Phoenix LiveView</a>, a toolkit for building realtime interfaces through streaming diffs to server-side HTML over a WebSocket connection.</p>
<p>Phoenix was created by Chris McCord 11 years ago, and Chris joined Fly nearly four years ago. <a href="http://phoenix.new/">Phoenix.new</a> is his latest project.</p>
<p>Phoenix LiveView is a really great fit for Fly's geographically distributed application serving infrastructure. Fly co-founder Kurt Mackey <a href="https://fly.io/blog/low-latency-liveview/">wrote about that</a> in April 2021, before they had hired Chris, describing how LiveView benefits from low latency by "moving app processes close to users" - something Fly has been designed to help with from the start.</p>
<p>There's one major challenge though: Elixir is still a niche programming language, which means the number of people out there who are ready to spin up a new Phoenix app has always been artificially limited.</p>
<p>Fly's solution? Get LLMs to shave that learning curve down to <em>almost nothing</em>.</p>
<h4 id="prompt-driven-application-development-with-phoenix-new">Prompt-driven application development with Phoenix.new</h4>
<p>Phoenix.new is a prompt-driven application development platform. You describe what you want to build, then watch as an LLM-powered coding agent writes, tests and iterates on code to help achieve that goal. It's in the same broad category as <a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a>, <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0.dev</a> and and <a href="https://townie.val.run/">Val Town's Townie</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most important problems to solve with coding agents is to give them a robust sandbox where they can run code without breaking things outside of that space. Fly, at their heart, are a sandboxing company - their <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines</a> product makes it trivial to spin up a new sandboxed VM in just a few seconds. I'm building <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a> on Fly for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>I tried out Phoenix.new with the following starter prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>A notebook application. Notes are rich text, using a nice visual markdown editors. The first line of a note becomes the title. Notes have a URL that is a 6 character random text string - thise can be used to link notes to each other by dropping in an @ sign and that text string. A hash and then text becomes a tag, clicking a tag goes to a page with that tag on. Notes are all in SQLite FTS so they can be searched with a search tool.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watching it work was <em>fascinating</em>. It provides a full IDE-style environment in the browser, running a dedicated container and with a forwarded port to allow you to interact with the running application <em>while it is being built</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/phoenix-new.jpg" alt="Browser IDE interface showing a notebook app development project with a left sidebar containing a chat session that starts &quot;What would you like to build?&quot; with options like &quot;todo list&quot;, &quot;chat app&quot;, &quot;product landing page&quot;, then a main editor displaying plan.md file with detailed development steps including &quot;Generate a Phoenix LiveView project called 'notebook'&quot; and &quot;Start the server so you can view the app as we build it&quot;. The bottom has a terminal showing &quot;All dependencies are up to date&quot;, &quot;Generated notebook app&quot;, &quot;Done in 241ms&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>It spun up a <code>plan.md</code>, planned out the approach and started working through the code. Most interestingly, it constantly tested the application it was building using a testing tool that looked similar to my own <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a>. Here's an example of the output from that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can see the issue! The page is still showing the "Welcome to your Notebook" message instead of the form. Let me wait a moment for the JavaScript to execute and then check if the form appeared.</p>
<p><code>$ web http://localhost:4000 --js "setTimeout(() =&gt; { document.querySelector('button[phx-click=\"start_creating\"]').click(); }, 500); setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log('Form visible?', !!document.querySelector('textarea')); console.log('Creating note state:', document.body.innerHTML.includes('Create New Note')); }, 2000);"</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm used to coding agents that write and execute their own tests, but this is the most impressive example I've seen of a coding agent that actively interacts with and tests the live application while it is iterating on the code.</p>
<p>Most interestingly of all, since LiveView is a realtime framework, I could interact directly with the application at the same time as the machine was writing and testing it, seeing any changes it made instantly in my browser!</p>
<p>How did it do? It got there in the end, but with hindsight my initial prompt was a little too complex: I had to rescue it after it got stuck in an error loop trying to implement SQLite full-text search. Just like a project you build yourself it turns out to work much better if you start with the simplest possible version of the application and then iterate on it to add additional features.</p>
<p>One of my favorite details is how Git integration works. Phoenix.new commits constantly as it works, and a menu option for "Clone X to your local computer" then gives you a command that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>git clone "https://phoenix.new/git/WENQLj...big-random-string...VHFW/$RANDOM/notebook"</code></p>
<p>Run that locally to get a full copy of the repo! I ran the following to push it to a new repository in my GitHub account:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>git remote add github https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook.git
git push -u github main</pre></div>
<p>You can see the code (and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook/commits">commit history</a>) in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook">simonw/phoenix-new-notebook</a> repo.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-did-i-learn-">How much did I learn?</h4>
<p>My initial experiments with Phoenix.new were very much <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding</a> - I interacted with the resulting application but didn't pay a great deal of attention to the code that was being written, despite it being presented to me in an IDE that made it very easy to review what was going on.</p>
<p>As a result, I didn't learn much about the low-level syntax details of how Phoenix and Elixir work. I did however get a strong feel for the <em>shape</em> of Elixir and Phoenix at a high level as the code danced past my eye.</p>
<p>It turns out having an LLM write an application in front of you is a great way to start building understanding of what a framework can do.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs almost like watching a YouTube livestream of an experienced developer speed running building an application, except that app is exactly what you asked them to build and you can interject and send them in a new direction at any moment.</p>
<h4 id="expanding-beyond-elixir-and-phoenix">Expanding beyond Elixir and Phoenix</h4>
<p>Chris's announcement included this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point you might be wondering ‚Äì can I just ask it to build a Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care about are already installed. We‚Äôre still figuring out where to take this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in my plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The browser-based IDE includes a terminal, and I checked and <code>python3</code> and <code>python3 -m pip install datasette</code> work there already.</p>
<p>If Fly do evolve this into a framework-agnostic tool for building web apps they'll probably need to rebrand it from Phoenix.new to something a bit more generic!</p>
<p>Phoenix.new is currently priced as a $20/month subscription. Val Town recently switched the pricing for their similar Townie assistant from a subscription to to <a href="https://blog.val.town/townie-credits">pay per use</a>, presumably because for many users this kind of tool is something they would only use intermittently, although given the capabilities of Phoenix.new it's possible it could become a monthly driver for people, especially as it expands out to cover more frameworks.</p>
