## llm-openrouter 0.4

date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/releases/tag/0.4">llm-openrouter 0.4</a></strong></p>
I found out this morning that <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a> include support for a number of (rate-limited) <a href="https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0">free API models</a>.</p>
<p>I occasionally run workshops on top of LLMs (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/cutting-edge-web-scraping/">like this one</a>) and being able to provide students with a quick way to obtain an API key against models where they don't have to setup billing is really valuable to me!</p>
<p>This inspired me to upgrade my existing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin, and in doing so I closed out a bunch of open feature requests.</p>
<p>Consider this post the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/">annotated release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LLM <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html">schema support</a> for OpenRouter models that <a href="https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest&amp;supported_parameters=structured_outputs">support structured output</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/23">#23</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to get support for LLM's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/">new schema feature</a> into as many plugins as possible.</p>
<p>OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible API includes support for the <code>response_format</code> <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/structured-outputs">structured content option</a>, but with an important caveat: it only works for some models, and if you try to use it on others it is silently ignored.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/openrouter-examples/issues/20">filed an issue</a> with OpenRouter requesting they include schema support in their machine-readable model index. For the moment LLM will let you specify schemas for unsupported models and will ignore them entirely, which isn't ideal.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm openrouter key</code> command displays information about your current API key. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/24">#24</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful for debugging and checking the details of your key's rate limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm -m ... -o online 1</code> enables <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/web-search">web search grounding</a> against any model, powered by <a href="https://exa.ai/">Exa</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/25">#25</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenRouter apparently make this feature available to every one of their supported models! They're using new-to-me <a href="https://exa.ai/">Exa</a> to power this feature, an AI-focused search engine startup who appear to have built their own index with their own crawlers (according to <a href="https://docs.exa.ai/reference/faqs#how-often-is-the-index-updated">their FAQ</a>). This feature is currently priced by OpenRouter at $4 per 1000 results, and since 5 results are returned for every prompt that's 2 cents per prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm openrouter models</code> command for listing details of the OpenRouter models, including a <code>--json</code> option to get JSON and a <code>--free</code> option to filter for just the free models. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/26">#26</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This offers a neat way to list the available models. There are examples of the output <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/26#issuecomment-2711908704">in the comments on the issue</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New option to specify custom provider routing: <code>-o provider '{JSON here}'</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/17">#17</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of OpenRouter's USP is that it can route prompts to different providers depending on factors like latency, cost or as a fallback if your first choice is unavailable - great for if you are using open weight models like Llama which are hosted by competing companies.</p>
<p>The options they provide for routing are <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing">very thorough</a> - I had initially hoped to provide a set of CLI options that covered all of these bases, but I decided instead to reuse their JSON format and forward those options directly on to the model.

<p>My guess is that it's most of the reason Sonnet 3.5.1 was so beloved. Its personality was made much more <em>appealing</em>, compared to e. g. OpenAI's corporate drones. [...]</p>
<p>Deep Research was this for me, at first. Some of its summaries were just <em>pleasant</em> to read, they felt so information-dense and intelligent! Not like typical AI slop at all! But then it turned out most of it was just AI slop underneath anyway, and now my slop-recognition function has adjusted and the effect is gone.</p></blockquote>

He's using this to describe his latest site refresh which makes extensive use of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document">cross-document view transitions</a> - a fabulous new progressive enhancement CSS technique that's <a href="https://caniuse.com/view-transitions">supported</a> in Chrome and Safari (and hopefully soon <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1823896">in Firefox</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With cross-document view transitions getting broader and broader support, I‚Äôm realizing that building in-page, progressively-enhanced interactions is more work than simply building two HTML pages and linking them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim now has small static pages powering his home page filtering interface and even his navigation menu, with CSS view transitions configured to smoothly animate between the pages. I think it feels really good - here's what it looked like for me in Chrome (it looked the same both with and without JavaScript disabled):</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo - clicking the tabs to swap between Latest, Trending and Hacker News Hits rearranges the list of posts in a smooth animation, then navigating to a post causes its title to enlarge and move to the top while the rest of the article loads in." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llms-demo.gif" /></p>
<p>Watching the network panel in my browser, most of these pages are 17-20KB gzipped (~45KB after they've decompressed). No wonder it feels so snappy.</p>
<p>I poked around <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/styles.css">in Jim's CSS</a> and found this relevant code:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-css"><pre><span class="pl-k">@view-transition</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">navigation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> auto;
}

.<span class="pl-c1">posts-nav</span> <span class="pl-ent">a</span>[<span class="pl-c1">aria-current</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"page"</span>]<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">not</span>(<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">last-child</span>)<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">after</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">border-color</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">var</span>(<span class="pl-s1">--c-text</span>);
  <span class="pl-c1">view-transition-name</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> posts-nav;
}

<span class="pl-c">/* Old stuff going out */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-old</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.2<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear forwards;
  <span class="pl-c">/* <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2024/view-transitions-handling-aspect-ratio-changes/">https://jakearchibald.com/2024/view-transitions-handling-aspect-ratio-changes/</a> */</span>
  <span class="pl-c1">height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>;
}

<span class="pl-c">/* New stuff coming in */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-new</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.3<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear reverse;
  <span class="pl-c1">height</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">100<span class="pl-smi">%</span></span>;
}

<span class="pl-k">@keyframes</span> fade {
  <span class="pl-k">from</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">1</span>;
  }
  <span class="pl-k">to</span> {
    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">0</span>;
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Jim observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This really feels like a game-changer for simple sites. If you can keep your site simple, it‚Äôs easier to build traditional, JavaScript-powered on-page interactions as small, linked HTML pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've experimented with view transitions for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> in the past and the results were very promising. Maybe I'll pick that up again.</p>
<p>Bonus: Jim has a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/csr4mw/building_websites_with_lots_little_html#c_ncxssq">clever JavaScript trick</a> to avoid clicks to the navigation menu being added to the browser's history in the default case.

## Quoting Steve Yegge

<p>Claude Code's form factor is clunky as hell, it has no multimodal support, and it's hard to juggle with other tools. But it doesn't matter.

Neat interactive visualization of Uber's <a href="https://h3geo.org/">H3</a> hexagonal geographical indexing mechanism.</p>
<p><img alt="Map showing H3 geospatial index hexagons overlaid on the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Various H3 cell IDs are displayed including &quot;852621b3fffffff&quot;, &quot;852621a7fffffff&quot;, &quot;8527526fffffff&quot;, &quot;85262cd3fffffff&quot;, and &quot;85262c83fffffff&quot;. A sidebar shows input fields for &quot;lat,lon&quot; with a &quot;Go&quot; button and &quot;valid H3 id&quot; with a &quot;Find&quot; button.

<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/clupasq/h3-viewer">the source code</a>.</p>
<p>Why does H3 use hexagons? Because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">Hexagons are the Bestagons</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When hexagons come together, they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart. This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only triangles, squares, and hexagons can tile a plane without gaps, and of those three shapes hexagons offer the best ratio of perimeter to area.
