## Quoting datarama

date: 2025-06-11, updated: 2025-06-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://lobste.rs/s/btogou/llms_are_cheap#c_0o4e0e"><p>Since Jevons' original observation about coal-fired steam engines is a bit hard to relate to, my favourite modernized example for people who aren't software nerds is display technology.</p>
<p>Old CRT screens were <em>horribly</em> inefficient - they were large, clunky and absolutely guzzled power. Modern LCDs and OLEDs are slim, flat and use much less power, so that seems great ... except we're now using powered screens in a lot of contexts that would be unthinkable in the CRT era.</p>
<p>If I visit the local fast food joint, there's a row of large LCD monitors, most of which simply display static price lists and pictures of food. 20 years ago, those would have been paper posters or cardboard signage. The large ads in the urban scenery now are huge RGB LED displays (with whirring cooling fans); just 5 years ago they were large posters behind plexiglass. Bus stops have very large LCDs that display a route map and timetable which only changes twice a year - just two years ago, they were paper.</p>
<p>Our displays are much more power-efficient than they've ever been, but at the same time we're using <em>much</em> more power on displays than ever.</p></blockquote>

## Malleable software

date: 2025-06-11, updated: 2025-06-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/">Malleable software</a></strong></p>
New, delightful manifesto from Ink &amp; Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this essay, we envision malleable software: tools that users can reshape with minimal friction to suit their unique needs. Modification becomes routine, not exceptional. Adaptation happens at the point of use, not through engineering teams at distant corporations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a beautifully written essay. I love the early framing of a comparison with physical environments such as the workshop of a luthier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A guitar maker sets up their workshop with their saws, hammers, chisels and files arranged just so. They can also build new tools as needed to achieve the best result—a wooden block as a support, or a pair of pliers sanded down into the right shape. […] <strong>In the physical world, the act of crafting our environments comes naturally, because physical reality is malleable</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most software doesn’t have these qualities, or requires deep programming skills in order to make customizations. The authors propose “malleable software” as a new form of computing ecosystem to “give users agency as co-creators”.</p>
<p>They mention plugin systems as one potential path, but highlight their failings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, <strong>plugin systems still can only edit an app's behavior in specific authorized ways.</strong> If there's not a plugin surface available for a given customization, the user is out of luck. (In fact, most applications have no plugin API at all, because it's hard work to design a good one!)</p>
<p>There are other problems too. Going from installing plugins to <em>making</em> one is a chasm that's hard to cross. And each app has its own distinct plugin system, making it typically impossible to share plugins across different apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does AI-assisted coding help? Yes, to a certain extent, but there are still barriers that we need to tear down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think these developments hold exciting potential, and represent a good reason to pursue malleable software at this moment. But at the same time, <strong>AI code generation alone does not address all the barriers to malleability.</strong> Even if we presume that every computer user could perfectly write and edit code, that still leaves open some big questions.</p>
<p>How can users tweak the <em>existing</em> tools they've installed, rather than just making new siloed applications? How can AI-generated tools compose with one another to build up larger workflows over shared data? And how can we let users take more direct, precise control over tweaking their software, without needing to resort to AI coding for even the tiniest change?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They describe three key design patterns: a gentle slope from user to creator (as seen in Excel and HyperCard), focusing on tools, not apps (a kitchen knife, not an avocado slicer) and encouraging communal creation.</p>
<p>I found this note inspiring when considering my own work on <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many successful customizable systems such as spreadsheets, HyperCard, Flash, Notion, and Airtable follow a similar pattern: <strong>a media editor with optional programmability.</strong> When an environment offers document editing with familiar direct manipulation interactions, users can get a lot done without needing to write any code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the essay focuses on Ink &amp; Switch's own prototypes in this area, including Patchwork, Potluck and Embark.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is one of those pieces that defies attempts to summarize it. It's worth carving out some quality time to spend with this.

## AI-assisted coding for teams that can't get away with vibes

date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/05/29/ai-assisted-coding/">AI-assisted coding for teams that can&#x27;t get away with vibes</a></strong></p>
This excellent piece by Atharva Raykar offers a bunch of astute observations on AI-assisted development that I haven't seen written down elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Building with AI is fast</strong>. The gains in velocity are important, because when harnessed correctly, it allows teams to tighten feedback loops with users faster and make better products.</p>
<p>Yet, AI tools are tricky to use. Hold it wrong, and you can generate underwhelming results, worse still, slow down your velocity by drowning your project in slop and technical debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Atharva notes that AI is a multiplier: the more expertise you have in software engineering, the better the results you can get from LLMs. Furthermore, <em>what helps the human helps the AI</em>.</p>
<p>This means good test coverage, automatic linting, continuous integration and deployment, good documentation practices and "clearly defined features, broken down into multiple small story cards".</p>
<p>If a team has all of this stuff in place, AI coding assistants will be able to operate more reliably and collaborate more effectively with their human overseers.</p>
<p>I enjoyed his closing thoughts about how heavier reliance on LLMs changes our craft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, It’s less valuable to spend too much time looking for and building sophisticated abstractions. DRY is useful for ensuring patterns in the code don’t go out of sync, but there are costs to implementing and maintaining an abstraction to handle changing requirements. LLMs make some repetition palatable and allow you to wait a bit more and avoid premature abstraction.</p>
<p>Redoing work is now extremely cheap. Code in the small is less important than structural patterns and organisation of the code in the large. You can also build lots of prototypes to test an idea out. For this, vibe-coding is great, as long as the prototype is thrown away and rewritten properly later. [...]</p>
<p>Tests are non-negotiable, and AI removes all excuses to not write them because of how fast they can belt them out. But always review the assertions!</p>

## o3-pro

date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3-pro">o3-pro</a></strong></p>
OpenAI released o3-pro today, which they describe as a "version of o3 with more compute for better responses".</p>
<p>It's only available via the newer Responses API. I've added it to my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin">llm-openai-plugin</a> plugin which uses that new API, so you can try it out like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-openai-plugin
llm -m openai/o3-pro "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="Description by o3-pro: The image is a playful, minimalist cartoon showing a white bird riding a bicycle. The bird has a simple oval body, a round head with a small black eye, and a yellow beak. Its orange feet are positioned on the bicycle’s pedals. The bicycle itself is drawn with thin black lines forming two large circular wheels and a straightforward frame. The scene has a light blue background with a soft gray oval shadow beneath the bicycle, giving the impression of ground. Overall, the illustration has a light, whimsical feel." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o3-pro-pelican.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's <em>slow</em> - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6bc7dda9dbe07281d902d254e5fb6e33">generating this pelican</a> took 124 seconds! OpenAI suggest using their <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background">background mode</a> for o3 prompts, which I haven't tried myself yet.</p>
<p>o3-pro is priced at $20/million input tokens and $80/million output tokens - 10x the price of regular o3 after its <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/10/o3-price-drop/">80% price drop</a> this morning.</p>
<p>Ben Hylak had early access and published his notes so far in <a href="https://www.latent.space/p/o3-pro">God is hungry for Context: First thoughts on o3 pro</a>. It sounds like this model needs to be applied very thoughtfully. It comparison to o3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's smarter. <em>much smarter.</em></p>
<p><strong>But in order to see that, you need to give it</strong> <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> <strong>more context. and I'm running out of context.</strong> [...]</p>
<p>My co-founder Alexis and I took the the time to assemble a history of all of our past planning meetings at Raindrop, all of our goals, even record voice memos: and then asked o3-pro to come up with a plan.</p>
<p>We were blown away; it spit out the exact kind of concrete plan and analysis I've always wanted an LLM to create --- complete with target metrics, timelines, what to prioritize, and strict instructions on what to absolutely cut.</p>
<p>The plan o3 gave us was plausible, reasonable; but the plan o3 Pro gave us was specific and rooted enough that <strong><em>it actually changed how we are thinking about our future.</em></strong></p>
<p>This is hard to capture in an eval.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds to me like o3-pro works best when combined with tools. I don't have tool support in <code>llm-openai-plugin</code> yet, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin/issues/20">here's the relevant issue</a>.

## o3 price drop

date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>OpenAI just dropped the price of their o3 model by 80% - from $10/million input tokens and $40/million output tokens to just $2/million and $8/million for the very same model. This is in advance of the release of o3-pro which apparently is coming <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1932483131363504334">later today</a> (update: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/10/o3-pro/">here it is</a>).</p>
<p>This is a pretty huge shake-up in LLM pricing. o3 is now priced the same as GPT 4.1, and slightly less than GPT-4o ($2.50/$10). It’s also less than Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 ($3/$15) and Opus 4 ($15/$75) and sits in between Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro for &gt;200,00 tokens ($2.50/$15) and 2.5 Pro for &lt;200,000 ($1.25/$10).</p>
<p>I’ve updated my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> pricing calculator with the new rate.</p>
<p>How have they dropped the price so much? OpenAI's Adam Groth <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealAdamG/status/1932440328293806321">credits ongoing optimization work</a>:</p>

## Magistral — the first reasoning model by Mistral AI

date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/magistral">Magistral — the first reasoning model by Mistral AI</a></strong></p>
Mistral's first reasoning model is out today, in two sizes. There's a 24B Apache 2 licensed open-weights model called Magistral Small (actually Magistral-Small-2506), and a larger API-only model called Magistral Medium.</p>
<p>Magistral Small is available as <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506">mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506</a> on Hugging Face. From that model card:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Context Window</strong>: A 128k context window, but performance might degrade past 40k. Hence we recommend setting the maximum model length to 40k.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mistral also released an official GGUF version, <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506_gguf">Magistral-Small-2506_gguf</a>, which I ran successfully using Ollama like this:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull hf.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506_gguf:Q8_0
</code></pre>
<p>That fetched a 25GB file. I ran prompts using a chat session with <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m hf.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506_gguf:Q8_0
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what I got for "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle" (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7aaac8217f43be04886737d67c08ecca">transcript here</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="Blue sky and what looks like an eagle flying towards the viewer." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/magistral-pelican.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's disappointing that the GGUF doesn't support function calling yet - hopefully a community variant can add that, it's one of the best ways I know of to unlock the potential of these reasoning models.</p>
<p>I just noticed that Ollama have their own <a href="https://ollama.com/library/magistral">Magistral model</a> too, which can be accessed using:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull magistral:latest
</code></pre>
<p>That gets you a 14GB <code>q4_K_M</code> quantization - other options can be found in the <a href="https://ollama.com/library/magistral/tags">full list of Ollama magistral tags</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that caught my eye in the Magistral announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legal, finance, healthcare, and government professionals get traceable reasoning that meets compliance requirements. Every conclusion can be traced back through its logical steps, providing auditability for high-stakes environments with domain-specialized AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess this means the reasoning traces are fully visible and not redacted in any way - interesting to see Mistral trying to turn that into a feature that's attractive to the business clients they are most interested in appealing to.</p>
<p>Also from that announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our early tests indicated that Magistral is an excellent creative companion. We highly recommend it for creative writing and storytelling, with the model capable of producing coherent or — if needed — delightfully eccentric copy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't seen a reasoning model promoted for creative writing in this way before.</p>
<p>You can try out Magistral Medium by selecting the new "Thinking" option in Mistral's <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/">Le Chat</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a chat interface showing settings options. At the top is a text input field that says &quot;Ask le Chat or @mention an agent&quot; with a plus button, lightbulb &quot;Think&quot; button with up arrow, grid &quot;Tools&quot; button, and settings icon. Below are two toggle options: &quot;Pure Thinking&quot; with description &quot;Best option for math + coding. Disables tools.&quot; (toggle is off), and &quot;10x Speed&quot; with lightning bolt icon and &quot;PRO - 2 remaining today&quot; label, described as &quot;Same quality at 10x the speed.&quot; (toggle is on and green)." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/magistral-le-chat.jpg" /></p>
<p>They have options for "Pure Thinking" and a separate option for "10x speed", which runs Magistral Medium at 10x the speed using <a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/">Cerebras</a>.</p>
<p>The new models are also available through <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">the Mistral API</a>. You can access them by installing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> and running <code>llm mistral refresh</code> to refresh the list of available models, then:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mistral/magistral-medium-latest \
  'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'

## MCP can be a supercharger for Open Data projects and Vibe Coding

date: 2025-06-10, from: Conor O'Niell's blog, Cross Dominant

For personal projects, I generally follow Andrej Karpathy&rsquo;s original definition of Vibe Coding - I don&rsquo;t look at the generated code, I just tell the LLM what I want, paste in the error messages and iterate until it gives me the output I need. But that&rsquo;s a lot easier to do when you&rsquo;ve been writing software for 40+ years and know what to ask for!
But when it comes to creating Open Data projects, I often find that the challenge isn&rsquo;t the code, it&rsquo;s the data.

## WWDC: Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for developers

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers/">WWDC: Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for developers</a></strong></p>
Here's the Apple press release for today's WWDC announcements. Two things that stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foundation Models Framework</strong></p>
<p>With the Foundation Models framework, developers will be able to build on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are intelligent, available when they’re offline, and that protect their privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost.
The framework has native support for Swift, so developers can easily access the Apple Intelligence model with as few as three lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's new documentation on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels/generating-content-and-performing-tasks-with-foundation-models">Generating content and performing tasks with Foundation Models</a> - the Swift code looks like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">session</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">LanguageModelSession</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>
    instructions<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Reply with step by step instructions</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-kos">)</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">prompt</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Rum old fashioned cocktail</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-k">try</span></span> <span class="pl-k">await</span> session<span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">respond</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>
    to<span class="pl-kos">:</span> prompt<span class="pl-kos">,</span>
    options<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">GenerationOptions</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>temperature<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">2.0</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span>
<span class="pl-kos">)</span></pre>

<p>There's also a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/286/">23 minute Meet the Foundation Models framework</a> video from the conference, which clarifies that this is a 3 billion parameter model with 2 bit quantization. The model is trained for both tool-calling and structured output, which they call "guided generation" and describe as taking advantage of constrained decoding.</p>
<p>I'm also <em>very</em> excited about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containerization Framework</strong></p>
<p>The Containerization framework enables developers to create, download, or run Linux container images directly on Mac. It’s built on an open-source framework optimized for Apple silicon and provides secure isolation between container images. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I continue to seek the ideal sandboxing solution for running untrusted code - both from other humans and written for me by LLMs - on my own machines. This looks like it could be a really great option for that going forward.</p>
<p>It looks like <a href="https://github.com/apple/container">apple/container</a> on GitHub is part of this new feature. From the <a href="https://github.com/apple/container/blob/main/docs/technical-overview.md">technical overview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On macOS, the typical way to run Linux containers is to launch a Linux virtual machine (VM) that hosts all of your containers.</p>
<p><code>container</code> runs containers differently. Using the open source <a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization">Containerization</a> package, it runs a lightweight VM for each container that you create. [...]</p>
<p>Since <code>container</code> consumes and produces standard OCI images, you can easily build with and run images produced by other container applications, and the images that you build will run everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

## OpenAI hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue fueled by ChatGPT growth

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/openai-hits-10-billion-in-annualized-revenue-fueled-by-chatgpt-growth.html">OpenAI hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue fueled by ChatGPT growth</a></strong></p>
Noteworthy because OpenAI revenue is a useful indicator of the direction of the generative AI industry in general, and frequently comes up in conversations about the sustainability of the current bubble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI has hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue less than three years after launching its popular ChatGPT chatbot.</p>
<p>The figure includes sales  from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products and its application programming interface, or API. It excludes licensing revenue from Microsoft and large one-time deals, according to an OpenAI spokesperson.</p>
<p>For all of last year, OpenAI was around $5.5 billion in ARR. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these new numbers represent nearly double the ARR figures for last year.

## Quoting David Crawshaw

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-agents"><p>The process of learning and experimenting with LLM-derived technology has been an exercise in humility. In general I love learning new things when the art of programming changes […] But LLMs, and more specifically Agents, affect the process of writing programs in a new and confusing way. Absolutely every fundamental assumption about how I work has to be questioned, and it ripples through all the experience I have accumulated. There are days when it feels like I would be better off if I did not know anything about programming and started from scratch. And it is still changing.</p></blockquote>

## Copying Spinoza

date: 2025-06-09, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
I’ve run into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> a few
times, sometimes in unexpected places like <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, but I’ve not
yet spent any time reading his work. He popped up in a recent Between
the Covers <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">podcast</a>
interview with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine Thien</a>
about her new book <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a>. You’ll have to listen to the interview, or read the
book, to get a sense of how the book works, but it’s my understanding
that the main character is a refugee, and yet was able to bring with her
three slim books from a series called <em>The Great Lives of
Voyagers</em>, one of which is about Spinoza, the others being about Du
Fu and Hannah Arendt. I believe that readings of these fictional books
form part of The Book of Records.
</p>
<p>
During the interview Thien was asked about the importance of these
stories, and friendships to her work as a writer…not only friendships
with contemporaries, but across time as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s certainly true when I placed all the stories side by side, or as
they began to weave through each other, that it became clear that all of
them are at times, many times, sometimes, saved by another, and none of
their work would reach us had these acts of friendship not occurred. And
Moriel asked about that idea of friendship across the centuries between
the living and the dead. I was always struck by Hannah Arendt writing
about Rahel Varnhagen and saying she was my best friend even though she
had died a hundred years ago before her. I often felt this with the
three figures who were moving around in the Sea, that they were amazed
that we wanted to sit with them, even if we didn’t always agree with
them, even if we might have quite serious critiques of some of their
ideas. But even then, the desire to value the teacher, to value the
teaching, and to understand what it was that each of us might be looking
for each time we sit with a text, with a person, with another human
being, <em>I only really feel like I was with Spinoza when I, over many
months, copied up Ethics.</em> I understood then the way the geometry
would work on a person’s mind, that it is such a step-by-step process,
that text. One thing really must be understood before one moves to the
next proposition. One has to draw the angles of the triangle and the
measurements and understand what a triangle is before one can begin to
“constellate” it with other things. That’s very much how Ethics works.
It is this seed, that everything that it contains is in it from its
first axioms, its first propositions, and you can kind of unfold them
and see how that all works.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This idea of <em>copying</em> Spinoza’s Ethics in an effort to form an
understanding and a friendship with him is compelling: to get a copy of
Ethics, and a blank notebook, and just start copying it out. It’s my
understanding that the text takes shape in the form of axioms and
propositions that draw on geometry, in order to propose a “human
geometry”? Of all the maths that I needed to do in school it was
geometric proofs that I always got the most enjoyment from. This made me
think it would be fun to try do this copying practice with others, to
meet and discuss, and share our notebooks and thoughts? But then again,
I imagine if it took Thien months to do the copying it would take me
<em>much</em> longer…so perhaps it would be best to just work at my own
pace, when I can, without the peer pressure?
</p>
<p>
Another thing I learned while reading about Spinoza’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza%27s_Ethics">Ethics,
Demonstrated in Geometric Order</a> on Wikipedia is that the first
translation into English was done by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot">George Eliot</a> in
1883, and it was left unpublished until almost a hundred years later.
Spinoza wrote the book over 14 years and it was only published after he
died. According to Thien, it took her 9 years to write The Book of
Records. In this age of move fast and break things, the idea of doing
something restorative, over the course of years, is maybe what appeals
to me most.

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a nut and don&rsquo;t use SQLMesh or dbt. Instead, I built <a href="https://github.com/carbonfact/lea">lea</a> a few years ago, and we still use it at <a href="https://carbonfact.org">Carbonfact</a>. I would probably pick SQLMesh if I had to start over, but lea allows me to explore new ideas, so I&rsquo;m sticking to it for now.</p>

New family of embedding models from Qwen, in three sizes: 0.6B, 4B, 8B - and two categories: Text Embedding and Text Reranking.</p>
<p>The full collection <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-embedding-6841b2055b99c44d9a4c371f">can be browsed</a> on Hugging Face. The smallest available model is the 0.6B Q8 one, which is available as a 639MB GGUF. I tried it out using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a> plugin like this:</p>

llm sentence-transformers register Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
llm embed -m sentence-transformers/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B -c hi | jq length
</code></pre>
<p>This output 1024, confirming that Qwen3 0.6B produces 1024 length embedding vectors.</p>
<p>These new models are the highest scoring open-weight models on the well regarded <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB leaderboard</a> - they're licensed Apache 2.0.</p>
