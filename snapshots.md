## Notes on Google's Gemma 3

date: 2025-03-12, updated: 2025-03-12, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>Google's Gemma team released an impressive new model today (under their not-open-source <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms">Gemma license</a>). Gemma 3 comes in four sizes - 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B - and while 1B is text-only the larger three models are all multi-modal for vision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gemma 3 introduces multimodality, supporting vision-language input and text outputs. It handles context windows up to 128k tokens, understands over 140 languages, and offers improved math, reasoning, and chat capabilities, including structured outputs and function calling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/Gemma3Report.pdf">Gemma 3 Technical Report PDF</a>, which makes the big claim that they find "Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across
benchmarks".</p>
<p>I tried out the largest model using the latest <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> - this is the second time I've spotted a major model release partnering with Ollama on launch day, the first being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">Mistral Small 3</a>.</p>
<p>I ran this (after upgrading Ollama through their menu icon upgrade option):</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull gemma3:27b
</code></pre>
<p>That pulled 17GB of model weights. I've been trying it out using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m gemma3:27b 'Build a single page HTML+CSS+JavaScript UI that gives me a large textarea for writing in which constantly saves what I have entered to localStorage (restoring when I reload the page) and displays a word counter'
</code></pre>
<p>That was a replay of <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#word-counter.html">a prompt</a> I ran against Claude Artifacts a few months ago. Here's <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3-word-count.html">what Gemma built</a>, and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8a87f2242439d3974405a17f5d8bc23">full chat transcript</a>. It's a simple example but it worked just right.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma-word-count.gif" alt="Animated demo - a simple textarea, I type text in it and a word count updates above." /></p>

<p>Let's try out the vision mode, by asking it to describe this photo:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg" alt="Two pelicans flying against a blue sky " style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b describe -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0e703ba72d0cf5a6dd117981bd03e604">the full response</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong></p>
<p>The image features two brown pelicans in flight against a solid, bright blue background. The composition is dynamic, capturing the birds mid-wingbeat.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pelicans:</strong> Both pelicans are a rich, dark brown color. They have large, pale yellow-orange beaks and pouches. One pelican is shown with its wings fully extended, appearing to be gliding or soaring. The other is captured with its wings in a more dynamic, upward-sweeping motion.</li>
<li>
<strong>Background:</strong> The background is a flat, uniform shade of bright blue, which makes the pelicans stand out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Composition:</strong> The birds are positioned in opposite directions, creating a sense of movement and balance. The image is well-lit, highlighting the texture of the pelicans' feathers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall, the image is a striking and visually appealing depiction of these majestic birds in flight.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it right to say "the birds are positioned in opposite directions"? I thought that was a mistake at first, but I'll give it a pass since their wings are positioned in opposite directions to each other.</p>

<p>Something I've been curious about recently is longer context support: how well can a local model on my laptop deal with summarization or data extraction tasks against longer pieces of text?</p>
<p>I decided to try <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my Hacker News summarize script</a> using Gemma, against <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43340491">the thread</a> there discussing the Gemma 3 technical paper.</p>
<p>First I did a quick token count (using the OpenAI tokenizer but it's usually a similar number to other models):</p>
<pre><code>curl 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/43340491' | ttok
</code></pre>
<p>This returned 22,260 - well within Gemma's documented limits but still a healthy number considering just last year most models topped out at 4,000 or 8,000.</p>
<p>I ran my script like this:</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 43340491 -m gemma3:27b
</code></pre>
<p>It did a pretty good job! Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ab487ea3d1605e719dc2950cd4565146">full prompt and response</a>. The one big miss is that it ignored my instructions to include illustrative quotes - I don't know if modifying the prompt will fix that but it's disappointing that it didn't handle that well, given how important direct quotes are for building confidence in RAG-style responses.</p>
<p>Here's what I got for <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f79c4bd2fbe966e1b600cb8b41cae810">Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'
</code></pre>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma-3-pelican.svg" alt="A collection of abstract shapes, definitely not a pelican on a bicycle" /></p>

<p>You can also try out the new Gemma <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemma-3-27b-it">in Google AI Studio</a>, and via their API. I added support for it to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.15">llm-gemini 0.15</a>, though sadly it appears vision mode doesn't work with that API hosted model yet.</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini
# paste key here
llm -m gemma-3-27b-it 'five facts about pelicans of interest to skunks'
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/bc22062e60e5af3faf458756cb368d0e">Here's what I got</a>. I'm not sure how pricing works for that hosted model.</p>
<p>Gemma 3 is also already available <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm/pull/235">through MLX-VLM</a> - here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/mlx-community/gemma-3-67d14a10480a436ad478b0f9">the MLX model collection</a> - but I haven't tried that version yet.</p>

## OpenAI Agents SDK

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/">OpenAI Agents SDK</a></strong></p>
OpenAI's other big announcement today (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/responses-vs-chat-completions/">see also</a>) - a Python library (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai-agents/">openai-agents</a>) for building "agents", which is a replacement for their previous <a href="https://github.com/openai/swarm">swarm</a> research project.</p>
<p>In this project, an "agent" is a class that configures an LLM with a system prompt an access to specific tools.</p>
<p>An interesting concept in this one is the concept of <strong><a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/">handoffs</a></strong>, where one agent can chose to hand execution over to a different system-prompt-plus-tools agent treating it almost like a tool itself. This code example illustrates the idea:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">agents</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Agent</span>, <span class="pl-s1">handoff</span>

<span class="pl-s1">billing_agent</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Agent</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Billing agent"</span>
)
<span class="pl-s1">refund_agent</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Agent</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Refund agent"</span>
)
<span class="pl-s1">triage_agent</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Agent</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Triage agent"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">handoffs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">billing_agent</span>, <span class="pl-en">handoff</span>(<span class="pl-s1">refund_agent</span>)]
)</pre>

<p>The library also includes <a href="https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/">guardrails</a> - classes you can add that attempt to filter user input to make sure it fits expected criteria. Bits of this look suspiciously like trying to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/17/prompt-injection-more-ai/">solve AI security problems with more AI</a> to me.

## OpenAI API: Responses vs. Chat Completions

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions">OpenAI API: Responses vs. Chat Completions</a></strong></p>
OpenAI released a bunch of new API platform features this morning under the headline "<a href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/">New tools for building agents</a>" (their somewhat mushy interpretation of "agents" here is "systems that independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users").</p>
<p>A particularly significant change is the introduction of a new <strong>Responses API</strong>, which is a slightly different shape from the Chat Completions API that they've offered for the past couple of years and which others in the industry have widely cloned as an ad-hoc standard.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions">this guide</a> they illustrate the differences, with a reassuring note that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chat Completions API is an industry standard for building AI applications, and we intend to continue supporting this API indefinitely. We're introducing the Responses API to simplify workflows involving tool use, code execution, and state management. We believe this new API primitive will allow us to more effectively enhance the OpenAI platform into the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An API that <em>is</em> going away is the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants">Assistants API</a>, a perpetual beta first launched at OpenAI DevDay in 2023. The new responses API solves effectively the same problems but better, and assistants will be sunset "in the first half of 2026".</p>
<p>The best illustration I've seen of the differences between the two is this <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/commit/2954945ecc185259cfd7cd33c8cbc818a88e4e1b">giant commit</a> to the <code>openai-python</code> GitHub repository updating ALL of the example code in one go.</p>
<p>The most important feature of the Responses API (a feature it shares with the old Assistants API) is that it can manage conversation state on the server for you. An oddity of the Chat Completions API is that you need to maintain your own records of the current conversation, sending back full copies of it with each new prompt. You end up making API calls that look like this (from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state?api-mode=chat&amp;lang=javascript#manually-manage-conversation-state">their examples</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json"><pre>{
    <span class="pl-ent">"model"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>gpt-4o-mini<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
    <span class="pl-ent">"messages"</span>: [
        {
            <span class="pl-ent">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>user<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
            <span class="pl-ent">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>knock knock.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
        },
        {
            <span class="pl-ent">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>assistant<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
            <span class="pl-ent">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Who's there?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
        },
        {
            <span class="pl-ent">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>user<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
            <span class="pl-ent">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Orange.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
        }
    ]
}</pre></div>

<p>These can get long and unwieldy - especially when attachments such as images are involved - but the real challenge is when you start integrating tools: in a conversation with tool use you'll need to maintain that full state <em>and</em> drop messages in that show the output of the tools the model requested. It's not a trivial thing to work with.</p>
<p>The new Responses API continues to support this list of messages format, but you also get the option to outsource that to OpenAI entirely: you can add a new <code>"store": true</code> property and then in subsequent messages include a <code>"previous_response_id: response_id</code> key to continue that conversation.</p>
<p>This feels a whole lot more natural than the Assistants API, which required you to think in terms of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview#objects">threads, messages and runs</a> to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>Also fun: the Response API <a href="https://twitter.com/athyuttamre/status/1899541484308971822">supports HTML form encoding</a> now in addition to JSON:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -u :$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  -d model="gpt-4o" \
  -d input="What is the capital of France?"
</code></pre>
<p>I found that in an excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/athyuttamre/status/1899541471532867821">Twitter thread</a> providing background on the design decisions in the new API from OpenAI's Atty Eleti. Here's <a href="https://nitter.net/athyuttamre/status/1899541471532867821">a nitter link</a> for people who don't have a Twitter account.</p>
<h4>New built-in tools</h4>
<p>A potentially more exciting change today is the introduction of default tools that you can request while using the new Responses API. There are three of these, all of which can be specified in the <code>"tools": [...]</code> array.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{"type": "web_search_preview"}</code> - the same search feature available through ChatGPT. The documentation doesn't clarify which underlying search engine is used - I initially assumed Bing, but the tool documentation links to this <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots">Overview of OpenAI Crawlers</a> page so maybe it's entirely in-house now? Web search <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#web-search">is priced</a> at between $25 and $50 per thousand queries depending on if you're using GPT-4o or GPT-4o mini and the configurable size of your "search context".</li>
<li><code>{"type": "file_search", "vector_store_ids": [...]}</code> provides integration with the latest version of their <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search">file search</a> vector store, mainly used for RAG. "Usage is priced⁠ at $2.50 per thousand queries and file storage at $0.10/GB/day, with the first GB free".</li>
<li><code>{"type": "computer_use_preview", "display_width": 1024, "display_height": 768, "environment": "browser"}</code> is the most surprising to me: it's tool access to the <a href="https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/">Computer-Using Agent</a> system they built for their Operator product. This one is going to be <em>a lot</em> of fun to explore. The tool's documentation includes a warning <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use#beware-of-prompt-injections">about prompt injection risks</a>. Though on closer inspection I think this may work more like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Claude Computer Use</a>, where you have to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use#setting-up-your-environment">run the sandboxed environment yourself</a> rather than outsource that difficult part to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still thinking through how to expose these new features in my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool, which is made harder by the fact that a number of plugins now rely on the default OpenAI implementation from core, which is currently built on top of Chat Completions. I've been worrying for a while about the impact of our entire industry building clones of one proprietary API that might change in the future, I guess now we get to see how that shakes out!

## Quoting Ryan Cavanaugh

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/411"><p>Languages that allow for a structurally similar codebase offer a significant boon for anyone making code changes because we can easily port changes between the two codebases. In contrast, languages that require fundamental rethinking of memory management, mutation, data structuring, polymorphism, laziness, etc., might be a better fit for a ground-up rewrite, but we're undertaking this more as a <em>port</em> that maintains the existing behavior and critical optimizations we've built into the language. Idiomatic Go strongly resembles the existing coding patterns of the TypeScript codebase, which makes this porting effort much more tractable.</p></blockquote>

Regular readers might assume that I spurn all things AI-related, and this is not the case.

## Here's how I use LLMs to help me write code

date: 2025-03-11, updated: 2025-03-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>Online discussions about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">using Large Language Models to help write code</a> inevitably produce comments from developers who's experiences have been disappointing. They often ask what they're doing wrong - how come some people are reporting such great results when their own experiments have proved lacking?</p>
<p>Using LLMs to write code is <strong>difficult</strong> and <strong>unintuitive</strong>. It takes significant effort to figure out the sharp and soft edges of using them in this way, and there's precious little guidance to help people figure out how best to apply them.</p>
<p>If someone tells you that coding with LLMs is <em>easy</em> they are (probably unintentionally) misleading you. They may well have stumbled on to patterns that work, but those patterns do not come naturally to everyone.</p>
<p>I've been getting great results out of LLMs for code for over two years now. Here's my attempt at transferring some of that experience and intution to you.</p>

</ul>


<h4 id="set-reasonable-expectations">Set reasonable expectations</h4>
<p>Ignore the "AGI" hype - LLMs are still fancy autocomplete. All they do is predict a sequence of tokens - but it turns out writing code is mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be <em>extremely</em> useful for this provided you point them in the right direction.</p>
<p>If you assume that this technology will implement your project perfectly without you needing to exercise any of your own skill you'll quickly be disappointed.</p>
<p>Instead, use them to <em>augment</em> your abilities. My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who's lightning fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant examples at a moment's notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Over-confident</strong> is important. They'll absolutely make mistakes - sometimes subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/kellan-elliott-mccrea/">deeply inhuman</a> - if a human collaborator hallucinated a non-existent library or method you would instantly lose trust in them. Don't fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the same way.</p>
<p>When working with LLMs you'll often find things that they just cannot do. Make a note of these - they are useful lessons! They're also valuable examples to stash away for the future - a sign of a strong new model is when it produces usable results for a task that previous models had been unable to handle.</p>
<h4 id="account-for-training-cut-off-dates">Account for training cut-off dates</h4>
<p>A crucial characteristic of any model is its <strong>training cut-off date</strong>. This is the date at which the data they were trained on stopped being collected. For OpenAI's models this is usually October of 2023. Anthropic and Gemini and other providers may have more recent dates.</p>
<p>This is <em>extremely</em> important for code, because it influences what libraries they will be familiar with. If the library you are using had a major breaking change since October 2023, OpenAI models won't know about it!</p>
<p>I gain enough value from LLMs that I now deliberately consider this when picking a library - I try to stick with libraries with good stability and that are popular enough that many examples of them will have made it into the training data. I like applying the principles of <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a> - innovate on your project's unique selling points, stick with tried and tested solutions for everything else.</p>
<p>LLMs can still help you work with libraries that exist outside their training data, but you need to put in more work - you'll need to feed them recent examples of how those libraries should be used as part of your prompt.</p>
<p>This brings us to the most important thing to understand when working with LLMs:</p>
<h4 id="context-is-king">Context is king</h4>
<p>Most of the craft of getting good results out of an LLM comes down to managing its context - the text that is part of your current conversation.</p>
<p>This context isn't just the prompt that you have fed it: successful LLM interactions usually take the form of conversations, and the context consists of every message from you <em>and</em> every reply from the LLM that exist in the current conversation thread.</p>
<p>When you start a new conversation you reset that context back to zero. This is important to know, as often the fix for a conversation that has stopped being useful is to wipe the slate clean and start again.</p>
<p>Some LLM coding tools go beyond just the conversation. Claude Projects for example allow you to pre-populate the context with quite a large amount of text - including a recent ability to <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">import code directly from a GitHub</a> repository which I'm using a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>Tools like Cursor and VS Code Copilot include context from your current editor session and file layout automatically, and you can sometimes use mechanisms like <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview">Cursor's @commands</a> to pull in additional files or documentation.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I mostly work directly with the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> web or app interfaces is that it makes it easier for me to understand exactly what is going into the context. LLM tools that obscure that context from me are <em>less</em> effective.</p>
<p>You can use the fact that previous replies are also part of the context to your advantage. For complex coding tasks try getting the LLM to write a simpler version first, check that it works and then iterate on building to the more sophisticated implementation.</p>
<p>I often start a new chat by dumping in existing code to seed that context, then work with the LLM to modify it in some way.</p>
<p>One of my favorite code prompting techniques is to drop in several full examples relating to something I want to build, then prompt the LLM to use them as inspiration for a new project. I wrote about that in detail when I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">described my JavaScript OCR application</a> that combines Tesseract.js and PDF.js - two libraries I had used in the past and for which I could provide working examples in the prompt.</p>
<h4 id="ask-them-for-options">Ask them for options</h4>
<p>Most of my projects start with some open questions: is the thing I'm trying to do possible? What are the potential ways I could implement it? Which of those options are the <em>best</em>?</p>
<p>I use LLMs as part of this initial research phase.</p>
<p>I'll use prompts like "what are options for HTTP libraries in Rust? Include usage examples" - or "what are some useful drag-and-drop libraries in JavaScript? Build me an artifact demonstrating each one" (to Claude).</p>
<p>The training cut-off is relevant here, since it means newer libraries won't be suggested. Usually that's OK - I don't want the latest, I want the most stable and the one that has been around for long enough for the bugs to be ironed out.</p>
<p>If I'm going to use something more recent I'll do that research myself, outside of LLM world.</p>
<p>The best way to start any project is with a prototype that proves that the key requirements of that project can be met. I often find that an LLM can get me to that working prototype within a few minutes of me sitting down with my laptop - or sometimes even while working on my phone.</p>
<h4 id="tell-them-exactly-what-to-do">Tell them exactly what to do</h4>
<p>Once I've completed the initial research I change modes dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type code for me based on my detailed instructions.</p>
<p>Here's a recent example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a Python function that uses asyncio httpx with this signature:</p>
<pre><code>async def download_db(url, max_size_bytes=5 * 1025 * 1025): -&gt; pathlib.Path
</code></pre>
<p>Given a URL, this downloads the database to a temp directory and returns a path to it. BUT it checks the content length header at the start of streaming back that data and, if it's more than the limit, raises an error. When the download finishes it uses <code>sqlite3.connect(...)</code> and then runs a <code>PRAGMA quick_check</code> to confirm the SQLite data is valid - raising an error if not. Finally, if the content length header lies to us -  if it says 2MB but we download 3MB - we get an error raised as soon as we notice that problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could write this function myself, but it would take me the better part of fifteen minutes to look up all of the details and get the code working right. Claude knocked it out <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5aed8bd87016c77465c23e0dc4563ec9">in 15 seconds</a>.</p>
<p>I find LLMs respond extremely well to function signatures like the one I use here. I get to act as the function designer, the LLM does the work of building the body to my specification.</p>
<p>I'll often follow-up with "Now write me the tests using pytest". Again, I dictate my technology of choice - I want the LLM to save me the time of having to type out the code that's sitting in my head already.</p>
<p>If your reaction to this is "surely typing out the code is faster than typing out an English instruction of it", all I can tell you is that it really isn't for me any more. Code needs to be correct. English has enormous room for shortcuts, and vagaries, and typos, and saying things like "use that popular HTTP library" if you can't remember the name off the top of your head.</p>
<p>The good coding LLMs are excellent at filling in the gaps. They're also much less lazy than me - they'll remember to catch likely exceptions, add accurate docstrings, and annotate code with the relevant types.</p>
<h4 id="you-have-to-test-what-it-writes-">You have to test what it writes!</h4>
<p>I wrote about this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/#qa">at length last week</a>: the one thing you absolutely cannot outsource to the machine is testing that the code actually works.</p>
<p>Your responsibility as a software developer is to deliver working systems. If you haven't seen it run, it's not a working system. You need to invest in strengthening those manual QA habits.</p>
<p>This may not be glamorous but it's always been a critical part of shipping good code, with or without the involvement of LLMs.</p>
<h4 id="remember-it-s-a-conversation">Remember it's a conversation</h4>
<p>If I don't like what an LLM has written, they'll <em>never</em> complain at being told to refactor it! "Break that repetitive code out into a function", "use string manipulation methods rather than a regular expression", or even "write that better!" - the code an LLM produces first time is rarely the final implementation, but they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting frustrated or bored.</p>
<p>Occasionally I'll get a great result from my first prompt - more frequently the more I practice - but I expect to need at least a few follow-ups.</p>
<p>I often wonder if this is one of the key tricks that people are missing - a bad initial result isn't a failure, it's a starting point for pushing the model in the direction of the thing you actually want.</p>
<h4 id="use-tools-that-can-run-the-code-for-you">Use tools that can run the code for you</h4>
<p>An increasing number of LLM coding tools now have the ability to <em>run that code</em> for you. I'm slightly cautious about some of these since there's a possibility of the wrong command causing real damage, so I tend to stick to the ones that run code in a safe sandbox. My favorites right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong>, where ChatGPT can write and then execute Python code directly in a Kubernetes sandbox VM managed by OpenAI. This is completely safe - it can't even make outbound network connections so really all that can happen is the temporary filesystem gets mangled and then reset.</li>
<li>
<strong>Claude Artifacts</strong>, where Claude can build you a full HTML+JavaScript+CSS web application that is displayed within the Claude interface. This web app is displayed in a <em>very</em> locked down iframe sandbox, greatly restricting what it can do but preventing problems like accidental exfiltration of your private Claude data.</li>
<li>
<strong>ChatGPT Canvas</strong> is a newer ChatGPT feature with similar capabilites to Claude Artifacts. I have not explored this enough myself yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you're willing to live a little more dangerously:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a></strong> has an "Agent" feature that can do this, as does <strong><a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a></strong> and a growing number of other editors. I haven't spent enough time with these to make recommendations yet.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://aider.chat/">Aider</a></strong> is the leading open source implementation of these kinds of patterns, and is a great example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a> - recent releases of Aider have been <a href="https://aider.chat/HISTORY.html">80%+ written</a> by Aider itself.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a></strong> is Anthropic's new entrant into this space. I'll provide a detailed description of using that tool shortly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This run-the-code-in-a-loop pattern is so powerful that I chose my core LLM tools for coding based primarily on whether they can safely run and iterate on my code.</p>
<h4 id="vibe-coding-is-a-great-way-to-learn">Vibe-coding is a great way to learn</h4>
<p>Andrej Karpathy <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/6/andrej-karpathy/">coined the term</a> vibe-coding just over a month ago, and it has stuck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. [...] I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrej suggests this is "not too bad for throwaway weekend projects". It's also a <em>fantastic</em> way to explore the capabilities of these models - and really fun.</p>
<p>The best way to learn LLMs is to play with them. Throwing absurd ideas at them and vibe-coding until they almost sort-of work is a genuinely useful way to accelerate the rate at which you build intuition for what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>I've been vibe-coding since before Andrej gave it a name! My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">simonw/tools</a> GitHub repository has 77 HTML+JavaScript apps and 6 Python apps, and every single one of them was built by prompting LLMs. I have learned <em>so much</em> from building this collection, and I add to it at a rate of several new prototypes per week.</p>
<p>You can try most of mine out directly on <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> - a GitHub Pages published version of the repo. I wrote more detailed notes on some of these back in October in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see the transcript of the chat used for each one it's almost always linked to in the commit history for that page - or visit the new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon page</a> for an index that includes all of those links.</p>
<h4 id="a-detailed-example">A detailed example using Claude Code</h4>
<p>While I was writing this article I had the idea for that <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">tools.simonwillison.net/colophon</a> page - I wanted something I could link to that showed the commit history of each of my tools in a more obvious way than GitHub.</p>
<p>I decided to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate my AI-assisted coding process.</p>
<p>For this one I used <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, because I wanted it to be able to run Python code directly against my existing tools repository on my laptop.</p>
<p>Running the <code>/cost</code> command at the end of my session showed me this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; /cost 
  ⎿  Total cost: $0.61
     Total duration (API): 5m 31.2s
     Total duration (wall): 17m 18.7s
</code></pre>
<p>The initial project took me just over 17 minutes from start to finish, and cost me 61 cents in API calls to Anthropic.</p>
<p>I used the authoritarian process where I told the model exactly what I wanted to build. Here's my sequence of prompts (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/323e1b00ee4f8453c7834a7560eeafc1">full transcript here</a>).</p>
<p>I started by asking for an initial script to gather the data needed for the new page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all of the HTML files in this directory were created using Claude prompts, and the details of those prompts are linked in the commit messages. Build a Python script that checks the commit history for each HTML file in turn and extracts any URLs from those commit messages into a list. It should then output a JSON file with this structure: {"pages": {"name-of-file.html": ["url"], {"name-of-file-2.html": ["url1", "url2"], ... - as you can see, some files may have more than one URL in their commit history. The script should be called gather_links.py and it should save a JSON file called gathered_links.json</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really didn't think very hard about this first prompt - it was more of a stream of consciousness that I typed into the bot as I thought about the initial problem.</p>
<p>I inspected the initial result and spotted some problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like it just got the start of the URLs, it should be getting the whole URLs which might be to different websites - so just get anything that starts https:// and ends with whitespace or the end of the commit message</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I changed my mind - I wanted those full commit messages too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the script - I want to capture the full commit messages AND the URLs - the new format should be {"pages": {"aria-live-regions.html": {"commits": [{"hash": hash, "message": message, "date": iso formatted date], "urls": [list of URLs like before]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Providing examples like this is a great shortcut to getting exactly what you want.</p>
<p>Note that at no point have I looked at the code it's written in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5/gather_links.py">gather_links.py</a>! This is pure vibe-coding: I'm looking at what it's doing, but I've left the implementation details entirely up to the LLM.</p>
<p>The JSON looked good to me, so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is working great. Write me a new script called build_colophon.py which looks through that gathered JSON file and builds and saves an HTML page. The page should be mobile friendly and should list every page - with a link to that page - and for each one display the commit messages neatly (convert newlines to br and linkify URLs but no other formatting) - plus the commit message dates and links to the commits themselves which are in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools">https://github.com/simonw/tools</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claude knows how GitHub URLs works, so telling it to link to the commits and providing the repo name was enough for it guess <code>https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/fd9daf885c924ba277806b3440457d52b0ad90a8</code> for those commit URLs.</p>
<p>I tend to find Claude has good default taste when it comes to web page design - I said "the page should be mobile friendly" and left it at that.</p>
<p>Claude churned away and built me a page that wasn't right, so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's not working right. ocr.html had a bunch of commits but in colophon.html there is only one link and heading for the first commit and the rest are shown within that same block - there should be separate HTML chunks with links and formatted dates for each of the other commits. Also the neatly formatted date should include the HH:MM as well as the date</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It fixed the bug all on its own, leaving just two changes I decided to make:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's almost perfect, but each page should have the commits displayed in the opposite order - oldest first</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then:</p>

<p>And that was the entire project! Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/1e04f12a1cacea8856946162457d0d77e60ee549/build_colophon.py">build_colophon.py</a>, and the page it generated came out <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon.html">looking pretty good</a>:</p>

<p>There was one remaining task: I needed to deploy the new colophon as part of my site, but I didn't want to check that new <code>colophon.html</code> page into the repository itself. I wanted a custom GitHub Pages build process.</p>
<p>I started a brand new Claude Code session (clearing the slate) to see if that was something Claude could figure out too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This repo is deployed using GitHub Pages. I want to modify the build slightly - before deploying to GitHub Pages it should run python gather_links.py which will generate a file called gathered_links.json - then it should run python build_colophon.py which will use that file to create colophon.html - I want both gathered_links.json and colophon.html to be published to GitHub pages but I do not want them checked into the repo itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the first time, this time I watched what it was doing very closely - I don't know how to customize GitHub Pages builds in this way and I wanted to both learn how to do it and stay cautious that it might hallucinate details and fail at the task.</p>
<p>It told me it wanted to create this file and asked for my permission:</p>

<p>I guess that's right? I appreciated that comment about "Need full history for git log in gather_links.py" - that's something I could easily have missed.</p>
<p>Then it said it wanted to add those files to <code>.gitignore</code> - sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>It spat out this summary of its actions so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've created a GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates a .github/workflows/pages.yml file that:
<ul>
<li>Runs on pushes to main branch</li>
<li>Checkouts the full git history (needed for gather_links.py)</li>
<li>Sets up Python 3.12</li>
<li>Runs both scripts in sequence to generate the files</li>
<li>Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created .gitignore file to prevent the generated files from being committed</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when you push to main, GitHub Actions will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the gather_links.py script to create gathered_links.json</li>
<li>Run build_colophon.py to create colophon.html</li>
<li>Deploy both files (and all other files) to GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I checked to see how much it had cost:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; /cost 
  ⎿  Total cost: $0.1788
     Total duration (API): 44.6s
     Total duration (wall): 10m 18.6s
</code></pre>
<p>So 17 cents and 45 seconds using the Claude API. (I got distracted, hence the 10m of total time.) Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a560b07eef577e6183021d1ccaae7e07">full transcript</a>.</p>
<p>The code didn't look like it would irreversibly break anything, so I pushed it to GitHub to see what would happen.</p>
<p>... and it worked! My new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon page</a> was live.</p>
<p>There's a catch. I watched the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/actions">GitHub Actions</a> interface while it was running and something didn't look right:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon.jpg" alt="GitHub Actions interface showing three completed actions. Test for Custom pages workflow for colophon,2 Deploy for that same name and another one called pages-build-deployment." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I was expecting that "Test" job, but why were there two separate deploys?</p>
<p>I had a hunch that the previous, default Jekyll deploy was still running, while the new deploy ran at the same time - and it was pure luck of the timing that the new script finished later and over-wrote the result of the original.</p>
<p>It was time to ditch the LLMs and read some documentation!</p>
<p>I found this page on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages">Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages</a> but it didn't tell me what I needed to know.</p>
<p>On another hunch I checked the GitHub Pages settings interface for my repo and found this option:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-pages-settings.jpg" alt="GitHub Pages UI - shows your site is live at tools.simonwillison.net, deployed 7 minutes ago. - then under Buyld and deployment a source menu shows options for GitHub Actions or for Deploy from a branch (selected)" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>My repo was set to "Deploy from a branch", so I switched that over to "GitHub Actions".</p>
<p>I manually updated my <code>README.md</code> to add a link to the new Colophon page in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/4ee15aaad8e9a412505210a30f485528cb3c0390">this commit</a>, which triggered another build.</p>
<p>This time only two jobs ran, and the end result was the correctly deployed site:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon-2.jpg" alt="Only two in-progress workflows now, one is the Test one and the other is the Deploy to GitHub Pages one." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>(I later spotted another bug - some of the links inadvertently included <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags in their <code>href=</code>, which I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5">fixed</a> with another <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/d5ccbca1b530868980609222790a97cb">11 cent Claude Code session</a>.)</p>
<h4 id="be-ready-for-the-human-to-take-over">Be ready for the human to take over</h4>
<p>I got lucky with this example because it helped illustrate my final point: expect to need to take over.</p>
<p>LLMs are no replacement for human intuition and experience. I've spent enough time with GitHub Actions that I know what kind of things to look for, and in this case it was faster for me to step in and finish the project rather than keep on trying to get there with prompts.</p>
<h4 id="the-biggest-advantage-is-speed-of-development">The biggest advantage is speed of development</h4>
<p>My new <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">colophon page</a> took me just under half an hour from conception to finished, deployed feature.</p>
<p>I'm certain it would have taken me significantly longer without LLM assistance - to the point that I probably wouldn't have bothered to build it at all.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is why I care so much about the productivity boost I get from LLMs so much: it's not about getting work done faster, it's about being able to ship projects that I wouldn't have been able to justify spending time on at all.</p>
<p>I wrote about this in March 2023: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/">AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects</a>. Two years later that effect shows no sign of wearing off.</p>
<p>It's also a great way to accelerate learning new things - today that was how to customize my GitHub Pages builds using Actions, which is something I'll certainly use again in the future.</p>
<p>The fact that LLMs let me execute my ideas faster means I can implement more of them, which means I can learn even more.</p>
<h4 id="llms-amplify-existing-expertise">LLMs amplify existing expertise</h4>
<p>Could anyone else have done this project in the same way? Probably not! My prompting here leaned on 25+ years of professional coding experience, including my previous explorations of GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, GitHub itself and the LLM tools I put into play.</p>
<p>I also <em>knew</em> that this was going to work. I've spent enough time working with these tools that I was confident that assembling a new HTML page with information pulled from my Git history was entirely within the capabilities of a good LLM.</p>
<p>My prompts reflected that - there was nothing particularly novel here, so I dictated the design, tested the results as it was working and occasionally nudged it to fix a bug.</p>
<p>If I was trying to build a Linux kernel driver - a field I know virtually nothing about - my process would be entirely different.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-answering-questions-about-codebases">Bonus: answering questions about codebases</h4>
<p>If the idea of using LLMs to write code for you still feels deeply unappealing, there's another use-case for them which you may find more compelling.</p>
<p>Good LLMs are <em>great</em> at answering questions about code.</p>
<p>This is also very low stakes: the worst that can happen is they might get something wrong, which may take you a tiny bit longer to figure out. It's still likely to save you time compared to digging through thousands of lines of code entirely by yourself.</p>
<p>The trick here is to dump the code into a long context model and start asking questions. My current favorite for this is the catchily titled <code>gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05</code>, a preview of Google's Gemini 2.0 Pro which is currently free to use via their API.</p>
<p>I used this trick just <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/monolith/">the other day</a>. I was trying out a new-to-me tool called <a href="https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith">monolith</a>, a CLI tool written in Rust which downloads a web page and all of its dependent assets (CSS, images etc) and bundles them together into a single archived file.</p>
<p>I was curious as to how it worked, so I cloned it into my temporary directory and ran these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> monolith

files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>architectural overview as markdown<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>I'm using my own <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool (built for me by Claude 3 Opus <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/">last year</a>) here to gather the contents of all of the files in the repo into a single stream. Then I pipe that into my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool and tell it (via the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a> plugin) to prompt Gemini 2.0 Pro with a system prompt of "architectural overview as markdown".</p>
<p>This gave me back a <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2c80749935ae3339d6f7175dc7cf325b">detailed document</a> describing how the tool works - which source files do what and, crucially, which Rust crates it was using. I learned that it used <code>reqwest</code>, <code>html5ever</code>, <code>markup5ever_rcdom</code> and <code>cssparser</code> and that it doesn't evaluate JavaScript at all, an important limitation.</p>
<p>I use this trick several times a week. It's a great way to start diving into a new codebase - and often the alternative isn't spending more time on this, it's failing to satisfy my curiosity at all.</p>
<p>I included three more examples in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/14/files-to-prompt/">this recent post</a>.</p>

## LLVM Fortran Levels Up: Goodbye flang-new, Hello flang!

date: 2025-03-11, from: LLVM Blog

<p>LLVM has included a Fortran compiler &ldquo;Flang&rdquo; since LLVM 11 in late 2020. However,until recently the Flang binary was not <code>flang</code> (like <code>clang</code>) but instead<code>flang-new</code>.</p><p>LLVM 20 ends the era of <code>flang-new</code>. The community has decided that Flang isworthy of a new name.</p><p>The &ldquo;new&rdquo; name? You guessed it, <code>flang</code>.</p><p>A simple change that represents a major milestone for Flang.</p><p>This article will cover the almost 10 year journey of Flang.

Some are vendor specific such as the<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html">Intel Fortran Compiler</a>or NVIDIA&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers">HPC compilers</a>. Thenthere are open source options like <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/">GFortran</a>, whichsupports many platforms.</p><p>Why build one more?</p><p>The two partners in the early days of Flang were the US National Labs and NVIDIA.</p><p>For Pat McCormick (Flang project lead at Los Alamos National Laboratory) preservingthe utility of Fortran code was imperative:</p><blockquote><p>These [Fortran] codes represent an essential capability that supports manyelements of our [The United States&rsquo;] scientific mission and will continue to doso for the foreseeable future. A fundamental risk facing these codes is theabsence of a long-term, non-proprietary support path for Fortran.</p></blockquote><p>GFortran might seem to counter that statement, but remember that a single projectis a single point of failures, incompatibilities and disagreements. Having multipleimplementations reduces that risk.</p><p>NVIDIA&rsquo;s Gary Klimowicz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy68k5hHgLk">laid out</a>their goals for Flang in a presentation to FortranCon in 2020:</p><ul><li>Use a permissive license like that of <a href="https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt">LLVM</a>,which is more palatable to commercial users and contributors.</li><li>Develop an active community of Fortran compiler developers that includescompanies and institutions.</li><li>Support Fortran tool development by basing Flang on existing LLVM frameworks.</li><li>Support Fortran language experimentation for future language standards proposals.</li></ul><p>Intentions echoed by Pat McCormick:</p><blockquote><p>The overarching goal was to establish an open-source, modern implementation andsimultaneously grow a community that spanned industry, academia, and federalagencies at both the national and international levels.</p></blockquote><p>Fortran as a language also benefits from having many implementations. For C++language features, it is common to implement them on top of Clang and GCC, toprove the feature is viable and get feedback.</p><p>Implementing the feature multiple times in different compilers uncoversassumptions that may be a problem for certain compilers, or certain groups ofcompiler users.</p><p>In the same way, Flang and GFortran can provide that diversity.</p><p>However, even when features are standardised, standards can be ambiguous andimplementations do make mistakes. A new compiler is a chance to uncover these.</p><p>Jeff Hammond (NVIDIA) is very familiar with this, having tested Flang with manyexisting applications. They had this to say on the motivations for Flangand how users have reacted to it:</p><blockquote><p>The Fortran language has changed quite a bit over the past 30 years. Modern Fortrandeserves a modern compiler ecosystem, that&rsquo;s not only capable of compiling allthe old codes and all the code written for the current standard, but also supportsinnovation in the future.</p><p>Because it&rsquo;s a huge amount of work to build a feature-complete modern Fortran compiler,it&rsquo;s useful to leverage the resources of the entire LLVM community for this effort.NVIDIA and ARM play leading roles right now, with important contributions from IBM,Fujitsu and LBNL [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory], e.g. related to testsuites and coarrays. We hope to see the developer community grow in the future.</p><p>Another benefit from the LLVM Fortran compiler is that users are more likely toinvest in supporting a new compiler when it has full language support and runs onall the platforms. A broad developer base is critical to support all the platforms.</p><p>What I have seen so far interacting with our Fortran users is that they are veryexcited about LLVM Flang and were willing to commit to supporting it in theirbuild systems and CI systems, which has driven quality improvements in both theFlang compiler and the applications.</p><p>Like Clang did with C and C++ codes when it started to become popular, Flangis helping to identify bugs in Fortran code that weren&rsquo;t noticed before, whichis making the Fortran software ecosystem better.</p></blockquote><h1 id="pgi-to-llvm-the-flang-timeline">PGI to LLVM: The Flang Timeline</h1><p>The story of Flang really starts in 2015, but the Portland Group (PGI) collaboratedwith US National Labs prior to this.

It became its own public branch <code>fir-dev</code>, which was later contributedto the LLVM Project.</p><p>The following sections will go into detail on the intermediate representationsthat Flang uses today.</p><h1 id="mlir">MLIR</h1><p>The journey from Classic Flang to LLVM Flang involved a rewrite of theentire compiler. This provided an opportunity to pick up new things fromthe LLVM Project. Most notably MLIR.</p><p>&ldquo;Multi-Level Intermediate Representation&rdquo; (MLIR) was first<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzljG6DKgic">introduced</a> to the LLVMcommunity in 2019, around the time that F18 was approved to move into the LLVM Project.</p><p>The problem that MLIR addresses is the same one that Eric Schweitz tackled with FIR:It is difficult to map high level details of programming languagesinto LLVM IR.</p><p>You either have to attach them to the IR as metadata, try to recover thelost details later, or fight an uphill battle to add the details toLLVM IR itself. These details are crucial for producing optimised code in certainlanguages. (Fortran array optimisations were one use case referenced).</p><p>This led languages such as Swift and Rust to create their own IRs that includeinformation relevant to their own optimisations. After that IR has been optimisedit is converted into LLVM IR and goes through the normal compilation pipeline.</p><p>To implement these IRs they have to build a lot of infrastructure, but it cannotbe shared between the compilers.

It led us to course-correctin some cases, and Flang was a motivating factor for many feature requests.It contributed significantly to establishing and validating that MLIR had the right foundations.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Mehdi Amini</li></ul><p>Flang did not stop there, later adding another dialect<a href="https://flang.llvm.org/docs/HighLevelFIR.html">&ldquo;High Level Fortran Intermediate Representation&rdquo;</a>(HLFIR) which works at a higher level than FIR. A big target of HLFIRwas array optimisations, that were more complex to handle using FIR alone.</p><blockquote><p>FIR was a compromise on both ends to some degree. It wasn&rsquo;t trying to capturesyntactic information from Fortran, and I assumed there would be work done onan Abstract Syntax Tree.

For instance, when you use the option <code>-march=armv8a+memtag</code>,something in Flang knows that you want to compile for Armv8.0-a with the MemoryTagging Extension enabled.</p><p><code>-march=</code> is an example of a &ldquo;compiler driver&rdquo; option. These options are what usersgive to the compiler. There is actually a second driver after this, confusinglycalled the &ldquo;frontend&rdquo; driver, despite being behind the scenes.</p><p>In Flang&rsquo;s case the &ldquo;compiler driver&rdquo; is <code>flang</code> and the &ldquo;frontend driver&rdquo; is<code>flang -fc1</code> (they are two separate tools, contained in the same binary).</p><p>They are separate tools so that the compiler driver can provide an interfacesuited to compiler users, with stable options that do not change over time.On the other hand, the frontend driver is suited to compiler developers, exposesinternal compiler details and does not have a stable set of options.</p><p>You can see the differences if you add <code>-###</code> to the compiler command:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ./bin/flang /tmp/test.f90 -march=armv8a+memtag -### &#34;&lt;...&gt;/flang&#34; &#34;-fc1&#34; &#34;-triple&#34; &#34;aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu&#34; &#34;-target-feature&#34; &#34;+v8a&#34; &#34;-target-feature&#34; &#34;+mte&#34; &#34;/usr/bin/ld&#34; \ &#34;-o&#34; &#34;a.out&#34; &#34;-L/usr/lib/gcc/aarch64-linux-gnu/11&#34;</code></pre><p>(output edited for readability)</p><p>The compiler driver has split the compilation into a job for the frontend(<code>flang -fc1</code>) and the linker (<code>ld</code>). <code>-march=</code> has been converted into manyarguments to <code>flang -fc1</code>. This means that if compiler developers decided tochange how <code>-march=</code> was converted, existing <code>flang</code> commands would still work.</p><p>Another responsibility of the compiler driver is to know where to find librariesand header files. This differs between operating systems and evendistributions of the same family of operating systems (for example Linuxdistributions).</p><p>This created a problem when implementing the compiler driver for Flang. All thesedetails would take a long time to get right.</p><p>Luckily, by this time Flang was in the LLVM Project alongside Clang.Clang already knew how to handle this and had been tested on all sorts ofsystems over many years.</p><blockquote><p>The intent is to mirror clang, for both the driver and CompilerInvocation, asmuch as makes sense to do so. The aim is to avoid re-inventing the wheel andto enable people who have worked with either the clang or flang entry points,drivers, and frontends to easily understand the other.</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-a-fortran-mode-to-the-clang-driver-for-flang/52307">Peter Waller</a> (Arm)</li></ul><p>Flang became the first in-tree project to use Clang&rsquo;s compiler driverlibrary (<code>clangDriver</code>) to implement its own compiler driver.</p><p>This meant that Flang was able to handle all the targets and tools that Clangcould, without duplicating large amounts of code.</p><h1 id="reflections-on-flang">Reflections on Flang</h1><p>We are almost 10 years from the first announcement of what would become LLVMFlang.

## llm-openrouter 0.4

date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/releases/tag/0.4">llm-openrouter 0.4</a></strong></p>
I found out this morning that <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a> include support for a number of (rate-limited) <a href="https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0">free API models</a>.</p>
<p>I occasionally run workshops on top of LLMs (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/cutting-edge-web-scraping/">like this one</a>) and being able to provide students with a quick way to obtain an API key against models where they don't have to setup billing is really valuable to me!</p>
<p>This inspired me to upgrade my existing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin, and in doing so I closed out a bunch of open feature requests.</p>
<p>Consider this post the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/">annotated release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LLM <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html">schema support</a> for OpenRouter models that <a href="https://openrouter.ai/models?order=newest&amp;supported_parameters=structured_outputs">support structured output</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/23">#23</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to get support for LLM's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/">new schema feature</a> into as many plugins as possible.</p>
<p>OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible API includes support for the <code>response_format</code> <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/structured-outputs">structured content option</a>, but with an important caveat: it only works for some models, and if you try to use it on others it is silently ignored.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/openrouter-examples/issues/20">filed an issue</a> with OpenRouter requesting they include schema support in their machine-readable model index. For the moment LLM will let you specify schemas for unsupported models and will ignore them entirely, which isn't ideal.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm openrouter key</code> command displays information about your current API key. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/24">#24</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Useful for debugging and checking the details of your key's rate limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm -m ... -o online 1</code> enables <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/web-search">web search grounding</a> against any model, powered by <a href="https://exa.ai/">Exa</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/25">#25</a></li>
</ul>

<p>OpenRouter apparently make this feature available to every one of their supported models! They're using new-to-me <a href="https://exa.ai/">Exa</a> to power this feature, an AI-focused search engine startup who appear to have built their own index with their own crawlers (according to <a href="https://docs.exa.ai/reference/faqs#how-often-is-the-index-updated">their FAQ</a>). This feature is currently priced by OpenRouter at $4 per 1000 results, and since 5 results are returned for every prompt that's 2 cents per prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>llm openrouter models</code> command for listing details of the OpenRouter models, including a <code>--json</code> option to get JSON and a <code>--free</code> option to filter for just the free models. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/26">#26</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This offers a neat way to list the available models. There are examples of the output <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/26#issuecomment-2711908704">in the comments on the issue</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New option to specify custom provider routing: <code>-o provider '{JSON here}'</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter/issues/17">#17</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of OpenRouter's USP is that it can route prompts to different providers depending on factors like latency, cost or as a fallback if your first choice is unavailable - great for if you are using open weight models like Llama which are hosted by competing companies.</p>
<p>The options they provide for routing are <a href="https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/provider-routing">very thorough</a> - I had initially hoped to provide a set of CLI options that covered all of these bases, but I decided instead to reuse their JSON format and forward those options directly on to the model.

## Building Websites With Lots of Little HTML Pages

date: 2025-03-10, updated: 2025-03-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/lots-of-little-html-pages/">Building Websites With Lots of Little HTML Pages</a></strong></p>
Jim Nielsen coins a confusing new acronym - LLMS for (L)ots of (L)ittle ht(M)l page(S). He's using this to describe his latest site refresh which makes extensive use of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document">cross-document view transitions</a> - a fabulous new progressive enhancement CSS technique that's <a href="https://caniuse.com/view-transitions">supported</a> in Chrome and Safari (and hopefully soon <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1823896">in Firefox</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With cross-document view transitions getting broader and broader support, I’m realizing that building in-page, progressively-enhanced interactions is more work than simply building two HTML pages and linking them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim now has small static pages powering his home page filtering interface and even his navigation menu, with CSS view transitions configured to smoothly animate between the pages. I think it feels really good - here's what it looked like for me in Chrome (it looked the same both with and without JavaScript disabled):</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo - clicking the tabs to swap between Latest, Trending and Hacker News Hits rearranges the list of posts in a smooth animation, then navigating to a post causes its title to enlarge and move to the top while the rest of the article loads in." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llms-demo.gif" /></p>
<p>Watching the network panel in my browser, most of these pages are 17-20KB gzipped (~45KB after they've decompressed). No wonder it feels so snappy.</p>
<p>I poked around <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/styles.css">in Jim's CSS</a> and found this relevant code:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-css"><pre><span class="pl-k">@view-transition</span> {
  <span class="pl-c1">navigation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> auto;
}

.<span class="pl-c1">posts-nav</span> <span class="pl-ent">a</span>[<span class="pl-c1">aria-current</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"page"</span>]<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">not</span>(<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">last-child</span>)<span class="pl-kos">:</span><span class="pl-c1">after</span> {

}

<span class="pl-c">/* New stuff coming in */</span>
::<span class="pl-c1">view-transition-new</span>(<span class="pl-ent">posts-nav</span>) {
  <span class="pl-c1">animation</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> fade <span class="pl-c1">0.3<span class="pl-smi">s</span></span> linear reverse;

    <span class="pl-c1">opacity</span><span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">0</span>;
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Jim observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This really feels like a game-changer for simple sites. If you can keep your site simple, it’s easier to build traditional, JavaScript-powered on-page interactions as small, linked HTML pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've experimented with view transitions for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> in the past and the results were very promising. Maybe I'll pick that up again.</p>
<p>Bonus: Jim has a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/csr4mw/building_websites_with_lots_little_html#c_ncxssq">clever JavaScript trick</a> to avoid clicks to the navigation menu being added to the browser's history in the default case.

<p><strong><a href="https://wolf-h3-viewer.glitch.me/">wolf-h3-viewer.glitch.me</a></strong></p>
Neat interactive visualization of Uber's <a href="https://h3geo.org/">H3</a> hexagonal geographical indexing mechanism.</p>
<p><img alt="Map showing H3 geospatial index hexagons overlaid on the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Various H3 cell IDs are displayed including &quot;852621b3fffffff&quot;, &quot;852621a7fffffff&quot;, &quot;8527526fffffff&quot;, &quot;85262cd3fffffff&quot;, and &quot;85262c83fffffff&quot;. A sidebar shows input fields for &quot;lat,lon&quot; with a &quot;Go&quot; button and &quot;valid H3 id&quot; with a &quot;Find&quot; button. Text indicates &quot;Current H3 resolution: 5&quot; and &quot;Tip: Clicking an H3 cell will copy its id to the clipboard.&quot; Map attribution shows &quot;Leaflet | © OpenStreetMap contributors&quot;." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/h3-map.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/clupasq/h3-viewer">the source code</a>.</p>
<p>Why does H3 use hexagons? Because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">Hexagons are the Bestagons</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When hexagons come together, they form three-sided joints 120 degrees apart. This, for the least material, is the most mechanically stable arrangement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only triangles, squares, and hexagons can tile a plane without gaps, and of those three shapes hexagons offer the best ratio of perimeter to area.

## Everything To Everyone

date: 2025-03-09, updated: 2025-03-09, from: Tedium site

Companies like Amazon and Apple are attempting to do business in so many spaces that, when the cracks show, they really show. Hence why Apple Intelligence looks like a hot mess right now.
