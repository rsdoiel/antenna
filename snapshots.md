## New White Paper on Federal Public Access Policies

date: 2025-03-20, from: Authors Union blogs

Authors Alliance and SPARC have released the first of four planned white papers addressing legal issues surrounding open access to scholarly publications under the 2022 OSTP memo (the ‚ÄúNelson Memo‚Äù). The white papers are part of a larger project (described here) to support legal pathways to open access. This first paper discussed the ‚ÄúFederal Purpose [&#8230;]

## Calling a wrap on my weeknotes

date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>After <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">192 posts</a> that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I've decided to call a wrap on my weeknotes habit. The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/13/weeknotestwitter-sqlite-datasette-rure/">original goal</a> was to stay transparent during my 2019-2020 JSK fellowship, and I kept them up after that as an accountability mechanism and to get into a habit of writing regularly.</p>
<p>Over the past two years I've adopted new posting habits which are solving those problems in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I post something here almost every day. I actually maintained a daily posting streak throughout 2024, which I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/">ended in January</a>, but I'm still posting most days and plan to keep that up.</li>
<li>Every time I ship a new release of one of my projects I link to it from here. This replaces the "recent releases" section of my weeknotes.</li>
<li>I try to have a longer form piece of writing that's suitable for inclusion in <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> at least once every two weeks. That's another accountability mechanism that's working well for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>One downside of weeknotes is that I'd sometimes save something to include in them, which could lead to several items getting bundled together in a way that reduced their potential impact as standalone posts.</p>
<p>I got to the point with weeknotes where I was feeling guilty about not keeping them up. Given the volume of content I'm publishing already that felt like a sign that they were no longer providing the value they once did!</p>
<p>I still think weeknotes are an excellent habit for anyone who wants to write more frequently and be more transparent about their work. It feels healthy to be able to end a habit that's finished serving its purpose.</p>

## OpenAI platform: o1-pro

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1-pro">OpenAI platform: o1-pro</a></strong></p>
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!</p>
<p>Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token context window, 100,000 max output tokens, Sep 30 2023 knowledge cut-off date and it supports function calling, structured outputs and image inputs.</p>
<p>o1-pro doesn't support streaming, and most significantly for developers is the first OpenAI model to <em>only</em> be available via their new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses">Responses API</a>. This means tools that are built against their Chat Completions API (like my own <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) have to do a whole lot more work to support the new model - my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/839">issue for that is here</a>.</p>
<p>Since LLM doesn't support this new model yet I had to make do with <code>curl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0439d0255360c68b8f621133860710b1">the full JSON</a> I got back - 81 input tokens and 1552 output tokens for a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">total cost</a> of 94.335 cents.</p>
<p><img alt="Clearly a bird riding a bicycle. The pedals are in the wrong place and the bird doesn't quite have the majestic beak of a pelican." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o1-pro-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>I took a risk and added <code>"reasoning": {"effort": "high"}</code> to see if I could get a better pelican with more reasoning:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>Surprisingly that used <em>less</em> output tokens - 1459 compared to 1552 earlier (cost: 88.755 cents) - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/085d81e1160157572c9bd361b01374c4">producing this JSON</a> which rendered as a slightly better pelican:</p>
<p><img alt="A bit better - no pedals, so they cannot be in the wrong place. The bird has a slightly more majestic beak." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o1-pro-high-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>It was cheaper because while it spent 960 reasoning tokens as opposed to 704 for the previous pelican it omitted the explanatory text around the SVG, saving on total output.

## Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks)

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong>Vibe coding</strong> is having a moment. The term <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">was coined by Andrej Karpathy</a> just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and has since been featured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/personaltech/vibecoding-ai-software-programming.html">in the New York Times</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/ai-software-coding-programmer-expertise-jobs-threat">the Guardian</a> and countless online discussions.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that the definition is already escaping its original intent. I'm seeing people apply the term "vibe coding" to all forms of code written with the assistance of AI. I think that both dilutes the term and gives a false impression of what's possible with responsible <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted programming</a>.</p>
<p>Vibe coding is <em>not</em> the same thing as writing code with the help of LLMs!</p>
<p>To quote Andrej's <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original tweet</a> in full (with my emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and <strong>forget that the code even exists</strong>. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.</p>
<p>I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.</p>
<p><strong>It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing</strong>. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <em>love</em> this definition. Andrej is an extremely talented and experienced programmer - he has no need for AI assistance at all. He's using LLMs like this because it's fun to try out wild new ideas, and the speed at which an LLM can produce code is an order of magnitude faster than even the most skilled human programmers. For low stakes projects and prototypes why not just <em>let it rip</em>?</p>

<p>When I talk about vibe coding I mean <strong>building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="using-llms-for-code-responsibly-is-not-vibe-coding">Using LLMs for code responsibly is not vibe coding</h4>
<p>Let's contrast this "forget that the code even exists" approach to how professional software developers use LLMs.</p>
<p>The job of a software developer is not (just) to churn out code and features. We need to create code that demonstrably works, and can be understood by other humans (and machines), and that will support continued development in the future.</p>
<p>We need to consider performance, accessibility, security, maintainability, cost efficiency. Software engineering is all about trade-offs - our job is to pick from dozens of potential solutions by balancing all manner of requirements, both explicit and implied.</p>
<p>We also <em>need</em> to read the code. My golden rule for production-quality AI-assisted programming is that I won't commit any code to my repository if I couldn't explain exactly what it does to somebody else.</p>
<p>If an LLM wrote the code for you, and you then reviewed it, tested it thoroughly and made sure you could explain how it works to someone else that's not vibe coding, it's software development. The usage of an LLM to support that activity is immaterial.</p>
<p>I wrote extensively about my own process in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">Here‚Äôs how I use LLMs to help me write code</a>. Vibe coding only describes a small subset of my approach.</p>
<h4 id="let-s-not-lose-track-of-what-makes-vibe-coding-special">Let's not lose track of what makes vibe coding special</h4>
<p>I don't want "vibe coding" to become a negative term that's synonymous with irresponsible AI-assisted programming either. This weird new shape of programming has so much to offer the world!</p>
<p>I believe <strong>everyone deserves the ability</strong> to automate tedious tasks in their lives with computers. You shouldn't need a computer science degree or programming bootcamp in order to get computers to do extremely specific tasks for you.</p>
<p>If vibe coding grants millions of new people the ability to build their own custom tools, I could not be happier about it.</p>
<p>Some of those people will get bitten by the programming bug and go on to become proficient software developers. One of the biggest barriers to that profession is the incredibly steep initial learning curve - vibe coding shaves that initial barrier down to almost flat.</p>
<p>Vibe coding also has a ton to offer experienced developers. I've talked before about how <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">using LLMs for code is difficult</a> - figuring out what does and doesn't work is a case of building intuition over time, and there are plenty of hidden sharp edges and traps along the way.</p>
<p>I think vibe coding is the best tool we have to help experienced developers build that intuition as to what LLMs can and cannot do for them. I've published more than <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">80 experiments</a> I built with vibe coding and I've learned so much along the way. I would encourage any other developer, no matter their skill level, to try the same.</p>
<h4 id="when-is-it-ok-to-vibe-code-">When is it OK to vibe code?</h4>
<p>If you're an experienced engineer this is likely obvious to you already, so I'm writing this section for people who are just getting started building software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects should be <strong>low stakes</strong>. Think about how much harm the code you are writing could cause if it has bugs or security vulnerabilities. Could somebody be harmed - damaged reputation, lost money or something worse? This is particularly important if you plan to build software that will be used by other people!</li>
<li>Consider <strong>security</strong>. This is a really difficult one - security is a huge topic. Some high level notes:
<ul>
<li>Watch out for <strong>secrets</strong> - anything that looks similar in shape to a password, such as the API key used to access an online tool. If your code involves secrets you need to take care not to accidentally expose them, which means you need to understand how the code works!</li>
<li>Think about <strong>data privacy</strong>. If you are building a tool that has access to private data - anything you wouldn't want to display to the world in a screen-sharing session - approach with caution. It's possible to vibe code personal tools that you paste private information into but you need to be very sure you understand if there are ways that data might leave your machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be a <strong>good network citizen</strong>. Anything that makes requests out to other platforms could increase the load (and hence the cost) on those services. This is a reason I like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">Claude Artifacts</a> - their sandbox prevents accidents from causing harm elsewhere.</li>
<li>Is <strong>your money on the line</strong>? I've seen horror stories about people who vibe coded a feature against some API without a billing limit and racked up thousands of dollars in charges. Be very careful about using vibe coding against anything that's charged based on usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're going to vibe code anything that might be used by other people, I recommend checking in with someone more experienced for a vibe check (hah) before you share it with the world.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-make-vibe-coding-better-">How do we make vibe coding better?</h4>
<p>I think there are some fascinating software design challenges to be solved here.</p>
<p>Safe vibe coding for complete beginners starts with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>. Claude Artifacts was one of the first widely available vibe coding platforms and their approach to sandboxing is fantastic: code is restricted to running in a locked down <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, can load only approved libraries and can't make any network requests to other sites.</p>
<p>This makes it very difficult for people to mess up and cause any harm with their projects. It also greatly limits what those projects can do - you can't use a Claude Artifact project to access data from external APIs for example, or even to build software that runs your own prompts against an LLM.</p>
<p>Other popular vibe coding tools like Cursor (which was initially intended for professional developers) have far less safety rails.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room for innovation in this space. I'm hoping to see a cambrian explosion in tooling to help people build their own custom tools as productively and safely as possible.</p>
<h4 id="go-forth-and-vibe-code">Go forth and vibe code</h4>
<p>I really don't want to discourage people who are new to software from trying out vibe coding. The best way to learn anything is to build a project!</p>
<p>For experienced programmers this is an amazing way to start developing an intuition for what LLMs can and can't do. For beginners there's no better way to open your eyes to what's possible to achieve with code itself.</p>
<p>But please, don't confuse vibe coding with all other uses of LLMs for code.</p>

## My Thoughts on the Future of "AI"

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/thoughts-on-future-ai.html">My Thoughts on the Future of &quot;AI&quot;</a></strong></p>
Nicholas Carlini, previously deeply skeptical about the utility of LLMs, discusses at length his thoughts on where the technology might go.</p>
<p>He presents compelling, detailed arguments for both ends of the spectrum - his key message is that it's best to maintain very wide error bars for what might happen next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if, in three to five years, language models are capable of performing most (all?) cognitive economically-useful tasks beyond the level of human experts. And I also wouldn't be surprised if, in five years, the best models we have are better than the ones we have today, but only in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ways where costs continue to decrease considerably and capabilities continue to get better but there's no fundamental paradigm shift that upends the world order. To deny the <em>potential</em> for either of these possibilities seems to me to be a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If LLMs do hit a wall, it's not at all clear what that wall might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still believe there is something fundamental that will get in the way of our ability to build LLMs that grow exponentially in capability. But I will freely admit to you now that I have no earthly idea what that limitation will be. I have no evidence that this line exists, other than to make some form of vague argument that when you try and scale something across many orders of magnitude, you'll probably run into problems you didn't see coming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's lots of great stuff in here. I particularly liked this explanation of how you get R1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You take DeepSeek v3, and ask it to solve a bunch of hard problems, and when it gets the answers right, you train it to do more of that and less of whatever it did when it got the answers wrong. The idea here is actually really simple, and it works surprisingly well.</p>
</blockquote>

## OpenTimes

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://sno.ws/opentimes/">OpenTimes</a></strong></p>
Spectacular new open geospatial project by <a href="https://sno.ws/">Dan Snow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenTimes is a database of pre-computed, point-to-point travel times between United States Census geographies. It lets you download bulk travel time data for free and with no limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://opentimes.org/?id=060816135022&amp;mode=car#9.76/37.5566/-122.3085">what I get</a> for travel times by car from El Granada, California:</p>
<p><img alt="Isochrone map showing driving times from the El Granada census tract to other places in the San Francisco Bay Area" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opentimes.jpg" /></p>
<p>The technical details are <em>fascinating</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The entire OpenTimes backend is just static Parquet files on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/">Cloudflare's R2</a>. There's no RDBMS or running service, just files and a CDN. The whole thing costs about $10/month to host and costs nothing to serve. In my opinion, this is a <em>great</em> way to serve infrequently updated, large public datasets at low cost (as long as you partition the files correctly).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">R2 pricing</a> charges "based on the total volume of data stored" - $0.015 / GB-month for standard storage, then $0.36 / million requests for "Class B" operations which include reads. They charge nothing for outbound bandwidth.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All travel times were calculated by pre-building the inputs (OSM, OSRM networks) and then distributing the compute over <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/workflows/calculate-times.yaml">hundreds of GitHub Actions jobs</a>. This worked shockingly well for this specific workload (and was also completely free).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/runs/13094249792">GitHub Actions run</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/a6a5f7abcdd69559b3e29f360fe0ff0399dbb400/.github/workflows/calculate-times.yaml#L78-L80">calculate-times.yaml workflow</a> which uses a matrix to run 255 jobs!</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Actions run: calculate-times.yaml run by workflow_dispatch taking 1h49m to execute 255 jobs with names like run-job (2020-01) " src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opentimes-github-actions.jpg" /></p>
<p>Relevant YAML:</p>
<pre><code>  matrix:
    year: ${{ fromJSON(needs.setup-jobs.outputs.years) }}
    state: ${{ fromJSON(needs.setup-jobs.outputs.states) }}
</code></pre>
<p>Where those JSON files were created by the previous step, which reads in the year and state values from <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/a6a5f7abcdd69559b3e29f360fe0ff0399dbb400/data/params.yaml#L72-L132">this params.yaml file</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The query layer uses a single DuckDB database file with <em>views</em> that point to static Parquet files via HTTP. This lets you query a table with hundreds of billions of records after downloading just the ~5MB pointer file.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really creative use of DuckDB's feature that lets you run queries against large data from a laptop using HTTP range queries to avoid downloading the whole thing.</p>
<p>The README shows <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/3439fa2c54af227e40997b4a5f55678739e0f6df/README.md#using-duckdb">how to use that from R and Python</a> - I got this working in the <code>duckdb</code> client (<code>brew install duckdb</code>):</p>
<pre><code>INSTALL httpfs;
LOAD httpfs;
ATTACH 'https://data.opentimes.org/databases/0.0.1.duckdb' AS opentimes;

SELECT origin_id, destination_id, duration_sec
  FROM opentimes.public.times
  WHERE version = '0.0.1'
      AND mode = 'car'
      AND year = '2024'
      AND geography = 'tract'
      AND state = '17'
      AND origin_id LIKE '17031%' limit 10;
</code></pre>
<p>In answer to a question about adding public transit times <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392521#43393183">Dan said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next year or so maybe. The biggest obstacles to adding public transit are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting all the necessary scheduling data (e.g. GTFS feeds) for every transit system in the county. Not insurmountable since there are services that do this currently.</li>
<li>Finding a routing engine that can compute nation-scale travel time matrices quickly. Currently, the two fastest open-source engines I've tried (OSRM and Valhalla) don't support public transit for matrix calculations and the engines that do support public transit (R5, OpenTripPlanner, etc.) are too slow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gtfs.org/">GTFS</a> is a popular CSV-based format for sharing transit schedules - here's <a href="https://gtfs.org/resources/data/">an official list</a> of available feed directories.

## Mistral Small 3.1

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-small-3-1">Mistral Small 3.1</a></strong></p>
Mistral Small 3 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">came out in January</a> and was a notable, genuinely excellent local model that used an Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<p>Mistral Small 3.1 offers a significant improvement: it's multi-modal (images) and has an increased 128,000 token context length, while still "fitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized" (according to their <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503">model card</a>). Mistral's own benchmarks show it outperforming Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, but I haven't seen confirmation from external benchmarks.</p>
<p>Despite their mention of a 32GB MacBook I haven't actually seen any quantized GGUF or MLX releases yet, which is a little surprising since they partnered with Ollama on launch day for their previous Mistral Small 3. I expect we'll see various quantized models released by the community shortly.</p>
<p>The model <em>is</em> available via their <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">La Plateforme API</a>, which means you can access it via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> plugin.</p>

<p>The image depicts two brown pelicans in flight against a clear blue sky. Pelicans are large water birds known for their long bills and large throat pouches, which they use for catching fish. The birds in the image have long, pointed wings and are soaring gracefully. Their bodies are streamlined, and their heads and necks are elongated. The pelicans appear to be in mid-flight, possibly gliding or searching for food. The clear blue sky in the background provides a stark contrast, highlighting the birds' silhouettes and making them stand out prominently.</p>

## Episode 153 - The Keypact Mystery

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">When I was down at VCF SoCal I ran into a strange machine: the Keypact Micro-VIP. It's a terminal without a keyboard, covered in dials, with a speaker and a switch labeled "voice". This chance encounter with the unknown sent me down a wild path. It involved the creeping spread of computing, chicken feed, door to door life insurance salesmen, and at least one early hacker.</p>

## Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380129">Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</a></strong></p>
My TIL about <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a> (here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/side-panel-dialog">interactive demo</a>) showed up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225">on Hacker News</a> this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being surprisingly widely used.</p>
<p>The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).</p>
<p>Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add "overflow:auto", and some form of "max-height"/"max-width" to ensure that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.</p>
<p>The better solution to this was to add "max-height:stretch", "max-width:stretch". You can see <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r513642207">the discussion for this here</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the "stretch" keyword. (Blink <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2nDt3B9E/m/kP_rKOaDAgAJ?pli=1">likely will "soon"</a>)</p>
<p>However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a specification - and nobody implemented it ("-webit-fill-available" would have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn't have this working the same yet).</p>
<p>Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of "box-sizing:content-box" being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that we didn't want to touch). [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this insight into the challenges of evolving the standards that underlie the web, even for something this small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably worse not to have done anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from the comments I learned that Firefox DevTools <em>can</em> show you user-agent styles, but that option is turned off by default - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-update-firefox-can-show-browser-styles">notes on that here</a>. Once I turned this option on I saw references to an <code>html.css</code> stylesheet, so I dug around and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/res/html.css">found that in the Firefox source code</a>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commits/HEAD/layout/style/res/html.css">the commit history</a> for that file on the official GitHub mirror, which provides a detailed history of how Firefox default HTML styles have evolved with the standards over time.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380255">via uallo</a> here are the same default HTML styles for other browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chromium: <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css">third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css</a></li>

There was a time, 1999 specifically, when writing for the web in a web browser was a strange and new idea. That era lasted until 2006 when Twitter emerged, removing almost all the features of writing and adding character limits. That had enormous impact on the political and creative worlds. The era of wood chipping people and ideas.

## mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit">mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</a></strong></p>
OLMo 2 32B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/ai2/">claims to be</a> "the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini". Thanks to the MLX project here's a recipe that worked for me to run it on my Mac, via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin.</p>
<p>To install the model:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>That downloads 17GB to <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</code>.</p>
<p>To start an interactive chat with OLMo 2:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>Or to run a prompt:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o unlimited 1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn't enough to attempt to draw a pelican.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53f00731d494439d4aeca6bdd55368ca">pelican it drew</a> is refreshingly abstract:</p>
