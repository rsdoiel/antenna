In 2023 the FBI quietly arrested a notorious money launderer called ElonmuskWHM. Then the FBI secretly ran his operation for nearly a year to catch (and give money to) more criminals.

## Seniors and Juniors

date: 2025-04-08, from: O'Reilly Radar

It almost sounds pejorative, doesn’t it? But the distinction between senior and junior software developers is built into our jobs and job titles. Whether we call it entry-level or something else, we distinguish between people who are just starting their careers and those who have been around for a while. We’re all still learning (one [&#8230;]

## Quoting lmarena.ai

## llm-hacker-news

date: 2025-04-08, updated: 2025-04-08, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news">llm-hacker-news</a></strong></p>
I built this new plugin to exercise the new <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#register-fragment-loaders-register">register_fragment_loaders()</a> plugin hook I added to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/">LLM 0.24</a>. It's the plugin equivalent of <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes">the Bash script</a> I've been using to summarize <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> conversations for the past 18 months.</p>
<p>You can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-hacker-news
llm -f hn:43615912 'summary with illustrative direct quotes'
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the output <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/issues/1#issuecomment-2784887743">in this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The plugin registers a <code>hn:</code> prefix - combine that with the ID of a Hacker News conversation to pull that conversation into the context.</p>
<p>It uses the Algolia Hacker News API which returns <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/43615912">JSON like this</a>. Rather than feed the JSON directly to the LLM it instead converts it to a hopefully more LLM-friendly format that looks like this example from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/blob/0.1/tests/test_hacker_news.py#L5-L18">the plugin's test</a>:</p>
<pre><code>[1] BeakMaster: Fish Spotting Techniques

[1.1] CoastalFlyer: The dive technique works best when hunting in shallow waters.

[1.1.1] PouchBill: Agreed. Have you tried the hover method near the pier?

[1.1.2] WingSpan22: My bill gets too wet with that approach.

[1.1.2.1] CoastalFlyer: Try tilting at a 40° angle like our Australian cousins.

[1.2] BrownFeathers: Anyone spotted those "silver fish" near the rocks?

[1.2.1] GulfGlider: Yes! They're best caught at dawn.
Just remember: swoop &gt; grab &gt; lift
</code></pre>
<p>That format was suggested by Claude, which then wrote most of the plugin implementation for me. Here's <a href="https://claude.ai/share/6da6ec5a-b8b3-4572-ab1b-141bb37ef70b">that Claude transcript</a>.

<p>AI tools will allow the best to reach even greater heights, while enabling smaller teams to accomplish more, and  bring in some completely new creator demographics.</p>
<p>Yes, we will get to a world where you can get an interactive game (or novel, or movie) out of a prompt, but there will be far better exemplars of the medium still created by dedicated teams of passionate developers.</p>
<p>The world will be vastly wealthier in terms of the content available at any given cost.</p>
<p>Will there be more or less game developer jobs? That is an open question. It could go the way of farming, where labor saving technology allow a tiny fraction of the previous workforce to satisfy everyone, or it could be like social media, where creative entrepreneurship has flourished at many different scales. Regardless, “don’t use power tools because they take people’s jobs” is not a winning strategy.</p></blockquote>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install -U llm</pre></div>
<p>The biggest new feature is <strong><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/fragments.html">fragments</a></strong>. You can now use <code>-f filename</code> or <code>-f url</code> to add one or more fragments to your prompt, which means you can do things like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm -f https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/llama-4-notes/ <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>bullet point summary<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7ffb19f647603558c575359e678185c0">the output</a> from that prompt, exported using <code>llm logs -c --expand --usage</code>. Token cost was 5,372 input, 374 output which works out as 0.103 cents (around 1/10th of a cent) using the default GPT-4o mini model.</p>
<p>Plugins can implement custom fragment loaders with a prefix. The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github">llm-fragments-github</a> plugin adds a <code>github:</code> prefix that can be used to load every text file in a GitHub repository as a list of fragments:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-fragments-github
llm -f github:simonw/s3-credentials <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Suggest new features for this tool<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c9bbbc5f6560b01f4b7882ac0194fb25">the output</a>. That took 49,856 input tokens for a total cost of 0.7843 cents - nearly a whole cent!</p>
<h4 id="improving-llm-s-support-for-long-context-models">Improving LLM's support for long context models</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/long-context/">Long context</a></strong> is one of the most exciting trends in LLMs over the past eighteen months. Saturday's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/5/llama-4-notes/">Llama 4 Scout release</a> gave us the first model with a full 10 million token context. Google's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gemini/">Gemini</a> family has several 1-2 million token models, and the baseline for recent models from both OpenAI and Anthropic is 100 or 200 thousand.</p>
<p>Two years ago most models capped out at 8,000 tokens of input. Long context opens up many new interesting ways to apply this class of technology.</p>
<p>I've been using long context models via <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/files-to-prompt/">my files-to-prompt tool</a> to summarize large codebases, explain how they work and even to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/25/o1-preview-llm/">debug gnarly bugs</a>. As demonstrated above, it's surprisingly inexpensive to drop tens of thousands of tokens into  models like GPT-4o mini or most of the Google Gemini series, and the results are often very impressive.</p>
<p>One of LLM's most useful features is that it <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">logs every prompt and response</a> to a SQLite database. This is great for comparing the same prompt against different models and tracking experiments over time - my own database contained thousands of responses from hundreds of different models accumulated over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>This is where long context prompts were starting to be a problem. Since LLM stores the full prompt and response in the database, asking five questions of the same source code could result in five duplicate copies of that text in the database!</p>
<p>The new <strong>fragments</strong> feature targets this problem head on. Each fragment is stored once in a <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html#sql-schema">fragments</a> table, then de-duplicated in the future using a SHA256 hash of its content.</p>
<p>This saves on storage, and also enables features like <code>llm logs -f X</code> for seeing all logged responses <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html#filtering-by-prompts-that-used-a-specific-fragment">that use a particular fragment</a>.</p>
<p>Fragments can be specified in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>a path to a file</li>
<li>a URL to data online</li>
<li>an alias that's been set against a previous fragment (see <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/help.html#llm-fragments-set-help">llm fragments set</a>)</li>
<li>a hash ID of the content of a fragment</li>
<li>using <code>prefix:argument</code> to specify fragments from a plugin</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="asking-questions-of-llm-s-documentation">Asking questions of LLM's documentation</h4>
<p>Wouldn't it be neat if LLM could answer questions about its own documentation?</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-docs">llm-docs</a> plugin (built with the new <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#register-fragment-loaders-register">register_fragment_loaders() plugin hook</a>) enables exactly that:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-docs
llm -f docs: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>How do I embed a binary file?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/df115ffa63e101833a100f71555bf53d">output</a> starts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To embed a binary file using the LLM command-line interface, you can use the <code>llm embed</code> command with the <code>--binary</code> option. Here’s how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the appropriate embedding model installed that supports binary input.</li>
<li>Use the following command syntax:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm embed -m <span class="pl-k">&lt;</span>model_id<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> --binary -i <span class="pl-k">&lt;</span>path_to_your_binary_file<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;model_id&gt;</code> with the identifier for the embedding model you want to use (e.g., <code>clip</code> for the CLIP model) and <code>&lt;path_to_your_binary_file&gt;</code> with the path to your actual binary file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(74,570 input, 240 output = 1.1329 cents with GPT-4o mini)</p>
<p>Using <code>-f docs:</code> with just the prefix is the same as using <code>-f docs:llm</code>. The plugin fetches the documentation for your current version of LLM from my new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/docs-for-llms">simonw/docs-for-llms</a> repo, which also provides packaged documentation files for my <code>datasette</code>, <code>s3-credentials</code>, <code>shot-scraper</code> and <code>sqlite-utils</code> projects.</p>
<p>Datasette's documentation has got pretty long, so you might need to run that through a Gemini model instead (using the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini plugin</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm -f docs:datasette -m gemini-2.0-flash \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Build a render_cell plugin that detects and renders markdown<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f08b3832c379ca89d8cff3c61ec5662e">Here's the output</a>. 132,042 input, 1,129 output with Gemini 2.0 Flash = 1.3656 cents.</p>
<p>You can browse the combined documentation files this uses in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/docs-for-llms">docs-for-llm</a>. They're built using GitHub Actions.</p>
<p><a href="https://llmstxt.org/">llms-txt</a> is a project lead by Jeremy Howard that encourages projects to publish similar files to help LLMs ingest a succinct copy of their documentation.</p>
<h4 id="publishing-sharing-and-reusing-templates">Publishing, sharing and reusing templates</h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#register-template-loaders-register">register_template_loaders() plugin hook</a> allows plugins to register <code>prefix:value</code> custom template loaders, for use with the <code>llm -t</code> option.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates-github">llm-templates-github</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates-fabric">llm-templates-fabric</a> are two new plugins that make use of that hook.</p>
<p><code>llm-templates-github</code> lets you share and use templates via a public GitHub repository. Here's how to run my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">Pelican riding a bicycle</a> benchmark against a specific model:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-templates-github
llm -t gh:simonw/pelican-svg -m o3-mini</pre></div>
<p>This executes <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates/blob/main/pelican-svg.yaml">this pelican-svg.yaml</a> template stored in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates">simonw/llm-templates</a> repository, using a new repository naming convention.</p>
<p><code>llm -t gh:simonw/pelican-svg</code> will load that <code>pelican-svg.yaml</code> file from the <code>simonw/llm-templates</code> repo. You can also use <code>llm -t gh:simonw/name-of-repo/name-of-template</code> to load a template from a repository that doesn't follow that convention.</p>
<p>To share your own templates, create a repository on GitHub under your user account called <code>llm-templates</code> and start saving <code>.yaml</code> files to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates-fabric">llm-templates-fabric</a> provides a similar mechanism for loading templates from  Daniel Miessler's extensive <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric">fabric collection</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-templates-fabric
curl https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/6/only-miffy/ <span class="pl-k">|</span> \
  llm -t f:extract_main_idea</pre></div>
<p>A conversation with Daniel was the inspiration for this new plugin hook.</p>

<h4 id="template-and-fragment-loader-plugins">Template and fragment loader plugins so far</h4>
<p>Here's the list of fragment and template loader plugins so far from the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/directory.html#fragments-and-template-loaders">LLM plugins directory</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates-github">llm-templates-github</a></strong> supports loading templates shared on GitHub, e.g. <code>llm -t gh:simonw/pelican-svg</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-templates-fabric">llm-templates-fabric</a></strong> provides access to the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric">Fabric</a> collection of prompts: <code>cat setup.py | llm -t fabric:explain_code</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github">llm-fragments-github</a></strong> can load entire GitHub repositories in a single operation: <code>llm -f github:simonw/files-to-prompt 'explain this code'</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news">llm-hacker-news</a></strong> imports conversations from Hacker News as fragments: <code>llm -f hn:43615912 'summary with illustrative direct quotes'</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="everything-else-in-llm-0-24">Everything else in LLM 0.24</h4>
<p>LLM 0.24 is a big release, spanning <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/compare/0.23...0.24">51 commits</a>. The <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-24">release notes</a> cover everything that's new in full - here are a few of my highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin">llm-openai plugin</a> provides support for <strong>o1-pro</strong> (which is not supported by the OpenAI mechanism used by LLM core). Future OpenAI features will migrate to this plugin instead of LLM core itself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with OpenAI models being handled by LLM core is that I have to release a whole new version of LLM every time OpenAI releases a new model or feature. Migrating this stuff out to a plugin means I can release new version of that plugin independently of LLM itself - something I frequently do for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a> and others.</p>
<p>The new <code>llm-openai</code> plugin uses their Responses API, a new shape of API which <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/responses-vs-chat-completions/">I covered last month</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>llm -t $URL</code> option can now take a URL to a YAML template. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/856">#856</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The new custom template loaders are fun, but being able to paste in a URL to a YAML file somewhere provides a simpler way to share templates.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Templates can now store default model options. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/845">#845</a>
</li>
<li>Attachments can now be stored in templates. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/826">#826</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The quickest way to create your own template is with the <code>llm prompt ... --save name-of-template</code> command. This now works with attachments, fragments and default model options, each of which is persisted in <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html#templates-as-yaml-files">the template YAML file</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#setting-default-options-for-models">llm models options</a> family of commands for setting default options for particular models. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/829">#829</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I built this when I <a href="https://twitter.com/bindureddy/status/1900345517256958140">learned that</a> Qwen's QwQ-32b model works best with temperature 0.7 and top p 0.95.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>llm prompt -d path-to-sqlite.db</code> option can now be used to write logs to a custom SQLite database. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/858">#858</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This proved extremely useful for testing fragments - it meant I could run a prompt and save the full response to a separate SQLite database which I could then upload to S3 and share <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/863#issuecomment-2781723372">as a link to Datasette Lite</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>llm similar -p/--plain</code> option providing more human-readable output than the default JSON. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/853">#853</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like this to be the default output, but I'm holding off on changing that until LLM 1.0 since it's a breaking change for people building automations against the JSON from <code>llm similar</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Set the <code>LLM_RAISE_ERRORS=1</code> environment variable to raise errors during prompts rather than suppressing them, which means you can run <code>python -i -m llm 'prompt'</code> and then drop into a debugger on errors with <code>import pdb; pdb.pm()</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/817">#817</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really useful for debugging new model plugins.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>llm prompt -q gpt -q 4o</code> option - pass <code>-q searchterm</code> one or more times to execute a prompt against the first model that matches all of those strings - useful for if you can't remember the full model ID. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/841">#841</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty obscure but I found myself needing this. Vendors love releasing models with names like <code>gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25</code>, now I can run <code>llm -q gem -q 2.5 -q exp 'say hi'</code> to save me from looking up the model ID.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/other-models.html#openai-compatible-models">OpenAI compatible models</a> configured using <code>extra-openai-models.yaml</code> now support <code>supports_schema: true</code>, <code>vision: true</code> and <code>audio: true</code> options. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/adaitche">@adaitche</a> and <a href="https://github.com/giuli007">@giuli007</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/819">#819</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/843">#843</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't use this feature myself but it's clearly popular, this isn't the first time I'e had PRs with improvements from the wider community.</p>

## Quoting Andriy Burkov

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/burkov/status/1908961952141091196"><p>[...] The disappointing releases of both GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 have shown that if you don't train a model to reason with reinforcement learning, increasing its size no longer provides benefits.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning is limited only to domains where a reward can be assigned to the generation result. Until recently, these domains were math, logic, and code. Recently, these domains have also included factual question answering, where, to find an answer, the model must learn to execute several searches. This is how these "deep search" models have likely been trained.</p>
<p>If your business idea isn't in these domains, now is the time to start building your business-specific dataset. The potential increase in generalist models' skills will no longer be a threat.</p></blockquote>

## Note on 6th April 2025

date: 2025-04-06, updated: 2025-04-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>Some friends are traveling to Japan, and in bombarding them with unsolicited tips to try to convince them to visit <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huis_Ten_Bosch_(theme_park)">Huis Ten Bosch</a> - the Dutch theme park near Nagasaki - I was reminded of my all-time favorite piece of travel writing, by Richard Hendy: <strong><a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now/">Huis ten Bosch: Only Miffy can save us now</a></strong> - also <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now-2/">part two</a> and <a href="https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/huis-ten-bosch-only-miffy-can-save-us-now-3/">part three</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monumental in its conception, extravagant in its execution, and epic in its failure, Huis ten Bosch is the greatest by far of all of the progeny of Japan’s Bubble era dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so much good stuff in these essays, including a delightful divergence to cover the psychic toad that ended up responsible for more than $10 billion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] late at night scores of black limousines would park up outside one of her restaurants, Egawa, disgorging bankers for séances, inspired by esoteric mikkyo Buddhism, on the fourth floor, overseen by a giant ceramic toad standing a meter tall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard's essays convinced us to visit Huis Ten Bosch in 2014 and it was a highlight of our trip to Japan.
