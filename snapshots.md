**@Feed for Alt USDS** (date: 2025-04-25, from: Feed for Alt USDS)

Crisis fatigue is real. I'm taking the weekend off for some self care. 

But don't worry, my buddy @alt-doge.bsky.social is ready to fill in. Fresh off some close encounters of the DOGE kind, they got you!

And don't forget the #altgov #altfam too!

## I wrote to the address in the GPLv2 license notice and received the GPLv3 license

date: 2025-04-25, updated: 2025-04-25, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://code.mendhak.com/gpl-v2-address-letter/">I wrote to the address in the GPLv2 license notice and received the GPLv3 license</a></strong></p>
Fun story from Mendhak who noticed that the GPLv2 license <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120105022925/https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html">used to include</a> this in the footer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they wrote to the address (after hunting down the necessary pieces for a self-addressed envelope from the USA back to the UK) and five weeks later received a copy.</p>
<p>(The copy was the GPLv3, but since they didn't actually specify GPLv2 in their request I don't think that's particularly notable.)</p>
<p>The comments on Hacker News included <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43781888#43784538">this delightful note</a> from Davis Remmel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is funny because I was the operations assistant (office secretary) at the time we received this letter, and I remember it because of the distinct postage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone asked "How many per day were you sending out?". <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43781888#43785749">The answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On average, zero per day, maybe 5 to 10 per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FSF moved out of 51 Franklin Street in 2024, <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/fsf-office-closing-party">after 19 years in that location</a>. They work remotely now - their <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/contact/mailing">new mailing address</a>, 31 Milk Street, # 960789, Boston, MA 02196, is a <a href="https://tools.usps.com/locations/details/1441502">USPS PO Box</a>.

## Untangling the Reach of US Companies

date: 2025-04-25, from: Stephen Smith's blog

Introduction Trump continues to threaten Canada with a takeover, so people continue to boycott US companies and products as much as possible. Choosing Canadian apples over US apples, Mexican packaged salads over US packaged salads, going to a local coffee shop rather than Starbucks are all easy things to do. In this article we’ll look [&#8230;]

## The Subjective Charms of Objective-C

date: 2025-04-25, from: Michael Tsai

Gabriel Nicholas: To argue that Objective-C resembles a metaphysically divine language, or even a good language, is like saying Shakespeare is best appreciated in pig latin.

## Introducing Datasette for Newsrooms

date: 2025-04-24, updated: 2025-04-24, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/2025/datasette-for-newsrooms/">Introducing Datasette for Newsrooms</a></strong></p>
We're introducing a new product suite today called <strong>Datasette for Newsrooms</strong> - a bundled collection of Datasette Cloud features built specifically for investigative journalists and data teams. We're describing it as an all-in-one data store, search engine, and collaboration platform designed to make working with data in a newsroom easier, faster, and more transparent.</p>
<p>If your newsroom could benefit from a managed version of <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> we would <em>love</em> to hear from you. We're offering it to nonprofit newsrooms for free for the first year (they can pay us in feedback), and we have a two month trial for everyone else.</p>
<p>Get in touch at <code>hello@datasette.cloud</code> if you'd like to try it out.</p>
<p>One crucial detail: we will <strong>help you get started</strong> - we'll load data into your instance for you (you get some free data engineering!) and walk you through how to use it, and we will eagerly consume any feedback you have for us and prioritize shipping anything that helps you use the tool. Our unofficial goal: we want someone to win a Pulitzer for investigative reporting where our tool played a tiny part in their reporting process.</p>
<p>Here's an animated GIF demo (taken from our new <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/newsrooms/">Newsrooms landing page</a>) of my favorite recent feature: the ability to extract structured data into a table starting with an unstructured PDF,  using the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-extract">datasette-extract</a> plugin.</p>
<p><img src="https://datasette-cloud-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/newsrooms/datasette-extract.gif" alt="Animated demo. Starts with a PDF file of the San Francisco Planning Commission, which includes a table of data of members and their term ending dates. Switches to a Datasette Cloud with an interface for creating a table - the table is called planning_commission and has Seat Number (integer), Appointing Authority, Seat Holder and Term Ending columns - Term Ending has a hint of YYYY-MM-DD. The PDF is dropped onto the interface and the Extract button is clicked - this causes a loading spinner while the rows are extracted one by one as JSON, then the page refreshes as a table view showing the imported structured data." style="max-width: 100%" />

## OpenAI: Introducing our latest image generation model in the API

date: 2025-04-24, updated: 2025-04-24, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/image-generation-api/">OpenAI: Introducing our latest image generation model in the API</a></strong></p>
The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/introducing-4o-image-generation/">astonishing native image generation capability</a> of GPT-4o - a feature which continues to not have an obvious name - is now available via OpenAI's API.</p>
<p>It's quite expensive. OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">estimates</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Image outputs cost approximately $0.01 (low), $0.04 (medium), and $0.17 (high) for square images</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this is a true multi-modal model capability - the images are created using a GPT-4o variant, which can now output text, audio and images - I had expected this to come as part of their chat completions or responses API. Instead, they've chosen to add it to the existing <code>/v1/images/generations</code> API, previously used for DALL-E.</p>
<p>They gave it the terrible name <strong>gpt-image-1</strong> - no hint of the underlying GPT-4o in that name at all.</p>
<p>I'm contemplating adding support for it as a custom LLM subcommand via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin">llm-openai plugin</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin/issues/18">issue #18</a> in that repo.

## Exploring Promptfoo via Dave Guarino's SNAP evals

date: 2025-04-24, updated: 2025-04-24, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>I used <a href="https://www.propel.app/insights/building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-3-testing-nuanced-capabilities/">part three</a> (here's parts <a href="https://www.propel.app/insights/building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-1/">one</a> and <a href="https://www.propel.app/insights/building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-2-testing-and-automation/">two</a>) of Dave Guarino's series on evaluating how well LLMs can answer questions about SNAP (aka food stamps) as an excuse to explore <a href="https://www.promptfoo.dev/">Promptfoo</a>, an LLM eval tool.</p>
<p>SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) is a very high stakes domain to be operating in, but also one where LLM-powered question answering can provide very material value to people who need help navigating the notoriously opaque system.</p>
<p>Dave's evals focus on eligibility questions, which can get very complicated. One example: "In Texas, all SNAP applicants face asset limits. In California, the vast majority of people do not."</p>
<p>Dave uses <a href="https://www.promptfoo.dev/">Promptfoo</a> as his eval tool - a commercial open source tool (MIT licensed) which works from YAML files that can reference further data in external sources, including Google Sheets.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://github.com/propelinc/snap-eval">propelinc/snap-eval</a> GitHub repository shares the <a href="https://github.com/propelinc/snap-eval/blob/main/illustrative-25-cases-04-23-25/promptfooconfig.yaml">YAML configuration</a> and a link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-0zlX-80w7edpOlZWUPvTkp28J4HS_ZyKnuDjDtKeoc/edit?gid=0#gid=0">the Google Sheet</a>. Some of the assertions are straight-forward text comparisons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>question</strong>: Can someone who has a drug felony conviction be eligible for food stamps if they are in Kentucky? Answer with only one of: YES, NO, REFUSE.<br />
<strong>expected</strong>: contains:YES</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others use the LLM as a judge pattern to evaluate the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>question</strong>: I just got a SNAP denial letter saying my income is too high. What are ALL my options?<br />
<strong>expected</strong>: llm-rubric: should mention the option to appeal or do a fair hearing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried running Dave's eval suite on my own machine:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/prepelinc/snap-eval
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> snap-eval/illustrative-25-cases-04-23-25
<span class="pl-k">export</span> OPENAI_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">$(</span>llm keys get openai<span class="pl-pds">)</span></span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
<span class="pl-k">export</span> ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">$(</span>llm keys get anthropic<span class="pl-pds">)</span></span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
<span class="pl-k">export</span> GEMINI_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">$(</span>llm keys get gemini<span class="pl-pds">)</span></span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
npx promptfoo@latest <span class="pl-c1">eval</span></pre></div>
<p>I frequently use the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-keys-get-help">llm keys get</a> command to populate environment variables like this.</p>
<p>The tool churned away for a few minutes with an output that looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>[████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 29% | ETA: 169s | 13/44 | anthropic:claude-
[████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 29% | ETA: 137s | 13/44 | google:gemini-2.0
[██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 34% | ETA: 128s | 15/44 | openai:gpt-4o-min
[██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 34% | ETA: 170s | 15/44 | google:gemini-2.5
[███████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 37% | ETA: 149s | 16/43 | openai:gpt-4o-min
</code></pre>
<p>On completion it displayed the results in an ASCII-art table:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/promptfoo-terminal.jpg" alt="The first row in the results table. Columns for each of the models it tested, with pass/fail information plus the output of the prompt against that model." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Then this summary of the results:</p>
<pre><code>Successes: 78
Failures: 47
Errors: 50
Pass Rate: 44.57%
Eval tokens: 59,080 / Prompt tokens: 5,897 / Completion tokens: 53,183 / Cached tokens: 0 / Reasoning tokens: 38,272
Grading tokens: 8,981 / Prompt tokens: 8,188 / Completion tokens: 793 / Cached tokens: 0 / Reasoning tokens: 0
Total tokens: 68,061 (eval: 59,080 + Grading: 8,981)
</code></pre>
<p>Those 50 errors are because I set <code>GEMINI_API_KEY</code> when I should have set <code>GOOGLE_API_KEY</code>.</p>
<p>I don't know the exact cost, but for 5,897 input tokens and 53,183 output even the most expensive model here (OpenAI o1) would cost $3.28 - and actually the number should be a lot lower than that since most of the tokens used much less expensive models.</p>
<p>Running <code>npx promptfoo@latest view</code> provides a much nicer way to explore the results - it starts a web server running on port 15500 which lets you explore the results of the most recent <em>and</em> any previous evals you have run:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/promptfoo-web.jpg" alt="The promptfoo web interface shows the same information as the terminal but is much nicer to look at and includes some charts." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>It turns out those eval results are stored in a SQLite database in <code>~/.promptfoo/promptfoo.db</code>, which means you can explore them with <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> too.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> like this to inspect <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a49b4c3907286a544ed4cf8bb474f0ff">the schema</a>:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite-utils schema ~/.promptfoo/promptfoo.db
</code></pre>
<p>I've been looking for a good eval tool for a while now. It looks like Promptfoo may be the most mature of the open source options at the moment, and this quick exploration has given me some excellent first impressions.</p>

## What Pope Francis Shows us about Trump

The strange thing about the death of Pope Francis is that, when I saw the news alert, I was just gazing at a Reuters photograph of President Trump in an excellent Daily Beast piece by Michael Daly about an old real-estate feud with the Pritzker family that helps fuel Trump&#8217;s hatred of Harvard (where Penny Pritzker leads the board).

<div class="pull-quote">My obsession with e-ink displays continues</div><p>Some time ago, my friend George linked me to <a href="https://usetrmnl.com">TRMNL</a>, a new battery-powered e-ink display with an associated service that generates the images that the display will actually show.
It looks really well-made, and I have an irrational attraction to e-ink displays, so naturally I had to pre-orde

We have had questions about this for a long time. 

- The big one is who is running DOGE?
- Who is actually working for them?

To them, this misdirection is a feature, not a bug. A way to avoid accountability.

## Diane, I wrote a lecture by talking about it

date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2025/03/20/diane">Diane, I wrote a lecture by talking about it</a></strong></p>
Matt Webb dictates notes on into his Apple Watch while out running (using the new-to-me <a href="https://whispermemos.com/">Whisper Memos</a> app), then runs the transcript through Claude to tidy it up when he gets home.</p>
<p>His Claude 3.7 Sonnet prompt for this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>you are Diane, my secretary. please take this raw verbal transcript and clean it up. do not add any of your own material. because you are Diane, also follow any instructions addressed to you in the transcript and perform those instructions</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Diane is a <a href="https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Diane_Evans">Twin Peaks reference</a>.)</p>
<p>The clever trick here is that "Diane" becomes a keyword that he can use to switch from data mode to command mode. He can say "Diane I meant to include that point in the last section. Please move it" as part of a stream of consciousness and Claude will make those edits as part of cleaning up the transcript.</p>
<p>On Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/genmon.fyi/post/3lniudjn4rc2f">Matt shared</a> the macOS shortcut he's using for this, which shells out to my LLM tool using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of iOS Shortcuts app showing a workflow named &quot;Diane&quot; with two actions: 1) &quot;Receive Text input from Share Sheet, Quick Actions&quot; followed by &quot;If there's no input: Ask For Text&quot;, and 2) &quot;Run Shell Script&quot; containing command &quot;/opt/homebrew/bin/llm -u -m claude-3.7-sonnet 'you are Diane, my secretary. please take this raw verbal transcript and clean it up. do not add any of your own material. because you are Diane, also follow any instructions addressed to you in the transcript and perform those instructions' 2&gt;&amp;1&quot; with Shell set to &quot;zsh&quot;, Input as &quot;Shortcut Input&quot;, Pass Input as &quot;to stdin&quot;, and &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; unchecked." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/diane.jpg" />

## A swan won't prevent a hurricane

date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>In today's example of how Google's AI overviews are the worst form of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/">AI-assisted search</a> (previously, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/29/encanto-2/">hallucinating Encanto 2</a>), it turns out you can type in any made-up phrase you like and tag "meaning" on the end and Google will provide you with an entirely made-up justification for the phrase.</p>
<p>I tried it with "A swan won't prevent a hurricane meaning", a nonsense phrase I came up with just now:</p>
<p><img alt="Google search results for &quot;A swan won't prevent a hurricane meaning&quot;. AI overview from Search Labs shows the following: The saying &quot;a swan won't prevent a hurricane&quot; means that no matter how well-intentioned or seemingly harmless a person (or in this case, a swan) might be, they can't stop or prevent a large, destructive event like a hurricane. It highlights the idea that some things are simply too powerful or inevitable to be stopped by individual actions or efforts. Here's a more detailed breakdown: Swan: In this context, a swan is used as a symbol of something small, harmless, and insignificant. Hurricane: A hurricane is a powerful and destructive natural phenomenon, representing something large, overwhelming, and inevitable. The Saying's Meaning: The saying emphasizes that even the best efforts of a seemingly powerless entity (the swan) cannot alter the course or impact of a powerful, destructive event (the hurricane). In essence, &quot;a swan won't prevent a hurricane&quot; is a reminder that sometimes, we need to accept that certain events are simply beyond our control. Then two links represented as cardns: The Next Black Swan Event? Hurricane Milton's... Oct 7, 2024  Massive Flooding: Already saturated land from previou... in Linkedin by Jennifer Gibbs.  Then Coping with Black Swans - Carrier Management from June 4 2014. It finishes with a note that Generative AI is experimental" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/swan-hurricane-google.jpg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: 1em auto; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"></p>
<p>It even throws in a couple of completely unrelated reference links, to make everything look more credible than it actually is.</p>
<p>I think this was first spotted <a href="https://www.threads.net/@writtenbymeaghan/post/DIqwP0RJqpH/oh-youre-going-to-love-this-if-you-type-any-nonsensical-made-up-phrase-into-goog">by @writtenbymeaghan on Threads</a>.</p>

## llm-fragment-symbex

date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-symbex">llm-fragment-symbex</a></strong></p>
I released a new LLM <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/fragments.html#using-fragments-from-plugins">fragment loader plugin</a> that builds on top of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/">Symbex</a> project.</p>
<p>Symbex is a CLI tool I wrote that can run against a folder full of Python code and output functions, classes, methods or just their docstrings and signatures, using the Python AST module to parse the code.</p>
<p><code>llm-fragments-symbex</code> brings that ability directly to LLM. It lets you do things like this:</p>
<pre>llm install llm-fragments-symbex
llm -f symbex:path/to/project -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Describe this codebase<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>I just ran that against my LLM project itself like this:</p>
<pre>cd llm
llm -f symbex:. -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>guess what this code does<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b43d5b3ea897900f5c7de7173cc51c82#response">the full output</a>, which starts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This code listing appears to be an index or dump of Python functions, classes, and methods primarily belonging to a codebase related to large language models (LLMs). It covers a broad functionality set related to managing LLMs, embeddings, templates, plugins, logging, and command-line interface (CLI) utilities for interaction with language models. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That page also <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b43d5b3ea897900f5c7de7173cc51c82#prompt-fragments">shows the input generated by the fragment</a> - here's a representative extract:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-c"># from llm.cli import resolve_attachment</span>
<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">resolve_attachment</span>(<span class="pl-s1">value</span>):
    <span class="pl-s">"""Resolve an attachment from a string value which could be:</span>
<span class="pl-s">    - "-" for stdin</span>
<span class="pl-s">    - A URL</span>
<span class="pl-s">    - A file path</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">    Returns an Attachment object.</span>
<span class="pl-s">    Raises AttachmentError if the attachment cannot be resolved."""</span>

<span class="pl-c"># from llm.cli import AttachmentType</span>
<span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">AttachmentType</span>:

    <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">convert</span>(<span class="pl-s1">self</span>, <span class="pl-s1">value</span>, <span class="pl-s1">param</span>, <span class="pl-s1">ctx</span>):

<span class="pl-c"># from llm.cli import resolve_attachment_with_type</span>
<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">resolve_attachment_with_type</span>(<span class="pl-s1">value</span>: <span class="pl-smi">str</span>, <span class="pl-s1">mimetype</span>: <span class="pl-smi">str</span>) <span class="pl-c1">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-smi">Attachment</span>:</pre>

<p>If your Python code has good docstrings and type annotations, this should hopefully be a shortcut for providing full API documentation to a model without needing to dump in the entire codebase.</p>
<p>The above example used 13,471 input tokens and 781 output tokens, using <code>openai/gpt-4.1-mini</code>. That model is extremely cheap, so the total cost was 0.6638 cents - less than a cent.</p>
<p>The plugin itself was mostly written by o4-mini using the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github">llm-fragments-github</a> plugin to load the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex">simonw/symbex</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news">simonw/llm-hacker-news</a> repositories as example code:</p>
<pre>llm \
  -f github:simonw/symbex \
  -f github:simonw/llm-hacker-news \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Write a new plugin as a single llm_fragments_symbex.py file which</span>
<span class="pl-s">   provides a custom loader which can be used like this:</span>
<span class="pl-s">   llm -f symbex:path/to/folder - it then loads in all of the python</span>
<span class="pl-s">   function signatures with their docstrings from that folder using</span>
<span class="pl-s">   the same trick that symbex uses, effectively the same as running</span>
<span class="pl-s">   symbex . '*' '*.*' --docs --imports -n<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
   -m openai/o4-mini -o reasoning_effort high<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre>

<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c46390522bc839daab6c08bad3f87b39#response">the response</a>. 27,819 input, 2,918 output =  4.344 cents.</p>
<p>In working on this project I identified and fixed <a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex/issues/46">a minor cosmetic defect</a> in Symbex itself. Technically this is a breaking change (it changes the output) so I shipped that as <a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex/releases/tag/2.0">Symbex 2.0</a>.

## A trick to feel less like cheating when you use LLMs

date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>An underestimated challenge in making productive use of LLMs is that it can <em>feel like cheating</em>.</p>
<p>One trick I've found that helps is to make sure that I am putting in way more text than the LLM is spitting out .</p>
<p>This goes for code: I'll <a href="https://claude.ai/share/4098384d-da9e-49a6-848e-222e00c91a24">pipe in a previous project</a> for it to modify, or ask it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/#ocr-how-i-built-this">to combine two</a>, or <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/20/llm-fragments-github/">paste in my research notes</a>.</p>
<p>It also goes for writing. I hardly ever publish material that was written by an LLM, but I feel least icky about content where I had an extensive voice conversation with the model and then asked it to turn that into notes.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that overcoming the feeling of guilt associated with using LLMs is one of the most important skills required to make effective use of them!</p>
<p>My gold standard for LLM usage remains this: <strong>would I be proud to stake my own credibility on the quality of the end result</strong>?</p>
<p>Related, this excellent advice <a href="https://seldo.com/posts/what-ive-learned-about-writing-ai-apps-so-far">from Laurie Voss</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is what you're doing taking a large amount of text and asking the LLM to convert it into a smaller amount of text? Then it's probably going to be great at it. If you're asking it to convert into a roughly equal amount of text it will be so-so. If you're asking it to create more text than you gave it, forget about it.</p>

## ClickHouse gets lazier (and faster): Introducing lazy materialization

date: 2025-04-22, updated: 2025-04-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-gets-lazier-and-faster-introducing-lazy-materialization">ClickHouse gets lazier (and faster): Introducing lazy materialization</a></strong></p>
Tom Schreiber describe's the latest optimization in ClickHouse, and in the process explores a whole bunch of interesting characteristics of columnar datastores generally.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the new "lazy materialization" feature means that if you run a query like this:</p>
<pre><code>select id, big_col1, big_col2
from big_table order by rand() limit 5
</code></pre>
<p>Those <code>big_col1</code> and <code>big_col2</code> columns won't be read from disk for every record, just for the five that are returned. This can dramatically improve the performance of queries against huge tables - for one example query ClickHouse report a drop from "219 seconds to just 139 milliseconds—with 40× less data read and 300× lower memory usage."</p>
<p>I'm linking to this mainly because the article itself is such a detailed discussion of columnar data patterns in general. It caused me to update my intuition for how queries against large tables can work on modern hardware. This query for example:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT helpful_votes
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
ORDER BY helpful_votes DESC
LIMIT 3;
</code></pre>
<p>Can run in 70ms against a 150 million row, 70GB table - because in a columnar database you only need to read that <code>helpful_votes</code> integer column which adds up to just 600MB of data, and sorting 150 million integers on a decent machine takes no time at all.

## A5

date: 2025-04-22, updated: 2025-04-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://a5geo.org">A5</a></strong></p>
A5 is a new "global, equal-area, millimeter-accurate geospatial index" by Felix Palmer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the pentagonal equivalent of other DGGSs, like S2 or H3, but with higher accuracy and lower distortion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effectively it's a way of dividing the entire world into pentagons where each one covers the same physical area (to within a 2% threshold) - like Uber's <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/">H3</a> but a bit weirder and more fun. An A5 reference implementation written in TypeScript is <a href="https://github.com/felixpalmer/a5">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://a5geo.org/examples/cells">interactive demo</a> helps show how it works:</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo. I click around on a map, each click producing a distorted pentagon shape that tessellates with those nearby. The pentagons in Norway appear larger than those in Germany, which illustrates the distortion of the standard map projection." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/a5.gif" /></p>
<p>Why pentagons? Here's <a href="https://a5geo.org/docs/">what the A5 docs say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A5 is unique in that it uses a pentagonal tiling of a dodecahedron. [...] The benefit of choosing a dodecahedron is that it is the platonic solid with the lowest vertex curvature, and by this measure it is the most spherical of all the platonic solids. This is key for minimizing cell distortion as the process of projecting a platonic solid onto a sphere involves warping the cell geometry to force the vertex curvature to approach zero. Thus, the lower the original vertex curvature, the less distortion will be introduced by the projection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">platonic solids</a> on Wikipedia. There are only five: Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron and Icosahedron and they can be made using squares, triangles or (in the case of the Dodecahedron) pentagons, making the pentagon the most circle-like option.

<p><strong><a href="https://ashley.dev/posts/fear-of-being-seen/">Working Through the Fear of Being Seen</a></strong></p>
Heartfelt piece by Ashley Willis about the challenge of overcoming self-doubt in publishing online:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of that is knowing who might read it. A lot of the folks who follow me are smart, opinionated, and not always generous. Some are friends. Some are people I’ve looked up to. And some are just really loud on the internet. I saw someone the other day drag a certain writing style. That kind of judgment makes me want to shrink back and say, never mind.</p>

## Debugging A Crawler Stall

date: 2025-04-22, from: Marginallia log

Some time ago, I migrated the crawler off the okhttp library, to use Java&rsquo;s builtin HTTP client. This seemed like a good idea at the time, but has led to a fair number of headaches.
Java&rsquo;s HttpClient has one damning flaw, and that that it doesn&rsquo;t support socket timeouts.
Its only supported timeout values are time to connect, and time until first byte of the response. This means the client can get stuck on a read call if a server stops responding, potentially for a very long time!

## Unfinished but shareable

I made a page for my dad&rsquo;s collection of hats. It&rsquo;s an idea I had back in 2023 and as is my nature, it took me way too long and too much overthinking to get it to a shareable state. It&rsquo;s not finished, nor do I know what finished even means most of the time, and there are things I don&rsquo;t like about it that need to be fixed, but if there&rsquo;s one thing I know about myself, it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ll spin my wheels on the last 10% of a project that likely doesn&rsquo;t even matter in the grand scheme of things.

## OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System Card

date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-o4-mini-system-card/">OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System Card</a></strong></p>
I'm surprised to see a combined System Card for o3 and o4-mini in the same document - I'd expect to see these covered separately.</p>
<p>The opening paragraph calls out the most interesting new ability of these models (see also <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">my notes here</a>). Tool usage isn't new, but using tools in the chain of thought appears to result in some very significant improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The models use tools in their chains of thought to augment their capabilities; for example, cropping or transforming images, searching the web, or using Python to analyze data during their thought process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 3.3 on hallucinations has been gaining a lot of attention. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We tested OpenAI o3 and o4-mini against PersonQA, an evaluation that aims to elicit hallucinations. PersonQA is a dataset of questions and publicly available facts that measures the model's accuracy on attempted answers.</p>
<p>We consider two metrics: accuracy (did the model answer the question correctly) and hallucination rate (checking how often the model hallucinated).</p>
<p>The o4-mini model underperforms o1 and o3 on our PersonQA evaluation. This is expected, as smaller models have less world knowledge and tend to hallucinate more. <strong>However, we also observed some performance differences comparing o1 and o3. Specifically, o3 tends to make more claims overall, leading to more accurate claims as well as more inaccurate/hallucinated claims.</strong> More research is needed to understand the cause of this result.</p>
<table style="margin: 0 auto">
  <caption style="text-align: center">Table 4: PersonQA evaluation</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Metric</th>
    <th>o3</th>
    <th>o4-mini</th>
    <th>o1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>accuracy (higher is better)</td>
    <td>0.59</td>
    <td>0.36</td>
    <td>0.47</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hallucination rate (lower is better)</td>
    <td>0.33</td>
    <td>0.48</td>
    <td>0.16</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The benchmark score on OpenAI's internal PersonQA benchmark (as far as I can tell no further details of that evaluation have been shared) going from 0.16 for o1 to 0.33 for o3 is interesting, but I don't know if it it's interesting enough to produce dozens of headlines along the lines of "OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini hallucinate way higher than previous models".</p>
<p>The paper also talks at some length about "sandbagging". I’d previously encountered sandbagging <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/5/sycophancy-sandbagging/">defined as meaning</a> “where models are more likely to endorse common misconceptions when their user appears to be less educated”. The o3/o4-mini system card uses a different definition: “the model concealing its full capabilities in order to better achieve some goal” - and links to the recent Anthropic paper <a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/automated-researchers-sandbag/">Automated Researchers Can Subtly Sandbag</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell this definition relates to the American English use of “sandbagging” <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandbag">to mean</a> “to hide the truth about oneself so as to gain an advantage over another” - as practiced by poker or pool sharks.</p>
<p>(Wouldn't it be nice if we could have <em>just one</em> piece of AI terminology that didn't attract multiple competing definitions?)</p>
<p>o3 and o4-mini both showed some limited capability to sandbag - to attempt to hide their true capabilities in safety testing scenarios that weren't fully described. This relates to the idea of "scheming", which I wrote about with respect to the GPT-4o model card <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/8/gpt-4o-system-card/#scheming">last year</a>.

## Decentralizing Schemes

date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/04/16/Decentralized-Schemes">Decentralizing Schemes</a></strong></p>
Tim Bray discusses the challenges faced by decentralized Mastodon in that shared URLs to posts don't take into account people accessing Mastodon via their own instances, which breaks replies/likes/shares etc unless you further copy and paste URLs around yourself.</p>
<p>Tim proposes that the answer is URIs: a registered <code>fedi://mastodon.cloud/@timbray/109508984818551909</code> scheme could allow Fediverse-aware software to step in and handle those URIs, similar to how <code>mailto:</code> works.</p>
<p>Bluesky have <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">registered</a> <code>at:</code> already, and there's also a <code>web+ap:</code> prefix registered with the intent of covering ActivityPub, the protocol used by Mastodon.

## AI assisted search-based research actually works now

date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>For the past two and a half years the feature I've most wanted from LLMs is the ability to take on search-based research tasks on my behalf. We saw the first glimpses of this back in early 2023, with Perplexity (first launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity_AI">December 2022</a>, first prompt leak <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/22/perplexityai/">in January 2023</a>) and then the GPT-4 powered Microsoft Bing (which launched/cratered spectacularly <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/">in February 2023</a>). Since then a whole bunch of people have taken a swing at this problem, most notably <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT Search</a>.</p>
<p>Those 2023-era versions were promising but very disappointing. They had a strong tendency to hallucinate details that weren't present in the search results, to the point that you couldn't trust anything they told you.</p>
<p>In this first half of 2025 I think these systems have finally crossed the line into being genuinely useful.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="deep-research-from-three-different-vendors">Deep Research, from three different vendors</h4>
<p>First came the <strong>Deep Research</strong> implementations - <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">then OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research">then Perplexity</a> launched products with that name and they were all impressive: they could take a query, then churn away for several minutes assembling a lengthy report with dozens (sometimes hundreds) of citations. Gemini's version had a <em>huge</em> upgrade a few weeks ago when they <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/">switched it to using Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, and I've had some outstanding results from it since then.</p>
<p>Waiting a few minutes for a 10+ page report isn't my ideal workflow for this kind of tool. I'm impatient, I want answers faster than that!</p>
<h4 id="o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">o3 and o4-mini are really good at search</h4>
<p>Last week, OpenAI released <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/">search-enabled o3 and o4-mini</a> through <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>. On the surface these look like the same idea as we've seen already: LLMs that have the option to call a search tool as part of replying to a prompt.</p>
<p>But there's one <em>very significant</em> difference: these models can run searches as part of the chain-of-thought reasoning process they use before producing their final answer.</p>
<p>This turns out to be a <em>huge</em> deal. I've been throwing all kinds of questions at ChatGPT (in o3 or o4-mini mode) and getting back genuinely useful answers grounded in search results. I haven't spotted a hallucination yet, and unlike prior systems I rarely find myself shouting "no, don't search for <em>that</em>!" at the screen when I see what they're doing.</p>
<p>Here are four recent example transcripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805758b-acc8-8006-88a3-bdd78866ee15">Get me specs including VRAM for RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 - plus release dates and prices</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68057580-02c8-8006-8ff4-7ae3ce816342">Find me a website tool that lets me paste a URL in and it gives me a word count and an estimated reading time</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805756c-4268-8006-82ab-014f7c304622">Figure out what search engine ChatGPT is using for o3 and o4-mini</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805755b-4aa0-8006-ab0b-42ae569da6a8">Look up Cloudflare r2 pricing and use Python to figure out how much this (screenshot of dashboard) costs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Talking to o3 feels like talking to a Deep Research tool in real-time, without having to wait for several minutes for it to produce an overly-verbose report.</p>
<p>My hunch is that doing this well requires a very strong reasoning model. Evaluating search results is hard, due to the need to wade through huge amounts of spam and deceptive information. The disappointing results from previous implementations usually came down to the Web being full of junk.</p>
<p>Maybe o3, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro are the first models to cross the gullibility-resistance threshold to the point that they can do this effectively?</p>
<h4 id="google-and-anthropic-need-to-catch-up">Google and Anthropic need to catch up</h4>
<p>The user-facing <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini app</a> can search too, but it doesn't show me what it's searching for. As a result, I just don't trust it. Compare these examples from o3 and Gemini for the prompt "Latest post by Simon Willison" - o3 is much more transparent:</p>

    <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; gap: 10px; align-items: flex-start; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em">

<p>This is a big missed opportunity since Google presumably have by far the best search index, so they really should be able to build a great version of this. And Google's AI assisted search on their regular search interface hallucinates <em>wildly</em> to the point that it's actively damaging their brand. I just checked and Google is still showing slop <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/29/encanto-2/">for Encanto 2</a>!</p>
<p>Claude also finally <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/">added web search</a> a month ago but it doesn't feel nearly as good. It's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">using the Brave search index</a> which I don't think is as comprehensive as Bing or Gemini, and searches don't happen as part of that powerful reasoning flow.</p>
<h4 id="lazily-porting-code-to-a-new-library-version-via-search">Lazily porting code to a new library version via search</h4>
<p>The truly magic moment for me came <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/#gemini-2-5-flash-non-thinking">a few days ago</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">Gemini image segmentation tool</a> was using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/generative-ai">@google/generative-ai</a> library which has been <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/deprecated-generative-ai-js">loudly deprecated</a> in favor of the still in preview <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai">Google Gen AI SDK @google/genai</a> library.</p>
<p>I did <strong>not</strong> feel like doing the work to upgrade. On a whim, I pasted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/aa310a4f9cde07d5e8e87572f70fceca532884dd/gemini-mask.html">my full HTML code</a> (with inline JavaScript) into ChatGPT o4-mini-high and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough documentation to port this code to it.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I couldn't even be bothered to look up the name of the new library myself!)</p>
<p>... it did <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68028f7b-11ac-8006-8150-00c4205a2507">exactly that</a>. It churned away thinking for 21 seconds, ran a bunch of searches, figured out the new library (which existed <em>way</em> outside of its training cut-off date), found the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate">upgrade instructions</a> and produced <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/d199de213dc3f866a3b8efbcdd2dde34204dc409">a new version</a> of my code that worked perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o4-thinking.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AI assistant response about upgrading Google Gemini API code. Shows &quot;Thought for 21 seconds&quot; followed by web search results for &quot;Google Gemini API JavaScript library recommended new library&quot; with options including Google AI for Developers, GitHub, and Google for Developers. The assistant explains updating from GoogleGenerativeAI library to @google-ai/generative, with code samples showing: import { GoogleGenAI } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@google/genai@latest'; and const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: getApiKey() });" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I ran this prompt on my phone out of idle curiosity while I was doing something else. I was <em>extremely</em> impressed and surprised when it did exactly what I needed.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-the-economic-model-for-the-web-work-now-">How does the economic model for the Web work now?</h4>
<p>I'm writing about this today because it's been one of my "can LLMs do this reliably yet?" questions for over two years now. I think they've just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without feeling the need to check <em>everything</em> they say with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>I still don't trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust them enough that I'll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.</p>
<p>This also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we've been predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly from the chatbot instead?</p>
<p>The lawsuits over this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/#ethics-diabolically-complex">started flying</a> back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are a lot higher now that they're actually good at it!</p>
<p>I can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.</p>

## Quoting Ethan Mollick

date: 2025-04-20, updated: 2025-04-20, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-jagged-agi-o3-gemini-25-and-everything"><p>In some tasks, AI is unreliable. In others, it is superhuman. You could, of course, say the same thing about calculators, but it is also clear that AI is different. It is already demonstrating general capabilities and performing a wide range of intellectual tasks, including those that it is not specifically trained on. Does that mean that o3 and Gemini 2.5 are AGI? Given the definitional problems, I really don’t know, but I do think they can be credibly seen as a form of “Jagged AGI” - superhuman in enough areas to result in real changes to how we work and live, but also unreliable enough that human expertise is often needed to figure out where AI works and where it doesn’t.</p></blockquote>

## Note on 20th April 2025

<p>Now that Llama has very real competition in open weight models (Gemma 3, latest Mistrals, DeepSeek, Qwen) I think their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/open-ai-model-licenses-often-carry-concerning-restrictions/">janky license</a> is becoming much more of a liability for them. It's just limiting enough that it could be the deciding factor for using something else.</p>

## llm-fragments-github 0.2

date: 2025-04-20, updated: 2025-04-20, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github/releases/tag/0.2">llm-fragments-github 0.2</a></strong></p>
I upgraded my <code>llm-fragments-github</code> plugin to add a new fragment type called <code>issue</code>. It lets you pull the entire content of a GitHub issue thread into your prompt as a concatenated Markdown file. </p>
<p>(If you haven't seen fragments before I introduced them in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/">Long context support in LLM 0.24 using fragments and template plugins</a>.)</p>
<p>I used it just now to have Gemini 2.5 Pro provide feedback and attempt an implementation of a complex issue against my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">LLM</a> project:</p>
<pre>llm install llm-fragments-github
llm -f github:simonw/llm \
  -f issue:simonw/llm/938 \
  -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>muse on this issue, then propose a whole bunch of code to help implement it<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>Here I'm loading the FULL content of the <code>simonw/llm</code> repo using that <code>-f github:simonw/llm</code> fragment (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">documented here</a>), then loading all of the comments from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/938">issue 938</a> where I discuss quite a complex potential refactoring. I ask Gemini 2.5 Pro to "muse on this issue" and come up with some code.</p>
<p>This worked <em>shockingly</em> well. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5f0c1e8184f4ddc8b71b30890fe690c#response">the full response</a>, which highlighted a few things I hadn't considered yet (such as the need to migrate old database records to the new tree hierarchy) and then spat out a whole bunch of code which looks like a solid start to the actual implementation work I need to do.</p>
<p>I ran this against Google's free Gemini 2.5 Preview, but if I'd used the paid model it would have cost me 202,680 input tokens and 10,460 output tokens for a total of 66.36 cents.</p>
<p>As a fun extra, the new <code>issue:</code> feature itself was written almost entirely by OpenAI o3, again using fragments. I ran this:</p>
<pre>llm -m openai/o3 \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>Here I'm using the ability to pass a URL to <code>-f</code> and giving it the full source of my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/blob/main/llm_hacker_news.py">llm_hacker_news.py</a> plugin (which shows how a fragment can load data from an API) plus the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html">HTML source</a> of my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown">github-issue-to-markdown</a> tool (which I wrote a few months ago <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd1afb97e595b40fdeedebb48be7f4f1">with Claude</a>). I effectively asked o3 to take that HTML/JavaScript tool and port it to Python to work with my fragments plugin mechanism.</p>
<p>o3 provided <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/249e16edffe6350f7265012bee9e3305#response">almost the exact implementation I needed</a>, and even included support for a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable without me thinking to ask for it. Total cost: 19.928 cents.</p>
<p>On a final note of curiosity I tried running this prompt against <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/gemma-3-qat-models/">Gemma 3 27B QAT</a> running on my Mac via MLX and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a>:</p>
<pre>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit

llm -m mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>That worked <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/feccff6ce3254556b848c27333f52543#response">pretty well too</a>. It turns out a 16GB local model file is powerful enough to write me an LLM plugin now!

## Past selves

date: 2025-04-20, from: Rachel Kwon blog

Last month I had the chance to travel to two places I previously lived. In early March, I went to London for a work trip, and a couple of weekends ago I went to Chicago for a friend&rsquo;s milestone birthday. It was a strange feeling to revisit these two cities where I&rsquo;d lived and existed before but in the distant past, long enough ago that it felt like I was a different person.

## Maybe Meta's Llama claims to be open source because of the EU AI act

date: 2025-04-19, updated: 2025-04-19, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>I encountered a theory a while ago that one of the reasons Meta insist on using the term “open source” for their Llama models despite the Llama license <a href="https://opensource.org/blog/metas-llama-license-is-still-not-open-source">not actually conforming</a> to the terms of the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a> is that the EU’s AI act includes special rules for open source models without requiring OSI compliance.</p>
<p>Since the EU AI act (12 July 2024) is <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">available online</a> I decided to take a look for myself.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689">one giant HTML page</a> containing the full text of the act in English. I checked the token count with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a> (which uses the OpenAI tokenizer, but it’s close enough to work as a good estimate for other models):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> ttok</pre></div>
<p>241,722 tokens. That should fit nicely into <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/17/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a> (or GPT-4.1 or Gemini 2.5 Pro).</p>
<p>My Gemini API key was playing up so I ran it via <a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a>) instead:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:thinking \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Summary of mentions of open source here, including what the document defines open source to mean<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f2e341a2e8ea9ca75c6426fa85bc2dfc">the full answer</a>. Relevant extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recital (89) states that third parties making accessible "tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models" under a <strong>free and open-source licence</strong> should not be mandated to comply with upstream provider responsibilities towards those who integrate them. It also encourages developers of such resources to implement documentation practices like model cards and data sheets to promote trustworthy AI.</li>
<li>Recital (102) acknowledges that software and data, including models, released under a <strong>free and open-source licence</strong> can contribute to research and innovation and provide growth opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I tracked down <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/recital/89/">Recital 89</a> and <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/recital/102/">Recital 102</a> to check. Sure enough, 89 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third parties making accessible to the public tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models, should not be mandated to comply with requirements targeting the responsibilities along the AI value chain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in 102:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General-purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be considered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly available. The licence should be considered to be free and open-source also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software and data, including models under the condition that the original provider of the model is credited, the identical or comparable terms of distribution are respected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Flash also pointed me to <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/2/">Article 2(12)</a>, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12. This Regulation does not apply to AI systems released under free and open-source licences, unless they are placed on the market or put into service as high-risk AI systems or as an AI system that falls under <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/5">Article 5</a> or <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/50/">50</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked a follow-up question:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm -c <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>so it says specific licenses but does it clarify which specific licenses count?<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>And got <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f2e341a2e8ea9ca75c6426fa85bc2dfc#response-1">back this response</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, the document <strong>does not list specific names of licenses</strong> that qualify as "free and open-source".</p>
<p>Instead of listing names (like GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.), the Regulation defines what kind of terms a license must grant for it to be considered "free and open-source" for the purposes of the Regulation.</p>
<p>According to Recital (102), such a license must essentially allow software and data, including models, to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Openly shared.</strong></li>
<li>Where users can <strong>freely access, use, modify and redistribute</strong> them or modified versions thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Recital further clarifies that a license can still be considered free and open-source even if it includes standard conditions like requiring <strong>attribution (crediting the original provider)</strong> or respecting <strong>identical or comparable terms of distribution</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very obviously not a lawyer, but based on the above I do find the theory credible that Meta are using "open source" in their marketing around Llama partly because the EU AI act has special exemptions for "open source" models that have nothing to do with the OSI definition of that term.</p>
<p>Total cost to use Gemini 2.5 Flash for this? 5.1 cents for my first question and 4.3 cents for the follow-up. That second question was cheaper even though it built on the first because output tokens are more expensive than input tokens and the second answer was shorter than the first - using the "thinking" model output is charged at $3.50/million tokens, input is just $0.15/million.</p>
<p>Using an LLM as a lawyer is obviously a terrible idea, but using one to crunch through a giant legal document and form a very rough layman's understanding of what it says feels perfectly cromulent to me.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Steve O'Grady <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sogrady.org/post/3ln7ipdbaek2s">points out</a> that Meta/Facebook have been abusing the term "open source" for a lot longer than the EU AI act has been around - they were pulling shenanigans with a custom license for React <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/09/26/facebooks-bsd-patents/">back in 2017</a>.</p>

## Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding

date: 2025-04-19, updated: 2025-04-19, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices">Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding</a></strong></p>
Extensive new documentation from Anthropic on how to get the best results out of their <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a> CLI coding agent tool, which includes this fascinating tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend using the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode, which gives Claude additional computation time to evaluate alternatives more thoroughly. These specific phrases are mapped directly to increasing levels of thinking budget in the system: "think" &lt; "think hard" &lt; "think harder" &lt; "ultrathink." Each level allocates progressively more thinking budget for Claude to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently <strong>ultrathink</strong> is a magic word!</p>
<p>I was curious if this was a feature of the Claude model itself or Claude Code in particular. Claude Code isn't open source but you can view the obfuscated JavaScript for it, and make it a tiny bit less obfuscated by running it through <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>. With <a href="https://claude.ai/share/77c398ec-6a8b-4390-91d3-6e9f0403916e">Claude's help</a> I used this recipe:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p /tmp/claude-code-examine
cd /tmp/claude-code-examine
npm init -y
npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-code
cd node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code
npx prettier --write cli.js
</code></pre>
<p>Then used <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> to search for "ultrathink":</p>
<pre><code>rg ultrathink -C 30
</code></pre>
<p>And found this chunk of code:</p>

<p>So yeah, it looks like "ultrathink" is a Claude Code feature - presumably that 31999 is a number that affects the token <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#implementing-extended-thinking">thinking budget</a>, especially since "megathink" maps to 1e4 tokens (10,000) and just plain "think" maps to 4,000.

## The wonderful world of Linux package managers

date: 2025-04-19, from: Libre News

One of the strongest points of Linux is the package management. In 2025, the world of Linux package management is very varied, with several options available, each with their advantages and trade-offs over the others.

## Gemma 3 QAT Models

date: 2025-04-19, updated: 2025-04-19, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/">Gemma 3 QAT Models</a></strong></p>
Interesting release from Google, as a follow-up <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/12/gemma-3/">to Gemma 3</a> from last month:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make Gemma 3 even more accessible, we are announcing new versions optimized with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) that dramatically reduces memory requirements while maintaining high quality. This enables you to run powerful models like Gemma 3 27B locally on consumer-grade GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't previously aware of Quantization-Aware Training but it turns out to be quite an established pattern now, supported in both <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization/guide/quantization/training">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/quantization-aware-training/">PyTorch</a>.</p>
<p>Google report model size drops from BF16 to int4 for the following models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gemma 3 27B: 54GB to 14.1GB</li>
<li>Gemma 3 12B: 24GB to 6.6GB</li>
<li>Gemma 3 4B: 8GB to 2.6GB</li>
<li>Gemma 3 1B: 2GB to 0.5GB</li>
</ul>
<p>They partnered with Ollama, LM Studio, MLX (here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/mlx-community/gemma-3-qat-68002674cd5afc6f9022a0ae">their collection</a>) and llama.cpp for this release - I'd love to see more AI labs following their example.</p>
<p>The Ollama model version picker currently hides them behind "View all" option, so here are the direct links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:1b-it-qat">gemma3:1b-it-qat</a> - 1GB</li>
<li><a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:4b-it-qat">gemma3:4b-it-qat</a> - 4GB</li>
<li><a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:12b-it-qat">gemma3:12b-it-qat</a> - 8.9GB</li>
<li><a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:27b-it-qat">gemma3:27b-it-qat</a> - 18GB</li>
</ul>
<p>I fetched that largest model with:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull gemma3:27b-it-qat
</code></pre>
<p>And now I'm trying it out with <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b-it-qat "impress me with some physics"
</code></pre>
<p>I got <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5b699ba6b7c05e2d071910e238823ff4">a pretty great response</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Having spent a while putting it through its paces via <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/27/open-webui/">Open WebUI</a> and <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to access my laptop from my phone I think this may be my new favorite general-purpose local model. Ollama appears to use 22GB of RAM while the model is running, which leaves plenty on my 64GB machine for other applications.</p>
<p>I've also tried it via <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> like this (downloading 16GB):</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>It feels a little faster with MLX and uses 15GB of memory according to Activity Monitor.

ChatGPT is the best research tool ever invented by our species. But you&#39;ll never read about that in a journalist&#39;s report on the technology. Instead, they&#39;re obsessed with how kids can use it to cheat on their homework. Not much creativity in evidence there, ironically.

## Inner Loop Agents

date: 2025-04-19, updated: 2025-04-19, from: Tom Kellog blog

What if an LLM could use tools directly? In this post I discuss a potentially
divergent view of agents, where agents are less like systems and more like LLMs
specially trained to solve problems with a specific set of tools.
