## A trick to feel less like cheating when you use LLMs

date: 2025-04-23, updated: 2025-04-23, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>An underestimated challenge in making productive use of LLMs is that it can <em>feel like cheating</em>.</p>
<p>One trick I've found that helps is to make sure that I am putting in way more text than the LLM is spitting out .</p>
<p>This goes for code: I'll <a href="https://claude.ai/share/4098384d-da9e-49a6-848e-222e00c91a24">pipe in a previous project</a> for it to modify, or ask it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/#ocr-how-i-built-this">to combine two</a>, or <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/20/llm-fragments-github/">paste in my research notes</a>.</p>
<p>It also goes for writing. I hardly ever publish material that was written by an LLM, but I feel least icky about content where I had an extensive voice conversation with the model and then asked it to turn that into notes.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that overcoming the feeling of guilt associated with using LLMs is one of the most important skills required to make effective use of them!</p>
<p>My gold standard for LLM usage remains this: <strong>would I be proud to stake my own credibility on the quality of the end result</strong>?</p>
<p>Related, this excellent advice <a href="https://seldo.com/posts/what-ive-learned-about-writing-ai-apps-so-far">from Laurie Voss</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is what you're doing taking a large amount of text and asking the LLM to convert it into a smaller amount of text? Then it's probably going to be great at it. If you're asking it to convert into a roughly equal amount of text it will be so-so. If you're asking it to create more text than you gave it, forget about it.</p>

## Elegy for the Video Screenshot

Nora Deligter: It was around this time when streaming platforms like Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, and the Criterion Channel imposed a quiet embargo on the screenshot.

But gradually, the digital-rights-management [&#8230;]

## Figment is another E Ink handheld game console made for text adventures (and maybe more)

<p>E Ink displays offer a paper-like viewing experience that makes them a good fit for eBook readers and digital signage. They consume less power than LCD or AMOLED screens, emit no light, and can be viewed using ambient light only. But they also tend to have much lower screen refresh rates than other display technologies [&#8230;]</p>

## ClickHouse gets lazier (and faster): Introducing lazy materialization

date: 2025-04-22, updated: 2025-04-22, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-gets-lazier-and-faster-introducing-lazy-materialization">ClickHouse gets lazier (and faster): Introducing lazy materialization</a></strong></p>
Tom Schreiber describe's the latest optimization in ClickHouse, and in the process explores a whole bunch of interesting characteristics of columnar datastores generally.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the new "lazy materialization" feature means that if you run a query like this:</p>
<pre><code>select id, big_col1, big_col2
from big_table order by rand() limit 5
</code></pre>
<p>Those <code>big_col1</code> and <code>big_col2</code> columns won't be read from disk for every record, just for the five that are returned. This can dramatically improve the performance of queries against huge tables - for one example query ClickHouse report a drop from "219 seconds to just 139 milliseconds‚Äîwith 40√ó less data read and 300√ó lower memory usage."</p>
<p>I'm linking to this mainly because the article itself is such a detailed discussion of columnar data patterns in general. It caused me to update my intuition for how queries against large tables can work on modern hardware. This query for example:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT helpful_votes
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
ORDER BY helpful_votes DESC
LIMIT 3;
</code></pre>
<p>Can run in 70ms against a 150 million row, 70GB table - because in a columnar database you only need to read that <code>helpful_votes</code> integer column which adds up to just 600MB of data, and sorting 150 million integers on a decent machine takes no time at all.

## A5

date: 2025-04-22, updated: 2025-04-22, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://a5geo.org">A5</a></strong></p>
A5 is a new "global, equal-area, millimeter-accurate geospatial index" by Felix Palmer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the pentagonal equivalent of other DGGSs, like S2 or H3, but with higher accuracy and lower distortion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effectively it's a way of dividing the entire world into pentagons where each one covers the same physical area (to within a 2% threshold) - like Uber's <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/">H3</a> but a bit weirder and more fun. An A5 reference implementation written in TypeScript is <a href="https://github.com/felixpalmer/a5">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://a5geo.org/examples/cells">interactive demo</a> helps show how it works:</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo. I click around on a map, each click producing a distorted pentagon shape that tessellates with those nearby. The pentagons in Norway appear larger than those in Germany, which illustrates the distortion of the standard map projection." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/a5.gif" /></p>
<p>Why pentagons? Here's <a href="https://a5geo.org/docs/">what the A5 docs say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A5 is unique in that it uses a pentagonal tiling of a dodecahedron. [...] The benefit of choosing a dodecahedron is that it is the platonic solid with the lowest vertex curvature, and by this measure it is the most spherical of all the platonic solids. This is key for minimizing cell distortion as the process of projecting a platonic solid onto a sphere involves warping the cell geometry to force the vertex curvature to approach zero. Thus, the lower the original vertex curvature, the less distortion will be introduced by the projection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">platonic solids</a> on Wikipedia. There are only five: Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron and Icosahedron and they can be made using squares, triangles or (in the case of the Dodecahedron) pentagons, making the pentagon the most circle-like option.

<p><strong><a href="https://ashley.dev/posts/fear-of-being-seen/">Working Through the Fear of Being Seen</a></strong></p>
Heartfelt piece by Ashley Willis about the challenge of overcoming self-doubt in publishing online:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of that is knowing who might read it. A lot of the folks who follow me are smart, opinionated, and not always generous. Some are friends. Some are people I‚Äôve looked up to. And some are just really loud on the internet. I saw someone the other day drag a certain writing style. That kind of judgment makes me want to shrink back and say, never mind.</p>

## Debugging A Crawler Stall

date: 2025-04-22, from: Marginallia log

Some time ago, I migrated the crawler off the okhttp library, to use Java&rsquo;s builtin HTTP client. This seemed like a good idea at the time, but has led to a fair number of headaches.
Java&rsquo;s HttpClient has one damning flaw, and that that it doesn&rsquo;t support socket timeouts.
Its only supported timeout values are time to connect, and time until first byte of the response. This means the client can get stuck on a read call if a server stops responding, potentially for a very long time!

## Unfinished but shareable

I made a page for my dad&rsquo;s collection of hats. It&rsquo;s an idea I had back in 2023 and as is my nature, it took me way too long and too much overthinking to get it to a shareable state. It&rsquo;s not finished, nor do I know what finished even means most of the time, and there are things I don&rsquo;t like about it that need to be fixed, but if there&rsquo;s one thing I know about myself, it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ll spin my wheels on the last 10% of a project that likely doesn&rsquo;t even matter in the grand scheme of things.

## OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System Card

date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-o4-mini-system-card/">OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System Card</a></strong></p>
I'm surprised to see a combined System Card for o3 and o4-mini in the same document - I'd expect to see these covered separately.</p>
<p>The opening paragraph calls out the most interesting new ability of these models (see also <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">my notes here</a>). Tool usage isn't new, but using tools in the chain of thought appears to result in some very significant improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The models use tools in their chains of thought to augment their capabilities; for example, cropping or transforming images, searching the web, or using Python to analyze data during their thought process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 3.3 on hallucinations has been gaining a lot of attention. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We tested OpenAI o3 and o4-mini against PersonQA, an evaluation that aims to elicit hallucinations. PersonQA is a dataset of questions and publicly available facts that measures the model's accuracy on attempted answers.</p>
<p>We consider two metrics: accuracy (did the model answer the question correctly) and hallucination rate (checking how often the model hallucinated).</p>
<p>The o4-mini model underperforms o1 and o3 on our PersonQA evaluation. This is expected, as smaller models have less world knowledge and tend to hallucinate more. <strong>However, we also observed some performance differences comparing o1 and o3. Specifically, o3 tends to make more claims overall, leading to more accurate claims as well as more inaccurate/hallucinated claims.</strong> More research is needed to understand the cause of this result.</p>
<table style="margin: 0 auto">
  <caption style="text-align: center">Table 4: PersonQA evaluation</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Metric</th>
    <th>o3</th>
    <th>o4-mini</th>
    <th>o1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>accuracy (higher is better)</td>
    <td>0.59</td>
    <td>0.36</td>
    <td>0.47</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hallucination rate (lower is better)</td>
    <td>0.33</td>
    <td>0.48</td>
    <td>0.16</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The benchmark score on OpenAI's internal PersonQA benchmark (as far as I can tell no further details of that evaluation have been shared) going from 0.16 for o1 to 0.33 for o3 is interesting, but I don't know if it it's interesting enough to produce dozens of headlines along the lines of "OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini hallucinate way higher than previous models".</p>
<p>The paper also talks at some length about "sandbagging". I‚Äôd previously encountered sandbagging <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/5/sycophancy-sandbagging/">defined as meaning</a> ‚Äúwhere models are more likely to endorse common misconceptions when their user appears to be less educated‚Äù. The o3/o4-mini system card uses a different definition: ‚Äúthe model concealing its full capabilities in order to better achieve some goal‚Äù - and links to the recent Anthropic paper <a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/automated-researchers-sandbag/">Automated Researchers Can Subtly Sandbag</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell this definition relates to the American English use of ‚Äúsandbagging‚Äù <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandbag">to mean</a> ‚Äúto hide the truth about oneself so as to gain an advantage over another‚Äù - as practiced by poker or pool sharks.</p>
<p>(Wouldn't it be nice if we could have <em>just one</em> piece of AI terminology that didn't attract multiple competing definitions?)</p>
<p>o3 and o4-mini both showed some limited capability to sandbag - to attempt to hide their true capabilities in safety testing scenarios that weren't fully described. This relates to the idea of "scheming", which I wrote about with respect to the GPT-4o model card <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/8/gpt-4o-system-card/#scheming">last year</a>.

## Decentralizing Schemes

date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/04/16/Decentralized-Schemes">Decentralizing Schemes</a></strong></p>
Tim Bray discusses the challenges faced by decentralized Mastodon in that shared URLs to posts don't take into account people accessing Mastodon via their own instances, which breaks replies/likes/shares etc unless you further copy and paste URLs around yourself.</p>
<p>Tim proposes that the answer is URIs: a registered <code>fedi://mastodon.cloud/@timbray/109508984818551909</code> scheme could allow Fediverse-aware software to step in and handle those URIs, similar to how <code>mailto:</code> works.</p>
<p>Bluesky have <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">registered</a> <code>at:</code> already, and there's also a <code>web+ap:</code> prefix registered with the intent of covering ActivityPub, the protocol used by Mastodon.

<p>There&#8217;s a new version of a pocket-sized mini PC available from AliExpress that packs an Intel N150 quad-core processor, 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and an M.2 slot into a body that measures just 145 x 62 x 20mm (5.71&#8243; x 2.44&#8243;¬† x 0.79&#8243;).

## AI assisted search-based research actually works now

date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>For the past two and a half years the feature I've most wanted from LLMs is the ability to take on search-based research tasks on my behalf. We saw the first glimpses of this back in early 2023, with Perplexity (first launched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity_AI">December 2022</a>, first prompt leak <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/22/perplexityai/">in January 2023</a>) and then the GPT-4 powered Microsoft Bing (which launched/cratered spectacularly <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/">in February 2023</a>). Since then a whole bunch of people have taken a swing at this problem, most notably <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT Search</a>.</p>
<p>Those 2023-era versions were promising but very disappointing. They had a strong tendency to hallucinate details that weren't present in the search results, to the point that you couldn't trust anything they told you.</p>
<p>In this first half of 2025 I think these systems have finally crossed the line into being genuinely useful.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="deep-research-from-three-different-vendors">Deep Research, from three different vendors</h4>
<p>First came the <strong>Deep Research</strong> implementations - <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Google Gemini</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">then OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research">then Perplexity</a> launched products with that name and they were all impressive: they could take a query, then churn away for several minutes assembling a lengthy report with dozens (sometimes hundreds) of citations. Gemini's version had a <em>huge</em> upgrade a few weeks ago when they <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/">switched it to using Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, and I've had some outstanding results from it since then.</p>
<p>Waiting a few minutes for a 10+ page report isn't my ideal workflow for this kind of tool. I'm impatient, I want answers faster than that!</p>
<h4 id="o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">o3 and o4-mini are really good at search</h4>
<p>Last week, OpenAI released <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/">search-enabled o3 and o4-mini</a> through <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>. On the surface these look like the same idea as we've seen already: LLMs that have the option to call a search tool as part of replying to a prompt.</p>
<p>But there's one <em>very significant</em> difference: these models can run searches as part of the chain-of-thought reasoning process they use before producing their final answer.</p>
<p>This turns out to be a <em>huge</em> deal. I've been throwing all kinds of questions at ChatGPT (in o3 or o4-mini mode) and getting back genuinely useful answers grounded in search results. I haven't spotted a hallucination yet, and unlike prior systems I rarely find myself shouting "no, don't search for <em>that</em>!" at the screen when I see what they're doing.</p>
<p>Here are four recent example transcripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805758b-acc8-8006-88a3-bdd78866ee15">Get me specs including VRAM for RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 - plus release dates and prices</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68057580-02c8-8006-8ff4-7ae3ce816342">Find me a website tool that lets me paste a URL in and it gives me a word count and an estimated reading time</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805756c-4268-8006-82ab-014f7c304622">Figure out what search engine ChatGPT is using for o3 and o4-mini</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805755b-4aa0-8006-ab0b-42ae569da6a8">Look up Cloudflare r2 pricing and use Python to figure out how much this (screenshot of dashboard) costs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Talking to o3 feels like talking to a Deep Research tool in real-time, without having to wait for several minutes for it to produce an overly-verbose report.</p>
<p>My hunch is that doing this well requires a very strong reasoning model. Evaluating search results is hard, due to the need to wade through huge amounts of spam and deceptive information. The disappointing results from previous implementations usually came down to the Web being full of junk.</p>
<p>Maybe o3, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro are the first models to cross the gullibility-resistance threshold to the point that they can do this effectively?</p>
<h4 id="google-and-anthropic-need-to-catch-up">Google and Anthropic need to catch up</h4>
<p>The user-facing <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini app</a> can search too, but it doesn't show me what it's searching for. As a result, I just don't trust it. Compare these examples from o3 and Gemini for the prompt "Latest post by Simon Willison" - o3 is much more transparent:</p>

<p>This is a big missed opportunity since Google presumably have by far the best search index, so they really should be able to build a great version of this. And Google's AI assisted search on their regular search interface hallucinates <em>wildly</em> to the point that it's actively damaging their brand. I just checked and Google is still showing slop <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/29/encanto-2/">for Encanto 2</a>!</p>
<p>Claude also finally <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/">added web search</a> a month ago but it doesn't feel nearly as good. It's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">using the Brave search index</a> which I don't think is as comprehensive as Bing or Gemini, and searches don't happen as part of that powerful reasoning flow.</p>
<h4 id="lazily-porting-code-to-a-new-library-version-via-search">Lazily porting code to a new library version via search</h4>
<p>The truly magic moment for me came <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/#gemini-2-5-flash-non-thinking">a few days ago</a>.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">Gemini image segmentation tool</a> was using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/generative-ai">@google/generative-ai</a> library which has been <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/deprecated-generative-ai-js">loudly deprecated</a> in favor of the still in preview <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai">Google Gen AI SDK @google/genai</a> library.</p>
<p>I did <strong>not</strong> feel like doing the work to upgrade. On a whim, I pasted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/aa310a4f9cde07d5e8e87572f70fceca532884dd/gemini-mask.html">my full HTML code</a> (with inline JavaScript) into ChatGPT o4-mini-high and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough documentation to port this code to it.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I couldn't even be bothered to look up the name of the new library myself!)</p>
<p>... it did <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68028f7b-11ac-8006-8150-00c4205a2507">exactly that</a>. It churned away thinking for 21 seconds, ran a bunch of searches, figured out the new library (which existed <em>way</em> outside of its training cut-off date), found the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate">upgrade instructions</a> and produced <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/d199de213dc3f866a3b8efbcdd2dde34204dc409">a new version</a> of my code that worked perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o4-thinking.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AI assistant response about upgrading Google Gemini API code. Shows &quot;Thought for 21 seconds&quot; followed by web search results for &quot;Google Gemini API JavaScript library recommended new library&quot; with options including Google AI for Developers, GitHub, and Google for Developers. The assistant explains updating from GoogleGenerativeAI library to @google-ai/generative, with code samples showing: import { GoogleGenAI } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@google/genai@latest'; and const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: getApiKey() });" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I ran this prompt on my phone out of idle curiosity while I was doing something else. I was <em>extremely</em> impressed and surprised when it did exactly what I needed.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-the-economic-model-for-the-web-work-now-">How does the economic model for the Web work now?</h4>
<p>I'm writing about this today because it's been one of my "can LLMs do this reliably yet?" questions for over two years now. I think they've just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without feeling the need to check <em>everything</em> they say with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>I still don't trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust them enough that I'll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.</p>
<p>This also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we've been predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly from the chatbot instead?</p>
<p>The lawsuits over this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/#ethics-diabolically-complex">started flying</a> back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are a lot higher now that they're actually good at it!</p>
<p>I can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.</p>

You could, of course, say the same thing about calculators, but it is also clear that AI is different. It is already demonstrating general capabilities and performing a wide range of intellectual tasks, including those that it is not specifically trained on. Does that mean that o3 and Gemini 2.5 are AGI? Given the definitional problems, I really don‚Äôt know, but I do think they can be credibly seen as a form of ‚ÄúJagged AGI‚Äù - superhuman in enough areas to result in real changes to how we work and live, but also unreliable enough that human expertise is often needed to figure out where AI works and where it doesn‚Äôt.</p></blockquote>

## Note on 20th April 2025

<p>Now that Llama has very real competition in open weight models (Gemma 3, latest Mistrals, DeepSeek, Qwen) I think their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/open-ai-model-licenses-often-carry-concerning-restrictions/">janky license</a> is becoming much more of a liability for them. It's just limiting enough that it could be the deciding factor for using something else.</p>

## llm-fragments-github 0.2

date: 2025-04-20, updated: 2025-04-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github/releases/tag/0.2">llm-fragments-github 0.2</a></strong></p>
I upgraded my <code>llm-fragments-github</code> plugin to add a new fragment type called <code>issue</code>. It lets you pull the entire content of a GitHub issue thread into your prompt as a concatenated Markdown file. </p>
<p>(If you haven't seen fragments before I introduced them in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/">Long context support in LLM 0.24 using fragments and template plugins</a>.)</p>
<p>I used it just now to have Gemini 2.5 Pro provide feedback and attempt an implementation of a complex issue against my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">LLM</a> project:</p>
<pre>llm install llm-fragments-github
llm -f github:simonw/llm \
  -f issue:simonw/llm/938 \
  -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>muse on this issue, then propose a whole bunch of code to help implement it<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>Here I'm loading the FULL content of the <code>simonw/llm</code> repo using that <code>-f github:simonw/llm</code> fragment (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">documented here</a>), then loading all of the comments from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/938">issue 938</a> where I discuss quite a complex potential refactoring. I ask Gemini 2.5 Pro to "muse on this issue" and come up with some code.</p>
<p>This worked <em>shockingly</em> well. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5f0c1e8184f4ddc8b71b30890fe690c#response">the full response</a>, which highlighted a few things I hadn't considered yet (such as the need to migrate old database records to the new tree hierarchy) and then spat out a whole bunch of code which looks like a solid start to the actual implementation work I need to do.</p>
<p>I ran this against Google's free Gemini 2.5 Preview, but if I'd used the paid model it would have cost me 202,680 input tokens and 10,460 output tokens for a total of 66.36 cents.</p>
<p>As a fun extra, the new <code>issue:</code> feature itself was written almost entirely by OpenAI o3, again using fragments. I ran this:</p>
<pre>llm -m openai/o3 \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>Here I'm using the ability to pass a URL to <code>-f</code> and giving it the full source of my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/blob/main/llm_hacker_news.py">llm_hacker_news.py</a> plugin (which shows how a fragment can load data from an API) plus the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html">HTML source</a> of my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown">github-issue-to-markdown</a> tool (which I wrote a few months ago <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd1afb97e595b40fdeedebb48be7f4f1">with Claude</a>). I effectively asked o3 to take that HTML/JavaScript tool and port it to Python to work with my fragments plugin mechanism.</p>
<p>o3 provided <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/249e16edffe6350f7265012bee9e3305#response">almost the exact implementation I needed</a>, and even included support for a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable without me thinking to ask for it. Total cost: 19.928 cents.</p>
<p>On a final note of curiosity I tried running this prompt against <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/gemma-3-qat-models/">Gemma 3 27B QAT</a> running on my Mac via MLX and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a>:</p>
<pre>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit

llm -m mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>

<p>That worked <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/feccff6ce3254556b848c27333f52543#response">pretty well too</a>. It turns out a 16GB local model file is powerful enough to write me an LLM plugin now!

I was looking around on my server and came across this neat little tree chart app. I probably wrote it ten years ago, but it still works, the wonder of the open web. Software you write for it tends to still run.

## Past selves

date: 2025-04-20, from: Rachel Kwon blog

Last month I had the chance to travel to two places I previously lived. In early March, I went to London for a work trip, and a couple of weekends ago I went to Chicago for a friend&rsquo;s milestone birthday. It was a strange feeling to revisit these two cities where I&rsquo;d lived and existed before but in the distant past, long enough ago that it felt like I was a different person.
