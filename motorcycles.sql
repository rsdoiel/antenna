But while I have written a decent number of blog posts (public), I haven''t really touched on why I write a blog.</p>\n<p>There isn''t one overarching reason as to why I write in public. However, there are a few things that happen when I write for others.</p>\n<h2 id="it-s-a-way-to-formalise-my-thoughts">It''s a way to formalise my thoughts</h2>\n<p>I''m sure you''ve heard the adage that "writing is thinking". This is an oversimplification, but still rings true. Writing is the process of structuring and expressing my thoughts. I find that writing helps me better understand the underlying material and forces me to query it in a critical manner.</p>\n<p>The mere process of writing leads to better retention (hence why note-taking has been done for centuries), and so when I write about a topic, not only do I understand it better, but I can recall the nuances with greater fluency.</p>\n<h2 id="it-s-a-way-to-connect-with-people">It''s a way to connect with people</h2>\n<p>Quite a few years ago I <a href="/quitting-social-media/">deleted all my social media accounts</a>. Since then I have focused on in-person relationships, and tried my best to break free from the doom scrolling of the modern internet. There is, however, something to be said about having a low-touch circle of acquaintances with common interests.</p>\n<p>This has historically been expressed by letter writing, especially amongst academics, who would write to others in their field to explore ideas and exchange information.</p>\n<p>To a certain extent, my blog functions in a similar way. I regularly receive emails from my readers who expand on, and challenge my understanding of the world.</p>\n<p>It also allows people who are close to me to follow what I''m working on and thinking about, but in a less snipped-up manner than Twitter permits. I much prefer this kind of digital relationship to Twitter followers since the context of the communication contains nuance by default.</p>\n<h2 id="it-s-a-way-to-share-something-i-ve-learned-with-the-world">It''s a way to share something I''ve learned with the world</h2>\n<p>Tangentially related to the last two points, when I learn something new, or stumble upon a novel idea and write about it, not only am I learning and internalising it by structuring my thoughts. I''m also creating new material on the topic, adding my own interpretation, and distributing it within my circles.</p>\n<p>In a world where ChatGPT generated content is quickly becoming the norm, it''s more valuable than ever to have an honest, human-crafted writeup on an interesting topic. In a way I think ChatGPT has made human writing even more precious.</p>\n<h2 id="it-makes-me-a-better-writer-and-communicator">It makes me a better writer and communicator</h2>\n<p>The only way to become a better writer is to write.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://herman.bearblog.dev/on-goal-setting/','On goal-setting',replace('<p>2024 has arrived and with it aspirations to "do better". That isn''t to say 2023 wasn''t a good year. Not by any means. But the earth has reached the specific point in its trajectory around the sun where we define the year as "new" again, and so we arbitrarily decide that it''s the time to do certain things.</p>\n<p>I like that. There''s a lot of hate for New Years Resolutions™. Why choose <em>this</em> time of year to make a change? Any time will technically do. But humans are like that. We like round numbers, symmetrical shapes, patterns, and the beginnings of things.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2023 my brother, partner, and I sat down at a local coffee shop and had a mini-retrospective of how the past year went. It was both a bonding experience, sharing the wins and hardships of the year, but also an external perspective which helped me recognise aspects of the year that I had previously overlooked. It was refreshing.</p>\n<p>We then got to speaking about goals and resolutions for the new year.</p>\n<p>Here''s how I like to set goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep the main focus on 3 goals or fewer</li>\n<li>Define what hitting these goals looks like</li>\n<li>Specify <em>how</em> I will achieve each goal</li>\n<li>Revisit the list a handful of times throughout the year to make sure I''m still on track (or whether my destination has changed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is similar to the SMART goal-setting system, where instead of just trying to do things that <em>feel aligned</em> with my goals, I''m instead proactive about the what and the how. I also find that having only 3 goals is much more sustainable, since reinventing oneself is neigh impossible on January 1st.</p>\n<p>Here''s an example of one of my goals for the year:</p>\n<p><em>Spend more time with friends and nurture existing relationships</em></p>\n<p>What does this look like for me?</p>\n<p>It means that in a given week I will have the "full" feeling that comes with spending quality time with people I love. It means doing neat activities together and creating memories that I will look back on fondly.</p>\n<p>And how will I achieve this?</p>\n<p>The first step is to make plans with friends during the week. This could be dinner, or just a walk in the park. Thursday evenings are generally free (the alternative is finding something good on Netflix, which is getting harder and harder). If I try to make time for an activity with one or a few friends every Thursday evening, I''ll already be in the green with this goal.</p>\n<p>The second step is to nurture existing communities. I am part of a group of other bootstrappy founders who meet about once a month for a good dinner and chat. I find these dinners to be both stimulating and motivational (although the last one left me a bit tender the next day). So, explicitly making time for this and taking initiative in the organisation if necessary are both happy-paths.</p>\n<p>The third step is to plan larger activities like getaways, hikes, or festivals. I''m off to a good start so far just arriving back from a particularly good New Years music festival up the East coast with a great set of people.</p>\n<p>And finally make more time for video calls with friends and family who are in other cities or countries. A big reason "nurture friendships" is a goal for me this year is that there has been an exodus of friends from Cape Town over the past few years (mostly to the UK) and I miss them.</p>\n<p>And that''s how I goal-set. It''s not a perfect system, but I feel it works well for me and it feels <em>right</em>.</p>\n<p>Have a spectacular 2024!</p>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article?

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://herman.bearblog.dev/how-bear-does-analytics-with-css/','How Bear does analytics with CSS',replace('<p>Bear Blog has a few design constraints for speed, efficiency, and stability. There are many great open-source, privacy-focussed analytics platforms out there, but I wanted to build one native to Bear.</p>\n<p><a href="#tldr">tldr;</a></p>\n<p>One of my constraints for Bear is to not use client-side javascript. This applies to the analytics system as well. Client-side javascript can be tweaked to determine the authenticity of traffic to a page and determine (partially) whether it is bot traffic or not, which is very useful for analytics. The main downside, however, is that most adblockers block analytics scripts. And not just the bad ones, like Google Analytics. Even Fathom and Plausible analytics struggle with logging activity on adblocked browsers.</p>\n<p>There''s always the option of just parsing server logs, which gives a rough indication of the kinds of traffic accessing the server. Unfortunately all server traffic is generally seen as equal. Technically bots "should" have a user-agent that identifies them as a bot, but few identify that since they''re trying to scrape information as a "person" using a browser. In essence, just using server logs for analytics gives a skewed perspective to traffic since a lot of it are search-engine crawlers and scrapers (and now GPT-based parsers).</p>\n<p>So instead of using server logs, I trigger a read with CSS. Here''s my slightly boutique analytics system.</p>\n<p>When a person accesses the website the page is loaded.\nOn each page I have the following CSS:</p>\n<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>body:hover {\n    border-image: url("/hit/{{ post.id }}/?ref={{ request.META.HTTP_REFERER }}");\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The only info I need to actively re-add to this request is the referrer (yes, HTTP_REFERER is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer" target="_blank">spelt incorrectly</a>).</p>\n<p>Now, when a person hovers their cursor over the page (or scrolls  on mobile) it triggers <code>body:hover</code> which calls the URL for the post hit. I don''t think any bots hover and instead just use JS to interact with the page, so I can, with reasonable certainty, assume that this is a human reader.</p>\n<p>I then confirm the user-agent isn''t a bot (which isn''t perfect, but still something). I also extract the browser and platform from the user-agent string.</p>\n<p>My second constraint is to not store any identifying information about the reader either in browser cookies, or on the server. In order to do this I use the IP address of the request to determine the country, then hash the IP address along with the date. All subsequent requests to the page are checked for matching IP address + date hashes and duplicates are discarded.</p>\n<p>In this way each IP address per day constitutes one "read" of the page. No IP addresses are stored un-hashed and the IP-with-date-hash creates a convenient built-in expiry time.</p>\n<p>Here''s the code if you''re interested:</p>\n<div

I''m not even talking about the logistics of filing tax returns, but on what taxes are, the different types of tax, and how they work.</p>\n<p>I also regularly hear wide-spread simple misconceptions about tax, which illustrate a gross misunderstanding of the system. I recently heard someone say that they didn''t want to get a raise since that would put them into a higher tax bracket, and they would therefore earn less take-home pay. That''s...not how that works.</p>\n<p>This is an oversight by the government, who sets the (public school) curriculum. We''re taught many things in school that have marginal use later in life. I personally love poetry and finding subtle meaning in words, but it''s not for everyone. It''s not a prerequisite to operate in society. Whereas, everybody is required, by law, to pay taxes.</p>\n<p>By not providing education around tax-literacy many people break the law without even knowing it. They are also much less likely to pay tax due to the daunting, complicated nature of a system they are unfamiliar with.</p>\n<p>Misunderstanding tax also leads to mistrust in government. And a healthy amount of mistrust is necessary in a functioning democracy, but when the system is too opaque, problems become harder to address. Most people have a vague notion that tax is used to pay for things like roads and other infrastructure. However, I think if people fully understood the purpose of taxation and the way that money is regulated and spent, they would be slightly less bitter about it. Maybe.</p>\n<p>I propose making financial literacy a mandatory subject for high school students, with a focus on understanding tax (and a few other things like real-world credit and debt). Teach them how to calculate income tax and capital gains. Show them how to be tax efficient without breaking the law, and about different tax jurisdictions. Hell, teach them how to register a company and the basic structure of a small organisation.</p>\n<p>If we want a future where young people innovate and contribute to the overall well-being of a country, we need to get this right. Knowledge of taxation leads to compliance. And a well funded government (all other things being equal) is better than an underfunded one.</p>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article?

And finally there''s the ability to not do anything, which can be quite nebulous and dangerous if not managed.</p>\n<p>One nice thing about being employed is when you wake up, you know what you''re going to do. You''re going to work. The choice has been made. The structure around that work, and the underlying purpose are set by others and you just need to make it happen. Yes, there is a big variety in occupations, but in general, an employee has to go to work, receive direction, and be productive.</p>\n<p>When you''re working solo, however, there isn''t a specific thing you <em>have</em> to do. No pre-set route to take. If I decide to not do any work today, no-one will notice. But if I continue doing so for too many days things start falling apart. Slowly at first, then rapidly, until everything I''ve built comes toppling down around me.</p>\n<p>Listed below are a few ways I try to stay motivated as a solo-creator:</p>\n<h2 id="i-work-on-things-that-i-find-engaging">I work on things that I find engaging</h2>\n<p>This is the most important point for me, and perhaps the hardest one to fulfil. When going down the early stages of product development the main question on my mind is "If this project works out, do I want to spend the next few years working on it?"</p>\n<p>If the answer is yes, awesome. I keep at it. If no...well, it''s probably not going to succeed anyway.</p>\n<p>Smarter people than I have written at length about finding engaging work, so I won''t delve into it too deeply. I can, however, recommend <a href="http://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> for those interested in the topic of finding meaningful and engaging work.</p>\n<h2 id="i-build-routine-into-my-day">I build routine into my day</h2>\n<p>Since I don''t have a boss to ensure I put in the hours, I have to <strong>choose</strong> to do the work. This is surprisingly difficult at times, especially when the less-interesting things need to be handled (tax returns/bug reports/refund requests).</p>\n<p>And so my day has a fairly simple but dynamic structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffee and a walk with my partner</li>\n<li>Gym for about an hour</li>\n<li>Journal and write</li>\n<li>Work block 1 (about 3 hours)</li>\n<li>Lunch and chill</li>\n<li>Work block 2 (also about 3 hours)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exercise and writing sets me up for the day. It''s my primer and gets me into the right frame of mind.</p>\n<p>The first work block is where I try to tackle the most difficult problems or the tasks with the least inertia. I don''t check my email until after lunch. This is important since I want to focus on the big tasks while I''m fresh, and email has a habit of stealing that freshness away.</p>\n<p>After lunch, and if the momentum is good, I may continue working on my big tasks, but now I allow myself to check my email and open Slack to see if anything else needs my attention. This is my second work block, which handles the myriad of small tasks that come with running a company.</p>\n<p>Do I manage to keep to this structure this every day? No. But I try and mostly succeed. It''s a framework. Sometimes I''m just not feeling it and allow myself a day off to read or play Playstation. Without forcing myself to grind I never get too ground down.</p>\n<h2 id="i-m-intentional-with-my-down-time">I''m intentional with my down-time</h2>\n<p>I''m <a href="/quitting-social-media/">not on traditional social media</a> so don''t have that eating away at my attention, but Hacker News is pretty good at derailing my day. So is YouTube to a lesser extent. To preserve my focus I don''t engage with any of these platforms until the end of the work day. It''s way too easy to open Hacker News and then get nothing else done for the next few hours.</p>\n<p>At around 4 my work day is generally complete and the rest of it is mine to enjoy. I try to not work past 5 since I want to spend time with people I love, get some fresh air, cook a good meal, and decompress so I have the energy and drive to jump in again tomorrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>"You write until you come to a place where you still have your juice and know what will happen next and you stop and try to live through until the next day when you hit it again."</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>~Earnest Hemingway</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leaves me with something to pick up in the morning, and makes getting into the zone slightly easier.</p>\n<h2 id="i-hang-out-with-people-in-my-field">I hang out with people in my field</h2>\n<p>Since I don''t have any coworkers, I don''t get to hang out and talk shop during the work day. To address this I stay active on a Slack community of devs and creators in my country, as well as go to meet-ups and events in interesting communities. I have lunch dates with other creators and founders where we can shoot-the-shit and talk product.</p>\n<p>This keeps me social and sane, provides a sounding board for ideas, and is a nice way to have low-touch, semi-professional relationships. I have my close friends who I enjoy spending time with, but they don''t share my problems, and having the catharsis of being "in the trenches" with others is something I appreciate.</p>\n<h2 id="i-write-about-it">I write about it</h2>\n<p>And finally, I write about my thoughts and experiences. Things I''ve worked on and what I would like to work on next. This post is an example of exactly that.</p>\n<p>Through writing I better understand what I''m doing and how I''m doing it. It''s a public self-retrospective, in a way. I sometimes receive feedback, opinions, and advice from strangers and friends alike. And, most importantly, I enjoy sharing my journey with the world.</p>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article?

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-creative-agency-of-small-projects/','The creative agency of small projects',replace('<p>Since I moved out of the startup world I''ve exclusively worked on small projects. Niche, simple tools packed with love and attention to detail. I''ve written about <a href="/my-product-is-my-garden/">my approach</a> to building, and how it impacts my life and outlook.</p>\n<p>Today, however, I want to write about a less-obvious benefit of building small: The agency to be more creative.</p>\n<p>I used to frequent game-jams back in the day. At the beginning of a jam teams are presented with "the theme". This is a mechanic, or even a single word, around which your game is to be built. It''s a seed from which to grow your own novel idea.</p>\n<p>For example, one game-jam I attended back in 2018 had a single word theme: "waves". During this event I saw interesting interpretations and neat ideas ranging from a game about surfing (a pretty literal interpretation, for sure) to one about trying to figure out if a person on the other side of the street is waving at you, or someone behind you (where you lose points if you awkwardly wave back). There were a few that played with light and sound as well, which I thought was a cool "waves" interpretation.</p>\n<p>Our game was called <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/wheelchair-wizards">Wheelchair Wizards</a>, where 1-4 players control wizards in wheelchairs (moving around by shooting fireballs). All the wizards spawn atop a tower and have to hold off waves (yeah, it''s a pretty loose interpretation) of goblins crawling over the crenelations. We had a great time building it and managed to nab the "most fun" game award for that particular local jam.</p>\n<p>Circling back to building non-game products, having something small creates space to play with new ideas. The first reason is that your "theme" is set and (hopefully) well defined. For example, it''s difficult to pin down what the "theme" of Wordpress is. Whereas <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear''s theme</a> is simple "a super fast blogging platform that gets out of your way".</p>\n<p>The second is that experimentation isn''t expensive (both in terms of time and money) when you build small. A new feature only takes a day or three and many can be easily abandoned. Most ideas aren''t good. Other times you strike gold and merge to master. Now that''s satisfying.</p>\n<p>Then there are self-imposed constraints. At some game jams you can choose to do these optional constraints to receive extra points. Think of them as "achievements". Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your game must be controllable with only one button.</li>\n<li>You can only use a 2 bit colour pallet.</li>\n<li>Local multiplayer.</li>\n<li>All sound effects need to be voice recordings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This adds delight to the building process. Many issues are simple to solve by breaking one of these constraints, but much less satisfying.</p>\n<p>Here''s how I used self-imposed constrains on Bear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No client side Javascript.</li>\n<li>Synchronous everything.</li>\n<li>Pages need to be under 5kb.</li>\n<li>It needs to run on any device (including my Kindle''s browser).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And I''ve held pretty tightly to these constraints. Even Bear''s analytics system is fully server side rendered using SVG graphs. Yes, there''s technically a JS library for that, but then I''d be cheating.</p>\n<p>Am I saying that this is the optimal way to build software? Certainly not. Is it the way I like to build software?</p>\n<p>Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Finding joy in what you''re working on is the difference between a product that feels loved, and a sterile tool. It''s the difference between a hand-made teapot with the oceanic glazing, and the white one you get from Ikea.</p>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article?

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-frustration-loop/','The Frustration Loop',replace('<p>I''ve been engaged in an ongoing war with spammers. Because <a href="https://bearblog.dev" target="_blank">Bear</a> is free-to-use it''s naturally the target of backlink farmers, credit card phishers, illegal drug sellers, online casino advertisers, and crypto shillers.</p>\n<p>I won''t go into too much detail on the causes. I''ve written about them <a href="/the-chatgpt-vs-bear-blog-spam-war/">twice</a> <a href="/5-hours-to-15-minutes/">before</a>. In brief: the barrier to entry is low (easy signup to a free service) which leads to bad actors trying to exploit the platform (usually for backlinks).</p>\n<p>For context, this isn''t bot traffic. It''s instead the kinds of spam farms you can purchase 100 backlinks from on Fiverr. They have a team of a few hundred low paid workers submitting content to every corner of the web in the hopes it will boost SEO ranking (it won''t).</p>\n<p>To combat this, I have a few mechanisms in place. If a piece of spam is posted on Bear, it is by default not visible to the wider internet until reviewed. All unreviewed blogs have "no-index" and "no-follow" tags and do not show up on the sitemap or discovery feed. This is easily resolved by opting into a review. However, I''d still prefer the spam content weren''t on the platform at all, regardless of its discoverability.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a>. This is a spam detection tool by the Wordpress people and is pretty accurate and easy to use. At one point I tried to spin up my own spam detection system using GPT4, but it was less accurate and more expensive than Akismet so I took out a subscription and never looked back.</p>\n<p>Blocking spam on signup worked somewhat, but was easily circumventable by spammers who are well versed in dealing with these kinds of barriers. When a spammer is blocked this action provides them with information about how certain kinds of content are regulated, and hints at how to sidestep those regulations.</p>\n<p>So despite having robust spam detection on creating a blog, some spammers found ways to parade as legitimate blogs, then post spam in less regulated areas, which I would have to manually sniff out and flag.</p>\n<p>This combined with spammers using commercial VPN services like Nord meant that simply blocking posts from certain IP addresses could result in valid users being blocked. Nord VPN alone has several hundred servers all over the world so spammers are rarely hindered by IP bans.</p>\n<p>This lead me to an idea: The Frustration Loop</p>\n<p>The premise is simple. When spam is detected, instead of blocking the blog, fake system error or failure in the most frustrating way possible. Waste their time and make them give up.</p>\n<p>I got the idea from <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/">The Password Game</a> which I highly recommend checking out. Here''s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When spam is detected, clear the form (so all the info needs to re-typed) and throw an error, eg: "Our servers are bearly managing. Try again later."</li>\n<li>Disable pasting in all text areas. We can''t make it too easy.</li>\n<li>Every 5 to 10 seconds the element focus switches to a different input so while they''re typing in one area, they may accidentally start typing in another in a mildly annoying way.</li>\n<li>And finally to top it off, if/when they finally manage to submit the form again, throw a different error, eg: "Ensure content contains necessary parameters."</li>\n<li>Repeat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so they get stuck in my never ending web of frustration and after a while deem the software to be malfunctioning and give up.</p>\n<p><img alt="Anti spam measures" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman-1695212424-0.gif"/></p>\n<p>"Now hold up there Herman! Won''t this be triggered by valid users?" you say.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, but it''s fairly unlikely. In my tests I haven''t managed to trigger it without explicitly performing a dodgy action. On top of that, it''s been running in production for the past 3 months and I''ve only had one user report this as an issue. He was advertising online casinos.</p>\n<p>Did it stop the spammers?</p>\n<p>Yes! Since implementing The Frustration Loop the amount of spam has dropped from about 30% of new blogs, to less than 5% (nothing is perfect). There are a few improvements to be made, and some holes to patch, but it''s working well.</p>\n<p>I was hesitant about writing this post, since by describing The Frustration Loop potential spammers could potentially circumvent it. But somehow I don''t think they read my blog.</p>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article? I write about 1-2 a month.

Walking around Cape Town, whether it be to grab my morning coffee, or to pick up groceries, feels more delightful because of the organic gallery that is my city. Especially when a new piece of art pops up on a previously unremarkable stretch of street. What a cheeky surprise!</p>\n<p>Street art has the magical ability to turn a dingy industrial district into a hyperlocal gallery. Like the philosopher''s stone turning lead into gold, an abandoned warehouse is transformed into a scenic wonderland. A glimpse into an artist''s soul. A wall which used to display "50% off beds" in cracked orange paint is now a colourful montage of animals flying through the neighbourhood. Their destination, uncertain.</p>\n<p><img alt="Street art" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman-1694598954-0.JPG"/></p>\n<p>Over time (and if you take an interest) you''ll start to recognise the different artists by their style. The neighbourhood becomes a treasure hunt where finding a new piece of art is an event. I like to take snapshots to send to my friends along with the location so if they''re in the area, they can see it too.</p>\n<p>Cause this art is ephemeral.</p>\n<p>The above example of the colourful animals is now a construction site for a new block of flats. In a way it''s similar to a gallery in even this, where the murals pass through. Some sticking around for years, and others disappearing into the ether, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p>Street art is the catalyst that turns the old-and-run-down into the new-up-and-coming. A bottom-up revitalisation of an area, and a point of pride amongst its residents.</p>\n<p>There''s something else. Something primordially authentic about street art in particular. Like ancient cave paintings there is no economic reward. Instead it''s the modern handprint on the cave wall saying: "I was here".</p>\n<p><img alt="Cave art hands" src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman-1694599209-0.jpg"/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>If you''re interested in seeing some Cape Town''s street art, this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/capetownstreetart/">Instagram account</a> has a pretty good catalogue.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article?

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://herman.bearblog.dev/passwords-are-fine/','Passwords are fine',replace('<p>I''ve spent too much of my professional life trying to build a better means of authentication.</p>\n<p>For a while I was fixated on Magic Links, then I built a few prototypes of authentication using a combination of token passing and TOTP. And finally, I built a storage-less password manager (another story for another day). When proposals for systems like WebAuthn or Apple Passkeys were published I got excited. To see the world move away from the dated and insecure email/password combo would have really made my day.</p>\n<p>But after a while I lost my fervour. There was a lack of implementation of these strong password-less authentication methods across web-services and apps. There was no transition. Also, my opinions around authentication changed...somewhat.</p>\n<p>I had an article pop up on my feed recently titled "<a href="https://sec.okta.com/articles/2020/04/webauthn-great-and-it-sucks" target="_blank">WebAuthn is great and it sucks</a>" which describes the problem succinctly. While the tech is great, the problem is that nothing supports these new-fangled methods of authentication. I''ve run into a few other problems as well:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Multi-devicing for authentication is a poor user experience. Even having to go click a link in your mailbox sucks.</li>\n<li>People don''t have their phone on them all the time (and some don''t even have a smartphone).</li>\n<li>New users don''t understand these methods of authentication.</li>\n<li>They''re generally much more complicated to implement than a basic email/password combo.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>As a side note, I''m not a fan of single sign-on using Twitter/Google/Facebook due to the inability to migrate to a different service if need be. If Twitter locks you out of your account you''re locked out of all your connected services as well. This is a broader topic, but I just wanted to touch on it before continuing.</em></p>\n<p>Passwords are simple and affordable. We were using them prior to computers ("Open sesame!") and their understandability transferred easily. "But wait!" you say. "Aren''t passwords insecure and easy to compromise?". Well yes...if managed poorly.</p>\n<h4 id="let-s-explore-the-common-pitfalls-of-passwords">Let''s explore the common pitfalls of passwords:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>People can''t remember passwords for their dozens of services.</li>\n<li>Due to #1 people tend to re-use passwords, which makes one compromised service a more wide-spread problem.</li>\n<li>People can have their passwords stolen (generally also due to #1 since they write them down or store them insecurely).</li>\n<li>Services can have their user''s passwords stolen if not stored as a hash (this is a solved problem though, services need to do better).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice that all of these problems are solved by fairly simple password hygiene.</p>\n<p>I personally have one obnoxiously long and complicated password for my password manager, but then all of my other passwords are random lengthly strings which are impossible to guess.</p>\n<p>I don''t ever see them.</p>\n<p>The passwords also aren''t re-used, which solves #2 and my login flow is a super convenient fingerprint scan on both my phone and my laptop. And if I have to manually enter my password on a different device (which is very rare) I can easily pull up my password on my password manager and type it in.</p>\n<p>Not only does a good password manager make people safer, it makes logins much easier since you don''t have to remember "which password I used for this service", then follow the "forgot password" flow.</p>\n<p>I guess the point I''m trying to make here is that the problem with passwords is password hygiene, not with the method itself.</p>\n<p>When ebola was wreaking havoc in Central Africa the most effective intervention was to implement a culture of hand-washing. The UN send healthcare workers out to cities, towns and villages armed with plastic basins and soap, but most importantly, knowledge. It was an effective intervention and the culture of hand-washing persists to this day.</p>\n<p>Password hygiene is imperative for our digital world. Fact is that even if we create the perfect new authentication method, passwords will persist on the vast majority of services. If it ain''t broke...</p>\n<p>Finally, when sharing passwords, it is important to do so securely. Slack is not a secure channel for these kinds of things. I''ve <a href="/thinking-about-passwords/" target="_blank">written</a> about this before and built out a completely free <a href="https://horuspass.com/send" target="_blank">service</a> to share passwords and API keys securely, but any good password manager should have similar functionality.</p>\n<h4 id="recommendation-time">Recommendation time:</h4>\n<p>If you''re an Apple user, then the built in Apple password manager is probably the best solution for you. It''s close to perfect since it allows biometric authentication, syncs between your devices, and is well integrated into their products.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, there are also a bunch of great apps that have similar functionality. <a href="https://1password.com" target="_blank">1Password</a> is a good choice. So is <a href="https://www.dashlane.com" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>. There are others.</p>\n<p>Good passwords combined with an authentication app for 2FA like <a href="https://authy.com" target="_blank">Authy</a> or Google Authenticator are great security. You''ll probably never have an issue. On this note, SMS 2FA is bad. Not only are SIM-swap scams prevalent and fairly easy to execute, but it is also a fragile system and breaks easily ("Didn''t receive the SMS? Click here to retry.").</p>\n<p>On top of that, SMS isn''t universal. My bank only supports SMS 2FA so while I''m travelling I''m effectively cut off from certain functionality. I hate it and have tried to change it, but banks move slowly.</p>\n<p>It''s important for us to get this right. If you have parents (or grandparents) who aren''t particularly tech-savvy, sit them down for an afternoon and teach them about password hygiene. Let''s create a better authentication culture. It will keep everyone safer.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article? I write about 1-2 a month.

Every now and again (say I enter a house which has a no-shoe rule), someone will spot them and find the concept strange, commenting on how weird they look, and if the material between the toes gets annoying. I''m here to tell you why these kinds of socks are the best, and why I can''t go back to foot jail.</p>\n<p>I started wearing toe socks after a broken metatarsal (which healed a bit crooked) from my high-school days started annoying me on long walks. I found that if my toes weren''t jammed together in a little package that pain went away. A good comparison is that regular socks are like mittens. They do their job and are comfortable, but each finger lacks autonomy. Toe socks are more like gloves, allowing your feet to move freely with each toe following its own muse. Your toes get to spread out a bit more and, more importantly for me, your big toe isn''t pulled off-centre by the material.</p>\n<p>I''m not going to get into the (fairly spotty) science about bare-foot running shoes. I''m here to talk about the tangible reasons that toe socks are better than regular socks and why you should probably give them a spin.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>They''re plain better for your toes. Toes want to spread out and be free. Having your toes cramped together by a sleeve all day will fundamentally change the way the foot is shaped and how you walk.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You have better balance. The more surface area your foot has, the better your stability. And even inside a pair of regular gym shoes, with my toe socks on I find I am more firmly planted on the ground.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You don''t get sweaty between your toes. One of the main functions of a sock is to wick moisture away from your skin, and regular socks miss the places where this is the most important. Between your toes. If you''ve ever gotten a fungal infection (like athlete''s foot), you know exactly where it thrives. Toe socks do a good job at preventing this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Inexplicably, they don''t slide down. Regular socks slowly work themselves down into your shoe over a day (depending on the build quality), but toe socks break sock physics and just...don''t.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You don''t get blisters between your toes. If you are a distance runner or hiker, you''ll know how annoying those specific blisters are. This is due to toe-on-toe friction. Since this is now sock-on-sock friction, your toes remain unharmed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They''re delightful and serve as a conversation starter. They look silly. But this is just because they aren''t common. So many good conversations started with a wayward glance at my form-fitting feet fashion.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason toe socks aren''t commonplace is just that they''re harder to manufacture than regular socks. People are used to regular socks and it''s only the weirdos that wear them. Every person I''ve convinced to try toe socks has since made the switch. So go on. Give it a try. I promise big toe sock isn''t paying me.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<h5 id="enjoyed-the-article-i-write-about-1-2-a-month-subscribe-via-email-or-rss-feed">Enjoyed the article? I write about 1-2 a month.
