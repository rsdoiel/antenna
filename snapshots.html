self-doubt in publishing online:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Part of that is knowing who might read it. A lot of the folks who follow
me are smart, opinionated, and not always generous. Some are friends.
Some are people I‚Äôve looked up to. And some are just really loud on the
internet. I saw someone the other day drag a certain writing style. That
kind of judgment makes me want to shrink back and say, never mind.

<h2 id="openai-o3-and-o4-mini-system-card">OpenAI o3 and o4-mini System
Card</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-o4-mini-system-card/">OpenAI
o3 and o4-mini System Card</a></strong>
</p>
I‚Äôm surprised to see a combined System Card for o3 and o4-mini in the
same document - I‚Äôd expect to see these covered separately.
</p>
<p>
The opening paragraph calls out the most interesting new ability of
these models (see also
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">my
notes here</a>). Tool usage isn‚Äôt new, but using tools in the chain of
thought appears to result in some very significant improvements:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The models use tools in their chains of thought to augment their
capabilities; for example, cropping or transforming images, searching
the web, or using Python to analyze data during their thought process.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 3.3 on hallucinations has been gaining a lot of attention.
Emphasis mine:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We tested OpenAI o3 and o4-mini against PersonQA, an evaluation that
aims to elicit hallucinations. PersonQA is a dataset of questions and
publicly available facts that measures the model‚Äôs accuracy on attempted
answers.
</p>
<p>
We consider two metrics: accuracy (did the model answer the question
correctly) and hallucination rate (checking how often the model
hallucinated).
</p>
<p>
The o4-mini model underperforms o1 and o3 on our PersonQA evaluation.
This is expected, as smaller models have less world knowledge and tend
to hallucinate more. <strong>However, we also observed some performance
differences comparing o1 and o3. Specifically, o3 tends to make more
claims overall, leading to more accurate claims as well as more
inaccurate/hallucinated claims.</strong> More research is needed to
understand the cause of this result.
</p>
<table style="margin: 0 auto">

</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
The benchmark score on OpenAI‚Äôs internal PersonQA benchmark (as far as I
can tell no further details of that evaluation have been shared) going
from 0.16 for o1 to 0.33 for o3 is interesting, but I don‚Äôt know if it
it‚Äôs interesting enough to produce dozens of headlines along the lines
of ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äôs o3 and o4-mini hallucinate way higher than previous
models‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
The paper also talks at some length about ‚Äúsandbagging‚Äù. I‚Äôd previously
encountered sandbagging
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/5/sycophancy-sandbagging/">defined
as meaning</a> ‚Äúwhere models are more likely to endorse common
misconceptions when their user appears to be less educated‚Äù. The
o3/o4-mini system card uses a different definition: ‚Äúthe model
concealing its full capabilities in order to better achieve some goal‚Äù -
and links to the recent Anthropic paper
<a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/automated-researchers-sandbag/">Automated
Researchers Can Subtly Sandbag</a>.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell this definition relates to the American English use
of ‚Äúsandbagging‚Äù
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandbag">to mean</a>
‚Äúto hide the truth about oneself so as to gain an advantage over
another‚Äù - as practiced by poker or pool sharks.
</p>
<p>
(Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we could have <em>just one</em> piece of AI
terminology that didn‚Äôt attract multiple competing definitions?)
</p>
<p>
<p>o3 and o4-mini both showed some limited capability to sandbag - to
attempt to hide their true capabilities in safety testing scenarios that
weren‚Äôt fully described. This relates to the idea of ‚Äúscheming‚Äù, which I
wrote about with respect to the GPT-4o model card
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/8/gpt-4o-system-card/#scheming">last
year</a>.</p>

Tim Bray discusses the challenges faced by decentralized Mastodon in
that shared URLs to posts don‚Äôt take into account people accessing
Mastodon via their own instances, which breaks replies/likes/shares etc
unless you further copy and paste URLs around yourself.
</p>
<p>
Tim proposes that the answer is URIs: a registered
<code>fedi://mastodon.cloud/<span class="citation"
data-cites="timbray/109508984818551909">@timbray/109508984818551909</span></code>
scheme could allow Fediverse-aware software to step in and handle those
URIs, similar to how <code>mailto:</code> works.

assisted search-based research actually works now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, updated: 2025-04-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
For the past two and a half years the feature I‚Äôve most wanted from LLMs
is the ability to take on search-based research tasks on my behalf. We
saw the first glimpses of this back in early 2023, with Perplexity
(first launched
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity_AI">December 2022</a>,
first prompt leak
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/22/perplexityai/">in January
2023</a>) and then the GPT-4 powered Microsoft Bing (which
launched/cratered spectacularly
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/15/bing/">in February
2023</a>). Since then a whole bunch of people have taken a swing at this
problem, most notably <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google
Gemini</a> and
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT
Search</a>.
</p>
<p>
Those 2023-era versions were promising but very disappointing. They had
a strong tendency to hallucinate details that weren‚Äôt present in the
search results, to the point that you couldn‚Äôt trust anything they told
you.
</p>
<p>
In this first half of 2025 I think these systems have finally crossed
the line into being genuinely useful.

Deep Research, from three different vendors
</h4>
<p>
First came the <strong>Deep Research</strong> implementations -
<a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/">Google
Gemini</a> and
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">then
OpenAI</a> and
<a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research">then
Perplexity</a> launched products with that name and they were all
impressive: they could take a query, then churn away for several minutes
assembling a lengthy report with dozens (sometimes hundreds) of
citations. Gemini‚Äôs version had a <em>huge</em> upgrade a few weeks ago
when they
<a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/deep-research-gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/">switched
it to using Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, and I‚Äôve had some outstanding results
from it since then.
</p>
<p>
Waiting a few minutes for a 10+ page report isn‚Äôt my ideal workflow for
this kind of tool. I‚Äôm impatient, I want answers faster than that!
</p>
<h4 id="o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">
o3 and o4-mini are really good at search
</h4>
<p>
Last week, OpenAI released
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/">search-enabled
o3 and o4-mini</a> through <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>.
On the surface these look like the same idea as we‚Äôve seen already: LLMs
that have the option to call a search tool as part of replying to a
prompt.
</p>
<p>
But there‚Äôs one <em>very significant</em> difference: these models can
run searches as part of the chain-of-thought reasoning process they use
before producing their final answer.
</p>
<p>
This turns out to be a <em>huge</em> deal. I‚Äôve been throwing all kinds
of questions at ChatGPT (in o3 or o4-mini mode) and getting back
genuinely useful answers grounded in search results. I haven‚Äôt spotted a
hallucination yet, and unlike prior systems I rarely find myself
shouting ‚Äúno, don‚Äôt search for <em>that</em>!‚Äù at the screen when I see
what they‚Äôre doing.
</p>
<p>
Here are four recent example transcripts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805758b-acc8-8006-88a3-bdd78866ee15">Get
me specs including VRAM for RTX 5090 and RTX PRO 6000 - plus release
dates and prices</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68057580-02c8-8006-8ff4-7ae3ce816342">Find
me a website tool that lets me paste a URL in and it gives me a word
count and an estimated reading time</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805756c-4268-8006-82ab-014f7c304622">Figure
out what search engine ChatGPT is using for o3 and o4-mini</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6805755b-4aa0-8006-ab0b-42ae569da6a8">Look
up Cloudflare r2 pricing and use Python to figure out how much this
(screenshot of dashboard) costs</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Talking to o3 feels like talking to a Deep Research tool in real-time,
without having to wait for several minutes for it to produce an
overly-verbose report.
</p>
<p>
My hunch is that doing this well requires a very strong reasoning model.
Evaluating search results is hard, due to the need to wade through huge
amounts of spam and deceptive information. The disappointing results
from previous implementations usually came down to the Web being full of
junk.
</p>
<p>
Maybe o3, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro are the first models to cross the
gullibility-resistance threshold to the point that they can do this
effectively?
</p>
<h4 id="google-and-anthropic-need-to-catch-up">
Google and Anthropic need to catch up
</h4>
<p>
The user-facing <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini
app</a> can search too, but it doesn‚Äôt show me what it‚Äôs searching for.
As a result, I just don‚Äôt trust it. This is a big missed opportunity
since Google presumably have by far the best search index, so they
really should be able to build a great version of this. And Google‚Äôs AI
assisted search on their regular search interface hallucinates
<em>wildly</em> to the point that it‚Äôs actively damaging their brand. I
just checked and Google is still showing slop
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/29/encanto-2/">for Encanto
2</a>!
</p>
<p>
Claude also finally
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/">added web search</a> a
month ago but it doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as good. It‚Äôs
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">using
the Brave search index</a> which I don‚Äôt think is as comprehensive as
Bing or Gemini, and searches don‚Äôt happen as part of that powerful
reasoning flow.
</p>
<h4 id="lazily-porting-code-to-a-new-library-version-via-search">
Lazily porting code to a new library version via search

<p>
The truly magic moment for me came
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/#gemini-2-5-flash-non-thinking">a
few days ago</a>.
</p>
<p>
My
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/18/gemini-image-segmentation/">Gemini
image segmentation tool</a> was using the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/generative-ai"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="google/generative-ai">@google/generative-ai</span></a>
library which has been
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/deprecated-generative-ai-js">loudly
deprecated</a> in favor of the still in preview
<a href="https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai">Google Gen AI SDK <span
class="citation" data-cites="google/genai">@google/genai</span></a>
library.
</p>
<p>
I did <strong>not</strong> feel like doing the work to upgrade. On a
whim, I pasted
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/aa310a4f9cde07d5e8e87572f70fceca532884dd/gemini-mask.html">my
full HTML code</a> (with inline JavaScript) into ChatGPT o4-mini-high
and prompted:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript
library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough
documentation to port this code to it.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(I couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to look up the name of the new library
myself!)
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¶ it did
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68028f7b-11ac-8006-8150-00c4205a2507">exactly
that</a>. It churned away thinking for 21 seconds, ran a bunch of
searches, figured out the new library (which existed <em>way</em>
outside of its training cut-off date), found the
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate">upgrade
instructions</a> and produced
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/d199de213dc3f866a3b8efbcdd2dde34204dc409">a
new version</a> of my code that worked perfectly.
</p>

</p>
<p>
I ran this prompt on my phone out of idle curiosity while I was doing
something else. I was <em>extremely</em> impressed and surprised when it
did exactly what I needed.
</p>
<h4 id="how-does-the-economic-model-for-the-web-work-now-">
How does the economic model for the Web work now?
</h4>
<p>
I‚Äôm writing about this today because it‚Äôs been one of my ‚Äúcan LLMs do
this reliably yet?‚Äù questions for over two years now. I think they‚Äôve
just crossed the line into being useful as research assistants, without
feeling the need to check <em>everything</em> they say with a fine-tooth
comb.
</p>
<p>
I still don‚Äôt trust them not to make mistakes, but I think I might trust
them enough that I‚Äôll skip my own fact-checking for lower-stakes tasks.
</p>
<p>
This also means that a bunch of the potential dark futures we‚Äôve been
predicting for the last couple of years are a whole lot more likely to
become true. Why visit websites if you can get your answers directly
from the chatbot instead?
</p>
<p>
The lawsuits over this
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/#ethics-diabolically-complex">started
flying</a> back when the LLMs were still mostly rubbish. The stakes are
a lot higher now that they‚Äôre actually good at it!
</p>
<p>
I can feel my usage of Google search taking a nosedive already. I expect
a bumpy ride as a new economic model for the Web lurches into view.

What are the origins of Britain‚Äôs original bad boys, The Rolling Stones?
Where did they all come from and how did they meet? What was it about
the 1960s, with its air of sexual liberation, newly elected Labour
government, and rising youth culture that allowed them to burst onto the
musical scene? Who was Brian [‚Ä¶]

<p>
In some tasks, AI is unreliable. In others, it is superhuman. You could,
of course, say the same thing about calculators, but it is also clear
that AI is different. It is already demonstrating general capabilities
and performing a wide range of intellectual tasks, including those that
it is not specifically trained on. Does that mean that o3 and Gemini 2.5
are AGI? Given the definitional problems, I really don‚Äôt know, but I do
think they can be credibly seen as a form of ‚ÄúJagged AGI‚Äù - superhuman
in enough areas to result in real changes to how we work and live, but
also unreliable enough that human expertise is often needed to figure
out where AI works and where it doesn‚Äôt.

Now that Llama has very real competition in open weight models (Gemma 3,

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/open-ai-model-licenses-often-carry-concerning-restrictions/">janky
license</a> is becoming much more of a liability for them. It‚Äôs just
limiting enough that it could be the deciding factor for using something
else.

<p>date: 2025-04-20, updated: 2025-04-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github/releases/tag/0.2">llm-fragments-github
0.2</a></strong>
</p>
I upgraded my <code>llm-fragments-github</code> plugin to add a new
fragment type called <code>issue</code>. It lets you pull the entire
content of a GitHub issue thread into your prompt as a concatenated
Markdown file.
</p>
<p>
(If you haven‚Äôt seen fragments before I introduced them in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/">Long
context support in LLM 0.24 using fragments and template plugins</a>.)
</p>
<p>
I used it just now to have Gemini 2.5 Pro provide feedback and attempt
an implementation of a complex issue against my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">LLM</a> project:
</p>
<pre>llm install llm-fragments-github
llm -f github:simonw/llm \
  -f issue:simonw/llm/938 \
  -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>muse on this issue, then propose a whole bunch of code to help implement it<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
Here I‚Äôm loading the FULL content of the <code>simonw/llm</code> repo
using that <code>-f github:simonw/llm</code> fragment
(<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">documented
here</a>), then loading all of the comments from
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/938">issue 938</a> where I
discuss quite a complex potential refactoring. I ask Gemini 2.5 Pro to
‚Äúmuse on this issue‚Äù and come up with some code.
</p>
<p>
This worked <em>shockingly</em> well. Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5f0c1e8184f4ddc8b71b30890fe690c#response">the
full response</a>, which highlighted a few things I hadn‚Äôt considered
yet (such as the need to migrate old database records to the new tree
hierarchy) and then spat out a whole bunch of code which looks like a
solid start to the actual implementation work I need to do.
</p>
<p>
I ran this against Google‚Äôs free Gemini 2.5 Preview, but if I‚Äôd used the
paid model it would have cost me 202,680 input tokens and 10,460 output
tokens for a total of 66.36 cents.
</p>
<p>
As a fun extra, the new <code>issue:</code> feature itself was written
almost entirely by OpenAI o3, again using fragments. I ran this:
</p>
<pre>llm -m openai/o3 \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
Here I‚Äôm using the ability to pass a URL to <code>-f</code> and giving
it the full source of my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/blob/main/llm_hacker_news.py">llm_hacker_news.py</a>
plugin (which shows how a fragment can load data from an API) plus the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html">HTML
source</a> of my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown">github-issue-to-markdown</a>
tool (which I wrote a few months ago
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd1afb97e595b40fdeedebb48be7f4f1">with
Claude</a>). I effectively asked o3 to take that HTML/JavaScript tool
and port it to Python to work with my fragments plugin mechanism.
</p>
<p>
o3 provided
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/249e16edffe6350f7265012bee9e3305#response">almost
the exact implementation I needed</a>, and even included support for a
<code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable without me thinking to
ask for it. Total cost: 19.928 cents.
</p>
<p>
On a final note of curiosity I tried running this prompt against
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/gemma-3-qat-models/">Gemma
3 27B QAT</a> running on my Mac via MLX and
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a>:
</p>
<pre>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit

llm -m mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
<p>That worked
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/feccff6ce3254556b848c27333f52543#response">pretty
well too</a>. It turns out a 16GB local model file is powerful enough to
write me an LLM plugin now!</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-20, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>Last month I had the chance to travel to two places I previously
lived. In early March, I went to London for a work trip, and a couple of
weekends ago I went to Chicago for a friend‚Äôs milestone birthday. It was
a strange feeling to revisit these two cities where I‚Äôd lived and
existed before but in the distant past, long enough ago that it felt
like I was a different person.</p>
