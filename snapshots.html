<p>Proton (PDF): We believe that Apple’s conduct, as detailed in the
complaint we filed, constitutes further violations of US antitrust law.
Without this case, Apple could get away with behavior in the US that is
already outlawed in the European Union. If this were to happen, American
consumers, and developers focused on the American market, […]</p>

InstCombine: improve optimizations for ceiling division with no overflow
- a PR by Alex Gaynor and Claude Code</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142869">llvm:
InstCombine: improve optimizations for ceiling division with no overflow
- a PR by Alex Gaynor and Claude Code</a></strong>
</p>
Alex Gaynor maintains
<a href="https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1">rust-asn1</a>, and recently
spotted a missing LLVM compiler optimization while hacking on it, with
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/d998511d-45ee-4132-bee4-fe7f70350a67">the
assistance of Claude</a> (Alex works for Anthropic).
</p>
<p>
He describes how he confirmed that optimization in
<a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2025/jun/20/serialize-some-der/">So you
want to serialize some DER?</a>, taking advantage of a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/AliveToolkit/alive2">Alive2</a> to
automatically verify that the potential optimization resulted in the
same behavior.
</p>
<p>
Alex <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/142497">filed
a bug</a>, and then…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Obviously the next move is to see if I can send a PR to LLVM, but it’s
been years since I was doing compiler development or was familiar with
the LLVM internals and I wasn’t really prepared to invest the time and
energy necessary to get back up to speed. But as a friend pointed out…
what about Claude?
</p>
<p>
At this point my instinct was, “Claude is great, but I’m not sure if
I’ll be able to effectively code review any changes it proposes, and I’m
<em>not</em> going to be the asshole who submits an untested and
unreviewed PR that wastes a bunch of maintainer time”. But excitement
got the better of me, and I asked <code>claude-code</code> to see if it
could implement the necessary optimization, based on nothing more than
the test cases.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alex reviewed the resulting code <em>very</em> carefully to ensure he
wasn’t wasting anyone’s time, then submitted
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142869">the PR</a>
and had Claude Code help implement the various changes requested by the
reviewers. The optimization
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/632151fbeea972f4aa3c14921eca1e45c07646f3">landed</a>
two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Alex’s conclusion (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am incredibly leery about
<a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2025/mar/05/generality/">over-generalizing</a>
how to understand the capacity of the models, but at a minimum it seems
safe to conclude that <strong>sometimes you should just let the model
have a shot at a problem and you may be surprised – particularly when
the problem has very clear success criteria</strong>. This only works if
you have the capacity to review what it produces, of course. […]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This echoes Ethan Mollick’s advice to “always invite AI to the table”.
For programming tasks the “very clear success criteria” is extremely
important, as it helps fit the tools-in-a-loop pattern implemented by
coding agents such as Claude Code.
</p>
<p>
LLVM have
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#ai-generated-contributions">a
policy</a> on AI-assisted contributions which is compatible with Alex’s
work here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[…] the LLVM policy is that contributors are permitted to use artificial
intelligence tools to produce contributions, provided that they have the
right to license that code under the project license. Contributions
found to violate this policy will be removed just like any other
offending contribution.
</p>
<p>
While the LLVM project has a liberal policy on AI tool use, contributors
are considered responsible for their contributions. We encourage
contributors to review all generated code before sending it for review
to verify its correctness and to understand it so that they can answer
questions during code review.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Back in April Ben Evans
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@kittylyst/114397697851381604">put out
a call</a> for concrete evidence that LLM tools were being used to solve
non-trivial problems in mature open source projects:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I keep hearing #AI boosters / talking heads claiming that #LLMs have
transformed software development […] Share some AI-derived pull requests
that deal with non-obvious corner cases or non-trivial bugs from mature
#opensource projects.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this LLVM optimization definitely counts!
</p>
<p>
<p>(I also like how this story supports the idea that AI tools amplify
existing human expertise rather than replacing it. Alex had previous
experience with LLVM, albeit rusty, and could lean on that knowledge to
help direct and evaluate Claude’s work.)</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Authors Union blogs</p>
<p>In May 2025, Connecticut’s legislature passed landmark legislation to
address restrictive ebook licensing practices that limit libraries’
ability to serve the public. It aims to ensure ebook licenses align more
closely with  libraries’ core public interest mission of lending,
access, and preservation. This represents a pivotal step toward
safeguarding the role of libraries in the digital age. As more states
consider similar measures, a key question arises: Should authors support
these efforts? The answer is unequivocally yes— and here’s why.</p>

Coding: The Future of Software Development with Agents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU">Agentic
Coding: The Future of Software Development with Agents</a></strong>
</p>
Armin Ronacher delivers a 37 minute YouTube talk describing his
adventures so far with Claude Code and agentic coding methods.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A friend called Claude Code catnip for programmers and it really feels
like this. I haven’t felt so energized and confused and just so willing
to try so many new things… it is really incredibly addicting.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I picked up a bunch of useful tips from this video:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Armin runs Claude Code with the
<code>–dangerously-skip-permissions</code> option, and says this unlocks
a huge amount of productivity. I haven’t been brave enough to do this
yet but I’m going to start using that option while running in a Docker
container to ensure nothing too bad can happen.
</li>
<li>
When your agentic coding tool can run commands in a terminal you can
mostly avoid MCP - instead of adding a new MCP tool, write a script or
add a Makefile command and tell the agent to use that instead. The only
MCP Armin uses is
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">the Playwright
one</a>.
</li>
<li>
Combined logs are a really good idea: have everything log to the same
place and give the agent an easy tool to read the most recent N log
lines.
</li>
<li>
While running Claude Code, use Gemini CLI to run sub-agents, to perform
additional tasks without using up Claude Code’s own context
</li>
<li>
Designing additional tools that provide very clear errors, so the agents
can recover when something goes wrong.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Playwright, Armin has Claude Code perform all sorts of
automated operations via a signed in browser instance as well. “Claude
can debug your CI… it can sign into a browser, click around, debug…” -
he also has it use the <code>gh</code> GitHub CLI tool to interact with
things like <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_workflow">GitHub
Actions workflows</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Lunar Lander is one of the best loves video games of all time. The game
was created in 1969 as an homage to the recent Apollo 11. From there it
would only spread. Just about anything that can print text has it’s own
version of Lunar Lander.
</p>
<p>
The early history of this game is mixed up with something weird: two
nearly identical programming languages. Today we will be using the
history of Lunar Lander as a good excuse to look at an obscure tongue
called FOCAL. This language is so close to BASIC that direct
line-by-line translation is possible. But are the two connected?

<strong><a href="https://chipx86.blog/2025/06/29/tip-use-keyword-only-arguments-in-python-dataclasses/">Tip:
Use keyword-only arguments in Python dataclasses</a></strong>
</p>
<p>Useful tip from Christian Hammond: if you create a Python dataclass
using <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="dataclass">@dataclass</span>(kw_only=True)</code> its
constructor will require keyword arguments, making it easier to add
additional properties in the future, including in subclasses, without
risking breaking existing code.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-your-context">How to Fix Your Context</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html">How
to Fix Your Context</a></strong>
</p>
Drew Breunig has been publishing some very detailed notes on
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/27/context-engineering/">context
engineering</a> recently. In
<a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html">How
Long Contexts Fail</a> he described four common patterns for
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/18/context-rot/">context
rot</a>, which he summarizes like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Context Poisoning</strong>: When a hallucination or other error
makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context Distraction</strong>: When a context grows so long that
the model over-focuses on the context, neglecting what it learned during
training.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context Confusion</strong>: When superfluous information in the
context is used by the model to generate a low-quality response.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context Clash</strong>: When you accrue new information and
tools in your context that conflicts with other information in the
prompt.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
In
<a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html">this
follow-up</a> he introduces neat ideas (and more new terminology) for
addressing those problems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tool Loadout</strong> describes selecting a subset of tools to
enable for a prompt, based on research that shows anything beyond 20 can
confuse some models.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Context Quarantine</strong> is “the act of isolating contexts in
their own dedicated threads” - I’ve called rhis sub-agents in the past,
it’s the pattern
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/2/claude-trace/">used by
Claude Code</a> and explored in depth in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/14/multi-agent-research-system/">Anthropic’s
multi-agent research paper</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Context Pruning</strong> is “removing irrelevant or otherwise
unneeded information from the context”, and <strong>Context
Summarization</strong> is the act of boiling down an accrued context
into a condensed summary. These techniques become particularly important
as conversations get longer and run closer to the model’s token limits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Context Offloading</strong> is “the act of storing information
outside the LLM’s context”. I’ve seen several systems implement their
own “memory” tool for saving and then revisiting notes as they work, but
an even more interesting example recently is how various coding agents
create and update <code>plan.md</code> files as they work through larger
problems.
</p>
<p>
Drew’s conclusion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The key insight across all the above tactics is that <em>context is not
free</em>. Every token in the context influences the model’s behavior,
for better or worse. The massive context windows of modern LLMs are a
powerful capability, but they’re not an excuse to be sloppy with
information management.
</p>

to be devouring Kingmaker by Sonia Purnell, the biography of the famed

that’s the French name, at least, though other countries have something
similar. This means you should often give way to traffic simply because
