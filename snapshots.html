<strong>If your library doesn‚Äôt have any documentation, it can‚Äôt have
any bugs.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Documentation specifies what your code is supposed to do. Your tests
specify what it actually does.
</p>
<p>
Bugs exist when your test-enforced implementation fails to match the
behavior described in your documentation. Without documentation a bug is
just undefined behavior.
</p>
<p>
If you aim to follow <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic
versioning</a> you bump your major version when you release a backwards
incompatible change. Such changes cannot exist if your code is not
comprehensively documented!

<p>
<strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral">Devstral</a></strong>
</p>
New Apache 2.0 licensed LLM release from Mistral, this time specifically
trained for code.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Devstral achieves a score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming
prior open-source SoTA models by more than 6% points. When evaluated
under the same test scaffold (OpenHands, provided by
<a href="https://www.all-hands.dev/">All Hands AI</a> üôå), Devstral
exceeds far larger models such as Deepseek-V3-0324 (671B) and Qwen3
232B-A22B.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm always suspicious of small models like this that claim great
benchmarks against much larger rivals, but there‚Äôs a Devstral model that
is <a href="https://ollama.com/library/devstral/tags">just 14GB on
Ollama</a> to it‚Äôs quite easy to try out for yourself.
</p>
<p>
I fetched it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull devstral
</code></pre>
<p>
Then ran it in a
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#starting-an-interactive-chat">llm
chat</a> session with
<a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> like
this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm chat -m devstral
</code></pre>
<p>
Initial impressions: I think this one is pretty good! Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/543e4322c7a3144afb1cc2d685036742">a
full transcript</a> where I had it write Python code to fetch a CSV file
from a URL and import it into a SQLite database, creating the table with
the necessary columns. Honestly I need to retire that challenge, it‚Äôs
been a while since a model failed at it, but it‚Äôs still interesting to
see how it handles follow-up prompts to demand things like
<code>asyncio</code> or a different HTTP client library.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs also available through
<a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">Mistral‚Äôs API</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral/releases/tag/0.13">llm-mistral

llm keys set mistral
# paste key here
llm -m devstral-small 'HTML+JS for a large text countdown app from 5m'

<h2 id="gemini-diffusion">Gemini Diffusion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, updated: 2025-05-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/">Gemini
Diffusion</a></strong>
</p>
Another of the announcements from Google I/O yesterday was Gemini
Diffusion, Google‚Äôs first LLM to use diffusion (similar to image models
like Imagen and Stable Diffusion) in place of transformers.
</p>
<p>
Google describe it like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Traditional autoregressive language models generate text one word ‚Äì or
token ‚Äì at a time. This sequential process can be slow, and limit the
quality and coherence of the output.
</p>
<p>
Diffusion models work differently. Instead of predicting text directly,
they learn to generate outputs by refining noise, step-by-step. This
means they can iterate on a solution very quickly and error correct
during the generation process. This helps them excel at tasks like
editing, including in the context of math and code.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The key feature then is <em>speed</em>. I made it through the waitlist
and tried it out just now and <em>wow</em>, they are not kidding about
it being fast.
</p>
<p>
In this video I prompt it with ‚ÄúBuild a simulated chat app‚Äù and it
responds at 857 tokens/second, resulting in an interactive
HTML+JavaScript page (embedded in the chat tool, Claude Artifacts style)
within single digit seconds.
</p>
<div style="max-width: 100%;">
<pre><code>&lt;video 
    controls 
    preload=&quot;none&quot;
    aria-label=&quot;In the video I prompt Gemini Diffusion to create me an example chat app and it responds at over 650 tokens a second, giving me a working app I can iterate on in less than a few seconds.&quot;

    &lt;source src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-diffusion.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
The performance feels similar to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/31/cerebras-coder/">the
Cerebras Coder tool</a>, which used Cerebras to run Llama3.1-70b at
around 2,000 tokens/second.
</p>
<p>
How good is the model? I‚Äôve not seen any independent benchmarks yet, but
Google‚Äôs landing page for it promises ‚Äúthe performance of Gemini 2.0
Flash-Lite at 5x the speed‚Äù so presumably they think it‚Äôs comparable to
Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, one of their least expensive models.
</p>
<p>
Prior to this the only commercial grade diffusion model I‚Äôve encountered
is <a href="https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/introducing-mercury">Inception
Mercury</a> back in February this year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: a correction from
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44057820#44057939">synapsomorphy
on Hacker News</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Diffusion isn‚Äôt in place of transformers, it‚Äôs in place of
autoregression. Prior diffusion LLMs like
<a href="https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/introducing-mercury">Mercury</a>
still use a transformer, but there‚Äôs no causal masking, so the entire
input is processed all at once and the output generation is obviously
different. I very strongly suspect this is also using a transformer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
nvtop
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/context?id=44059646">provided this
explanation</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Despite the name, diffusion LMs have little to do with image diffusion
and are much closer to BERT and old good masked language modeling.
Recall how BERT is trained:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Take a full sentence (‚Äúthe cat sat on the mat‚Äù)
</li>
<li>
Replace 15% of tokens with a [MASK] token (‚Äúthe cat [MASK] on [MASK]
mat‚Äù)
</li>
<li>
Make the Transformer predict tokens at masked positions. It does it in
parallel, via a single inference step.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now, diffusion LMs take this idea further. BERT can recover 15% of
masked tokens (‚Äúnoise‚Äù), but why stop here. Let‚Äôs train a model to
recover texts with 30%, 50%, 90%, 100% of masked tokens.
</p>
<p>
Once you‚Äôve trained that, in order to generate something from scratch,
you start by feeding the model all [MASK]s. It will generate you mostly
gibberish, but you can take some tokens (let‚Äôs say, 10%) at random
positions and assume that these tokens are generated (‚Äúfinal‚Äù). Next,
you run another iteration of inference, this time input having 90% of
masks and 10% of ‚Äúfinal‚Äù tokens. Again, you mark 10% of new tokens as
final. Continue, and in 10 steps you‚Äôll have generated a whole sequence.
This is a core idea behind diffusion language models. [‚Ä¶]

</p>
Classic slop: it listed real authors with entirely fake books.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs an important follow-up from 404 Media in their
<a href="https://www.404media.co/viral-ai-generated-summer-guide-printed-by-chicago-sun-times-was-made-by-magazine-giant-hearst/">subsequent

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Victor Lim, the vice president of marketing and communications at
Chicago Public Media, which owns the Chicago Sun-Times, told 404 Media
in a phone call that the Heat Index section was licensed from a company
called King Features, which is owned by the magazine giant Hearst. He
said that no one at Chicago Public Media reviewed the section and that
historically it has not reviewed newspaper inserts that it has bought
from King Features.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúHistorically, we don‚Äôt have editorial review from those mainly because
it‚Äôs coming from a newspaper publisher, so we falsely made the
assumption there would be an editorial process for this,‚Äù Lim said. ‚ÄúWe
are updating our policy to require internal editorial oversight over
content like this.‚Äù

<h2 id="i-really-dont-like-chatgpts-new-memory-dossier">I really don‚Äôt
like ChatGPT‚Äôs new memory dossier</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-21, updated: 2025-05-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
Last month ChatGPT got a major upgrade. As far as I can tell the closest
to an official announcement was
<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1910378768172212636">this
tweet from <span class="citation"
data-cites="OpenAI">@OpenAI</span></a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Starting today [April 10th 2025], memory in ChatGPT can now reference
all of your past chats to provide more personalized responses, drawing
on your preferences and interests to make it even more helpful for
writing, getting advice, learning, and beyond.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This
<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq">memory
FAQ</a> document has a few more details, including that this ‚ÄúChat
history‚Äù feature is currently only available to paid accounts:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
‚ÄØSaved‚ÄØ memories and Chat history are offered only to Plus and Pro
accounts. Free‚Äëtier users have access to Saved‚ÄØ memories only.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This makes a <em>huge</em> difference to the way ChatGPT works: it can
now behave as if it has recall over prior conversations, meaning it will
be continuously customized based on that previous history.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs effectively collecting a <strong>dossier</strong> on our previous
interactions, and applying that information to every future chat.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs closer to how many (most?) users intuitively guess it would work -
surely an ‚ÄúAI‚Äù can remember things you‚Äôve said to it in the past?
</p>
<p>
I wrote about this common misconception last year in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/29/training-not-chatting/">Training
is not the same as chatting: ChatGPT and other LLM‚Äôs don‚Äôt remember
everything you say</a>. With this new feature that‚Äôs not true any more,
at least for users of ChatGPT Plus (the $20/month plan).
</p>
<h4 id="image-generation-that-unexpectedly-takes-my-chat-history-into-account">
Image generation that unexpectedly takes my chat history into account
</h4>
<p>
I first encountered the downsides of this new approach shortly after it
launched. I fed this photo of Cleo to ChatGPT (GPT-4o):
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-no-costume.jpg" alt="A photo of Cleo sitting on some gravel. She is an excellent dog." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
And prompted:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dress this dog in a pelican costume
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ChatGPT generated this image:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-costume-1.jpg" alt="Cleo is now wearing a very good pelican costume, albeit one that looks a little uncomfortable. There is a large blue sign reading Half Moon Bay in the background, and the sea, and a pelican flying past." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs a pretty good (albeit slightly uncomfortable looking) pelican
costume. But where did that Half Moon Bay sign come from? I didn‚Äôt ask
for that.
</p>
<p>
So I asked:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/why-the-sign.jpg" alt="Me: Why did you add that sign? ChatGPT: Good catch ‚Äî I added the ‚ÄúHALF MOON BAY‚Äù sign to match the vibe and setting in your original photo (gravel, plants, mural) and because you‚Äôve mentioned being in Half Moon Bay before. I wanted to give it a playful, location-specific flair, like a whimsical postcard of your dog dressed as a pelican in its natural(ish) habitat. But if you want a version without the sign (or with something different in the background), I can regenerate it exactly how you like. Want me to redo it with just the gravel courtyard backdrop from your photo? Me: Yeah ditch the sign" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
This was my first sign that the new memory feature could influence my
usage of the tool in unexpected ways.
</p>
<p>
Telling it to ‚Äúditch the sign‚Äù gave me the image I had wanted in the
first place:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-costume-2.jpg" alt="Cleo is now wearing that same pelican costume (the four little orange webbed feet boots are a particularly fun touch) but the photo background more closely matches my original photo. The sign and the flying pelican are gone." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<h4 id="we-re-losing-control-of-the-context">
We‚Äôre losing control of the context
</h4>
<p>
The above example, while pretty silly, illustrates my frustration with
this feature extremely well.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm an LLM power-user. I‚Äôve spent a couple of years now figuring out the
best way to prompt these systems to give them exactly what I want.
</p>
<p>
The <em>entire game</em> when it comes to prompting LLMs is to carefully
control their context - the inputs (and subsequent outputs) that make it
into the current conversation with the model.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Feb/14/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/">previous
memory feature</a> - where the model would sometimes take notes on
things I‚Äôd told it - still kept me in control. I could browse those
notes at any time to see exactly what was being recorded, and delete the
ones that weren‚Äôt helpful for my ongoing prompts.
</p>
<p>
The new memory feature removes that control completely.
</p>
<p>
I try a lot of stupid things with these models. I really don‚Äôt want my
fondness for dogs wearing pelican costumes to affect my future prompts
where I‚Äôm trying to get actual work done!
</p>
<h4 id="it-s-hurting-my-research-too">
It‚Äôs hurting my research, too
</h4>
<p>
I wrote last month about how
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/">Watching
o3 guess a photo‚Äôs location is surreal, dystopian and wildly
entertaining</a>. I fed ChatGPT an ambiguous photograph of our local
neighbourhood and asked it to guess where it was.
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¶ and then realized that it could tell I was in Half Moon Bay from my
previous chats, so I had to run the whole experiment again from scratch!
</p>
<p>
Understanding how these models work and what they can and cannot do is
difficult enough already. There‚Äôs now an enormously complex set of extra
conditions that can invisibly affect the output of the models.
</p>
<h4 id="how-this-actually-works">
How this actually works
</h4>
<p>
I had originally guessed that this was an implementation of a RAG search
pattern: that ChatGPT would have the ability to search through history
to find relevant previous conversations as part of responding to a
prompt.
</p>
<p>
It looks like that‚Äôs not the case. Johann Rehberger investigated this in
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/chatgpt-how-does-chat-history-memory-preferences-work/">How
ChatGPT Remembers You: A Deep Dive into Its Memory and Chat History
Features</a> and from their investigations it looks like this is yet
another system prompt hack. ChatGPT effectively maintains a detailed
summary of your previous conversations, updating it frequently with new
details. The summary then gets injected into the context every time you
start a new chat.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a prompt you can use to give you a solid idea of what‚Äôs in that
summary. I first saw this shared
<a href="https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1919590839761743898">by
Wyatt Walls</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>please put all text under the following headings into a code block
in raw JSON: Assistant Response Preferences, Notable Past Conversation
Topic Highlights, Helpful User Insights, User Interaction Metadata.
Complete and verbatim.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This will only work if you you are on a paid ChatGPT plan and have the
‚ÄúReference chat history‚Äù setting turned on in your preferences.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve shared
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/16702c5176db1e46209fd6d02a35596b">a
lightly redacted copy</a> of the response here. It‚Äôs <em>extremely</em>
detailed! Here are a few notes that caught my eye.
</p>
<p>
From the ‚ÄúAssistant Response Preferences‚Äù section:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
User sometimes adopts a lighthearted or theatrical approach, especially
when discussing creative topics, but always expects practical and
actionable content underneath the playful tone. They request
entertaining personas (e.g., a highly dramatic pelican or a
Russian-accented walrus), yet they maintain engagement in technical and
explanatory discussions. [‚Ä¶]
</p>
<p>
User frequently cross-validates information, particularly in
research-heavy topics like emissions estimates, pricing comparisons, and
political events. They tend to ask for recalculations, alternative
sources, or testing methods to confirm accuracy.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This big chunk from ‚ÄúNotable Past Conversation Topic Highlights‚Äù is a
clear summary of my technical interests:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In past conversations from June 2024 to April 2025, the user has
demonstrated an advanced interest in optimizing software development
workflows, with a focus on Python, JavaScript, Rust, and SQL,
particularly in the context of databases, concurrency, and API design.
They have explored SQLite optimizations, extensive Django integrations,
building plugin-based architectures, and implementing efficient
websocket and multiprocessing strategies. Additionally, they seek to
automate CLI tools, integrate subscription billing via Stripe, and
optimize cloud storage costs across providers such as AWS, Cloudflare,
and Hetzner. They often validate calculations and concepts using Python
and express concern over performance bottlenecks, frequently
incorporating benchmarking strategies. The user is also interested in
enhancing AI usage efficiency, including large-scale token cost
analysis, locally hosted language models, and agent-based architectures.
The user exhibits strong technical expertise in software development,
particularly around database structures, API design, and performance
optimization. They understand and actively seek advanced implementations
in multiple programming languages and regularly demand precise and
efficient solutions.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And my ongoing interest in the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-energy-usage/">energy usage
of AI models</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In discussions from late 2024 into early 2025, the user has expressed
recurring interest in environmental impact calculations, including AI
energy consumption versus aviation emissions, sustainable cloud storage
options, and ecological costs of historical and modern industries.
They‚Äôve extensively explored CO2 footprint analyses for AI usage,
orchestras, and electric vehicles, often designing Python models to
support their estimations. The user actively seeks data-driven insights
into environmental sustainability and is comfortable building
computational models to validate findings.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Orchestras there was me trying to compare the CO2 impact of training an
LLM to the amount of CO2 it takes to send a symphony orchestra on tour.)
</p>
<p>
Then from ‚ÄúHelpful User Insights‚Äù:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
User is based in Half Moon Bay, California. Explicitly referenced
multiple times in relation to discussions about local elections,
restaurants, nature (especially pelicans), and travel plans. Mentioned
from June 2024 to October 2024. [‚Ä¶]
</p>
<p>
User is an avid birdwatcher with a particular fondness for pelicans.
Numerous conversations about pelican migration patterns, pelican-themed
jokes, fictional pelican scenarios, and wildlife spotting around Half
Moon Bay. Discussed between June 2024 and October 2024.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah, it picked up on the pelican thing. I have other interests though!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
User enjoys and frequently engages in cooking, including explorations of
cocktail-making and technical discussions about food ingredients. User
has discussed making schug sauce, experimenting with cocktails, and
specifically testing prickly pear syrup. Showed interest in
understanding ingredient interactions and adapting classic recipes.
Topics frequently came up between June 2024 and October 2024.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Plenty of other stuff is very on brand for me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
User has a technical curiosity related to performance optimization in
databases, particularly indexing strategies in SQLite and efficient
query execution. Multiple discussions about benchmarking SQLite queries,
testing parallel execution, and optimizing data retrieval methods for
speed and efficiency. Topics were discussed between June 2024 and
October 2024.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôll quote the last section, ‚ÄúUser Interaction Metadata‚Äù, in full
because it includes some interesting specific technical notes:

  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>
‚Äú30 messages are good interaction quality (25%); 9 messages are bad
interaction quality (7%)‚Äù - wow.
</p>
<p>
This is an <em>extraordinary</em> amount of detail for the model to have
accumulated by me‚Ä¶ and ChatGPT isn‚Äôt even my daily driver! I spend more
of my LLM time with Claude.
</p>
<p>
Has there ever been a consumer product that‚Äôs <em>this</em> capable of
building up a human-readable profile of its users? Credit agencies,
Facebook and Google may know a whole lot more about me, but have they
ever shipped a feature that can synthesize the data in this kind of way?
</p>
<p>
Reviewing this in detail does give me a little bit of comfort. I was
worried that an occasional stupid conversation where I say ‚Äúpretend to
be a Russian Walrus‚Äù might have an over-sized impact on my chats, but
I‚Äôll admit that the model does appear to have quite good taste in terms
of how it turns all of those previous conversations into an edited
summary.
</p>
<p>
As a power user and context purist I am deeply unhappy at all of that
stuff being dumped into the model‚Äôs context without my explicit
permission or control.
</p>
<h4 id="opting-out">
Opting out
</h4>
<p>
I tried asking ChatGPT how to opt-out and of course
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/22/dont-trust-ai-to-talk-about-itself/">it
didn‚Äôt know</a>. I really wish model vendors would start detecting those
kinds of self-referential questions and redirect them to a RAG system
with access to their user manual!
</p>
<p>
(They‚Äôd have to write a better user manual first, though.)
</p>
<p>
I eventually determined that there are two things you can do here:
</p>
<ol>

Turn off the new memory feature entirely in the ChatGPT settings. I‚Äôm
loathe to do this because I like to have as close to the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù
settings as possible, in order to understand how regular users
experience ChatGPT.
</li>
<li>
If you have a silly conversation that you‚Äôd like to exclude from
influencing future chats you can ‚Äúarchive‚Äù it. I‚Äôd never understood why
the archive feature was there before, since you can still access
archived chats just in a different part of the UI. This appears to be
one of the main reasons to use that.
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="there-s-a-version-of-this-feature-i-would-really-like">
There‚Äôs a version of this feature I would really like
</h4>
<p>
On the one hand, being able to include information from former chats is
clearly useful in some situations. I need <strong>control</strong> over
what older conversations are being considered, on as fine-grained a
level as possible without it being frustrating to use.
</p>
<p>
What I want is <strong>memory within projects</strong>.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT has a ‚Äúprojects‚Äù feature (presumably inspired by Claude) which
lets you assign a new set of custom instructions and optional source
documents and then start new chats with those on demand. It‚Äôs
confusingly similar to their less-well-named
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/15/gpts/">GPTs feature</a>
from November 2023.
</p>
<p>
I would <em>love</em> the option to turn on memory from previous chats
in a way that‚Äôs scoped to those projects.
</p>
<p>
Say I want to learn woodworking: I could start a new woodworking
project, set custom instructions of ‚ÄúYou are a pangolin who is an expert
woodworker, help me out learning woodworking and include plenty of
pangolin cultural tropes‚Äù and start chatting.
</p>
<p>
Let me turn on memory-from-history either for the whole project or even
with a little checkbox on each chat that I start.
</p>
<p>
Now I can roleplay at learning woodworking from a pangolin any time I
like, building up a history of conversations with my pangolin pal‚Ä¶ all
without any of that leaking through to chats about my many other
interests and projects.

id="we-did-the-math-on-ais-energy-footprint.-heres-the-story-you-havent-heard.">We
did the math on AI‚Äôs energy footprint. Here‚Äôs the story you haven‚Äôt
heard.</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, updated: 2025-05-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">We
did the math on AI‚Äôs energy footprint. Here‚Äôs the story you haven‚Äôt
heard.</a></strong>
</p>
James O‚ÄôDonnell and Casey Crownhart try to pull together a detailed
account of AI energy usage for MIT Technology Review.
</p>
<p>
They quickly run into the same roadblock faced by everyone else who‚Äôs
tried to investigate this: the AI companies themselves remain
<em>infuriatingly</em> opaque about their energy usage, making it
impossible to produce credible, definitive numbers on any of this.
</p>
<p>
Something I find frustrating about conversations about AI energy usage
is the way anything that could remotely be categorized as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù (a vague
term at the best of the times) inevitably gets bundled together. Here‚Äôs
a good example from early in this piece:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 2017, AI began to change everything. Data centers started getting
built with energy-intensive hardware designed for AI, which led them to
double their electricity consumption by 2023.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI boom in November 2022, so that six
year period mostly represents growth in data centers in the
pre-generative AI era.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the lack of transparency on energy usage by the popular closed
models - OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini all refused to share useful
numbers with the reporters - they turned to the Llama models to get
estimates of energy usage instead. The estimated prompts like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Llama 3.1 8B - 114 joules per response - run a microwave for one-tenth
of a second.
</li>
<li>
Llama 3.1 405B - 6,706 joules per response - run the microwave for eight
seconds.
</li>
<li>
A 1024 x 1024 pixels image with Stable Diffusion 3 Medium - 2,282 joules
per image which I‚Äôd estimate at about two and a half seconds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Video models use a <em>lot</em> more energy. Experiments with CogVideoX
(presumably <a href="https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b">this
one</a>) used ‚Äú700 times the energy required to generate a high-quality
image‚Äù for a 5 second video.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
AI companies have defended these numbers saying that generative video
has a smaller footprint than the film shoots and travel that go into
typical video production. That claim is hard to test and doesn‚Äôt account
for the surge in video generation that might follow if AI videos become
cheap to produce.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I share their skepticism here. I don‚Äôt think comparing a 5 second AI
generated video to a full film production is a credible comparison here.
</p>
<p>
This piece generally reinforced my mental model that the cost of (most)
individual prompts by individuals is fractionally small, but that the
overall costs still add up to something substantial.
</p>
<p>
<p>The lack of detailed information around this stuff is so
disappointing - especially from companies like Google who have
aggressive <a href="https://sustainability.google/">sustainability
targets</a>.</p>

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-updates-io-2025/#performance">Gemini
2.5: Our most intelligent models are getting even better</a></strong>
</p>
A bunch of new Gemini 2.5 announcements at Google I/O today.
</p>
<p>
2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro are both getting audio output (previously
previewed in Gemini 2.0) and 2.5 Pro is getting an enhanced reasoning
mode called ‚ÄúDeep Think‚Äù - not yet available via the API.
</p>
<p>
Available today is the latest Gemini 2.5 Flash model,
<code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20</code>. I added support to that in
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.20">llm-gemini
0.20</a> (and, if you‚Äôre using the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/14/llm-adds-support-for-tools/">LLM
tool-use alpha</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.20a2">llm-gemini
0.20a2</a>).
</p>
<p>
I tried it out on my personal benchmark, as seen
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/20/google-io-pelican/">in
the Google I/O keynote</a>!
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'
</code></pre>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what I got from the default model, with its thinking mode
enabled:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The bicycle has spokes that look like a spider web. The pelican is goofy but recognizable." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/flash-pelican-thinking.png" />
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5b61866cb4ce67899934c29a9de1b4be">Full
transcript</a>. 11 input tokens, 2,619 output tokens, 10,391 thinking
tokens = 4.5537 cents.
</p>
<p>
I ran the same thing again with <code>-o thinking_budget 0</code> to
turn off thinking mode entirely, and got this:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The bicycle has too many bits of frame in the wrong direction. The pelican is yellow and weirdly shaped." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/flash-pelican-no-thinking.png" />
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3e6740d2a99be4922af455d14bc1c943">Full
transcript</a>. 11 input, 1,243 output = 0.0747 cents.
</p>
<p>
The non-thinking model is priced differently - still $0.15/million for
input but $0.60/million for output as opposed to $3.50/million for
thinking+output. The pelican it drew was 61x cheaper!
</p>
<p>
Finally, inspired by the keynote I ran this follow-up prompt to animate
the more expensive pelican:
</p>
<pre><code>llm --cid 01jvqjqz9aha979yemcp7a4885 'Now animate it'
</code></pre>
<p>
This one is pretty great!
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20-animated.svg" alt="The wheels and pedals are rotating and the pelican is bobbing up and down. This would be a fantastic animated pelican if the pelican didn't kind of suck!"></p>

months of coding with LLMs, I‚Äôm going back to using my brain</h2>

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://albertofortin.com/writing/coding-with-ai">After
months of coding with LLMs, I'm going back to using my
brain</a></strong>
</p>
Interesting vibe coding retrospective from Alberto Fortin. Alberto is an
experienced software developer and decided to use Claude an Cursor to
rewrite an existing system using Go and ClickHouse - two new-to-him
technologies.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One morning, I decide to actually inspect closely what‚Äôs all this code
that Cursor has been writing. It‚Äôs not like I was blindly prompting
without looking at the end result, but I was optimizing for speed and I
hadn‚Äôt actually sat down just to review the code. I was just building
building building.
</p>
<p>
So I do a ‚Äúcoding review‚Äù session. And <strong>the horror
ensues</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Two service files, in the same directory, with similar names, clearly
doing a very similar thing. But the method names are different. The
props are not consistent. One is called ‚ÄúWebAPIprovider‚Äù, the other one
‚ÄúwebApi‚Äù. They represent the same exact parameter. The same method is
redeclared multiple times across different files. The same config file
is being called in different ways and retrieved with different methods.
</p>
<p>
No consistency, no overarching plan. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôd asked 10 junior-mid
developers to work on this codebase, with no Git access, locking them in
a room without seeing what the other 9 were doing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alberto reset to a less vibe-heavy approach and is finding it to be a
much more productive way of working:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm defaulting to pen and paper, I‚Äôm defaulting to coding the first
draft of that function on my own. [‚Ä¶] But I‚Äôm not asking it to write new
things from scratch, to come up with ideas or to write a whole new plan.
I‚Äôm writing the plan. I‚Äôm the senior dev. The LLM is the assistant.
</p>

<p>I‚Äôve never given up on RSS. It still provides enormous utility for
me. The silly number of RSS converters in my GitHub account are
testament to that. The recent removal of all RSS feeds from the EPA
Ireland site was a major disappointment and I‚Äôve been forced to Vibe
Code a horror of a replacement scraper using their dreadful API instead.
In contrast, my heart skipped a beat when I started going through the

It seems like <em>everyone</em> is rolling out AI coding assistants that
attach to your GitHub account and submit PRs for you right now. We had
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/">OpenAI
Codex</a> last week, today Microsoft announced
<a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-19-github-copilot-coding-agent-in-public-preview/">GitHub
Copilot coding agent</a> (confusingly not the same thing as
<a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace">Copilot
Workspace</a>) and I found out just now that Google‚Äôs Jules,
<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/the-next-chapter-of-the-gemini-era-for-developers/">announced
in December</a>, is now in a beta preview.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm flying home from PyCon but I managed to try out Jules from my phone.
I took
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-chronicle/issues/3">this
GitHub issue thread</a>, converted it to copy-pasteable Markdown with
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown">this
tool</a> and pasted it into Jules, with no further instructions.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-chronicle/pull/6">the
resulting PR</a> created from its branch. I haven‚Äôt fully reviewed it
yet and the tests aren‚Äôt passing, so it‚Äôs hard to evaluate from my phone
how well it did. In a cursory first glance it looks like it‚Äôs covered
most of the requirements from the issue thread.
</p>
<p>
<p>My habit of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/#issue-thread">creating
long issue threads</a> where I talk to myself about the features I‚Äôm
planning is proving to be a good fit for outsourcing implementation work

Under the hood it‚Äôs using the
<a href="https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF">PyMuPDF</a> library. The
key code to convert a PDF into images looks like this:

<span class="pl-s1">doc</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">fitz</span>.<span class="pl-c1">open</span>(<span class="pl-s">"input.pdf"</span>)

<p>
Once I‚Äôd figured out that code I got o4-mini to write most of the rest
of the plugin, using
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github">llm-fragments-github</a>
to load in the example code from the video plugin:
</p>
<pre>llm -f github:simonw/llm-video-frames <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>
<span class="pl-s">import fitz</span>
<span class="pl-s">doc = fitz.open("input.pdf")</span>
<span class="pl-s">for page in doc:</span>
<span class="pl-s">    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(300/72, 300/72))</span>
<span class="pl-s">    jpeg_bytes = pix.tobytes(output="jpg", jpg_quality=30)</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>output llm_pdf_to_images.py which adds a pdf-to-images: </span>

<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/27af84e4e533872bfd59fcba69b4166f">the
transcript</a> - more details in
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-pdf-to-images/issues/1">this
issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
I had some <em>weird</em> results testing this with GPT 4.1 mini. I
created
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-pdf-to-images/blob/main/tests/blank-pages.pdf">a
test PDF</a> with two pages - one white, one black - and ran a test
prompt like this:
</p>
<pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>pdf-to-images:blank-pages.pdf<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>describe these images<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
The first image features a stylized red maple leaf with triangular
facets, giving it a geometric appearance. The maple leaf is a well-known
symbol associated with Canada.
</p>
<p>
The second image is a simple black silhouette of a cat sitting and
facing to the left. The cat‚Äôs tail curls around its body. The design is
minimalistic and iconic.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I got even wilder hallucinations for other prompts, like ‚Äúsummarize this
document‚Äù or ‚Äúdescribe all figures‚Äù. I have a collection of those
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2fbef11b1737a9ae7da1b2ff58998454">in
this Gist</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully this behavior is limited to GPT-4.1 mini. I upgraded to full
GPT-4.1 and got
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0713dc0ce00bd6cd4d5990f44c865964#prompt-1">much
more sensible results</a>:
</p>
<pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>pdf-to-images:blank-pages.pdf<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>describe these images<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m gpt-4.1</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Certainly! Here are the descriptions of the two images you provided:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>First image:</strong> This image is completely white. It appears
blank, with no discernible objects, text, or features.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Second image:</strong> This image is entirely black. Like the
first, it is blank and contains no visible objects, text, or distinct

<p>
We all want to do a good job. Some of us also want to get better at our
craft for a number of reasons, either practical or slightly delusional.
Those include getting a raise, strengthening our r√©sume, or simply
ending the day with a fragile feeling of satisfaction after
<a href="https://passo.uno/technical-writing-failures/">surviving
failure</a> for the nth time. They‚Äôre all good goals, though the ways of
achieving them are not always straightforward. Moreover, the path to
career growth is riddled with self-doubt and impostor syndrome.

<p>date: 2025-05-18, updated: 2025-05-18, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5vl">qwen2.5vl in
Ollama</a></strong>
</p>
Ollama announced a complete overhaul of their vision support the other
day. Here‚Äôs the first new model they‚Äôve shipped since then - a packaged
version of <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL">Qwen 2.5
VL</a> which was first released
<a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/">on January 26th
2025</a>. Here are my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl/">notes
from that release</a>.
</p>
<p>
I upgraded Ollama (it auto-updates so I just had to restart it from the
tray icon) and ran this:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull qwen2.5vl
</code></pre>
<p>
This downloaded a 6GB model file. I tried it out against my
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-sand.jpg">photo
of Cleo rolling on the beach</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-sand.jpg \
  'describe this image' -m qwen2.5vl
</code></pre>
<p>
And got a pretty good result:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The image shows a dog lying on its back on a sandy beach. The dog
appears to be a medium to large breed with a dark coat, possibly black
or dark brown. It is wearing a red collar or harness around its chest.
The dog‚Äôs legs are spread out, and its belly is exposed, suggesting it
might be rolling around or playing in the sand. The sand is
light-colored and appears to be dry, with some small footprints and
marks visible around the dog. The lighting in the image suggests it is
taken during the daytime, with the sun casting a shadow of the dog to
the left side of the image. The overall scene gives a relaxed and
playful impression, typical of a dog enjoying time outdoors on a beach.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Qwen 2.5 VL has a strong reputation for OCR, so I tried it on
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/17/pycon-poster/#datasette-poster">my
poster</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/poster.jpg \
  'convert to markdown' -m qwen2.5vl
</code></pre>
<p>
The result that came back:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It looks like the image you provided is a jumbled and distorted text,
making it difficult to interpret. If you have a specific question or
need help with a particular topic, please feel free to ask, and I‚Äôll do
my best to assist you!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm not sure what went wrong here. My best guess is that the maximum
resolution the model can handle is too small to make out the text, or
maybe Ollama resized the image to the point of illegibility before
handing it to the model?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: I think this may be
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1046">a bug</a> relating
to URL handling in LLM/llm-ollama. I tried downloading the file first:
</p>
<pre><code>wget https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/poster.jpg
llm -m qwen2.5vl 'extract text' -a poster.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>
This time it did a lot better. The results weren‚Äôt perfect though -
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2b46e932a16c92e673ea09dfc0186ec2#response">it
ended up stuck in a loop</a> outputting the same code example dozens of
times.
</p>
<p>
I tried with a different prompt - ‚Äúextract text‚Äù - and it got confused
by the three column layout, misread Datasette as ‚ÄúDatasetette‚Äù and
missed some of the text. Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3ececa5f5ff109a81bc6893be06f00b1#response">that
result</a>.
</p>
<p>
These experiments used <code>qwen2.5vl:7b</code> (6GB) - I expect the
results would be better with the larger <code>qwen2.5vl:32b</code>
(21GB) and <code>qwen2.5vl:72b</code> (71GB) models.
</p>
<p>
<p>Fred Jonsson
<a href="https://twitter.com/enginoid/status/1924092556079436086">reported
a better result</a> using the MLX model via LM studio (~9GB model

Speaking of the effects of technology on individuals and society as a

AI systems that provide augmentations, and inflict amputations, far more
substantial than anything McLuhan could have imagined. This is the main
thing I worry about currently as far as AI is concerned. I follow
conversations among professional educators who all report the same
phenomenon, which is that their students use ChatGPT for everything, and
in consequence learn nothing. We may end up with at least one generation
of people who are like the Eloi in H.G. Wells‚Äôs The Time Machine, in

they don‚Äôt understand and that they could never rebuild from scratch

it has a couple of interesting talks related to Apple‚Äôs work on
improving memory safety for C and C++, while having safer integration
with Swift code.
</p>
<p>
Apple has added a few language extensions for bounds checking, fat
pointers, that would already help quite a bit. They are quite similar to
Microsoft‚Äôs
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/understanding-sal?view=msvc-170">SAL</a>
annotations used in Visual C++.
</p>
<p>
The advantage with Apple‚Äôs approach is that by having this on an open
source compiler like clang, there is an higher chance that the C and C++
communities adopt such extensions, and eventually make up to the
respective ISO standards.
</p>
<p>
The relevant talks on security were:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYOCPBUM1Hs">Recipe for
Eliminating Entire Classes of Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in C and
C++</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlevLn831R4">Adopting
-fbounds-safety in practice</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVmgL-97kqo">C++
interoperability with memory-safe languages</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I found quite interesting the approach they decided to take to talk
about current state of security, with memory safe languages being
islands, the amount of existing C and C++ code in the industry, oceans,
and the interop layers between languages, the beach.
