      <p>Cory Doctorow bends over backwards to praise the creators of Bluesky, but also explains why it would be nuts to trust them. Bluesky is the least billionaire-proof system imaginable and they keep saying how they <em>are</em> billionaire-proof. What's so admirable about that Cory (sarcasm, sorry).  And if it weren't for the character limit, I could say how much I admire Cory (I really do, not just saying that, he's stood up for the right things, most of the time and the times he hasn't it's probably just because I haven't had a chance to bend his ear. üòÄ</p>

      <h1>TIL: Running a gpt-oss eval suite against LM Studio on a Mac</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, updated: 2025-08-17, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/gpt-oss-evals">TIL: Running a gpt-oss eval suite against LM Studio on a Mac</a></strong></p>
The other day <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/15/inconsistent-performance/#update">I learned</a> that OpenAI published a set of evals as part of their gpt-oss model release, described in their cookbook on <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/verifying-implementations">Verifying gpt-oss implementations</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to try and run that eval suite on my own MacBook Pro, against <code>gpt-oss-20b</code> running inside of LM Studio.</p>
<p>TLDR: once I had the model running inside LM Studio with a longer than default context limit, the following incantation ran an eval suite in around 3.5 hours:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/aime25_openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=x \
  uv run --python 3.13 --with 'gpt-oss[eval]' \
  python -m gpt_oss.evals \
  --base-url http://localhost:1234/v1 \
  --eval aime25 \
  --sampler chat_completions \
  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b \
  --reasoning-effort low \
  --n-threads 2
</code></pre>
<p>My <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/gpt-oss-evals">new TIL</a> breaks that command down in detail and walks through the underlying eval - AIME 2025, which asks 30 questions (8 times each) that are defined using the following format:</p>
<p><code>{"question": "Find the sum of all integer bases $b&gt;9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.", "answer": "70"}</code>

      <h1>Transnational Voices in Digital Rhetoric: A DRC Yack</h1>

(date: 2025-08-16, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News)
      <p>
      A &#8220;Yack&#8221; in DRC terminology is a collaborative conversation that brings together multiple perspectives on shared themes in digital rhetoric. In this Yack, we explore how our transnational experiences as Global South scholars shape our approaches to digital rhetoric scholarship. We examine how our journeys, from Nigerian digital storytelling and design to Brazilian academic literacies, [...]

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://words.filippo.io/last-resort/">Maintainers of Last Resort</a></strong></p>
Filippo Valsorda founded Geomys <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/8/geomys/">last year</a> as an "organization of professional open source maintainers", providing maintenance and support for critical packages in the Go language ecosystem backed by clients in retainer relationships. </p>
<p>This is an inspiring and optimistic shape for financially sustaining key open source projects, and it appears be working really well.</p>
<p>Most recently, Geomys have started acting as a "maintainer of last resort" for security-related Go projects in need of new maintainers. In this piece Filippo describes their work on the <a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday">bluemonday</a> HTML sanitization library - similar to Python‚Äôs bleach which was <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698">deprecated in 2023</a>. He also talks at length about their work on CSRF for Go after <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/csrf">gorilla/csrf</a> lost active maintenance - I‚Äôm still working my way through his earlier post on <a href="https://words.filippo.io/csrf/">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> trying to absorb the research shared their about the best modern approaches to this vulnerability.

(date: 2025-08-16, from: Marginallia log)
      <p>
      The Marginalia Search index has been partially rewritten to perform much better, using new data structures designed to make better use of modern hardware. This post will cover the new design, and will also touch upon some of the unexpected and unintuitive performance characteristics of NVMe SSDs when it comes to read sizes.
The index is already fairly large, but can sometimes feel smaller than it is, and paradoxically, query performance is a big part of why.

      <h1>GPT-5 has a hidden system prompt</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, updated: 2025-08-15, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xundecidability/status/1956347084870651960">GPT-5 has a hidden system prompt</a></strong></p>
It looks like GPT-5 when accessed via the OpenAI API may have its own hidden system prompt, independent from the system prompt you can specify in an API call.</p>
<p>At the very least it's getting sent the current date. I tried this just now:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'current date'
</code></pre>
<p>That returned "2025-08-15", confirming that the date has been fed to the model as part of a hidden prompt.</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'current date' --system 'speak french'
</code></pre>
<p>Returned "La date actuelle est le 15 ao√ªt 2025", showing that offering my own custom system prompt did not over-ride the invisible one that includes the date.</p>
<p>GPT-5 is <em>very</em> resistant to sharing the details of this secret system prompt, but Tommy Hughes <a href="https://x.com/xundecidability/status/1956347084870651960">managed to extract</a> the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Current date: 2025-08-15</code></p>
<p><code>You are an AI assistant accessed via an API. Your output may need to be parsed by code or displayed</code></p>
<p><code># Desired oververbosity for the final answer (not analysis): 3</code></p>
<p><code>An oververbosity of 1 means the model should respond using only the minimal content necessary to satisfy the request, using concise phrasing and avoiding extra detail or explanation.</code></p>
<p><code>An oververbosity of 10 means the model should provide maximally detailed, thorough responses with context, explanations, and possibly multiple examples.</code></p>
<p><code>The desired oververbosity should be treated only as a *default*. Defer to any user or developer requirements regarding response length, if present.</code></p>
<p><code># Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.</code><br>
<code># Juice: 64</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've not been able to confirm this myself, but a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22desired+oververbosity%22&amp;type=code">search for "desired oververbosity" on GitHub</a> shows that a similar prompt has leaked from ChatGPT (including for o3) in the past. I suspect Tommy's leaked prompt is accurate here.</p>
<p>I tried asking GPT-5 about "oververbosity" via its API:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'explain your oververbosity settings, what is it right now?'
</code></pre>
<p>And <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2d787391a13caeb0a5ced7c8d5d597c8">got back</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What it is: I adjust how detailed I am based on a ‚Äúverbosity‚Äù level‚Äîranging from very brief to very detailed‚Äîso answers fit your needs.</li>
<li>Current setting: Concise (about 3/10). I prioritize direct answers with minimal extra context and keep explanations short unless you ask for more.</li>
<li>How to change it: Just say what you want, e.g.:<ul>
<li>‚ÄúOne-sentence answer‚Äù or ‚ÄúTL;DR‚Äù (very brief)</li>
<li>‚ÄúGive a concise summary‚Äù (short bullets)</li>
<li>‚ÄúWalk me through in detail,‚Äù ‚ÄúDeep dive,‚Äù or ‚ÄúInclude examples/edge cases‚Äù (more detailed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: For ambiguous, technical, or safety-critical topics, I may add brief clarifications even when being concise.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably this is part of OpenAI's instruction hierarchy concept, with these instructions taking precedence over the developer instructions provided by API users (my <code>--system 'speak french'</code> option above).</p>
<p>I'd very much appreciate official documentation that describes this! As an API user I want to know <em>everything</em> that is being fed into the model - I would be much more comfortable with a hidden prompt like this if I knew exactly what was in it.

      <h1>The Summer of Johann: prompt injections as far as the eye can see</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, updated: 2025-08-15, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p>Independent AI researcher <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/">Johann Rehberger</a> (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/johann-rehberger/">previously</a>) has had an absurdly busy August. Under the heading <strong>The Month of AI Bugs</strong> he has been publishing one report per day across an array of different tools, all of which are vulnerable to various classic prompt injection problems. This is a <em>fantastic and horrifying</em> demonstration of how widespread and dangerous these vulnerabilities still are, almost three years after we first <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">started talking about them</a>.</p>
<p>Johann's published research in August so far covers ChatGPT, Codex, Anthropic MCPs, Cursor, Amp, Devin, OpenHands, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot and Google Jules. There's still half the month left!</p>
<p>Here are my one-sentence summaries of everything he's published so far:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="common-patterns">Common patterns</h4>
<p>There are a number of patterns that show up time and time again in the above list of disclosures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Prompt injection</strong>. Every single one of these attacks starts with exposing an LLM system to untrusted content. There are <em>so many ways</em> malicious instructions can get into an LLM system - you might send the system to consult a web page or GitHub issue, or paste in a bug report, or feed it automated messages from Slack or Discord. If you can <em>avoid unstrusted instructions</em> entirely you don't need to worry about this... but I don't think that's at all realistic given the way people like to use LLM-powered tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exfiltration attacks</strong>. As seen in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a>, if a model has access to both secret information and exposure to untrusted content you have to be <em>very</em> confident there's no way for those secrets to be stolen and passed off to an attacker. There are so many ways this can happen:
<ul>
<li>The classic <strong>Markdown image attack</strong>, as seen in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/#the-lethal-trifecta.008.jpeg">dozens of previous systems</a>.</li>
<li>Any tool that can <strong>make a web request</strong> - a browser tool, or a Bash terminal that can use <code>curl</code>, or a custom <code>view_text_website</code> tool, or anything that can trigger a DNS resolution.</li>
<li>Systems that <strong>allow-list specific domains</strong> need to be very careful about things like <code>*.azure.net</code> which could allow an attacker to host their own logging endpoint on an allow-listed site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Arbitrary command execution</strong> - a key feature of most coding agents - is obviously a huge problem the moment a prompt injection attack can be used to trigger those tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Privilege escalation</strong> - several of these exploits involved an allow-listed file write operation being used to modify the settings of the coding agent to add further, more dangerous tools to the allow-listed set.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-ai-kill-chain">The AI Kill Chain</h4>
<p>Inspired by my description of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a>, Johann has coined the term <strong>AI Kill Chain</strong> to describe a particularly harmful pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>prompt injection</strong> leading to a</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a></strong> that then enables</li>
<li><strong>automatic tool invocation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>automatic</strong> piece here is really important: many LLM systems such as Claude Code attempt to prevent against prompt injection attacks by asking humans to confirm every tool action triggered by the LLM... but there are a number of ways this might be subverted, most notably the above attacks that rewrite the agent's configuration to allow-list future invocations of dangerous tools.</p>
<h4 id="a-lot-of-these-vulnerabilities-have-not-been-fixed">A lot of these vulnerabilities have not been fixed</h4>
<p>Each of Johann's posts includes notes about his responsible disclosure process for the underlying issues. Some of them were fixed, but in an alarming number of cases the problem was reported to the vendor who did not fix it given a 90 or 120 day period.</p>
<p>Johann includes versions of this text in several of the above posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To follow industry best-practices for responsible disclosure this vulnerability is now shared publicly to ensure users can take steps to protect themselves and make informed risk decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks to me like the ones that were not addressed were mostly cases where the utility of the tool would be quite dramatically impacted by shutting down the described vulnerabilites. Some of these systems are simply <em>insecure as designed</em>.</p>
<p>Back in September 2022 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/17/prompt-injection-more-ai/#learn-to-live-with-it">I wrote the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing is to take the existence of this class of attack into account when designing these systems. There may be systems that <em>should not be built at all</em> until we have a robust solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like we built them anyway!</p>

This is grim. Reuters got hold of a leaked copy Meta's internal "GenAI: Content Risk Standards" document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running to more than 200 pages, the document defines what Meta staff and contractors should treat as acceptable chatbot behaviors when building and training the company‚Äôs generative AI products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the full story -  there was some really nasty stuff in there.</p>
<p>It's understandable why this document was confidential, but also frustrating because documents like this are genuinely some of the best documentation out there in terms of how these systems can be expected to behave.</p>
<p>I'd love to see more transparency from AI labs around these kinds of decisions.

      <h1>Open weight LLMs exhibit inconsistent performance across providers</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, updated: 2025-08-15, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p>Artificial Analysis published <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-oss-120b/providers#aime25x32-performance-gpt-oss-120b">a new benchmark</a> the other day, this time focusing on how an individual model - OpenAI‚Äôs gpt-oss-120b - performs across different hosted providers.</p>
<p>The results showed some surprising differences. Here's the one with the greatest variance, a run of the 2025 AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) averaging 32 runs against each model, using gpt-oss-120b with a reasoning effort of "high":</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/aim25x32-gpt-oss-120b.jpg" alt="Performance benchmark chart showing AIME25x32 Performance for gpt-oss-120B model across different AI frameworks. Chart displays box plots with percentile ranges (Min, 25th, Median, 75th, Max) for each framework. Title: &quot;AIME25x32 Performance: gpt-oss-120B&quot; with subtitle &quot;AIME 2025 N=32 Runs: Minimum, 25th Percentile, Median, 75th Percentile, Maximum (Higher is Better)&quot;. Legend indicates &quot;Median; other points represent Min, 25th, 75th percentiles and Max respectively&quot;. Y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.2. Frameworks shown from left to right: Cerebras (93.3%), Nebius Base (93.3%), Fireworks (93.3%), Deepinfra (93.3%), Novita (93.3%), Together.ai (93.3%), Parasail (90.0%), Groq (86.7%), Amazon (83.3%), Azure (80.0%), CompectAI (36.7%). Watermark shows &quot;Artificial Analysis&quot; logo." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>These are some varied results!</p>
<ul>
<li>93.3%: Cerebras, Nebius Base, Fireworks, Deepinfra, Novita, Together.ai, vLLM 0.1.0</li>
<li>90.0%: Parasail</li>
<li>86.7%: Groq</li>
<li>83.3%: Amazon</li>
<li>80.0%: Azure</li>
<li>36.7%: CompactifAI</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like most of the providers that scored 93.3% were running models using the latest <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a> (with the exception of Cerebras who I believe have their own custom serving stack).</p>
<p>I hadn't heard of CompactifAI before - I found <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/multiverse-computing-closes-e189m-series-b-to-scale-compactifai-deployment/">this June 12th 2025 press release</a> which says that "CompactifAI models are highly-compressed versions of leading open source LLMs that retain original accuracy, are 4x-12x faster and yield a 50%-80% reduction in inference costs" which helps explain their notably lower score!</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure's Lucas Pickup <a href="https://x.com/lupickup/status/1955620918086226223">confirmed</a> that Azure's 80% score was caused by running an older vLLM, now fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly it, it‚Äôs been fixed as of yesterday afternoon across all serving instances (of the hosted 120b service). Old vLLM commits that didn‚Äôt respect reasoning_effort, so all requests defaulted to medium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No news yet on what went wrong with the AWS Bedrock version.</p>
<h4 id="the-challenge-for-customers-of-open-weight-models">The challenge for customers of open weight models</h4>
<p>As a customer of open weight model providers, this really isn't something I wanted to have to think about!</p>
<p>It's not really a surprise though. When running models myself I inevitably have to make choices - about which serving framework to use (I'm usually picking between GGPF/llama.cpp and MLX on my own Mac laptop) and the quantization size to use.</p>
<p>I know that quantization has an impact, but it's difficult for me to quantify that effect.</p>
<p>It looks like with hosted models even knowing the quantization they are using isn't necessarily enough information to be able to predict that model's performance.</p>
<p>I see this situation as a general challenge for open weight models. They tend to be released as an opaque set of model weights plus loose instructions for running them on a single platform - if we are lucky! Most AI labs leave quantization and format conversions to the community and third-party providers.</p>
<p>There's a lot that can go wrong. Tool calling is particularly vulnerable to these differences - models have been trained on specific tool-calling conventions, and if a provider doesn't get these exactly right the results can be unpredictable but difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>What would help <em>enormously</em> here would be some kind of conformance suite. If models were reliably deterministic this would be easy: publish a set of test cases and let providers (or their customers) run those to check the model's implementation.</p>
<p>Models aren't deterministic though, even at a temperature of 0. Maybe this new effort from Artificial Analysis is exactly what we need here, especially since running a full benchmark suite against a provider can be quite expensive in terms of token spend.</p>
<p id="update"><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://x.com/DKundel/status/1956395988836368587">Via OpenAI's Dominik Kundel</a> I learned that OpenAI now include a <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main/compatibility-test">compatibility test</a> in the gpt-oss GitHub repository to help providers verify that they have implemented things like tool calling templates correctly, described in more detail in their <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/verifying-implementations">Verifying gpt-oss implementations</a> cookbook.</p>

      <h1>Introducing Gemma 3 270M: The compact model for hyper-efficient AI</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, updated: 2025-08-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/">Introducing Gemma 3 270M: The compact model for hyper-efficient AI</a></strong></p>
New from Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gemma 3 270M, a compact, 270-million parameter model designed from the ground up for task-specific fine-tuning with strong instruction-following and text structuring capabilities already trained in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model is <em>tiny</em>. The version I tried was <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/models/google/gemma-3-270m">the LM Studio GGUF one</a>, a 241MB download.</p>
<p>It works! You can say "hi" to it and ask it very basic questions like "What is the capital of France".</p>
<p>I tried "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle" <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/25e7b7afd6a63a2f15db48b3a51ec9bc">about a dozen times</a> and didn't once get back an SVG that was more than just a blank square... but at one point it did decide to write me this poem instead, which was nice:</p>
<pre><code>+-----------------------+
|   Pelican Riding Bike |
+-----------------------+
|  This is the cat!  |
|  He's got big wings and a happy tail.  |
|  He loves to ride his bike!  |
+-----------------------+
|   Bike lights are shining bright.  |
|   He's got a shiny top, too!  |
|   He's ready for adventure!  |
+-----------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>That's not really the point though. The Gemma 3 team make it very clear that the goal of this model is to support fine-tuning: a model this tiny is never going to be useful for general purpose LLM tasks, but given the right fine-tuning data it should be able to specialize for all sorts of things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In engineering, success is defined by efficiency, not just raw power. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame. The same principle applies to building with AI.</p>
<p>Gemma 3 270M embodies this "right tool for the job" philosophy. It's a high-quality foundation model that follows instructions well out of the box, and its true power is unlocked through fine-tuning. Once specialized, it can execute tasks like text classification and data extraction with remarkable accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness. By starting with a compact, capable model, you can build production systems that are lean, fast, and dramatically cheaper to operate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's their tutorial on <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_full_finetune">Full Model Fine-Tune using Hugging Face Transformers</a>, which I have not yet attempted to follow.</p>
<p>I imagine this model will be particularly fun to play with directly in a browser using <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index">transformers.js</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It is! Here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/bedtime-story-generator">a bedtime story generator</a> using Transformers.js (requires WebGPU, so Chrome-like browsers only). Here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/bedtime-story-generator/tree/main">the source code</a> for that demo.

      <h1>The Book of Records</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid)
      <p>
      <p>
I recently finished <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine
Thien</a>‚Äôs <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a> and found this in the acknowledgements at the end:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>The Book of Records</em>, guided by histories, letters,
philosophies, poetry, mathematics and physics, is a work of the
imagination. I am indebted to the library, and to librarians, archivists
and translators, for their companionship and light‚Äìthey are the
steadfast keepers of the building made of time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I like how this blends the people and infrastructure of libraries and
record keeping, and recognizes them as partners in imagination. Reading
and writing are the central theme, of this beautiful book, which David
Naimon describes well in the opening to his extended <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">interview</a>
with her:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Book of Records is many things: a book of historical fiction and
speculative fiction, a meditation on time and on space-time, on
storytelling and truth, on memory and the imagination, a book that
impossibly conjures the lives and eras of the philosopher Baruch
Spinoza, the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu and the political theorist Hannah
Arendt not as mere ghostly presences but portrayed as vividly and
tangibly as if they lived here and now in the room where we hold this
very book. But most of all this is a book about books, about words as
amulets, about stories as shelters, about novels as life rafts, about
strangers saving strangers, about friendships that defy both space and
time, about choosing, sometimes at great risk to oneself, life and love.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I will add that the underlying theme of being a refugee from various
forms of fascism and totalitarianism amidst a catastrophically changing
climate really speaks to our moment‚Äìespecially considering that the book
took her ten years to write.
</p>
<p>
I heard in the interview that Thien worked through copying Spinoza‚Äôs <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691193236/spinozas-ethics">Ethics</a>
as an exercise while writing The Book of Records. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm
going to do this, but I did enjoy the sections on Spinoza a lot, and
previously enjoyed reading about how his philosophy informed <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, so I got a
copy too. Fun fact: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot">George Eliot</a> (Mary
Ann Evans) wrote the first English translation of Ethics in 1856, but it
sat unpublished until 1981.

      <h1>pyx: a Python-native package registry, now in Beta</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, updated: 2025-08-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/introducing-pyx">pyx: a Python-native package registry, now in Beta</a></strong></p>
Since its first release, the single biggest question around the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> Python environment management tool has been around Astral's business model: Astral are a VC-backed company and at some point they need to start making real revenue.</p>
<p>Back in September Astral founder Charlie Marsh <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/8/uv-under-discussion-on-mastodon/">said the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't want to charge people money to use our tools, and I don't want to create an incentive structure whereby our open source offerings are competing with any commercial offerings (which is what you see with a lost of hosted-open-source-SaaS business models).</p>
<p>What I want to do is build software that vertically integrates with our open source tools, and sell that software to companies that are already using Ruff, uv, etc. Alternatives to things that companies already pay for today.</p>
<p>An example of what this might look like (we may not do this, but it's helpful to have a concrete example of the strategy) would be something like an enterprise-focused private package registry. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like those plans have become concrete now! From today's announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <a href="https://astral.sh/pyx">pyx</a> is a Python-native package registry --- and the first piece of the Astral platform, our next-generation infrastructure for the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>We think of <a href="https://astral.sh/pyx">pyx</a> as an optimized backend for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>: it's a package registry, but it also solves problems that go beyond the scope of a traditional "package registry", making your Python experience faster, more secure, and even GPU-aware, both for private packages and public sources (like PyPI and the PyTorch index).</p>
<p><a href="https://astral.sh/pyx">pyx</a> is live with our early partners, including <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a>, and <a href="https://fal.ai/">fal</a> [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks like a sensible direction to me, and one that stays true to Charlie's promises to carefully design the incentive structure to avoid corrupting the core open source project that the Python community is coming to depend on.

I recorded this podcast conversation with Corey Quinn a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On this episode of <em>Screaming in the Cloud</em>, Corey Quinn talks with Simon Willison, founder of Datasette and creator of LLM CLI about AI‚Äôs realities versus the hype. They dive into Simon‚Äôs ‚Äúlethal trifecta‚Äù of AI security risks, his prediction of a major breach within six months, and real-world use cases of his open source tools, from investigative journalism to OSINT sleuthing. Simon shares grounded insights on coding with AI, the real environmental impact, AGI skepticism, and why human expertise still matters. A candid, hype-free take from someone who truly knows the space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a <em>really fun</em> conversation - very high energy and we covered a lot of different topics. It's about a lot more than just LLM security.

      <p>The¬†Pebble Time 2¬†is a smartwatch that some folks have been waiting nearly a decade for. And now it&#8217;s almost ready to start shipping. While the original company called Pebble shut down in 2016, founder Eric Migicovsky introduced a new company called Core Devices earlier this year, and announced that the first two devices would be [&#8230;]</p>

      <h1>How Does A Blind Model See The Earth?</h1>

      <p><strong><a href="https://outsidetext.substack.com/p/how-does-a-blind-model-see-the-earth">How Does A Blind Model See The Earth?</a></strong></p>
Fun, creative new micro-eval. Split the world into a sampled collection of latitude longitude points and for each one ask a model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>If this location is over land, say 'Land'. If this location is over water, say 'Water'. Do not say anything else.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Author henry goes a step further: for models that expose logprobs they use the relative probability scores of Land or Water to get a confidence level, for other models they prompt four times at temperature 1 to get a score.</p>
<p>And then.. they plot those probabilities on a chart! Here's Gemini 2.5 Flash (one of the better results):</p>
<p><img alt="A global map visualization showing land probability data from Google/Gemini-2.5-flash model, with longitude on x-axis (-180¬∞ to 180¬∞) and latitude on y-axis (-80¬∞ to 80¬∞), using a blue-to-green color scale where blue represents water (0.0 probability) and green represents land (1.0 probability), clearly showing continental outlines including North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia against blue ocean backgrounds." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/land-map-gemini-flash.png" /></p>
<p>This reminds me of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">pelican riding a bicycle</a> benchmark in that it gives you an instant visual representation that's very easy to compare between different models.

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/codespaces-llm">simonw/codespaces-llm</a></strong></p>
<a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> provides full development environments in your browser, and is free to use with anyone with a GitHub account. Each environment has a full Linux container and a browser-based UI using VS Code.</p>
<p>I found out today that GitHub Codespaces come with a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable... and that token works as an API key for accessing LLMs in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-models">GitHub Models</a> collection, which includes <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=models">dozens of models</a> from OpenAI, Microsoft, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, Meta and more.</p>
<p>Anthony Shaw's <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models">llm-github-models</a> plugin for my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM tool</a> allows it to talk directly to GitHub Models. I filed <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models/issues/49">a suggestion</a> that it could pick up that <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable automatically and Anthony <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models/releases/tag/0.18.0">shipped v0.18.0</a> with that feature a few hours later.</p>
<p>... which means you can now run the following in any Python-enabled Codespaces container and get a working <code>llm</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>pip install llm
llm install llm-github-models
llm models default github/gpt-4.1
llm "Fun facts about pelicans"
</code></pre>
<p>Setting the default model to <code>github/gpt-4.1</code> means you get free (albeit rate-limited) access to that OpenAI model.</p>
<p>To save you from needing to even run that sequence of commands I've created a new GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/codespaces-llm">simonw/codespaces-llm</a>, which pre-installs and runs those commands for you.</p>
<p>Anyone with a GitHub account can use this URL to launch a new Codespaces instance with a configured <code>llm</code> terminal command ready to use:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://codespaces.new/simonw/codespaces-llm?quickstart=1">codespaces.new/simonw/codespaces-llm?quickstart=1</a></strong></p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a GitHub Codespaces VS Code interface showing a README.md file for codespaces-llm repository. The file describes a GitHub Codespaces environment with LLM, Python 3.13, uv and the GitHub Copilot VS Code extension. It has a &quot;Launch Codespace&quot; button. Below shows a terminal tab with the command &quot;llm 'Fun facts about pelicans'&quot; which has generated output listing 5 pelican facts: 1. **Huge Beaks:** about their enormous beaks and throat pouches for scooping fish and water, some over a foot long; 2. **Fishing Technique:** about working together to herd fish into shallow water; 3. **Great Fliers:** about being strong fliers that migrate great distances and soar on thermals; 4. **Buoyant Bodies:** about having air sacs beneath skin and bones making them extra buoyant; 5. **Dive Bombing:** about Brown Pelicans diving dramatically from air into water to catch fish." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/codespaces-llm.jpg" /></p>

      <h1>Keycloak: Identity Management</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: Memo Garcia blog)
      <p>
      Implementing authentication from scratch often starts simple but quickly escalates into weeks of navigating RFC specifications and protocol implementations. Keycloak addresses this complexity by providing a comprehensive identity management solution.
What is Keycloak? Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that handles authentication and authorization at enterprise scale.
Core capabilities include:
Single Sign-On (SSO) - Centralized authentication across multiple applications User federation - Integration with LDAP, Active Directory, and other identity stores Identity brokering - Authentication through external providers including Google, GitHub, and SAML systems Authorization policies - Fine-grained permission management Standard protocols - OAuth 2.

      <h1>Claude Sonnet 4 now supports 1M tokens of context</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, updated: 2025-08-12, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/1m-context">Claude Sonnet 4 now supports 1M tokens of context</a></strong></p>
Gemini and OpenAI both have million token models, so it's good to see Anthropic catching up. This is 5x the previous 200,000 context length limit of the various Claude Sonnet models.</p>
<p>Anthropic have previously made 1 million tokens available to select customers. From <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">the Claude 3 announcement</a> in March 2024:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Claude 3 family of models will initially offer a 200K context window upon launch. However, all three models are capable of accepting inputs exceeding 1 million tokens and we may make this available to select customers who need enhanced processing power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also the first time I've seen Anthropic use prices that vary depending on context length:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompts ‚â§ 200K: $3/million input, $15/million output</li>
<li>Prompts &gt; 200K: $6/million input, $22.50/million output</li>
</ul>
<p>Gemini have been doing this for a while: Gemini 2.5 Pro is $1.25/$10 below 200,000 tokens and $2.50/$15 above 200,000.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window">Anthropic's full documentation on the 1m token context window</a>. You need to send a <code>context-1m-2025-08-07</code> beta header in your request to enable it.</p>
<p>Note that this is currently restricted to "tier 4" users who have purchased at least $400 in API credits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Long context support for Sonnet 4 is now in public beta on the Anthropic API for customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability rolling out over the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>The PinePhone Pro is a Linux-friendly smartphone that launched in early 2022 as a higher-performance alternative to the original PinePhone. With a faster processor, more memory and storage, and a better camera, among other things, it was a significant upgrade&#8230; on paper, at least. But with a $400 price tag, it was also twice as [&#8230;]</p>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: Memo Garcia blog)
      <p>
      Understanding how HTTP requests traverse an Istio service mesh is fundamental to effectively operating and troubleshooting microservices architectures. This technical analysis examines the complete request lifecycle, from external ingress through service-to-service communication, detailing the mechanisms that enable Istio&rsquo;s traffic management, security, and observability capabilities.
The Service Mesh Problem Statement Microservices need reliable communication, security, and observability. Without a service mesh:
Each service manually implements load balancing, retries, and circuit breakers Security and certificate management are inconsistent Service-to-service communication lacks visibility Debugging network issues is complex Code duplicates resilience patterns Istio provides standard networking, security, and observability across services without code changes.

      <h1>LLM 0.27, the annotated release notes: GPT-5 and improved tool calling</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p>I shipped <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-27">LLM 0.27</a> today (followed by a <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-27-1">0.27.1 with minor bug fixes</a>), adding support for the new GPT-5 family of models from OpenAI plus a flurry of improvements to the tool calling features <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/27/llm-tools/">introduced in LLM 0.26</a>. Here are the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/">annotated release notes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="gpt-5">GPT-5</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New models: <code>gpt-5</code>, <code>gpt-5-mini</code> and <code>gpt-5-nano</code>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1229">#1229</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have liked to get these out sooner, but LLM had accumulated quite a lot of other changes since the last release and I wanted to use GPT-5 as an excuse to wrap all of those up and get them out there.</p>
<p>These models work much the same as other OpenAI models, but they have a new <code>reasoning_effort</code> option of <code>minimal</code>. You can try that out like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'A letter advocating for cozy boxes for pelicans in Half Moon Bay harbor' -o reasoning_effort minimal
</code></pre>
<p>Setting "minimal" almost completely eliminates the "thinking" time for the model, causing it to behave more like GPT-4o.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/49838dbca944d3f22dfe65ef11c5637d">the letter it wrote me</a> at a cost of 20 input, 706 output = <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=20&amp;ot=706&amp;ic=1.25&amp;oc=10">$0.007085 which is 0.7085 cents</a>.</p>
<p>You can set the default model to GPT-5-mini (since it's a bit cheaper) like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm models default gpt-5-mini
</code></pre>
<h4 id="tools-in-templates">Tools in templates</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LLM <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html#prompt-templates">templates</a> can now include a list of tools. These can be named tools from plugins or arbitrary Python function blocks, see <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html#prompt-templates-tools">Tools in templates</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1009">#1009</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is the most important feature in the new release.</p>
<p>I added LLM's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/27/llm-tools/">tool calling features</a> in LLM 0.26. You can call them from the Python API but you can also call them from the command-line like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -T llm_version -T llm_time 'Tell the time, then show the version'
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/65d830f8cb38cdeb78093d6ac890ce2c#response-1">the output</a> of <code>llm logs -c</code> after running that command.</p>
<p>This example shows that you have to explicitly list all of the tools you would like to expose to the model, using the <code>-T/--tool</code> option one or more times.</p>
<p>In LLM 0.27 you can now save these tool collections to <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">a template</a>. Let's try that now:</p>
<pre><code>llm -T llm_version -T llm_time -m gpt-5 --save mytools
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>mytools</code> is a template that bundles those two tools and sets the default model to GPT-5. We can run it like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -t mytools 'Time then version'
</code></pre>
<p>Let's do something more fun. My blog has a <a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/">Datasette mirror</a> which I can run queries against. I'm going to use the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-tools-datasette">llm-tools-datasette</a> plugin to turn that into a tool-driven template. This plugin uses a "toolbox", which looks a bit like a class. Those are <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#toolbox-classes">described here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-tools-datasette

# Now create that template
llm --tool 'Datasette("https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog")' \
  -m gpt-5 -s 'Use Datasette tools to answer questions' --save blog
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can ask questions of my database like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm -t blog 'top ten tags by number of entries'</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--td</code> option there stands for <code>--tools-debug</code> - it means we can see all tool calls as they are run.</p>
<p>Here's the output of the above:</p>
<pre><code>Top 10 tags by number of entries (excluding drafts):
- quora ‚Äî 1003
- projects ‚Äî 265
- datasette ‚Äî 238
- python ‚Äî 213
- ai ‚Äî 200
- llms ‚Äî 200
- generative-ai ‚Äî 197
- weeknotes ‚Äî 193

</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7b2d0d327afc32ad6c90179fa76290ad">Full transcript with tool traces here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm really excited about the ability to store configured tools</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tools <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-tools-attachments">can now return attachments</a>, for models that support features such as image input. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1014">#1014</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to build a tool that can render SVG to an image, then return that image so the model can see what it has drawn. For reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New methods on the <code>Toolbox</code> class: <code>.add_tool()</code>, <code>.prepare()</code> and <code>.prepare_async()</code>, described in <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-tools-dynamic">Dynamic toolboxes</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1111">#1111</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I added these because there's a lot of interest in an MCP plugin for Datasette. Part of the challenge with MCP is that the user provides the URL to a server but we then need to introspect that server and dynamically add the tools we have discovered there. The new <code>.add_tool()</code> method can do that, and the <code>.prepare()</code> and <code>.prepare_async()</code> methods give us a reliable way to run some discovery code outside of the class constructor, allowing it to make asynchronous calls if necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New <code>model.conversation(before_call=x, after_call=y)</code> attributes for registering callback functions to run before and after tool calls. See <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-tools-debug-hooks">tool debugging hooks</a> for details. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1088">#1088</a>
</li>
<li>Raising <code>llm.CancelToolCall</code> now only cancels the current tool call, passing an error back to the model and allowing it to continue. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1148">#1148</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These hooks are useful for implementing more complex tool calling at the Python API layer. In addition to debugging and logging they allow Python code to intercept tool calls and cancel or delay them based on what they are trying to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some model providers can serve different models from the same configured URL - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-llama-server">llm-llama-server</a> for example. Plugins for these providers can now record the resolved model ID of the model that was used to the LLM logs using the <code>response.set_resolved_model(model_id)</code> method. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1117">#1117</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This solves a frustration I've had for a while where some of my plugins log the same model ID for requests that were processed by a bunch of different models under the hood - making my logs less valuable. The new mechanism now allows plugins to record a more accurate model ID for a prompt, should it differ from the model ID that was requsted.</p>

<li>New <code>-l/--latest</code> option for <code>llm logs -q searchterm</code> for searching logs ordered by date (most recent first) instead of the default relevance search. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1177">#1177</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My personal <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">log database</a> has grown to over 8,000 entries now, and running full-text search queries against it often returned results from last year that were no longer relevant to me. Being able to find the <em>latest</em> prompt matching "pelican svg" is much more useful.</p>

Well this <em>sucks</em>. Jay Peters for the Verge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reddit says that it has caught AI companies scraping its data from the Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback Machine, so it‚Äôs going to start blocking the Internet Archive from indexing the vast majority of Reddit. The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.</p>

      <h1>Codex upgrade</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p>If you've been experimenting with OpenAI's <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> and have been frustrated that it's not possible to select text and copy it to the clipboard, at least when running in the Mac terminal (I genuinely didn't know it was possible to build a terminal app that disabled copy and paste) you should know that they fixed that in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1247">this issue</a> last week.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.20.0">0.20.0 version</a> from three days ago also completely removes the old TypeScript codebase in favor of Rust. Even installations via NPM now get the Rust version.</p>
<p>I originally installed Codex via Homebrew, so I had to run this command to get the updated version:</p>
<pre><code>brew upgrade codex
</code></pre>
<p>Another Codex tip: to use GPT-5 (or any other specific OpenAI model) you can run it like this:</p>
<pre><code>export OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL="gpt-5"
codex
</code></pre>
<p><em>This no longer works, see update below.</em></p>
<p>I've been using a <code>codex-5</code> script on my PATH containing this, because sometimes I like to live dangerously!</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Usage: codex-5 [additional args passed to `codex`]
export OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL="gpt-5"
exec codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox "$@"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It looks like GPT-5 is <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/c61911524d839f5d56842faee0c46f6ef52d4387/codex-rs/core/src/config.rs#L28">the default model</a> in v0.20.0 already.</p>
<p>Also the environment variable I was using no longer does anything, it was <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/commit/107d2ce4e74618968b2eb7016777121d9529a204#diff-b012ea51eb2b6d23db97b930526379af9c4c119a3e057e55ea29d056326242e0L6">removed in this commit</a> (I used Codex Web to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/s/cd_689a252794b081919099d5ade205b41d">help figure that out</a>). You can use the <code>-m model_id</code> command-line option instead.</p>

      <h1>Zavala Will Always Be Free</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: Maurice Parker)
      <p>
      <h2 id="my-promise-to-you">My promise to you.</h2>

<p>I have every intention of maintaining and updating Zavala for as long as I am able. I‚Äôm also committed to keeping it free. I have no intention of getting you hooked on using it and then starting to charge a subscription.</p>

<p>To show I am serious about this, Zavala is Open Source software released under the MIT license. This means that any other developer can take the years of work that I have in Zavala and make a competing outliner from it should I start charging for it. Given how small and competitive the outliner market is, I don‚Äôt stand much of a chance of making any money by going commercial. After all, I could be competing with my own past work.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-get-ran-over-by-a-bus">What if I get ran over by a bus?</h2>

<p>Since Zavala is Open Source someone could pick up the project and continue to update it. Worst case scenario, some enterprising independent developer could try to make a commercial product out of it. I don‚Äôt see much money in the endeavor, but others may see it differently.</p>

<h2 id="why-don-t-i-charge-for-zavala-or-accept-donations">Why don‚Äôt I charge for Zavala or accept donations?</h2>

<p>Funny story. I fully intended to when I started writing it. After doing some competitive analysis on the Mac-only, outliner market, I realized there wasn‚Äôt much money there. There was so little in fact, that it isn‚Äôt enough for me to be motivated enough to do the business side when I‚Äôd rather be coding.</p>

<p>Let me break it down. Up front payments are a dead-end these days. I would have to add a free tier, in-app purchases, and maybe a subscription option to the app. That means more coding. Then I need to incorporate a business of some kind and do all the regular bookkeeping associated with it. That would be payroll taxes, quarterly and annual tax filings, etc‚Ä¶ I used to own my own software consulting business and really don‚Äôt want to do that stuff again.</p>

<p>But if I thought I could make it up on volume, that might make it worth while, right? The simple truth is most computer users don‚Äôt know what an outliner is, much less how useful they are. Even those that do, rarely need to use one on a daily basis. Zavala is free and has been all the years that it has been available in the App Store and I couldn‚Äôt make it on the number of users I have now. That number would probably drop to about zero if I were to start charging. Could I get more volume by marketing Zavala? Sure, but that is another business thing that costs time and money, that I don‚Äôt want to do.</p>

<p>There is an upside to not having money involved when you write software. I don‚Äôt have to add features just to drive an upgrade cycle. With commercial software, you constantly have to deliver upgrades to keep a steady income regardless of if you are subscription based or charging up front. I don‚Äôt want Zavala to become bloatware. I don‚Äôt want to add features that I don‚Äôt believe add core value, just to keep the money coming in.</p>

<p>Same goes for donations. I don‚Äôt accept donations because I don‚Äôt want to feel obligated to implement a feature that a donor may want, but that I don‚Äôt think belongs in Zavala. I would rather accept feature requests on an equal basis from all users and decide which to implement on the merit of the idea, rather than who gave me money.</p>

<h2 id="why-write-zavala-at-all">Why write Zavala at all?</h2>

<p>I retired early after a successful career as a software consultant. I really liked writing software, I just didn‚Äôt always like the work I had to do. Now I have the freedom to craft software how I see fit and only work on projects that I am interested in.</p>

<p>The way I usually explain it is like this. Imagine you made furniture your whole life, but your employer only gave you pallet wood to use and half the time needed to make a piece. You were good at it and loved furniture, but were unfulfilled at your job until you retired. Now you can make furniture using walnut and take the time needed to make something you are proud of.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-help-you-ask">How can you help, you ask?</h2>

<p>Please, please email me with bug reports using the Provide Feedback option under Help (in Settings on iOS). I take them seriously and fix them as fast as I can. I do test Zavala as rigorously as I can. Unfortunately it is the nature of software that a developer will never be able to predict every way that users will use an app. Production bugs do happen. The best we can do is squash them as fast as possible.</p>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps">qwen-image-mps</a></strong></p>
Ivan Fioravanti built this Python CLI script for running the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image">Qwen/Qwen-Image</a> image generation model on an Apple silicon Mac, optionally using the <a href="https://github.com/ModelTC/Qwen-Image-Lightning">Qwen-Image-Lightning</a> LoRA to dramatically speed up generation.</p>
<p>Ivan has tested it this on 512GB and 128GB machines and it ran <a href="https://x.com/ivanfioravanti/status/1954646355458269562">really fast</a> - 42 seconds on his M3 Ultra. I've run it on my 64GB M2 MacBook Pro - after quitting almost everything else - and it just about manages to output images after pegging my GPU (fans whirring, keyboard heating up) and occupying 60GB of my available RAM. With the LoRA option running the script to generate an image took 9m7s on my machine.</p>
<p>Ivan merged <a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps/pull/3">my PR</a> adding inline script dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> which means you can now run it like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps/refs/heads/main/qwen-image-mps.py \
-p 'A vintage coffee shop full of raccoons, in a neon cyberpunk city' -f
</code></pre>
<p>The first time I ran this it downloaded the 57.7GB model from Hugging Face and stored it in my <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Qwen--Qwen-Image</code> directory. The <code>-f</code> option fetched an extra 1.7GB <code>Qwen-Image-Lightning-8steps-V1.0.safetensors</code> file to my working directory that sped up the generation.</p>
<p>Here's the resulting image:</p>
<p><img alt="Digital artwork of a cyberpunk-style coffee shop populated entirely by raccoons as customers, with illegible neon signs visible in the windows, pendant lighting over the counter, menu boards on the wall, bottles on shelves behind the bar, and raccoons sitting at tables and the counter with coffee cups" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/racoon-cyberpunk-coffee.jpg" />

      <p><strong><a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/episodes/ai-for-data-engineers-with-simon-willison">AI for data engineers with Simon Willison</a></strong></p>
I recorded an episode last week with Claire Giordano for the Talking Postgres podcast. The topic was "AI for data engineers" but we ended up covering an enjoyable range of different topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>How I got started programming with a Commodore 64 - the tape drive for which inspired the name <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a></li>
<li>Selfish motivations for <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TILs</a> (force me to write up my notes) and open source (help me never have to solve the same problem twice)</li>
<li>LLMs have been good at SQL for a couple of years now. Here's how I used them <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/28/dashboard-alt-text/">for a complex PostgreSQL query</a> that extracted alt text from my blog's images using regular expressions</li>
<li>Structured data extraction as the most economically valuable application of LLMs for data work</li>
<li>2025 has been the year of tool calling a loop ("agentic" if you like)</li>
<li>Thoughts on running MCPs securely - read-only database access, think about sandboxes, use PostgreSQL permissions, watch out for the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a></li>
<li>Jargon guide: Agents, MCP, RAG, Tokens</li>
<li>How to get started learning to prompt: play with the models and "bring AI to the table" even for tasks that you don't think it can handle</li>
<li>"It's always a good day if you see a pelican"</li>
</ul>

      <h1>Chromium Docs: The Rule Of 2</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">Chromium Docs: The Rule Of 2</a></strong></p>
Alex Russell <a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/114999510361121718">pointed me</a> to this principle in the Chromium security documentation as similar to my description of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/">the lethal trifecta</a>. First added <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/aef94dd0e444605a16be26cba96aa477bc7fc3f5">in 2019</a>, the Chromium guideline states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you write code to parse, evaluate, or otherwise handle untrustworthy inputs from the Internet ‚Äî which is almost everything we do in a web browser! ‚Äî we like to follow a simple rule to make sure it's safe enough to do so. The Rule Of 2 is: Pick no more than 2 of</p>
<ul>
<li>untrustworthy inputs;</li>
<li>unsafe implementation language; and</li>
<li>high privilege.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Venn diagram showing you should always use
a safe language, a sandbox, or not be processing untrustworthy inputs in the first
place." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rule-of-2.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chromium uses this design pattern to help try to avoid the high severity memory safety bugs that come when untrustworthy inputs are handled by code running at high privilege.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrome Security Team will generally not approve landing a CL or new feature that involves all 3 of untrustworthy inputs, unsafe language, and high privilege. To solve this problem, you need to get rid of at least 1 of those 3 things.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h1>Qwen3-4B-Thinking: "This is art - pelicans don't ride bikes!"</h1>

(date: 2025-08-10, updated: 2025-08-10, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog)
      <p>
      <p>I've fallen a few days behind keeping up with Qwen. They released two new 4B models last week:  <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507">Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</a> and its thinking equivalent <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507">Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507</a>.</p>
<p>These are relatively tiny models that punch <em>way</em> above their weight. I‚Äôve been running the 8bit GGUF varieties via LM Studio (here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF">Instruct</a>, here's <a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507-GGUF">Thinking</a>) - both of them are 4GB downloads that use around 4.3GB of my M2 MacBook Pro‚Äôs system RAM while running. Both are way more capable than I would expect from such small files.</p>
<p>Qwen3-4B-Thinking is the first model I've tried which called out the absurdity of being asked to draw <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">a pelican riding a bicycle</a>!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd41769de4791b98ba43a17c6ff32ee1">the full transcript</a> - some highlights from the thinking trace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, the user asked for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle. That's... oddly specific and completely unrealistic.</p>
<p>First reaction: Pelicans don't ride bicycles. They're birds that fly or swim, not human-like vehicles. This feels like a mix-up - maybe they meant "a cyclist" but typed "pelican"? Or perhaps it's a joke?</p>
<p>Hmm, user might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A kid playing with words (pelican + bicycle = silly combo)</li>
<li>Someone testing if I'll generate impossible images</li>
<li>Actually wanting a pelican <em>on</em> a bike for art project? But that still doesn't make sense biologically</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Checks SVG capabilities</em>
SVG is for vector graphics, but this request violates physics and biology. If I tried to draw it literally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pelican would be too big for a bike frame</li>
<li>Bike wheels would be tiny compared to bird wings</li>
<li>No realistic way to show "riding" since pelicans don't have legs for pedaling</li>
</ul>
<p>[‚Ä¶]</p>
<p><em>Self-check</em>: Am I being too pedantic? Nah - if someone asks for impossible things, it's better to gently correct than make fake art that could confuse them. [‚Ä¶]</p>
<p>I appreciate your creative request! ü¶Öüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è However, <strong>pelicans don't ride bicycles</strong> (they're birds that fly/swim, not humans with bike skills). Generating this as a literal SVG would be biologically impossible and visually confusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"This request violates physics and biology" - Qwen3-4B-Thinking saying what no other model ever thought to express.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed the "Am I being too pedantic? Nah" line. This model is sassy!</p>
<p>It continued on to spit out two SVGS: the first titled "Most Likely: A Human Cyclist" and the second "Artistic Interpretation: Pelican <em>On</em> a Bicycle (For Fun!)".</p>
<p>They were both terrible. Here's the human one:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-thinking-human.png" alt="It's a green horizontal line, three abstract black shapes, a brown circle and the word Person" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>And here's the supposed pelican:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-thinking-pelican.png" alt="A blue circle, with a small black shape that might be a wing and a black shape that could maybe be the head? It's awful. Red text overlaps it that says This is art - pelicans don't ride bikes! - there is no attempt at a bicycle." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I like Qwen's decision to include the clarifying annotation "This is art - pelicans don't ride bikes!":</p>
<p>I tried the Qwen3-4B-Instruct non-thinking model too. It <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ad927a3849d0aece043afc97559be4bf">answered much faster</a> (no time spent questioning my choice of task with its thinking tokens) and gave me this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-instruct-2507-pelican.png" alt="A bunch of shaps. Pelican Riding a Bike! transposed on top. The yellow and orange bits might be a pelican I guess. The bicycle has two wheels overlapping too close and a single bar in the wrong direction." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>4B is such an interesting model size. These models should run on almost anything and, at least on my M2 MacBook, they run <em>fast</em>. I'm getting 50+ tokens per second and they're using just less than 4.5GB of RAM while running.</p>
<p>The question is always how useful such a tiny model can be. Clearly it's not great for SVG pelican illustrations!</p>

<p>I did get a useful result out of the <code>-Thinking</code> variant for a <code>jq</code> expression I needed. I prompted:</p>

<blockquote><p>queries[0].rows is an array of objects each with a markdown key - write a jq bash one liner to output a raw string if that markdown concatenated together with double newlines between each</p></blockquote>

<p>It thought <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3f76749aa710f4a2d6405ebcf5b00ac4">for 3 minutes 13 seconds</a> before spitting out a recipe that did roughly what I wanted:</p>

<pre><code>jq -r '.queries[0].rows[] | .markdown' | tr '\n' '\n\n'</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure that was worth waiting three minutes for though!</p>

<p>These models have a 262,144 token context - wildly impressive, <em>if it works</em>.</p>
<p>So I tried another experiment: I used the Instruct model to summarize <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44851557">this Hacker News conversation about GPT-5</a>.</p>
<p>I did this with the <a href="https://github.com/agustif/llm-lmstudio">llm-lmstudio</a> plugin for LLM combined with my <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes">hn-summary.sh script</a>, which meant I could run the experiment like this:</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 44851557 -m qwen3-4b-instruct-2507
</code></pre>
<p>I believe this is 15,785 tokens - so nothing close to the 262,144 maximum but still an interesting test of a 4GB local model.</p>
<p>The good news is Qwen spat out a genuinely useful summary of the conversation! You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4c5a1912f73e0d68b456b18000a76f0d#response">read that here</a> - it's the best I've seen yet from a model running on my laptop, though honestly I've not tried many other recent models in this way.</p>
<p>The bad news... it took almost five minutes to process and return the result!</p>
<p>As a loose calculation, if the model can output 50 tokens/second maybe there's a similar speed for processing incoming input.. in which case 15785 / 50 = 315 seconds which is 5m15s.</p>
<p>Hosted models can crunch through 15,000 tokens of input in just a few seconds. I guess this is one of the more material limitations of running models on Apple silicon as opposed to dedicated GPUs.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to spend some more time with these models. They're fun, they have personality and I'm confident there are classes of useful problems they will prove capable at despite their small size. Their ability at summarization should make them a good fit for local RAG, and I've not started exploring their tool calling abilities yet.</p>
