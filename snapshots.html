      <h1>AI mode is good, actually</h1>

(date: 2025-09-07, updated: 2025-09-07, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/ai-mode/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>When I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/">how good ChatGPT with GPT-5</a> is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google's efforts around this are.</p>
<p>I'm glad I left that out, because it turns out Google's new "AI mode" is genuinely really good! It feels  very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results <em>much</em> faster.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/ai">www.google.com/ai</a></strong> (not available in the EU, as I found out this morning since I'm staying in France for a few days.)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://share.google/aimode/SZNHD7Owi0Wv9d3Ci">what I got</a> for the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of search results page with navigation tabs &quot;AI Mode&quot; and more.  Main search query reads &quot;Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?&quot; Results show &quot;11 sites&quot; and include text: &quot;In 2024, Anthropic paid millions of dollars to buy physical books in bulk, which they then cut up, scanned, and discarded to train their AI models. This method was a major component of a copyright lawsuit settlement that Anthropic paid in September 2025. While Anthropic took this destructive, large-scale approach, other major AI labs have taken different routes to acquire book data.&quot; Followed by &quot;Here's how other AI companies have sourced book data:&quot; with bullet points for &quot;OpenAI and Microsoft: In June 2025, the companies announced a partnership with Harvard University libraries to train AI models on digitized, public-domain books. This non-destructive method provides high-quality text while preserving the original physical copies.&quot; &quot;Meta: Meta has been accused of relying on large-scale piracy to build its datasets for models like LLaMA. In 2025, a search tool revealed that Meta had copied more than 7.5 million books from the pirate site LibGen for its AI systems.&quot; &quot;Google: Decades before the current AI boom, Google pioneered non-destructive scanning methods for its Google Books project. This method became a successful legal precedent for digitizing copyrighted works for internal purposes. In 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of this project, Tom Turvey, to help with its own book-acquisition strategy." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai-mode-books.jpg" /></p>
<p>I'll be honest: I hadn't spent much time with AI mode for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My expectations of "AI mode" were extremely low based on my terrible experience of "AI overviews"</li>
<li>The name "AI mode" is so generic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on some initial experiments I'm impressed - Google finally seem to be taking full advantage of their search infrastructure for building out truly great AI-assisted search.</p>
<p>I do have one disappointment: AI mode will tell you that it's "running 5 searches" but it won't tell you what those searches are! Seeing the searches that were run is really important for me in evaluating the likely quality of the end results. I've had the same problem with Google's Gemini app in the past - the lack of transparency as to what it's doing really damages my trust.</p>

      <h1>GPT-5 Thinking in ChatGPT (aka Research Goblin) is shockingly good at search</h1>

(date: 2025-09-06, updated: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>"Don't use chatbots as search engines" was great advice for several years... until it wasn't.</p>
<p>I wrote about how good OpenAI's o3 was at using its Bing-backed search tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/">back in April</a>. GPT-5 feels even better.</p>
<p>I've started calling it my <strong>Research Goblin</strong>. I can assign a task to it, no matter how trivial or complex, and it will do an often unreasonable amount of work to search the internet and figure out an answer.</p>
<p>This is excellent for satisfying curiosity, and occasionally useful for more important endeavors as well.</p>
<p>I always run my searches by selecting the "GPT-5 Thinking" model from the model picker - in my experience this leads to far more comprehensive (albeit much slower) results.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from just the last couple of days. Every single one of them was run on my phone, usually while I was doing something else. Most of them were dictated using the iPhone voice keyboard, which I find faster than typing. Plus, it's fun to talk to my Research Goblin.</p>

<h4 id="bouncy-travelators">Bouncy travelators</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>They used to be rubber bouncy travelators at Heathrow and they were really fun, have all been replaced by metal ones now and if so, when did that happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was traveling through Heathrow airport pondering what had happened to the fun bouncy rubber travelators.</p>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc2d98-9aac-8006-98b9-1424d98290f8">Here's what I got</a>. Research Goblin narrowed it down to some time between 2014-2018 but, more importantly, found me this <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/totalsf/article/sfo-bouncy-moving-walkway-airport-19845449.php">delightful 2024 article</a> by Peter Hartlaub in the San Francisco Chronicle with a history of the SFO bouncy walkways, now also sadly retired.</p>
<h4 id="identify-this-building">Identify this building</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/reading-building.jpg" alt="not a great photo of a building with a distinctive shaped roof" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Identify this building in reading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a photo I snapped out of the window on the train. It <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc2e21-1d24-8006-b083-00b3233e1c67">thought for 1m4s</a> and correctly identified it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blade,_Reading">The Blade</a>.</p>
<h2 id="starbucks-uk-cake-pops">Starbucks UK cake pops</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Starbucks in the UK don't sell cake pops! Do a deep investigative dive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Starbucks in Exeter railway station didn't have cake pops, and the lady I asked didn't know what they were.</p>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc71b4-68f4-8006-b462-cf32f61e7ec3">Here's the result</a>. It turns out Starbucks did launch cake pops in the UK <a href="https://www.nationalworld.com/lifestyle/starbucks-cake-pops-launched-in-uk-on-new-autumn-menu-full-list-of-items-4284537">in September 2023</a> but they aren't available at all outlets, in particular the licensed travel locations such as the one at Exeter St Davids station.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed how it established definitive proof by consulting <a href="https://www.starbucks.co.uk/sites/starbucks-uk-pwa/files/2024-11/HOL24_UK_AllergenBook_CORE_FOOD_v02.LR_.pdf">the nutrition and allergen guide PDF</a> on starbucks.co.uk, which does indeed list both the Birthday Cake Pop (my favourite) and the Cookies and Cream one (apparently discontinued in the USA, at least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lp5chq/just_learned_today_the_cookies_cream_cake_pop_has/">according to r/starbucks</a>).</p>
<h4 id="britannica-to-seed-wikipedia">Britannica to seed Wikipedia</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone on hacker News said:</p>
<p>&gt; I was looking at another thread about how Wikipedia was the best thing on the internet. But they only got the head start by taking copy of Encyclopedia Britannica and everything else</p>
<p>Find what they meant by that</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc3062-5a68-8006-a12b-cf7196a130ae">The result</a>. It turns out Wikipedia did seed itself with content from the out-of-copyright 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica... but that project took place in 2006, five years after Wikipedia first launched in 2001.</p>
<p>I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the single best article I can link somebody to that explains the 1911 Britannica thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Encyclopaedia_Britannica">Wikipedia:WikiProject Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> which includes a detailed explanation and a link to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:EB1911">the 13,000 pages</a> still tagged with the template from that project. I posted what I found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45135061#45137109">in a comment</a>.</p>
<p>Notably (for me anyway) I didn't feel the need to disclose my use of ChatGPT in finding that information - at this point that feels a little like disclosing that I ran a Google search.</p>
<h4 id="official-name-for-the-university-of-cambridge">Official name for the University of Cambridge</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the official legal name of the university of Cambridge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/iancal/">Here's the context for that one</a>. It thought for 19 seconds - the thinking trace reveals it knew the answer but wanted to confirm it. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc723d-a344-8006-9514-fb3ea2c2b43b">It answered</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.” <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/the-university-as-a-charity">University of Cambridge</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/legal">Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That first link gave me the citation I needed in order to be sure this was right.</p>
<p>Since this is my shortest example, here's a screenshot of the expanded "Thought for 19s" panel. I <em>always</em> expand the thoughts - seeing how it pulled together its answer is crucial for evaluating if the answer is likely to be useful or not.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cambridge-name.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an AI assistant's thought process and research. Header shows &quot;Thought for 19s&quot; followed by bullet points: &quot;The user asked for the official legal name of the University of Cambridge, and I think they mean the formal corporate name. It's probably 'The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,' similar to Oxford's. I'm going to verify by checking the web for precise information.&quot; &quot;The official name of Cambridge might include the serial comma, like 'Masters, and Scholars.' There's a similar structure with Oxford, which uses a comma after 'Masters' too. The University is an exempt charity, so you can cross-check with legal documents like statutes or charity records. I'll double-check.&quot; Shows search results for &quot;official legal name of University of Cambridge&quot; from en.wikipedia.org, www.cam.ac.uk, projects.propublica.org and &quot;10 more&quot; sources. Continues with &quot;The University of Cambridge's official legal name, based on the University website and Cambridge University Press, is 'The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,' with the serial comma after 'Masters.' It's clear from these authoritative sources, so I'll provide that straightforward answer, citing the University site.&quot; &quot;The official legal name of the University of Cambridge is 'The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,' with the comma after Masters and the Oxford comma before 'and.' I'll answer concisely in one line and cite official sources to confirm. No need for extra UI elements here.&quot; Shows &quot;Done&quot; status. Final answer displays: &quot;The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.&quot; attributed to University of Cambridge, Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment, with &quot;Sources&quot; section at bottom." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<h4 id="history-of-the-caverns-in-exeter-quay">History of the caverns in Exeter quay</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Research On the waterfront restaurant in Exeter, is it dug into the cliffs somehow? History of the building, who built it, why and how</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were out to dinner <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xxvaPQiNWACtbq3H8">here</a> and noticed that the interior of the restaurant appeared to be a space dug into the cliff, which piqued my interest.</p>
<p>This was <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc32fb-d52c-8006-9259-0b984dc832b2">the ChatGPT session</a> that inspired the Research Goblin nickname. It just kept on digging!</p>
<p>The first reply took 2m40s and confirmed that yes, these quay buildings were carved into the red sandstone cliff <a href="https://www.exploredevon.info/activities/walk/exeter-quay/">in the 1820s-1830s</a>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT with GPT-5 really likes to suggest additional steps it can take. In this case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’d like, I can dig up the exact Historic England entry that covers the “Southern Warehouse” address and overlay it on a map of the vaults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often say "yes" purely out of curiosity to see what it will do next, and the offer to "overlay it on a map" was irresistible, like how would it even do that?</p>
<p>It did a <em>ton</em> of extra searches, found latitude and longitude coordinates for the restaurant (from Wikimedia Commons) and the warehouse buildings (from National Heritage List for England via Wikipedia), showed me that data in a table and then used Python to render this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/bad-chart.png" alt="Scatter plot titled &quot;On The Waterfront vs. Warehouse Vaults (Exeter Quay)&quot; with scientific notation &quot;+5.071e1&quot; in top left. Y-axis shows &quot;Latitude&quot; ranging from 0.0065 to 0.0090. X-axis shows &quot;Longitude&quot; ranging from -3.5310 to -3.5280. Three orange X markers plotted: &quot;Warehouse Vaults (6-11, The Quay) — HE 1223046&quot; at top center, &quot;On The Waterfront (4-9 Southern Warehouse)&quot; at middle left, and &quot;Warehouse Vaults (1-4, The Quay) — HE 1223045&quot; at bottom right" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Yeah, so that one is a bit of a miss!</p>
<p>But... the underlying research chain, as always, provided fascinating. I noticed that at one point it had searched for "Exeter Quay vaults map PDF", which inspired my next question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you find any PDF diagrams, showing the tunnels into the cliff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2m20s later it had found <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KgQ8hlUut3Q2r5wVMItggobi9P/2/844706/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">a planning document</a> and <a href="https://www.turner-locker.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cellar-1-The-Quay-TO-LET-2018-1.pdf">a letting brochure</a>, both PDFs, but noted that neither of them had the diagram I wanted. Evidently it actually "reads" the PDFs it finds as part of its activities, since it appears to have knowledge of the images contained within them as well as the text.</p>
<p>It concluded with this intriguing note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s strong evidence that a detailed plan/section <strong>does</strong> exist in the Exeter Archaeology report often cited by planners—<strong>“Archaeological, Historical and Conservation Study of the Exeter Canal Basin” (Exeter Archaeology Report 00.18, 2000)</strong>—but it isn’t online; it’s just cited in planning documents. You’d likely need to request it via the Devon Heritage Centre/Historic Environment Record.</p>
<p>If you want, I can keep hunting specialist archives for a digitized copy or a different report that includes the vault layouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously I said "Yes do that" and 2m24s later it chucked out a whole host of extra links, an apology that it still hadn't found a detailed plan diagram and, under the section heading "What I recommend next (actionable + exact ask)":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re happy, I can draft an email you can paste to the right archivists. [...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Exeter Quayside cliff vaults – request for plan/section drawings
Hello,</p>
<p>I’m researching the cliff-cut vaults behind The Quay (On The Waterfront / Kings Wharf).
Could you supply scans or copies of any <strong>plans/sections/diagrams</strong> of these vaults—especially those in <strong>Exeter Archaeology Report 00.18 (2000)</strong> (Archaeological, Historical and Conservation Study of the Exeter Canal Basin) and any <strong>EMAFU/Exeter Archaeology drawings</strong> for “The Quay” showing the <strong>vault/tunnel layouts cut into the red sandstone cliff</strong>?</p>
<p>For reference: NHLE list entries <strong>1223045 (1–4 Warehouse Vaults), 1223046 (6–11 Warehouse Vaults)</strong>, and <strong>1223114 (14–25 Vaults)</strong>.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a good thing my Research Goblin doesn't have the ability to send email (which we already know is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/31/snitchbench-with-llm/">very risky business</a>) or at this point I wouldn't be surprised if it started autonomously bothering archivists on my behalf!</p>
<h4 id="aldi-vs-lidl">Aldi vs Lidl</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In UK supermarket terms compare lidl and aldi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw an Aldi and a Lidl next to each other in Exeter and was curious as to how they compare. In this case my Research Goblin went <em>way</em> deeper than I had intended, thinking for 1m25s about market share and price surveys and loyalty schemes and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc7913-7ed8-8006-bd3f-63e540470cd7">answering</a> with ten paragraphs of detailed analysis.</p>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I just wanted the basic vibes like is one fancier than the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It thought for 6 seconds, didn't run any additional searches and replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Short version: neither is “fancy” — both are no-frills discounters — but <strong>Lidl often feels a touch more polished</strong>, while <strong>Aldi feels a touch more bare-bones</strong>. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I was now enjoying having my Goblin express judgement over British supermarket chains I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do they rate in fancinews compared to all of the other major UK supermarket chains?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(That was a typo for "fanciness" which it figured out.)</p>
<p>It thought for another 1m1s, ran 7 searches, consulted 27 URLs and gave me back a ranking that looked about right to me.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/fancy-supermarkets.jpg" alt="ChatGPT. Prompt: How do they rate in fancinews compared to all of the other major UK supermarket chains?

Time Out Worldwide Discounters (least fancy by design): Lidl (a touch more polished in-store) and Aldi (most stripped-back, no-frills).

Which? +1 Net: on a &quot;posh&quot; scale, think M&amp;S/Waitrose at the top, Sainsbury's/Tesco middle, Asda/Iceland lower, and Lidl/Aldi the least fancy— by intent, not as a knock on quality or value." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<h4 id="ai-labs-scanning-books-for-training-data">AI labs scanning books for training data</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic bought lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relevant to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/anthropic-settlement/">today's big story</a>. Research Goblin was <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc771c-c188-8006-a8e5-4b1624f5bdf0">unable to find</a> any news stories or other evidence that any labs other than Anthropic are engaged in large scale book scanning for training data. That's not to say it isn't happening, but it's happening very quietly if that's the case.</p>
<h4 id="gpt-5-for-search-feels-competent">GPT-5 for search feels competent</h4>
<p>The word that best describes how I feel about GPT-5 search is that it feels <strong>competent</strong>.</p>
<p>I've thrown all sorts of things at it over the last few weeks and it rarely disappoints me. It almost always does better than if I were to dedicate the same amount of time to manually searching myself, mainly because it's much faster at running searches and evaluating the results than I am.</p>
<p>I particularly love that it works so well on mobile. I used to reserve my deeper research sessions to a laptop where I could open up dozens of tabs. I'll still do that for higher stakes activities but I'm finding the scope of curiosity satisfaction I can perform on the go with just my phone has increased quite dramatically.</p>
<p>I've mostly stopped using OpenAI's Deep Research feature, because ChatGPT search now gives me the results I'm interested in far more quickly for most queries.</p>
<p>As a developer who builds software on LLMs I see ChatGPT search as the gold standard for what can be achieved using tool calling combined with chain-of-thought. Techniques like RAG are <em>massively</em> more effective if you can reframe them as several levels of tool calling with a carefully selected set of powerful search tools.</p>
<p>The way that search tool integrates with reasoning is key, because it allows GPT-5 to execute a search, reason about the results and then execute follow-up searches - all as part of that initial "thinking" process.</p>
<p>Anthropic call this ability <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#interleaved-thinking">interleaved thinking</a> and it's also <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#keeping-reasoning-items-in-context">supported by the OpenAI Responses API</a>.</p>
<h4 id="tips-for-using-search-in-chatgpt">Tips for using search in ChatGPT</h4>
<p>As with all things AI, GPT-5 search rewards intuition gathered through experience. Any time a curious thought pops into my head I try to catch it and throw it at my Research Goblin. If it's something I'm certain it won't be able to handle then even better! I can learn from watching it fail.</p>
<p>I've been trying out hints like "go deep" which seem to trigger a more thorough research job. I enjoy throwing those at shallow and unimportant questions like the UK Starbucks cake pops one just to see what happens!</p>
<p>You can throw questions at it which have a single, unambiguous answer - but I think questions which are broader and don't have a "correct" answer can be a lot more fun. The UK supermarket rankings above are a great example of that.</p>
<p>Since I love a questionable analogy for LLMs Research Goblin is... well, it's a goblin. It's very industrious, not quite human and not entirely trustworthy. You have to be able to outwit it if you want to keep it gainfully employed.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905">Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905</a></strong></p>
New not-quite-MIT licensed model from Chinese Moonshot AI, a follow-up to the highly regarded Kimi-K2 model they <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/11/kimi-k2/">released in July</a>.</p>
<p>This one is an incremental improvement - I've seen it referred to online as "Kimi K-2.1". It scores a little higher on a bunch of popular coding benchmarks, reflecting Moonshot's claim that it "demonstrates significant improvements in performance on public benchmarks and real-world coding agent tasks".</p>
<p>More importantly the context window size has been increased from 128,000 to 256,000 tokens.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor this is a <em>big</em> model - 1 trillion parameters in a mixture-of-experts configuration with 384 experts, 32B activated parameters and 8 selected experts per token.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://console.groq.com/playground?model=moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905">Groq's playground tool</a> to try "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle" and got <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/80f9fc8f888edc43e1f2a5170c95de3d">this result</a>, at a very healthy 445 tokens/second taking just under 2 seconds total:</p>
<p><img alt="This one is pretty good. Bicycle is mostly the right shape, the pelican is perched quite awkwardly on the saddle, it has quite a good attempt at the chain mechanism." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/kimi-0905.png" />

<p>I spent a long time building identifiers for universities and companies (which was taken for <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR</a> later) and it was a nightmare to say what a university even was. What’s the name of Cambridge? It’s not “Cambridge University” or “The university of Cambridge” legally. But it also is the actual name as people use it. <em>[It's <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/the-university-as-a-charity">The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge</a>]</em></p>
<p>The university of Paris went from something like 13 institutes to maybe one to then a bunch more. Are companies locations at their headquarters? Which headquarters?</p>

      <h1>Why I think the $1.5 billion Anthropic class action settlement may count as a win for Anthropic</h1>

(date: 2025-09-06, updated: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/anthropic-settlement/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/anthropic/773087/anthropic-to-pay-1-5-billion-to-authors-in-landmark-ai-settlement">Anthropic to pay $1.5 billion to authors in landmark AI settlement</a></strong></p>
I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/24/anthropic-training/">the details of this case</a> when it was found that Anthropic's training on book content was fair use, but they needed to have purchased individual copies of the books first... and they had seeded their collection with pirated ebooks from Books3, PiLiMi and LibGen.</p>
<p>The remaining open question from that case was the penalty for pirating those 500,000 books. That question has now been resolved in a settlement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic has reached an agreement to pay “at least” a staggering $1.5 billion, plus interest, to authors to settle its class-action lawsuit. The amount breaks down to smaller payouts expected to be approximately $3,000 per book or work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's wild to me that a $1.5 billion settlement can feel like a win for Anthropic, but given that it's undisputed that they downloaded pirated books  (as did Meta and likely many other research teams) the maximum allowed penalty was $150,000 per book, so $3,000 per book is actually a significant discount.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell this case sets a precedent for Anthropic's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/24/anthropic-training/#purchase-and-scan">more recent approach</a> of buying millions of (mostly used) physical books and destructively scanning them for training as covered by "fair use". I'm not sure if other in-flight legal cases will find differently.</p>
<p>To be clear: it appears it is legal, at least in the USA, to buy a used copy of a physical book (used = the author gets nothing), chop the spine off, scan the pages, discard the paper copy and then train on the scanned content. The transformation from paper to scan is "fair use".</p>
<p>If this <em>does</em> hold it's going to be a great time to be a bulk retailer of used books!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The official website for the class action lawsuit is <a href="https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com">www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the coming weeks, and if the court preliminarily approves the settlement, the website will provide to find a full and easily searchable listing of all works covered by the settlement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime the Atlantic have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/search-libgen-data-set/682094/">a search engine</a> to see if your work was included in LibGen, one of the pirated book sources involved in this case.</p>
<p>I had a look and it turns out the book I co-authored with 6 other people back in 2007 <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art/9780980285840/">The Art &amp; Science of JavaScript</a> is in there, so maybe I'm due for 1/7th of one of those $3,000 settlements!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Here's an interesting detail from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/05/anthropic-book-authors-copyright-settlement/">Washington Post story</a> about the settlement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic said in the settlement that the specific digital copies of books covered by the agreement were not used in the training of its commercially released AI models.</p>

      <h1>Selling the Van</h1>

(date: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/09/06/van/">Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
I don’t know about you, but this presentation <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVG8W-0p6vg&amp;t=32s">Tech
Promised Everything. Did it deliver?</a> by <a
href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> seemed to pop up
all over the place for me recently, in podcasts and social media posts.
At some point I initially watched about 1/2 of it, and stopped because
although it seemed kind of sweet I couldn’t understand what the fuss was
about. Then later after seeing it mentioned in another context I
finished watching it. What follows will only make sense if you have seen
it. If you haven’t seen it already I recommend you just close this tab
in your browser and move on with your life.
</p>
<p>
The central conceit of the talk seemed to be that his family sold their
(highly valued) van in order to buy a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> based
on the belief held by Hanselman, his parents, and his fifth grade
teacher Mrs Hill, that computing technology was a “gift” that was going
to “change everything” for the better. As the title suggests, his
presentation is asking whether it turned out that way or not.
</p>
<p>
After talking about the exponential growth of computing in the following
decades he goes on to describe how the use of Large Language Models
(LLM) in schools has resulted in course material being written with
LLMs, which are then completed by students with LLMs, and graded with
LLMs, with neither teacher or student engaging in a collaborative and
creative learning process. He suggests that this <em>is not</em>
realizing the promise of computer technology.
</p>
<p>
I agree, as I imagine you do too. I guess it was actually kind of brave
for Hanselman (a Microsoft employee, who essentially own OpenAI who
created ChatGPT) to get on a stage in front of a large audience and
compare generative AI technology, or Large Language Models, to “computer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad Libs</a>”, and that
not all is well with big-tech. If you’ve been following the news and
discourse around AI and LLMs at all then this certainly will not be news
to you. However, hearing it from Microsoft VP might seem a bit …
unusual?
</p>
<p>
Hanselman goes on to propose that a better use of the technology would
be for students to use generative AI to chat with Albert Einstein, Maya
Angelou, or Nelson Mandela. That the technology should allow us to do
things that “were not possible before” while maintaining “connection,
convenience and creativity”. That we should all learn how generative AI
works, so we can be more thoughtful about how we integrate it into our
lives.
</p>
<p>
But is it not already possible for students to understand Albert
Einstein, Maya Angelou and Nelson Mandela by reading <strong>what they
actually wrote</strong>, and <strong>what they actually said</strong>?
We have books, and recordings, and all kinds of information for teachers
and students to engage with, which can be sourced, cite and share,
preserved and made accessible. How is chatting with some massively
inefficient technology running in a centralized data center, that will
invent things that they might have said, better than what we have now?
The only thing that LLMs do seem to be better at currently is routing
around the copyright laws that prevent these works from being widely
available online.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that the reason why this talk resonated so much in tech
circles is that it is an <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologia">apology</a></em> for
generative AI, that recognizes the so called “AI bubble” that is
threatening to burst, while at the same time reinscribing, and
reauthorizing, the use of generative AI in society. It presents as a
meaningful critique, but is instead a piece of kitsch commentary that is
meant to appeal to a very specific demographic (people like me) who grew
up with these computers, and are grappling with their complicit
participation in a sociotechnical enterprise that has gone off the
rails.
</p>
<p>
This is Big Tech consoling us, that it has a moral compass. Or more
generously, it is one person in Big Tech, trying to recover (on stage)
what it felt like to have a moral compass.
</p>
<p>
One truly startling moment in the talk was when Hanselman showed his
smart phone, smart ring, smart watch, and an insulin sensor on his arm,
to point out that it represents more computation than existed on the
planet in 1980. I’m not sure if this analogy holds, but in broad strokes
it does seem significant right?
</p>
<p>
But for me this analogy invites some questions. Who has these devices in
their pocket, on the wrist, on their finger, and stuck in their arm? How
many resources needed to be extracted for this to happen? Who benefited
from the extraction, manufacture, and dissemination of this technology?
Is all this compute power <em>actually</em> needed to do things we
couldn’t do before? How much centralization of compute (especially by
generative AI) in resource draining data centers run by multinational
corporations has occurred to allow these personal devices to
proliferate? Perhaps that will be the topic of part two of the talk? I’m
not holding my breath.
</p>
<p>
I also am not holding my breath for the “AI Bubble” to burst. I think it
will take more than changes in stock market valuations to right this
ship that drifted off course well before generative AI. Big Tech is a
symptom and not a cure.

(date: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_125_ai_assistants/">Marginallia log</a>)
      <p>
      I&rsquo;ve been using the CoPilot plugin for IntelliJ on and off for the last few years, and while initially pretty enthusiastic, I&rsquo;ve come to first disable it and then delete it altogether along with JetBrains&rsquo; local AI-completions, and generally felt this has been an improvement in productivity and a reduction of frustration.
CoPilot is pretty good at taking things that are already pretty fast, such as monotonous code transformations like mapping an object to a SQL statement, and then making that even faster.

<p>It's just a worker that has state. And because it has state, it also has to have a name, so that you can route to the specific worker that has the state you care about. There may be a sqlite database attached, there may be a container attached. Those are just part of the state.</p></blockquote>

      <h1>Lonely Fans</h1>

(date: 2025-09-05, from: <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/lonely-fans/">Prof. Scott Galloway, No Mercy/No Malace blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Loneliness is lucrative. Leonid Radvinsky, the secretive owner of OnlyFans, received a $700 million windfall last year, while the platform’s top tier of content creators — mostly women — earn millions annually. With $7.2 billion in annual gross revenue and just 46 employees, OnlyFans may be one of the most profitable companies on the planet. [&#8230;]</p>

      Antenna is a feed orient content management tool. It can use to build a and run a blog. What follows are the steps needed to create a simple blog using only Antenna application, Markdown and the Antenna YAML configuration files.

The first thing we need is a directory to hold our website. That can be done from a terminal on Linux, macOS or Windows using the following command.

~~~shell
mkdir myblog
~~~

We want to change into that directory.

~~~shell
cd myblog
~~~ ...

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-embeddinggemma/">Introducing EmbeddingGemma</a></strong></p>
Brand new open weights (under the slightly janky <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms">Gemma license</a>) 308M parameter embedding model from Google:</p>

<p>Based on the Gemma 3 architecture, EmbeddingGemma is trained on 100+ languages and is small enough to run on less than 200MB of RAM with quantization.</p>

<p>As usual for these smaller models there's a <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/embeddinggemma#transformersjs">Transformers.js</a> demo (<a href="https://twitter.com/xenovacom/status/1963638444233511016">via</a>) that runs directly in the browser (in Chrome variants) - <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/semantic-galaxy">Semantic Galaxy</a> loads a ~400MB model and then lets you run embeddings against hundreds of text sentences, map them in a 2D space and run similarity searches to zoom to points within that space.</p>

      <h1>Highlighted tools</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, updated: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/highlighted-tools/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Any time I share my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">collection of tools</a> built using vibe coding and AI-assisted development (now at 124, here's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">the definitive list</a>) someone will inevitably complain that they're mostly trivial.</p>
<p>A lot of them are! Here's a list of some that I think are genuinely useful and worth highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">OCR PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>. This is the tool that started the collection, and I still use it on a regular basis. You can open any PDF in it (even PDFs that are just scanned images with no embedded text) and it will extract out the text so you can copy-and-paste it. It uses PDF.js and Tesseract.js to do that entirely in the browser. I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">how I originally built that here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations">Annotated Presentation Creator</a> - this one is <em>so useful</em>. I use it to turn talks that I've given into full annotated presentations, where each slide is accompanied by detailed notes. I have <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">29 blog entries</a> like that now and most of them were written with the help of this tool. Here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">how I built that</a>, plus <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#annotated-presentations.html">follow-up prompts I used to improve it</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/image-resize-quality">Image resize, crop, and quality comparison</a> - I use this for every single image I post to my blog. It lets me drag (or paste) an image onto the page and then shows me a comparison of different sizes and quality settings, each of which I can download and then upload to my S3 bucket. I recently added a slightly janky but mobile-accessible cropping tool as well. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#image-resize-quality.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper">Social Media Card Cropper</a> - this is an even more useful image tool. Bluesky, Twitter etc all benefit from a 2x1 aspect ratio "card" image. I built this custom tool for creating those - you can paste in an image and crop and zoom it to the right dimensions. I use this all the time. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#social-media-cropper.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render">SVG to JPEG/PNG</a> - every time I publish an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a> I use this tool to turn that SVG into a JPEG or PNG. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#svg-render.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/encrypt">Encrypt / decrypt message</a> - I often run workshops where I want to distribute API keys to the workshop participants. This tool lets me encrypt a message with a passphrase, then share the resulting URL to the encrypted message and tell people (with a note on a slide) how to decrypt it. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#encrypt.html">Prompt</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader">Jina Reader</a> - enter a URL, get back a Markdown version of the page. It's a thin wrapper over the Jina Reader API, but it's useful because it adds a "copy to clipboard" button which means it's one of the fastest way to turn a webpage into data on a clipboard on my mobile phone. I use this several times a week. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#jina-reader.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> - a pricing comparison and token pricing calculator for various hosted LLMs. This one started out as a tool but graduated to its own domain name. Here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#llm-prices.html">prompting development history</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/open-sauce-2025">Open Sauce 2025</a> - an unofficial schedule for the Open Sauce conference, complete with option to export to ICS plus a search tool and now-and-next. I built this <em>entirely on my phone</em> using OpenAI Codex, including scraping the official schedule - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/17/vibe-scraping/">full details here</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/hacker-news-histogram">Hacker News Multi-Term Histogram</a> - compare search terms on Hacker News to see how their relative popularity changed over time. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#hacker-news-histogram.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/passkeys">Passkey experiment</a> - a UI for trying out the Passkey / WebAuthn APIs that are built into browsers these days. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#passkeys.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/incomplete-json-printer">Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer</a> - do you ever find yourself staring at a screen full of JSON that isn't completely valid because it got truncated? This tool will pretty-print it anyway. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#incomplete-json-printer.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/bluesky-firehose">Bluesky WebSocket Feed Monitor</a> - I found out Bluesky has a Firehose API that can be accessed directly from the browser, so I vibe-coded up this tool to try it out. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#bluesky-firehose.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In putting this list together I realized I wanted to be able to link to the prompts for each tool... but those were hidden inside a collapsed <code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;</code> element for each one. So I fired up <a href="https://openai.com/codex/">OpenAI Codex</a> and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Update the script that builds the colophon.html page such that the generated page has a tiny bit of extra JavaScript - when the page is loaded as e.g. https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#jina-reader.html it should notice the #jina-reader.html fragment identifier and ensure that the Development history details/summary for that particular tool is expanded when the page loads.</code></p>

      <h1>Beyond Vibe Coding</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, updated: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/beyond-vibe-coding/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://beyond.addy.ie/">Beyond Vibe Coding</a></strong></p>
Back in May I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/1/not-vibe-coding/">Two publishers and three authors fail to understand what “vibe coding” means</a> where I called out the authors of two forthcoming books on "vibe coding" for abusing that term to refer to all forms of AI-assisted development, when <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding</a> based on the <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original Karpathy definition</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be honest: I don't feel great about that post. I made an example of those two books to push my own agenda of encouraging "vibe coding" to avoid <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/23/semantic-diffusion/">semantic diffusion</a> but it felt (and feels) a bit mean.</p>
<p>... but maybe it had an effect? I recently spotted that Addy Osmani's book "Vibe Coding: The Future of Programming" has a new title, it's now called "Beyond Vibe Coding: From Coder to AI-Era Developer".</p>
<p>This title is <strong>so much better</strong>. Setting aside my earlier opinions, this positioning as a book to help people go <em>beyond</em> vibe coding and use LLMs as part of a professional engineering practice is a really great hook!</p>
<p>From Addy's new description of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vibe coding was never meant to describe all AI-assisted coding. It's a specific approach where you don't read the AI's code before running it. There's much more to consider beyond the prototype for production systems. [...]</p>
<p>AI-assisted engineering is a more structured approach that combines the creativity of vibe coding with the rigor of traditional engineering practices. It involves specs, rigor and emphasizes collaboration between human developers and AI tools, ensuring that the final product is not only functional but also maintainable and secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Vibe-Coding-Leveraging-AI-Assisted/dp/B0F6S5425Y">lists it</a> as releasing on September 23rd. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

      <h1>Google antitrust remedies</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, updated: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/3/antitrust/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf">gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf</a></strong></p>
Here's the 230 page PDF ruling on the 2023 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Google_LLC_(2023)">United States v. Google LLC federal antitrust case</a> - the case that could have resulted in Google selling off Chrome and cutting most of Mozilla's funding.</p>
<p>I made it through the first dozen pages - it's actually quite readable.</p>
<p>It opens with a clear summary of the case so far, bold highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, this court ruled that Defendant Google LLC had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” <strong>The court found that, for more than a decade, Google had entered into distribution agreements with browser developers, original equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers to be the out-of-the box, default general search engine (“GSE”) at key search access points</strong>. These access points were the most efficient channels for distributing a GSE, and Google paid billions to lock them up. The agreements harmed competition. <strong>They prevented rivals from accumulating the queries and associated data, or scale, to effectively compete and discouraged investment and entry into the market</strong>. And they enabled Google to earn monopoly profits from its search text ads, to amass an unparalleled volume of scale to improve its search product, and to remain the default GSE without fear of being displaced. Taken together, these agreements effectively “froze” the search ecosystem, resulting in markets in which Google has “no true competitor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's an interesting generative AI twist: when the case was first argued in 2023 generative AI wasn't an influential issue, but more recently Google seem to be arguing that it is an existential threat that they need to be able to take on without additional hindrance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The emergence of GenAl changed the course of this case. No witness at the liability trial testified that GenAl products posed a near-term threat to GSEs. <strong>The very first witness at the remedies hearing, by contrast, placed GenAl front and center as a nascent competitive threat</strong>. These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among GSEs as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAlI space. Many of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies are crafted with that latter objective in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked this note about the court's challenges in issuing effective remedies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding this power, courts must approach the task of crafting remedies with a healthy dose of humility. This court has done so. It has no expertise in the business of GSEs, the buying and selling of search text ads, or the engineering of GenAl technologies. <strong>And, unlike the typical case where the court’s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge’s forte</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On to the remedies. These ones looked particularly important to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Google will be barred from entering or maintaining any exclusive contract
relating to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant,
and the Gemini app. [...]</li>
<li>Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a
contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final
judgment. Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key
assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints. [...]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess Perplexity <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3dpr0kkyz4o">won't be buying Chrome</a> then!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other
consideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google
Search, Chrome, or its GenAl products. <strong>Cutting off payments from Google
almost certainly will impose substantial —in some cases, crippling—
downstream harms to distribution partners</strong>, related markets, and consumers,
which counsels against a broad payment ban.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks like a huge sigh of relief for Mozilla, who were at risk of losing a sizable portion of their income if Google's search distribution revenue were to be cut off.

      <p>
      Problem You need safe, predictable traffic control in prod. VirtualServices + DestinationRules give version routing, timeouts/retries, and circuit breaking without touching code.
Approach Define versioned subsets in a DestinationRule. Route via VirtualService with weights (canary → rollout). Add timeout, retries, and outlier detection. Shift weights, watch metrics, then cut over. Example (Config) # vs-dr.yaml apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: svc namespace: prod spec: host: svc.prod.svc.cluster.local subsets: - name: v1 labels: version: v1 - name: v2 labels: version: v2 trafficPolicy: tls: mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL outlierDetection: consecutive5xx: 5 interval: 5s baseEjectionTime: 30s maxEjectionPercent: 50 --- apiVersion: networking.

      <p><strong><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2025/making-xml-human-readable-without-xslt/">Making XML human-readable without XSLT</a></strong></p>
In response to the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/xslt/">recent discourse</a> about XSLT support in browsers, Jake Archibald shares a new-to-me alternative trick for making an XML document readable in a browser: adding the following element near the top of the XML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  src="script.js" defer="" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>script.js</code> will then be executed by the browser, and can swap out the XML with HTML by creating new elements using the correct namespace:</p>
<pre><code>const htmlEl = document.createElementNS(
  'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml',
  'html',
);
document.documentElement.replaceWith(htmlEl);
// Now populate the new DOM
</code></pre>

Neat Python library by Darren Burns adding pixel image support to the Rich terminal library, using tricks to render an image using full or half-height colored blocks.</p>

      For better or for worse, AI has colonized this list so thoroughly that AI itself is little more than a list of announcements about new or upgraded models. But there are other points of interest. Is it just a coincidence (possibly to do with BlackHat) that so much happened in security in the past month? [&#8230;]

      <p>I just sent out my August 2025 <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/simonw">sponsors-only newsletter</a></strong> summarizing the past month in LLMs and my other work. Topics included GPT-5, gpt-oss, image editing models (Qwen-Image-Edit and Gemini Nano Banana), other significant model releases and the tools I'm using at the moment.</p>
<p>If you'd like a preview of the newsletter, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/722fc2f242977cb185838353776d14f4">the July 2025 edition</a> I sent out a month ago.</p>
<p>New sponsors get access to the full archive. If you start sponsoring for $10/month or more right now you'll get instant access to <a href="https://github.com/simonw-private/monthly/blob/main/2025-08-august.md">the August edition</a> in my <code>simonw-private/monthly</code> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>If you've already read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/">all 85 posts</a> I wrote in August the newsletter acts mainly as a recap, but I've had positive feedback from people who prefer to get the monthly edited highlights over reading the firehose that is my blog!</p>
<p>Here's the table of contents for the August newsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GPT-5</li>
<li>OpenAl's open models: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b</li>
<li>Other significant model releases in
August</li>
<li>Image editing: Qwen-Image-Edit and
Gemini Nano Banana</li>
<li>More prompt injection and more lethal trifecta</li>
<li>Tools I'm using at the moment</li>
<li>Bonus links</li>

Until then we're at the mercy of pieces of paper (articles of incorporation) that claim to be human without the responsibility attached.

      <h1>Introducing gpt-realtime</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, updated: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/1/introducing-gpt-realtime/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/">Introducing gpt-realtime</a></strong></p>
Released a few days ago (August 28th), <code>gpt-realtime</code> is OpenAI's new "most advanced speech-to-speech model". It looks like this is a replacement for the older <code>gpt-4o-realtime-preview</code> model that was released <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/">last October</a>.</p>
<p>This is a slightly confusing release. The previous realtime model was clearly described as a variant of GPT-4o, sharing the same October 2023 training cut-off date as that model.</p>
<p>I had expected that <code>gpt-realtime</code> might be a GPT-5 relative, but its training date is still October 2023 whereas GPT-5 is September 2024.</p>
<p><code>gpt-realtime</code> also shares the relatively low 32,000 context token and 4,096 maximum output token limits of <code>gpt-4o-realtime-preview</code>.</p>
<p>The only reference I found to GPT-5 in the documentation for the new model was a note saying "Ambiguity and conflicting instructions degrade performance, similar to GPT-5."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-models-prompting#general-usage-tips">usage tips</a> for <code>gpt-realtime</code> have a few surprises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Iterate relentlessly</strong>. Small wording changes can make or break behavior.</p>
<p>Example: Swapping “inaudible” → “unintelligible” improved noisy input handling. [...]</p>
<p><strong>Convert non-text rules to text</strong>: The model responds better to clearly written text.</p>
<p>Example: Instead of writing, "IF x &gt; 3 THEN ESCALATE", write, "IF MORE THAN THREE FAILURES THEN ESCALATE."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a whole lot more prompting tips in the new <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide">Realtime Prompting Guide</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI list several key improvements to <code>gpt-realtime</code> including the ability to configure it with a list of MCP servers, "better instruction following" and the ability to send it images.</p>
<p>My biggest confusion came from <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">the pricing page</a>, which lists separate pricing for using the Realtime API with <code>gpt-realtime</code> and GPT-4o mini. This suggests to me that the old <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview">gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview</a> model is still available, despite it no longer being listed on the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">OpenAI models page</a>.</p>
<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview</code> is a <strong>lot</strong> cheaper:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Model</th>
            <th>Token Type</th>

            <td>$0.30</td>
            <td>$20.00</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The mini model also has a much longer 128,000 token context window.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Turns out that was <a href="https://twitter.com/_agamble/status/1962839472837361807">a mistake in the documentation</a>, that mini model has a 16,000 token context size.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: OpenAI's <a href="https://twitter.com/pbbakkum/status/1962901822135525695">Peter Bakkum clarifies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different voice models in API and ChatGPT, but they share some recent improvements. The voices are also different.</p>
<p>gpt-realtime has a mix of data specific enough to itself that its not really 4o or 5</p>

(date: 2025-09-01, updated: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/1/cloudflare-radar-ai-insights/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights">Cloudflare Radar: AI Insights</a></strong></p>
Cloudflare launched this dashboard <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/expanded-ai-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/">back in February</a>, incorporating traffic analysis from Cloudflare's network along with insights from their popular 1.1.1.1 DNS service.</p>
<p>I found this chart particularly interesting, showing which documented AI crawlers are most active collecting training data - lead by GPTBot, ClaudeBot and Meta-ExternalAgent:</p>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing HTTP traffic by bot over time from August 26 to September 1. HTTP traffic by bot - HTTP request trends for top five most active AI bots. Crawl purpose: Training. GPTBot 31.7% (orange line), ClaudeBot 27.1% (blue line), Meta-ExternalAgent 25.3% (light blue line), Bytespider 9.3% (yellow-green line), Applebot 5.2% (green line). Max scale shown on y-axis. X-axis shows dates: Tue, Aug 26, Wed, Aug 27, Thu, Aug 28, Fri, Aug 29, Sat, Aug 30, Sun, Aug 31, Mon, Sep 1. Top right shows Crawl purpose dropdown set to &quot;Training&quot; with X and checkmark buttons." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/http-traffic-by-bot.jpg" /></p>
<p>Cloudflare's DNS data also hints at the popularity of different services. ChatGPT holds the first place, which is unsurprising - but second place is a hotly contested race between Claude and Perplexity and #4/#5/#6 is contested by GitHub Copilot, Perplexity, and Codeium/Windsurf.</p>
<p>Google Gemini comes in 7th, though since this is DNS based I imagine this is undercounting instances of Gemini on <code>google.com</code> as opposed to <code>gemini.google.com</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing generative AI services popularity rankings over time.

Y-axis shows ranks #1-#10, X-axis shows dates from Mon, Aug 25 to Mon, Sep 1 (partially visible). ChatGPT maintains #1 position throughout.

<p>This website is editable!</p>

<p>If you add <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/?edit=&amp;ref=rss"><code>?edit</code></a> to any URL on this site, it activates <strong>edit mode</strong>. In this mode, you can edit text and apply basic formatting to any element.</p>

<p>Of course, you won’t be able to save changes without having write access to my files, but I can. Using the Web <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access" target="_blank"><strong>File System API</strong></a>, it can update my local copy of the website’s source code.</p>

</window-decor>
<p>In short, I can edit my site via my site. In fact, this article was written this way!</p>

<p>It’s still rough in some cases, but the solution is usable.</p>

<h2>But why?</h2>

<p>As usual, I made this mainly for fun. But having a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor for my posts has been a long time goal ever since I <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/vanilla-web-rewrite?ref=rss" target="_blank">rewrote my site in vanilla HTML</a>.</p>

<p>After I moved away from a static site generator, the need for an extra transformational build step disappeared, allowing the raw HTML source to be directly served in the client. This unlocked a path to source editing in the client! As well as other basic&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces" target="_blank">things</a>&nbsp;for free.</p>

<p>The HTML file can now act as the editing platform, in addition to being the coding and authoring medium, and of course, the publishing medium.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/html-3.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="450" height="300">

<p>We're sticking with standards with this one. I’ve noticed that this has been the tendency of my personal use of Web tech.</p>
<prose-table>
  <table>
    <tbody><tr>
      <th>Instead of…
      </th><th>I use
    </th></tr><tr>
      <td>CMS
      </td><td>the file system
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>frontmatter
      </td><td>read data already in the markup,<br>
        <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tag-chip&gt;</code>s
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>WYSIWYG editor
      </td><td>editable HTML page
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>Advanced editor (?)
      </td><td>text editor (edit HTML code)
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>Widgets (??)
      </td><td>JavaScript
  </td></tr></tbody></table>
</prose-table>
<p>Anyway, these things don’t really impact visitors and readers of this site. It’s more about my writing and authoring experience. Thoughts can now go directly into the page the way it’s gonna be read.</p>

<p>I already felt a bit of that improved flow when I removed the build step and added a <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/simple-live-reload?ref=rss" target="_blank">live reload script</a>, minimising the development feedback loop. With direct editing, feedback loop is instant — no more switching between the text editor and the browser! It’s been extremely valuable during the proofreading and editing phase.</p>

<h2>Content, editable</h2>

<p>Browsers support editing HTML natively via the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute. Set this attribute on any element and it becomes editable. It’s a barebones way to get a WYSIWYG editor in HTML. This is what I’m using as of time of writing.</p>

<p><code>contenteditable</code> formatting options are limited though, and browser implementations vary. Not a problem for now.</p>

<p>Whether <code>contenteditable</code> was good <a href="https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480" target="_blank">or terrible</a>&nbsp;was a minor detail in the bigger picture. The real problem was the <em>Document Object Model</em>…</p>

<h2>DOM vs source</h2>

<p>When I said no build step I kinda lied. You see, there's still an inherent compilation step that happens <em>inside the browser</em>. This step is the parsing of HTML into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" target="_blank"><strong>Document Object Model</strong></a>, or the <strong>DOM</strong>. The “DOM” essentially are the elements that you actually interact with on a webpage.</p>
<box-note>Technically, the DOM is the interface to the elements themselves. For general purposes, <em>the interface is the abstraction</em>.</box-note>
<p>The contenteditable editor edits the DOM, not the HTML source code itself. I needed to somehow save the corresponding DOM edits into the source. It was not very straightforward.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/dom.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="450" height="300">

<p>HTML to DOM conversion is one way. DOM to source HTML would be another thing. And no, <code>innerHTML</code>/<code>outerHTML</code> is not the exact inverse operation.</p>

<p>For example, simply saving <code>html.outerHTML</code> to a file won’t work, because <code>outerHTML</code> (or any DOM introspection method, for that matter) takes a snapshot of the current state of the DOM, including <em>dynamically rendered elements</em>. This would break interactive elements and custom elements in the source, as the rendered elements would incorrectly overwrite the original markup.</p>

<p>Saving the generated <code>outerHTML</code> directly would also mess up any manual formatting that I make in the source code, collapsing whitespaces and forcing HTML entities. <small>(I don’t use Prettier; it produces invalid HTML)</small></p>

<h2>Solution: source patching</h2>

<p>So I made an algorithm to patch the source according to changes made in the DOM. What it does is listen for changes in the DOM tree, and tries to identify the ‘smallest’ textual patch needed to update the source.</p>

<p>It starts with the <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver" target="_blank">MutationObserver API</a></strong>. MutationObserver lets the code respond to changes in the DOM. For each change, the API provides the relevant node(s), as well as the two surrounding unchanged siblings.</p>
<box-note>
  <details>
    <summary>Btw, the MutationObserver API has been <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1105" target="_blank">somewhat</a> <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1111" target="_blank">unwieldy</a>.</summary>

    <p>It only provides coarse details about each change, not like a detailed diff. Also, a single user interaction (say, pressing the Enter key) could cause multiple mutations to fire (the Enter key causes a &lt;p&gt; to be inserted, then a &lt;br&gt; inside the p). Some mutations also end up cancelling each other in the same callback or across multiple callbacks (e.g. span that is added and removed immediately). The exact order and amount of effects also vary by browser.</p>

    <p>My workaround was to collapse multiple mutations into one logical change per resulting subtree.</p>
  </details>
</box-note>
<p>The idea is to update the relevant part of the source without changing the rest. To do this, it finds two anchor points around the mutation. These two points must remain stable throughout the mutation in both DOM and source. Only the content between them are replaced.</p>

<p>So for each change, the steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the unchanged element before the change.
  </li><li>Find the unchanged element after the change.
  </li><li>Use their <em>positions in source</em> as boundaries.
  </li><li>Splice the source <em>between the two boundaries</em> with the updated HTML.
</li></ol>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/splice.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy">

<p>Then there’s the subproblem of mapping the position of the boundary elements in the source code. Extracting the position of any given DOM element in the source code is a bit more involved:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get the element’s ‘address’, or its path in the DOM (unique steps from the root to the element).
  </li><li>Scan the source HTML, tag by tag, keeping track of your current ‘address’ by identifying opening and closing tags.
  </li><li>Compare the current tag’s path-in-source against the element’s path-in-DOM.
  </li><li>If paths match, then the current tag corresponds to the element!
</li></ol>

    <summary>
      <code>getPositionInSource</code> pseudocode
    </summary>

    <code-block>
      <pre><code>/** Gets the position of the given Element in the source code */

    <p>Handling void elements (e.g. <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>) and optional end tags (e.g. <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s with no end tags) require a bit more logic to keep the current path accurate, but the main idea remains the same.</p>

</card-box>
<p>The main algorithm can be described as basically a contextual find-and-replace. Instead of searching for the text to be replaced, it finds the surrounding text and replaces the content in the middle.</p>

<p>This preserves the source code’s original formatting and avoids overwriting dynamic elements! Yay!</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of room for improvement. My current issue is that it’s converting nearby HTML entities to rendered versions (e.g. <code>'&amp;hellip;'</code> to <code>'…'</code>). I think I’d need to implement a more fine-grained editing within an individual text node to solve that.</p>

<p>There are probably a bunch more edges cases that I haven’t discovered, but hey it works well enough to write the text you’re reading!</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://leanrada.com/tools/edit.js" target="_blank">code for the edit mode</a> for more details! Note: This script was made specifically for myself and my site.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>The algorithm doesn’t have to be perfect; I can always fall back to editing the source if certain things don’t work. A good thing about this is that I can switch to either method any time because in the end I'm working on the same HTML file.</p>

<p>When I first imagined this solution, I thought I would only be using it to do the final edits just before publishing a post, but here I am actually writing a whole post.</p>

<p>I can now imagine a workflow where I write the main text in the browser, then go into the HTML to insert media, mark up code blocks, custom elements, and other formatting. And of course, I’d use a code editor to code the interactive sections that I enjoy adding to my posts.</p>

<p>In the future, think I’d like to add more formatting options and UI for inserting code blocks, media, lists, headings, etc. Maybe use <a href="https://quilljs.com/" target="_blank">Quill</a> or something?</p>

<p>The top thing I would love to have is inserting hyperlinks. During final passes on a post, I like to sprinkle hyperlinks on interesting terms, even if just to link the <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> entry.</p>

<p>I’ll post about any improvements I make along the way. This could be a series! I mean, it already kind of is:</p>

      <h1>GSoC 2025: Profiling and Testing Math Functions on GPUs</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-profiling-and-testing-math-functions-on-gpus/">LLVM Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>With the increasing importance of GPU computing, having a robust and familiar C standard library becomes a valuable asset for developers. The LLVM project is actively working to provide this foundation, as a solid libc implementation enables more complex libraries to be developed for and used on GPUs.</p><p>A key part of this effort is providing the C standard math library (LLVM-libm) on GPUs, often reusing the same target-agnostic implementations developed for CPU targets. This context creates a twofold challenge. First, there is a need to systematically <strong>verify the conformance</strong> of these implementations to standards like OpenCL. Second, it is crucial to <strong>benchmark their performance</strong> against the highly-optimized vendor libraries to understand the trade-offs involved.</p><p>This Google Summer of Code 2025 project was designed to address both challenges by developing a framework for conformance testing as well as refining and expanding the existing benchmarking infrastructure. The work provides two benefits to the LLVM community:</p><ul><li>It <strong>empowers libc contributors</strong> with a robust tool to validate their GPU math function implementations.</li><li>It <strong>builds trust with end-users</strong> by providing transparent accuracy and performance data.</li></ul><p>This report details the work completed on this project.</p><h2 id="conformance-testing">Conformance Testing</h2><p>To address the goal of accuracy verification, I implemented a C++ framework for conformance testing within the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/offload/unittests/Conformance"><code>offload/unittests/Conformance</code></a> directory. This framework was designed to be extensible, easy to use, and capable of testing various implementation providers (<code>llvm-libm</code>, <code>cuda-math</code>, <code>hip-math</code>) across different hardware platforms (AMD, NVIDIA).</p><h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3><p>The framework&rsquo;s power and simplicity come from a few key components that work together:</p><ul><li><strong><code>DeviceContext</code></strong>: A lightweight wrapper around the new Offload API that abstracts away the low-level details of device discovery, resource management, and kernel launching.</li><li><strong><code>InputGenerator</code></strong>: An extensible interface for test input generation. The framework provides two concrete implementations:<ul><li><strong><code>ExhaustiveGenerator</code></strong>: Used for functions with small input spaces (e.g., half-precision functions and single-precision univariate functions), this generator iterates over every representable point in a given space, ensuring complete coverage.</li><li><strong><code>RandomGenerator</code></strong>: Used for functions with large input spaces (e.g., single-precision bivariate and double-precision functions), this generator produces a massive, deterministic stream of random points to sample the space thoroughly.</li></ul></li><li><strong><code>GpuMathTest</code></strong>: The main test harness class that orchestrates the entire process. It manages loading the correct GPU binary, setting up device buffers, invoking the generator, launching the kernel, and triggering the verification process.</li><li><strong><code>HostRefChecker</code></strong>: After the GPU computation is complete, this component calculates the expected result for each input on the host CPU (using the correctly rounded LLVM-libm&rsquo;s implementations) and computes the ULP (Units in the Last Place) distance to the actual result from the GPU.</li></ul><p>This architecture makes writing a new, complete test incredibly simple and concise. For example, a full exhaustive test for the <code>expf</code> function requires only a few lines of code:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&#34;mathtest/TestRunner.hpp&#34;</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#75715e">// ... other includes</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// 1.

The second major goal of this project was to refine and expand the existing benchmarking framework to enable fair, reproducible, and insightful performance comparisons between LLVM-libc and vendor-optimized libraries. This effort involved overcoming several subtle challenges and significantly refactoring the infrastructure.</p><h3 id="key-enhancements">Key Enhancements</h3><p>The path to reliable performance data involved a series of foundational improvements to ensure that the results are fair, statistically sound, and reproducible. Key enhancements included:</p><ul><li><strong>Reproducibility and Fairness</strong>: The initial framework was enhanced with a deterministic, per-thread random number generator (PRNG) to ensure that LLVM-libc and vendor libraries are compared using the exact same input sequences. Additionally, to prevent misleading results caused by compiler optimizations, loop unrolling was explicitly disabled in the throughput measurement loop. This change prevents the compiler from aggressively optimizing the transparent libc code in a way that isn&rsquo;t possible for vendor libraries, ensuring a true apples-to-apples comparison.</li><li><strong>Statistical Soundness</strong>: The framework&rsquo;s statistical calculations were improved. The standard deviation is now computed correctly using a sum-of-squares approach, and results from multiple GPU threads are aggregated using a statistically sound pooled mean and variance. The timing logic was also refined to subtract a baseline measurement of the empty benchmark loop, isolating the true cost of the function call.</li><li><strong>Flexible Input Generation and New Benchmarks</strong>: To support a wider range of functions, the framework was refactored with a pluggable input generation system. New distribution classes, <code>UniformExponent</code> (for values spanning orders of magnitude) and <code>UniformLinear</code> (for linear ranges), were introduced. This new flexibility enabled the addition of a comprehensive suite of benchmarks for the <code>exp</code> and <code>log</code> families.</li></ul><h3 id="more-contributions">More Contributions</h3><p>The contributions that refined and expanded the benchmarking infrastructure were submitted in the following pull requests: <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153512">#153512</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153900">#153900</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153971">#153971</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/155727">#155727</a>.</p><h3 id="performance-results">Performance Results</h3><p>As an example, see below part of the output from the <code>log</code> function benchmark on an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. It highlights interesting performance characteristics. Notice the exceptionally low and nearly constant cycles per call for NVIDIA&rsquo;s <code>__nv_logf</code>. Its IR reveals this is due to a compact <code>float</code>-only routine (a fixed sequence of FMAs plus simple bit manipulations) with Flush-To-Zero enabled and no lookup tables or divergent memory accesses.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span

id="future-work">Future Work</h2><p>The next logical steps include:</p><ul><li>Expanding conformance test coverage to include new higher math functions as they are implemented in LLVM-libm.</li><li>Adding performance benchmarks for more higher math functions.</li></ul><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>I would like to express my gratitude to my mentors, Joseph Huber and Tue Ly. I am deeply thankful for their belief in my potential, for their encouragement during the most challenging moments, and for their incredible availability to guide me and review my pull requests, often at night and on weekends. Their mentorship, which was rich with lessons in mathematics, programming, and GPU architecture, was certainly the best part of this experience. I would also like to thank the entire LLVM community for creating a welcoming and collaborative environment.</p>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://passo.uno/docs-contribution-journey/">Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Docs are a product. Contributing to them is among the finest forms of product engagement. Bystanders can become builders and authors: They contribute a verse so that the powerful play can go on. They cease being the product to become the owners of the product narrative. And in this AI age, where docs <a href="https://passo.uno/from-tech-writers-to-ai-context-curators/">matter more than ever</a>, users who write can steer the future of products.</p>

      <h1>Summary of changes for August 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://100r.co/site/log.html#aug2025">Hundred Rabbits blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Hey everyone!</p><p>This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects during the month of August.</p>

<img src="../media/content/videos/august_2025.jpg" alt="a rabbit is sitting amongst a pile of cushions, with the uxn system in one hand and the heart of the system, a beet, in the other" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="679">

  <li><b><a href="https://100r.co/site/wiktopher.html">Wiktopher</a></b>, updated <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/wiktopher-desert-tales/devlog/1006393/updated-ilken-songs" target="_blank">songs</a>.</li>
  <li><b>100r.co</b>, updated <a href="https://100r.co/site/cast_iron_cookware.html">cast iron cookware</a>(seasoning oil suggestions).</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/punk_rabbits.html" target="_blank">Punk Rabbits</a></b>, completed 15 new rabbits(#19-34).</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">Orca</a></b>, pushed a little update that includes the <i>string</i> operator.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/solresol.html" target="_blank">Solresol</a></b>,  illustrated some <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/generic/solresol_curwen.png" target="_blank">curwen signs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In preparation for a programming class that's coming up, we've implemented a graphical tiny-BASIC runtime called <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/sunflower-basic" target="_blank">Sunflower BASIC</a>. It contains the essential blocks of a BASIC language interpreter with enough features to communicate elementary programming concepts and how each one is implemented. We've also released the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYxAdjl1f0" target="_blank">Permacomputing 101</a> talk given at <a href='https://criticalsignals.nz/' target='_blank'>Critical Signals 2025</a> which covered a few interesting aspect of digital preservation and some tactics to craft software in a way that may last.</p>

<p>Choosing to remain in the Southern Gulf islands in August this year has permitted us to pick blackberries, <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/08/18.html" target="_blank">plums</a> and apples. We have incorporated the fruit into <a href="https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_blackberry_cake.html" target="_blank">cakes</a>, or just squished whole berries over morning toast. We processed some of the apples into <a href="https://grimgrains.com/site/chunky_apple_jam.html" target="_blank">jam</a>, and are currently delighting in eating through the rest. We've also been experimenting with the <a href="https://100r.co/site/solar_cooking.html">solar cooker</a>, preparing some <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/08/31.html" target="_blank">cinnamon buns</a> in it for the first time! See our cameo in our friend Peter's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiOcD4e7n6g" target="_blank">latest video</a>.</p>

      <h1>Building Your Own Antenna</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2025/08/31/Building_Your_Own_Antenna.html">Robert's Ramblings</a>)
      <p>
      I have been prototyping my personal news site called [Antenna](https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna) since 2023. It was inspired by Dave Winer's [news.scripting.com](https://news.scripting.com). It has always run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspberry Pi OS (Linux). The content is available over my home network and I make it public by publishing via GitHub pages. Over the last two years it has become the first place I go to consume content from the web (second is Dave's news.scripting.com).

This past month (August 2025), my prototype website lead me to write a new application I am calling [antenna](https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp) after the website that inspired it.

Having the feeds in a simple text format means I curate the feeds more. When I relied on OPML it became just enough extra work hand editing XML that I wanted something simpler. I started with a feed file format inspired by [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org). It was a little too simple, wound up writing scripts to convert that format to something more general (e.g. OPML). I decided to pick something better known for my new application. That got me thinking. Lots of people know Markdown. A collection is a list of zero or more links. That's is easy to express as Markdown. It has the advantage of being able to be convert to other formats as needed (example using a Pandoc filter to render as OPML).

What about other configuration I might need?

The Markdown community has supported Metadata for the Markdown document as "front matter" expressed in YAML. That suggested YAML has been seen by the many in in the Markdown community. YAML front matter is also documented. Why not use it for specific configuration of my collection of feeds? I can use it to express the extra fields that can be included in the channel metadata for rendering RSS 2.0 files. YAML can also serve as the configuration language for the Antenna application. Seems like a good match. I think people who work with Markdown maybe interested in generating static websites, they may have knowledge of YAML so that aligns with my applcation. ...

      <h1>Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality</h1>

(date: 2025-08-30, updated: 2025-08-30, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/30/claude-degraded-quality/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/h26lykctfnsz">Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality</a></strong></p>
Notable because often when people complain of degraded model quality it turns out to be unfounded - Anthropic in the past have emphasized that they don't change the model weights after releasing them without changing the version number.</p>
<p>In this case a botched upgrade of their inference stack cause a genuine model degradation for 56.5 hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 17:30 UTC on Aug 25th to 02:00 UTC on Aug 28th, Claude Opus 4.1 experienced a degradation in quality for some requests. Users may have seen lower intelligence, malformed responses or issues with tool calling in Claude Code.</p>
<p>This was caused by a rollout of our inference stack, which we have since rolled back for Claude Opus 4.1. [...]</p>
<p>We’ve also discovered that Claude Opus 4.0 has been affected by the same issue and we are in the process of rolling it back.</p>

      From a library and archives point of view, this is an interesting approach to crawling. I applaud that Paolo's CRAWLer. It respects the robots.txt! Crawling done correctly. 

In the mean time, I continue to battle the bad bots written by AI and stupid Tech Bros. Such is life.

      <h1>The perils of vibe coding</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, updated: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b3d410a-6e02-41ad-9e0a-c2e4d672ca00">The perils of vibe coding</a></strong></p>
I was interviewed by Elaine Moore for this opinion piece in the Financial Times, which ended up in the print edition of the paper too! I picked up a copy yesterday:</p>
<p><a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg" style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg" alt="The perils of vibe coding - A new OpenAI model arrived this month with a glossy livestream, group watch parties and a lingering sense of disappointment. The YouTube comment section was underwhelmed. “I think they are all starting to realize this isn’t going to become the world like they thought it would,” wrote one viewer. “I can see it on their faces.” But if the casual user was unimpressed, the AI model’s saving grace may be vibe. Coding is generative AI’s newest battleground. With big bills to pay, high valuations to live up to and a market wobble to erase, the sector needs to prove its corporate productivity chops. Coding is hardly promoted as a business use case that already works. For one thing, AI-generated code holds the promise of replacing programmers — a profession of very well paid people. For another, the work can be quantified. In April, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said that up to 50 per cent of the company’s code was now being written by AI. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has said the same thing. Salesforce has paused engineering hires and Mark Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan that Meta would use AI as a “mid-level engineer” that writes code. Meanwhile, start-ups such as Replit and Cursor’s Anysphere are trying to persuade people that with AI, anyone can code. In theory, every employee can become a software engineer. So why aren’t we? One possibility is that it’s all still too unfamiliar. But when I ask people who write code for a living they offer an alternative suggestion: unpredictability. As programmer Simon Willison put it: “A lot of people are missing how weird and funny this space is. I’ve been a computer programmer for 30 years and [AI models] don’t behave like normal computers.” Willison is well known in the software engineering community for his AI experiments. He’s an enthusiastic vibe coder — using LLMs to generate code using natural language prompts. OpenAI’s latest model GPT-3.1s, he is now favourite. Still, he predicts that a vibe coding crash is due if it is used to produce glitchy software. It makes sense that programmers — people who are interested in finding new ways to solve problems — would be early adopters of LLMs. Code is a language, albeit an abstract one. And generative AI is trained in nearly all of them, including older ones like Cobol. That doesn’t mean they accept all of its suggestions. Willison thinks the best way to see what a new model can do is to ask for something unusual. He likes to request an svg (an image made out of lines described with code) of a pelican on a bike and asks it to remember the chickens in his garden by name. Results can be bizarre. One model ignored key prompts in favour of composing a poem. Still, his adventures in vibe coding sound like an advert for the sector’s future. Anthropic’s Claude Code, the favoured model for developers, to make an OCR (optical character recognition) software loves screenshots) tool that will copy and paste text from a screenshot. He wrote software that summarises blog comments and has planned to cut a custom tool that will alert him when a whale is visible from his Pacific coast home. All this by typing prompts in English. It’s sounds like the sort of thing Bill Gates might have had in mind when he wrote that natural language AI agents would bring about “the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons”. But watching code appear and know how it works are two different things. My efforts to make my own comment summary tool produced something unworkable that gave overly long answers and then congratulated itself as a success. Willison says he wouldn’t use AI-generated code for projects he planned to ship out unless he had reviewed each line. Not only is there the risk of hallucination but the chatbot’s desire to be agreeable means it may an unusable idea works. That is a particular issue for those of us who don’t know how to fix the code. We risk creating software with hidden problems. It may not save time either. A study published in July by the non-profit Model Evaluation and Threat Research assessed work done by 16 developers — some with AI tools, some without. Those using AI assistance it had made them faster. In fact it took them nearly a fifth longer. Several developers I spoke to said AI was best used as a way to talk through coding problems. It’s a version of something they call rubber ducking (after their habit of talking to the toys on their desk) — only this rubber duck can talk back. As one put it, code shouldn’t be judged by volume or speed. Progress in AI coding is tangible. But measuring productivity gains is not as neat as a simple percentage calculation."></a></p>

<p>I've been talking about that whale spotting project for far too long. Now that it's been in the FT I really need to build it.</p>

      <h1>Lossy encyclopedia</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, updated: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/lossy-encyclopedia/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Since I love collecting questionable analogies for LLMs, here's a new one I just came up with: an LLM is <strong>a lossy encyclopedia</strong>. They have a huge array of facts compressed into them but that compression is lossy (see also <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">Ted Chiang</a>).</p>
<p>The key thing is to develop an intuition for questions it can usefully answer vs questions that are at a level of detail where the lossiness matters.</p>
<p>This thought sparked by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058688#45060519">a comment</a> on Hacker News asking why an LLM couldn't "Create a boilerplate Zephyr project skeleton, for Pi Pico with st7789 spi display drivers configured". That's more of a lossless encyclopedia question!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058688#45060709">answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to solve this particular problem is to make a correct example available to it. Don't expect it to just know extremely specific facts like that - instead, treat it as a tool that can act on facts presented to it.</p>

      <p>For decades, the phrase “Year of the Linux Desktop” has been tossed around like a tech industry punchline. But now, it’s no longer a meme—it’s a movement. According to the U.S. government’s own analytics, GNU/Linux has officially crossed the 6% threshold in desktop usage. That’s not hype. That’s hard data.</p>

      <h1>Writing Mac and iOS Apps Shouldn’t Be So Difficult</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html">Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>In the ’90s and early 2000s I worked for UserLand Software — <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> was founder and CEO — on a Mac app called UserLand Frontier.</p>

<p>The app was a scripting system and hash-table-oriented database that powered the early blogging and podcasting worlds. (That sounds grand, but it’s probably an understatement — but this post isn’t all about Frontier’s impact on the web, so I won’t go into details.)</p>

<p>The app was implemented in two pieces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>kernel</em>, written in C, implemented the database, networking, inter-application communication, various built-in data types, script compiler and evaluator and debugger, and so on</li>
  <li>The <em>scripts</em> used the kernel and implemented most of the actual app behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it was an app, it had plenty of UI — menus, contextual menus, buttons, larger UI components, and so on. What was brilliant was that you could, for instance, add and edit menus, and when you chose a menu command it would run your script. (Or when you clicked a toolbar button, etc.)</p>

<p>You could write an entire static blog publishing system and the UI to go with it without ever restarting the app. Click a thing, then see what happens in the app — and if it’s not right you’d edit the script, which would be automatically recompiled when called the next time.</p>

<p>In other words, there was absolutely no friction when it came to iteration. Write some code without restarting and see your changes immediately.</p>

<h3 id="how-good-was-this-really-in-practice">How good was this really in practice?</h3>

<p>You might imagine that we could do this for an hour or so before having to make changes to the kernel. Not so.</p>

<p>In fact, for the first three years I was there (might have been longer), I never even <em>saw</em> the kernel code. I worked all day every day as a professional developer at the script level, never having to restart the app. Just iterating like this all day long.</p>

<p>You might also imagine that the app was sluggish and slow since much of it was scripts instead of C code. It wasn’t! Scripts could be slow for the same reasons any code could be slow (I/O, of course, and algorithms and data structures not suited to the problem at hand) — but the app never felt slow.</p>

<p>I’ll remind you of the timing: <em>this was the ’90s.</em> We worked this way for real, and we were amazingly productive.</p>

<p>A scripting language plus key bits implemented in C was more than fast enough for an app. Even all those years ago.</p>

<h3 id="a-scripting-language-built-for-productivity">A scripting language built for productivity</h3>

<p>I’m not writing this article to praise Frontier — I’m talking about it to make a point, which I’ll get to.</p>

<p>But I wanted to bring up a second aspect to this: it’s not just frictionless iteration that was so great, it was also the scripting language and environment.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of this was how easy persistence was. I mentioned the hash-table-based database. Hash tables could contain hash tables (Swift developers: picture a Dictionary inside a Dictionary, and so on).</p>

<p>(We just called them tables for short — but remember that these are hash tables, not tables in a SQL database.)</p>

<p>In any script, at any time, without any ceremony, you could read and write from the database simply using dot notation: <code>user.prefs.city = "Seattle"</code> would set the value of <code>city</code> in the <code>prefs</code> table which was contained by the <code>user</code> table. This value would persist between runs of the app, because it was stored in the database.</p>

<p>(You could also pass around addresses of things too — it was quite common to pass the address of a table to another script, so that the other script wouldn’t need to hardcode a location.)</p>

<p>It was utterly automatic. And it meant that while we did have to choose where in the database to store things, and how to structure our storage, we didn’t have to choose a storage mechanism. It was the database.</p>

<p>(Note: of course we could read and write files, and did so when necessary. But the point is that the database handled almost all our persistence and in a super-easy way.)</p>

<p>(Also note: the database had a UI. It was visible and browsable. You could and often did hand-edit it. Even the scripts lived in the database, and were addressable via dot notation, like everything else.)</p>

<h3 id="we-had-nice-things">We had nice things!</h3>

<p>I’ll say again — this was in the ’90s, more than 25 years ago, and it was a great way of working on an app.</p>

<p>I’m not saying apps these days need to be Frontier-like in any details. But it seems absolutely bizarre to me that we — we who write Mac and iOS apps — still have to build and run the app, make changes, build and run the app, and so on, all day long. In the year 2025.</p>

<p>And it seems retro in the worst way that we’re still using anything other than a scripting language for most of our code. We should be using something simple and light that can configure toolbars, handle networking callbacks, query databases, manage views, and so on. And maybe with a DSL for SwiftUI-like declarative UI.</p>

<p>Almost none of that code needs to be in a lower-level language like Swift or Objective-C. It really doesn’t. (I say this as a performance junkie!)</p>

<p>It could be in Ruby, Lua, Python, or JavaScript. Better still would be a new language invented specifically for the problem of writing apps, something designed to make the common challenges of app writing easier.</p>

<p>We did have this stuff decades ago. Not for app making in general, sure — but now it’s 25 years later, and a company like Apple could make this real for all its app makers.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why things are the way they are right now, and you can point to a string of good decisions. No doubt.</p>

<p>But we can think outside of what we have now and ask: what would make app writing easier? What would make it a better experience? How could we get more done for our users with fewer bugs and faster turnaround?</p>

<p>I’m not saying that Frontier’s specific choices are the answer — I’m saying that the combination of frictionless iteration plus a purpose-built scripting language was extremely powerful, and we could use those things now.</p>

<p>And at some point I suspect these things are going to be table stakes for any platform that wants to attract developers. If you were a new developer right now, would you pick Xcode’s build-and-run, edit, build-and-run, edit — plus the growing complexity of Swift — over something like Electron and JavaScript?</p>

<h3 id="random-notes">Random notes</h3>

<p>Yes, I know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC">PyObjc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyCocoa">RubyCocoa</a>. Without first-class support in Apple’s developer tools, these were never going to work as popular alternatives.</p>

<p>I also know about (and use) Swift playgrounds and SwiftUI previews. Neither of these are as satisfying to use as I’d like, and neither of these are nearly as great as frictionless iteration in the actual app.</p>

<p>I also remember Xcode fix-and-continue, which didn’t work well enough to solve the problem of frictionless iteration.</p>

<p>Anyway… One more thing about Frontier: we had a system where people could get updates to the app automatically via the web. Those updates were just serialized versions of scripts at various database locations, which would get unpacked and stored in each user’s database. (Those who opted-in, of course.) The app would not have to be restarted to get bug fixes and new features! And of course the updates were very small, since they didn’t include the entire app. This seems so futuristic, but we had this in 1999. Why couldn’t we have this now?</p>

      <p>
      How you engage with the world changes how you experience the world, and how the world experiences you.
A snarky and cynical approach, by its default assumption that things are shit, or if they are not yet shit will inevitably turn to; such an approach will give your world a malodorous brownish tint.
Granted, snark gives you plausible deniability, a motte-and-bailey that protects you from direct criticism, encountering backlash you can always backpedal and say it was just a joke that you accidentally took a bit too far.

      <h1>V&A East Storehouse and Operation Mincemeat in London</h1>

(date: 2025-08-27, updated: 2025-08-27, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/27/london-culture/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>We were back in London for a few days and yesterday had a day of culture.</p>
<p>First up: the brand new <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/east/storehouse/visit">V&amp;A East Storehouse</a> museum in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park near Stratford, which opened on May 31st this year.</p>
<p>This is a delightful new format for a museum. The building is primarily an off-site storage area for London's Victoria and Albert museum, storing 250,000 items that aren't on display in their main building.</p>
<p>The twist is that it's also open to the public. Entrance is free, and you can climb stairs and walk through an airlock-style corridor into the climate controlled interior, then explore three floors of walkways between industrial shelving units holding thousands of items from the collection.</p>
<p>There is almost no signage aside from an occasional number that can help you look up items in the online catalog.</p>
<p>I found the lack of signs to be unexpectedly delightful: it compels you to really pay attention to the items on display.</p>
<p>There's so much great stuff in here. I particularly appreciated the two storey street-facing façades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_Gardens">Robin Hood Gardens</a>, a brutalist London residential estate completed in 1972 and demolished in 2017 through 2025. I also really enjoyed the Kaufman Office, an office space transplanted from Pittsburgh that is "the only complete interior designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright on permanent display outside the USA."</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/v-a-east-1.jpg" alt="Three levels of the Storehouse, each with walkways full of people looking at a variety of exhibits on shelves. Two huge concrete facades from the Robin Hood Gardens hang between the floors." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The building is a working museum warehouse and preservation facility, and there are various points where you can look out into the rest of the space (I enjoyed spotting a cluster of grandfather clocks in the distance) or watch the curators arranging and preserving new artifacts.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/113">added it to Niche Museums</a> with whole lot more of my photos.</p>
<p>In the evening we headed to the Fortune Theater to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat_(musical)">Operation Mincemeat</a> at the recommendation of several friends. It's a <em>fantastic</em> musical telling the story of a real British covert operation that took place during World War II. A cast of five take on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mincemeatbway/video/7538109771023453462">86 roles</a>, sometimes switching roles live on stage multiple times during a single number. It's hilarious, touching, deeply entertaining and manages to start at high energy and then continually escalate that energy as the show continues.</p>
<p>The original British cast (three of whom co-wrote it) have moved to New York for a broadway production that started in March. The cast we saw in London were outstanding.</p>
<p>It's a tiny theater - the West End's second smallest at 432 seats (the smallest is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Theatre">Arts Theater</a> at 350) which makes for an intimate performance.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved it and would jump at the chance to see it again.</p>

I couldn&#8217;t share a file on my Mac with the simulator. I couldn&#8217;t save a file on the simulator, for example from my own app or from the Apple [&#8230;]

      Whatever, Jamie (via Hacker News): This last decade has seen an inundation of new JavaScript runtimes (and engines in equal measure), enabling us to run JavaScript in all manner of contexts with precise fitness for task. Through these, we&#8217;ve seen the language spread to the Cloud, the edge, Smart TVs, mobile devices, and even microcontrollers.In [&#8230;]

      <h1>Piloting Claude for Chrome</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, updated: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/26/piloting-claude-for-chrome/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome">Piloting Claude for Chrome</a></strong></p>
Two days ago <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/">I said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly expect that the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today Anthropic announced their own take on this pattern, implemented as an invite-only preview Chrome extension.</p>
<p>To their credit, the majority of the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12012173-getting-started-with-claude-for-chrome">support article</a> is information about the security risks. From their post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as people encounter phishing attempts in their inboxes, browser-using AIs face prompt injection attacks—where malicious actors hide instructions in websites, emails, or documents to trick AIs into harmful actions without users' knowledge (like hidden text saying "disregard previous instructions and do [malicious action] instead").</p>
<p>Prompt injection attacks can cause AIs to delete files, steal data, or make financial transactions. This isn't speculation: we’ve run “red-teaming” experiments to test Claude for Chrome and, without mitigations, we’ve found some concerning results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their 123 adversarial prompt injection test cases saw a 23.6% attack success rate when operating in "autonomous mode". They added mitigations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we added safety mitigations to autonomous mode, we reduced the attack success rate of 23.6% to 11.2%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that 11.2% is still a catastrophic failure rate. In the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern.</p>
<p>Anthropic don't recommend autonomous mode - where the extension can act without human intervention. Their default configuration instead requires users to be much more hands-on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site-level permissions</strong>: Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites at any time in the Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Action confirmations</strong>: Claude asks users before taking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hate being stop energy on this topic. The demand for browser automation driven by LLMs is significant, and I can see why. Anthropic's approach here is the most open-eyed I've seen yet but it still feels doomed to failure to me.</p>
<p>I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks of this pattern.

      Matt Massicotte (Mastodon): So, no doubt there&#8217;s lots of historical stuff going on here.But, that still doesn&#8217;t explain how much trouble people have with ModelActor. I&#8217;m not sure anyone has ever used ModelActor without at least some surprises.[&#8230;]Actors exist to protect mutable state. The purpose of a ModelActor is to own and isolate the ModelContext.

Although they&#8217;re relatively old, macOS made major changes in their management in Ventura, and they&#8217;ve become popular in many third-party apps. [&#8230;]

      Choosing the right LLM has become a full-time job. New models appear almost daily, each offering different capabilities, prices, and quirks, from reasoning strengths to cost efficiency to code generation. This competition creates strong incentives for AI labs to carve out a niche and gives new startups room to emerge, resulting in a fragmented landscape [&#8230;]

Great piece from Andy Baio demonstrating quite how convoluted the usage ethics and backlash against generative AI has become.</p>
<p>Will Smith has been accused of using AI to misleadingly inflate the audience sizes of his recent tour. It looks like the audiences were real, but the combined usage of static-image-to-video models by his team with YouTube's ugly new compression experiments gave the resulting footage an uncanny valley effect that lead to widespread doubts over the veracity of the content.

      <h1>Tough Season in the Apple Fields</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/25/tough-season.html">Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>We’re adopting Liquid Glass for NetNewsWire 7, which we’ll release some time after the new versions of macOS and iOS come out.</p>

<p>Stuart Breckenridge has been doing great work on getting this done — and he’s written up a couple blog posts (with screenshots!) on his progress. See:</p>

<p><a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-ii-netnewswire-mac/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part II (NetNewsWire Mac)</a><br />
<a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-iii-netnewswire-ios/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part III (NetNewsWire iOS)</a></p>

<p>Since the app is made with mostly stock Apple UI, you might think that using Liquid Glass would be very little work, that it might be pretty automatic or just a matter of checking a few boxes. But that’s not true this year: it’s been a fair amount of work.</p>

<p>Other apps, apps with more custom UI, will probably have even more work, but even for us it’s been more than a bit.</p>

<p>And we’re not done. There will be little things (hopefully just little things) still to do before shipping. Including verifying that it all works as expected on the actual OS releases.</p>

<p>But all credit to Stuart, who got right on this and did a superb job.</p>

<p>(Note: if you want to see the code, you can: it’s on our <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/tree/experimental/liquid-glass">experimental/liquid-glass branch</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="but-my-mac">But My Mac</h3>

<p>As pleased as I am with Stuart’s work, I’m not pleased with Liquid Glass itself.</p>

<p>I don’t really care about it on iOS/iPadOS, because whatever. I don’t love those devices. I love Macs because it’s on Macs where you can set out to make new things that change the world.</p>

<p>(Okay. Fine. On iPhones and iPads you <em>can</em>, I guess, but generally it’s much harder, and it has to be an approved activity using an approved app. And one thing you definitely can’t do on those devices is create apps. [All apologies to people who do manage to edit their podcast episodes on an iPad or write at length on an iPhone. Cool! But I hope that even those folks will grant me my point.])</p>

<p>And so I seriously dislike the experience of using a Mac with Liquid Glass. The UI has become the star, but the drunken star, blurry, illegible, and physically unstable. It makes making things way more of a struggle than it used to be.</p>

<p>We had pretty good Mac UI, but Apple took the bad parts of it — the translucency and blurriness already there — and dialed it way up and called it content-centric. But it seems to me the opposite. Liquid Glass is Liquid-Glass-centric.</p>

<h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>

<p>First thing: I have many friends at Apple and I didn’t want to write any of this. And there are legions of engineers and designers who I don’t know but whose work I respect greatly. It’s not their fault that this is the direction of the UI.</p>

<p>And this is not the first time we’re going through a rough patch with Apple. I think of them as seasons — we had, for instance, terrible-keyboard season not so long ago. We were wondering if Apple would just stop making Macs altogether. But then that passed and we even got these wonderful Apple Silicon machines. Seasons end.</p>

<p>And we’re in a tough season with Swift these days too. It’s gotten so complex and difficult that I find myself daydreaming about going back to Objective-C. Objective-C is definitely funny-looking, but once you get past that it’s actually small and simple.</p>

<p>But with <a href="https://www.donnywals.com/what-is-approachable-concurrency-in-xcode-26/">Swift approachable concurrency</a> and other changes I can see eventually getting through this season and to a pretty great place, so I’m optimistic.</p>

<p>Seasons do end, in other words, or mostly seem to end (though not the App Store monopoly season, not so far), and I’ve resolved to just wait for Liquid Glass’s replacement. Perhaps along the way it will get refined enough so that people like me can use it without eye strain.</p>

<h3 id="better-perspective">Better Perspective</h3>

<p>But far, far worse than any of the above is Tim Cook’s gold statue presented to the President. And everything that went along with that. I felt utterly sick and I bet you did too. (And it made me seriously wonder if I wanted to continue writing apps for Apple platforms.)</p>

<p>I understand John Gruber’s argument in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">Gold, Frankincense, and Silicon</a> that maybe Cook’s move was the best possible move in a terribly corrupted system.</p>

<p>But what’s the use of being so rich and so powerful, I would ask Tim Cook, if you, even more than regular people, have to debase yourself before the dictator?</p>

<p>It’s tempting to think that our current government is just a season, like the bad keyboards or like Liquid Glass will eventually prove to be. Wait till the mid-terms or the next presidential election, you might think.</p>

<p>But there’s no reason to think that this authoritarian turn is just a season. Something besides just wishing and waiting for better is required.</p>

      <h1>Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, updated: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/">Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet</a></strong></p>
The security team from Brave took a look at Comet, the LLM-powered "agentic browser" extension from Perplexity, and unsurprisingly found security holes you can drive a truck through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vulnerability we’re discussing in this post lies in how Comet processes webpage content: when users ask it to “Summarize this webpage,” Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user’s instructions and untrusted content from the webpage. This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands. For instance, an attacker could gain access to a user’s emails from a prepared piece of text in a page in another tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visit a Reddit post with Comet and ask it to summarize the thread, and malicious instructions in a post there can trick Comet into accessing web pages in another tab to extract the user's email address, then perform all sorts of actions like triggering an account recovery flow and grabbing the resulting code from a logged in Gmail session.</p>
<p>Perplexity attempted to mitigate the issues reported by Brave... but an update to the Brave post later confirms that those fixes were later defeated and the vulnerability remains. </p>
<p>Here's where things get difficult: Brave themselves are developing an agentic browser feature called Leo. Brave's security team describe the following as a "potential mitigation" to the issue with Comet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The browser should clearly separate the user’s instructions from the website’s contents when sending them as context to the model. The contents of the page should always be treated as untrusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only it were that easy! This is the core problem at the heart of prompt injection which we've been talking about for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">nearly three years</a> - to an LLM the trusted instructions and untrusted content are concatenated together into the same stream of tokens, and to date (despite many attempts) nobody has demonstrated a convincing and effective way of distinguishing between the two.</p>
<p>There's an element of "those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones here" - I strongly expect that the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely.</p>
<p>One piece of good news: this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004846">Hacker News conversation</a> about this issue was almost entirely populated by people who already understand how serious this issue is and why the proposed solutions were unlikely to work. That's new: I'm used to seeing people misjudge and underestimate the severity of this problem, but it looks like the tide is finally turning there.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004846#45017568">a comment on Hacker News</a> Brave security lead Shivan Kaul Sahib confirms that they are aware of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/11/camel/">the CaMeL paper</a>, which remains my personal favorite example of a credible approach to this problem.

      <h1>Static Sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker</h1>

(date: 2025-08-24, updated: 2025-08-24, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/24/uv-caddy-and-docker/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/static-python-uv-caddy-docker/">Static Sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker</a></strong></p>
Nik Kantar documents his Docker-based setup for building and deploying mostly static web sites in line-by-line detail.</p>
<p>I found this really useful. The Dockerfile itself without comments is just 8 lines long:</p>
<pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:debian AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN uv python install 3.13
RUN uv run --no-dev sus
FROM caddy:alpine
COPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
COPY --from=build /src/output /srv/
</code></pre>
<p>He also includes a Caddyfile that shows how to proxy a subset of requests to the Plausible analytics service.</p>
<p>The static site is built using his <a href="https://github.com/nkantar/sus">sus</a> package for creating static URL redirecting sites, but would work equally well for another static site generator you can install and run with <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<p>Nik deploys his sites using <a href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a>, a new-to-me take on the self-hosting alternative to Heroku/Vercel pattern which helps run multiple sites on a collection of hosts using Docker containers.</p>
<p>A bunch of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985653">Hacker News comments</a> dismissed this as over-engineering. I don't think that criticism is justified - given Nik's existing deployment environment I think this is a lightweight way to deploy static sites in a way that's consistent with how everything else he runs works already.</p>
<p>More importantly, the world needs more articles like this that break down configuration files and explain what every single line of them does.

      Blue states are essentially paying red states to undermine democracy.

      <h1>Warmshowers sparks joy</h1>

      <p>I have a friend with whom I like to go travelling on a bicycle. We usually go for a couple of weeks, and we&rsquo;ve been doing it regularly over the past five years. We&rsquo;ve cycled in France and England so far. Both countries have many affordable campsites, and there&rsquo;s always a decent hotel/Airbnb not too far for when it&rsquo;s raining.</p>

<p>But this year we travelled through Switzerland, which is prohibitively expensive, and somewhat lacking in terms of places to camp. We were aware of <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers</a> and decided to give it a try. It was fantastic, and opened our eyes on what travelling and <a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/connect/">connecting</a> with people can be like. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever travel like we used to anymore.</p>
