By making effort an optional factor in higher education rather than the
whole <em>point</em> of it, LLMs risk producing a generation of students
who have simply <em>never experienced</em> the feeling of focused
intellectual work. Students who have never faced writer’s block are also
students who have never experienced the blissful flow state that comes
when you break through writer’s block. Students who have never searched
fruitlessly in a library for hours are also students who, in a
fundamental and distressing way, simply don’t know what a library is
even for.

<h2 id="shisa-v2-405b-japans-highest-performing-llm">Shisa V2 405B:
Japan’s Highest Performing LLM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, updated: 2025-06-03, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://shisa.ai/posts/shisa-v2-405b/">Shisa V2 405B:
Japan’s Highest Performing LLM</a></strong>
</p>
Leonard Lin and Adam Lensenmayer have been working on
<a href="https://shisa.ai/">Shisa</a> for a while. They describe their
latest release as “Japan’s Highest Performing LLM”.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Shisa V2 405B is the highest-performing LLM ever developed in Japan, and
surpasses GPT-4 (0603) and GPT-4 Turbo (2024-04-09) in our eval battery.
(It also goes toe-to-toe with GPT-4o (2024-11-20) and DeepSeek-V3 (0324)
on Japanese MT-Bench!)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This 405B release is a follow-up to the six smaller Shisa v2 models they
released <a href="https://shisa.ai/posts/shisa-v2/">back in April</a>,
which took a similar approach
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/">to
DeepSeek-R1</a> in producing different models that each extended
different existing base model from Llama, Qwen, Mistral and Phi-4.
</p>
<p>
The new 405B model uses Llama 3.1 405B Instruct as a base, and is
available under the
<a href="https://www.llama.com/llama3_1/license/">Llama 3.1 community
license</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shisa is a prominent example of <strong>Sovereign AI</strong> - the
ability for nations to build models that reflect their own language and
culture:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We strongly believe that it’s important for homegrown AI to be developed
both in Japan (and globally!), and not just for the sake of cultural
diversity and linguistic preservation, but also for data privacy and
security, geopolitical resilience, and ultimately, independence.
</p>
<p>
We believe the open-source approach is the only realistic way to achieve
sovereignty in AI, not just for Japan, or even for nation states, but
for the global community at large.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accompanying
<a href="https://shisa.ai/posts/shisa-v2-405b/#overview-report">overview
report</a> has some fascinating details:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Training the 405B model was extremely difficult. Only three other groups
that we know of: Nous Research, Bllossom, and AI2 have published Llama
405B full fine-tunes. […] We implemented every optimization at our
disposal including: DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 parameter and activation
offloading, gradient accumulation, 8-bit paged optimizer, and sequence
parallelism. Even so, the 405B model still barely fit within the H100’s
memory limits
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the new model the Shisa team have published
<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/shisa-ai/shisa-v2-sharegpt/viewer">shisa-ai/shisa-v2-sharegpt</a>,
180,000 records which they describe as “a best-in-class synthetic
dataset, freely available for use to improve the Japanese capabilities
of any model. Licensed under Apache 2.0”.
</p>
<p>
An interesting note is that they found that since Shisa out-performs
GPT-4 at Japanese that model was no longer able to help with evaluation,
so they had to upgrade to GPT-4.1:
</p>
<p>
<p><img alt="Comparison of GPT-4.1 vs GPT-4 as judges showing two radar charts comparing Shisa V2 405B and 70B models on JA MT-Bench benchmarks, with text &quot;Why use GPT-4.1 rather than GPT-4 as a Judge?&quot; and explanation that Shisa models exceed GPT-4 in Japanese performance and GPT-4 cannot accurately distinguish performance differences among stronger models, noting GPT-4.1 applies stricter evaluation criteria for more accurate assessment" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/shisa-gpt-4.jpg" /></p>

All Nuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, updated: 2025-06-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">My AI Skeptic
Friends Are All Nuts</a></strong>
</p>
Thomas Ptacek’s frustrated tone throughout this piece perfectly captures
how it feels sometimes to be an experienced programmer trying to argue
that “LLMs are actually really useful” in many corners of the internet.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some of the smartest people I know share a bone-deep belief that AI is a
fad — the next iteration of NFT mania. I’ve been reluctant to push back
on them, because, well, they’re smarter than me. But their arguments are
unserious, and worth confronting. Extraordinarily talented people are
doing work that LLMs already do better, out of spite. […]
</p>
<p>
You’ve always been responsible for what you merge to <code>main</code>.
You were five years go. And you are tomorrow, whether or not you use an
LLM. […]
</p>
<p>
Reading other people’s code is part of the job. If you can’t metabolize
the boring, repetitive code an LLM generates: skills issue! How are you
handling the chaos human developers turn out on a deadline?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And on the threat of AI taking jobs from engineers (with a link to an
old comment of mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43775358#43776612">So does
open source.</a> We used to pay good money for databases.
</p>
<p>
We’re a field premised on automating other people’s jobs away.
“Productivity gains,” say the economists. You get what that means,
right? Fewer people doing the same stuff. Talked to a travel agent
lately? Or a floor broker? Or a record store clerk? Or a darkroom tech?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The post has already attracted
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44163063">695 comments</a>
on Hacker News in just two hours, which feels like some kind of record
even by the usual standards of fights about AI on the internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Thomas, another hundred or so comments
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44163063#44165137">later</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A lot of people are misunderstanding the goal of the post, which is not
necessarily to persuade them, but rather to disrupt a static,
unproductive equilibrium of uninformed arguments about how this stuff
works. The commentary I’ve read today has to my mind vindicated that
premise.

I have found AI incredibly useful when I jump into <em>other

Tom MacWright does some archaeology and describes the three different

are processed:
</p>
<p>
<code>“a directive”;</code> is a

prologue</a>, most commonly seen with <code>“use strict”;</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>/** <span class="citation" data-cites="aPragma">@aPragma</span>

</p>
I’ve been thinking for a while it would be interesting to run some kind
of HTTP proxy against the Claude Code CLI app and take a peek at how it
works.
</p>
<p>
Mario Zechner just published a really nice version of that. It works by
monkey-patching
<a href="https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/blob/a19ef3b472701559df4f9d70766b97f5ed876535/apps/claude-trace/src/interceptor.ts#L152-L240">global.fetch</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/blob/a19ef3b472701559df4f9d70766b97f5ed876535/apps/claude-trace/src/interceptor.ts#L242-L286">Node
HTTP library</a> and then running Claude Code
<a href="https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/blob/a19ef3b472701559df4f9d70766b97f5ed876535/apps/claude-trace/src/cli.ts#L136-L153">using
Node</a> with an extra <code>–require interceptor-loader.js</code>
option to inject the patches.
</p>
<p>
Provided you have Claude Code installed and configured already, an easy
way to run it is via npx like this:
</p>
<pre><code>npx @mariozechner/claude-trace --include-all-requests
</code></pre>
<p>
I tried it just now and it logs request/response pairs to a
<code>.claude-trace</code> folder, as both <code>jsonl</code> files and
HTML.
</p>
<p>
The HTML interface is <em>really nice</em>. Here’s
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/log-2025-06-02-17-10-25.html">an
example trace</a> - I started everything running in my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">llm checkout</a> and asked
Claude to “tell me about this software” and then “Use your agent tool to
figure out where the code for storing API keys lives”.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Web-based debug log interface showing a conversation trace where USER asks &quot;Use your agent tool to figure out where the code for storing API keys lives&quot;, followed by ASSISTANT invoking dispatch_agent with a search prompt, then a Tool Result showing partial text about API key management functionality locations, and a Raw Tool Call section displaying the full JSON request with tool_use details including id, name, input prompt, and cache_control settings. The assistant concludes that key functionality is in cli.py with keys stored securely in keys.json in the user directory, manageable via commands like llm keys set openai and llm keys list." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-trace.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I specifically requested the “agent” tool here because I noticed in the
tool definitions a tool called <strong>dispatch_agent</strong> with this
tool definition (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: GlobTool,
GrepTool, LS, View, ReadNotebook. When you are searching for a keyword
or file and are not confident that you will find the right match on the
first try, <strong>use the Agent tool to perform the search for
you</strong>. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you are searching for a keyword like “config” or “logger”, the Agent
tool is appropriate
</li>
<li>
If you want to read a specific file path, use the View or GlobTool tool
instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
</li>
<li>
If you are searching for a specific class definition like “class Foo”,
use the GlobTool tool instead, to find the match more quickly
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Usage notes:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible</strong>,
to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple
tool uses
</li>
<li>
When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The
result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the
user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a
concise summary of the result.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send
additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to
communicate with you outside of its final report</strong>. Therefore,
your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the
agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what
information the agent should return back to you in its final and only
message to you.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The agent’s outputs should generally be trusted</strong>
</li>
<li>
IMPORTANT: The agent can not use Bash, Replace, Edit, NotebookEditCell,
so can not modify files. If you want to use these tools, use them
directly instead of going through the agent.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’d heard that Claude Code uses the LLMs-calling-other-LLMs pattern -
one of the reason it can burn through tokens so fast! It was interesting
to see how this works under the hood - it’s a tool call which is
designed to be used concurrently (by triggering multiple tool uses at
once).
</p>
<p>
<p>Anthropic have deliberately chosen not to publish any of the prompts
used by Claude Code. As with
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#the-missing-prompts-for-tools">other
hidden system prompts</a>, the prompts themselves mainly act as a
missing manual for understanding exactly what these tools can do for you
and how they work.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: reb00ted blog (Johannes Ernst, sustainabilty

<div class="slide-in-img slide-in-img-right">
<p><a href="https://time.com/7288387/sam-altman-orb-tools-for-humanity/">

<p>
“The Orb” is popping up in all sorts of places, most recently in
<a href="https://time.com/7288387/sam-altman-orb-tools-for-humanity/">Time
magazine’s “The Orb Will See You Now”</a>. It’s being heralded as
everything from the one and final solution for privacy-protecting
digital identity online, to a civil liberties nightmare, to an
indispensable tool for preventing an AI takeover, to a quick way to make
$42, and more.
</p>
<p>
But what it actually does and how it works is remarkably hard to find
out. In a
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/27n5EhUUFnDkxKn0MXm6aB?si=82gAJ1BGTN-ZPg13LMeNOQ&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=f2f457f1ac6943bd">recent
podcast</a>, the team behind the project took more than two hours to
explain it, and that was only the highlights with no detail. No wonder
theories are all over the place.
</p>
<p>
I listened to that podcast, and I think I can explain it in 5 min. Read
on, and we’ll start at the place where the value occurs: the Relying
Party.
</p>
<p>
“Relying Party” is a geek term for a website or app into which you want
to log in. So: all the value of the Orb and the app and networks and all
of that is because users can log into websites or apps with this system
(which doesn’t even have a good name. It’s not the Orb, which in the
grand scheme of things is not important. It’s not the World Coin. Maybe
it’s the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_(blockchain)">World
Network</a>, but that name is so bland to be almost useless. I’m going
to call it WN for this post.)
</p>
<p>
So you can log into a website or app with WN. That feature is of course
not unique. You can log into websites or apps with other things, like
usernames and passwords, or your Google or Facebook account or
<a href="https://openid.org/">OpenID</a>. But unlike other ways of
logging in, if you log into a website or app with WN, the website or app
is being guaranteed by all the tech that WN throws at it that a user who
already has an account on the website or app they want to log in, cannot
make a second account for the same website or app.
</p>
<p>
Have multiple Reddit accounts? Multiple Gmail addresses? Or multiple
Amazon accounts? If those sites were to implement WN, you could not do
that. Instead, those sites could be fairly certain that any new account
created on their site was 1) created by a human and 2) each account was
created by a different human. (Actually, the site can let you create
multiple accounts, but only if it knows that all of them belong to you.
You cannot create separate accounts pretending to be two distinct
humans. So I lied, you could have multiple Reddit accounts, but you
could not hide that fact from Reddit.)
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to talk about here why this may be a good or a bad idea.
Only how this is done.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, if you log into two separate sites with WN, the two sites
cannot compare notes and track you from one site to the other. Unlike
with, say, logging in by e-mail address, the two sites cannot simply
compare the e-mail addresses you gave them, and say, Oh, it’s the same
Joe! Let’s show him underware ads on this site too, because he browsed
underwear on the first site. That is impossible because he two sites are
being given different identifiers. (Those seem to be public keys, so
there is a different key pair per site.) This is nice from a privacy
perspective, similar to what Kim Cameron popularized twenty years ago
with
<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">directed
identity</a>.
</p>
<p>
The site-specific key pairs are being generated from the single most
important piece of data in the system, which is your master public key,
stored on a blockchain. This public blockchain acts as a registry for
all the identities in the system, i.e. for all humans registered with WN
– but before your freak out, it’s not as bad as it sounds, because all
that the blockchain stores is a public key. There is no other
information on that blockchain or elsewhere associated with that key,
such as your name or blood type. It’s just a long basically random
number.
</p>
<p>
So: the blockchain lists all the public keys of the people whose
identity can be asserted by WN, and the technical machinery can derive
relying-party-specific keypairs from any of those so that the relying
party can be certain the user has been verified, but cannot tell which
of the public key on the block chain, or which other keys used with
other sites belong to the same user.
</p>
<p>
How does the key get onto that block chain? It appears there is a small
set of trusted actors that have the credentials to put keys onto that
blockchain, and that small set of trusted actors are the Orb stations WN
has been setting up all over the world to get people registered. The
actual keys being registered are generated on your mobile device, and
only the public key is given to the system, the private one remains on
your device only.
</p>
<p>
So the Orb only exists to make a decision whether or not a public key
you’ve created on your mobile device may or may not be added to the
registry of verified identities on that blockchain. That’s all. The key
decision the Orb (and all of its Orb siblings in other locations) need
to make is: have any of us registered that human before? If yes, do not
add their new key to the blockchain. If no, let’s add it.
</p>
<p>
To determine whether or not WN has registered you before, the Orb
(really just a fancy camera) takes a picture of your retina, figures out
its unique characterics, breaks them into a gazillion data shards (which
are entirely useless until you have brought all of them together –
modern cryptography is often counter-intuitive) and distributes them so
that it is hard to bring it back together. When somebody attempts to
register again, the new attempted registration does the same thing, but
the system rejects it (using some fancy multi-party computation
distributed over 3 universities) because the previous shards are there
already.
</p>
<p>
That’s it. (Plus a few add-on’s they have been building. Like verifying,
using your smartphone’s camera, that it is indeed you operating the
device when you are attempting to log into a site or app, so you can’t
simply hand your public key to another person who otherwise could amass
or buy thousands of other people’s identities and effectively create
thousands of accounts on the same site, all under their control. Or the
crypto currency that the relying party has to pay in order to get WN to
verify an authentication attempt – that pays the sign-up bonus from for
new users, plus for the operation of the network.)
</p>
<p>
My impression:
</p>
<p>
Lots of tech and smarts. I have not looked at the algorithms, but I can
believe that this system can be made to work more or less as described.
It has a clearly unique value proposition compared to the many other
authentication / identity systems that are found in the wild.
</p>
<p>
My major remaining questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
How does this system fail, and how would it be fixed if/when it does?
You can be 100% certain of attacks, and 100% certain of very
sophisticated attacks if they get substantial uptake. I have no good
intuition about this, and I haven’t seen any substantive discussion
about that either. (That would probably take a lot more than a two-hour
podcast.) Given that one of their stated goal is that in the longer term
no organization, including themselves, can take over the system, how
would a rapid fix for a vulnerability even work?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
And of course: will anybody adopt it? Tech history is full of failed
novel authentication systems – the above quoted Kim’s CardSpace, in
spite of being shipped with every copy of Windows, being a notable
example. And there I have my doubts. As it is famously said, whatever
your authentication or identity scheme, the first thing that a relying
party asks for when implementing any of them is your e-mail address. If
they continue to do that, the whole system would be largely pointless.
But maybe there are some niche applications where this is different, I
just haven’t seen many of them.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
P.S. I’m sure I got some details wrong. Please correct me if you know
better.

<p>
My constant struggle is how to convince them that getting an education
in the humanities is not about regurgitating ideas/knowledge that
already exist. It’s about generating new knowledge, striving for
creative insights, and having thoughts that haven’t been had before. I
don’t want you to learn facts. I want you to think. To notice. To
question. To reconsider. To challenge. Students don’t yet get that
ChatGPT only rearranges preexisting ideas, whether they are accurate or
not.
</p>
<p>
And even if the information was guaranteed to be accurate, they’re not
learning anything by plugging a prompt in and turning in the resulting
paper. They’ve bypassed the entire process of learning.

158 - INTERCAL RIDES AGAIN - Restoring a Lost Compiler</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-01, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
In 1973 the world caught it’s first glimpse of INTERCAL. It’s a wild and
wacky language, somewhere between comedy and cutting satire. But the
compiler was never circulated. There would be later implementations, but
that original compiler remained lost to time. That is, until now. This
episode covers how the original source code was found, and my attempt to
get it up and running.

<h2 id="progressive-json">Progressive JSON</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-01, updated: 2025-06-01, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://overreacted.io/progressive-json/">Progressive
JSON</a></strong>
</p>
This post by Dan Abramov is a trap! It proposes a fascinating way of
streaming JSON objects to a client in a way that provides the shape of
the JSON before the stream has completed, then fills in the gaps as more
data arrives… and then turns out to be a sneaky tutorial in how React
Server Components work.
</p>
<p>
Ignoring the sneakiness, the imaginary streaming JSON format it
describes is a fascinating thought exercise:
</p>
<pre><code>{
  header: "$1",
  post: "$2",
  footer: "$3"
}
/* $1 */
"Welcome to my blog"
/* $3 */
"Hope you like it"
/* $2 */
{
  content: "$4",
  comments: "$5"
}
/* $4 */
"This is my article"
/* $5 */
["$6", "$7", "$8"]
/* $6 */
"This is the first comment"
/* $7 */
"This is the second comment"
/* $8 */
"This is the third comment"
</code></pre>
<p>
After each block the full JSON document so far can be constructed, and
Dan suggests interleaving <code>Promise()</code> objects along the way
for placeholders that have not yet been fully resolved - so after
receipt of block <code>$3</code> above (note that the blocks can be
served out of order) the document would look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>{
  header: "Welcome to my blog",
  post: new Promise(/* ... not yet resolved ... */),
  footer: "Hope you like it"
}
</code></pre>
<p>
<p>I’m tucking this idea away in case I ever get a chance to try it out
in the future.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/json&quot;&gt;json&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/react&quot;&gt;react&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/javascript&quot;&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>
