<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps">qwen-image-mps</a></strong>
</p>
Ivan Fioravanti built this Python CLI script for running the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image">Qwen/Qwen-Image</a>
image generation model on an Apple silicon Mac, optionally using the
<a href="https://github.com/ModelTC/Qwen-Image-Lightning">Qwen-Image-Lightning</a>
LoRA to dramatically speed up generation.
</p>
<p>
Ivan has tested it this on 512GB and 128GB machines and it ran
<a href="https://x.com/ivanfioravanti/status/1954646355458269562">really
fast</a> - 42 seconds on his M3 Ultra. I’ve run it on my 64GB M2 MacBook
Pro - after quitting almost everything else - and it just about manages
to output images after pegging my GPU (fans whirring, keyboard heating
up) and occupying 60GB of my available RAM. With the LoRA option running
the script to generate an image took 9m7s on my machine.
</p>
<p>
Ivan merged
<a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps/pull/3">my
PR</a> adding inline script dependencies for
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> which means you can now
run it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps/refs/heads/main/qwen-image-mps.py \
-p 'A vintage coffee shop full of raccoons, in a neon cyberpunk city' -f
</code></pre>
<p>
The first time I ran this it downloaded the 57.7GB model from Hugging
Face and stored it in my
<code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models–Qwen–Qwen-Image</code> directory.
The <code>-f</code> option fetched an extra 1.7GB
<code>Qwen-Image-Lightning-8steps-V1.0.safetensors</code> file to my
working directory that sped up the generation.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the resulting image:
</p>
<p>
<p><img alt="Digital artwork of a cyberpunk-style coffee shop populated entirely by raccoons as customers, with illegible neon signs visible in the windows, pendant lighting over the counter, menu boards on the wall, bottles on shelves behind the bar, and raccoons sitting at tables and the counter with coffee cups" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/racoon-cyberpunk-coffee.jpg" /></p>

<strong><a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/episodes/ai-for-data-engineers-with-simon-willison">AI
for data engineers with Simon Willison</a></strong>
</p>
I recorded an episode last week with Claire Giordano for the Talking
Postgres podcast. The topic was “AI for data engineers” but we ended up
covering an enjoyable range of different topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How I got started programming with a Commodore 64 - the tape drive for
which inspired the name <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>
</li>
<li>
Selfish motivations for
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TILs</a> (force me to write up
my notes) and open source (help me never have to solve the same problem
twice)
</li>
<li>
LLMs have been good at SQL for a couple of years now. Here’s how I used
them
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/28/dashboard-alt-text/">for
a complex PostgreSQL query</a> that extracted alt text from my blog’s
images using regular expressions
</li>
<li>
Structured data extraction as the most economically valuable application
of LLMs for data work
</li>
<li>
2025 has been the year of tool calling a loop (“agentic” if you like)
</li>
<li>
Thoughts on running MCPs securely - read-only database access, think
about sandboxes, use PostgreSQL permissions, watch out for the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/lethal-trifecta/">lethal
trifecta</a>
</li>
<li>
Jargon guide: Agents, MCP, RAG, Tokens
</li>
<li>
How to get started learning to prompt: play with the models and “bring
AI to the table” even for tasks that you don’t think it can handle
</li>
<li>
“It’s always a good day if you see a pelican”
</li>

<p>date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">Chromium
Docs: The Rule Of 2</a></strong>
</p>
Alex Russell
<a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/114999510361121718">pointed
me</a> to this principle in the Chromium security documentation as
similar to my description of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/">the lethal
trifecta</a>. First added
<a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/aef94dd0e444605a16be26cba96aa477bc7fc3f5">in
2019</a>, the Chromium guideline states:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When you write code to parse, evaluate, or otherwise handle
untrustworthy inputs from the Internet — which is almost everything we
do in a web browser! — we like to follow a simple rule to make sure it’s
safe enough to do so. The Rule Of 2 is: Pick no more than 2 of
</p>
<ul>
<li>
untrustworthy inputs;
</li>
<li>
unsafe implementation language; and
</li>
<li>
high privilege.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img alt="Venn diagram showing you should always use
a safe language, a sandbox, or not be processing untrustworthy inputs in the first
place." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rule-of-2.png" />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Chromium uses this design pattern to help try to avoid the high severity
memory safety bugs that come when untrustworthy inputs are handled by
code running at high privilege.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Chrome Security Team will generally not approve landing a CL or new
feature that involves all 3 of untrustworthy inputs, unsafe language,
and high privilege. To solve this problem, you need to get rid of at
least 1 of those 3 things.

id="qwen3-4b-thinking-this-is-art---pelicans-dont-ride-bikes">Qwen3-4B-Thinking:
“This is art - pelicans don’t ride bikes!”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, updated: 2025-08-10, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
I’ve fallen a few days behind keeping up with Qwen. They released two
new 4B models last week:
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507">Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</a>
and its thinking equivalent
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507">Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507</a>.
</p>
<p>
These are relatively tiny models that punch <em>way</em> above their
weight. I’ve been running the 8bit GGUF varieties via LM Studio (here’s
<a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF">Instruct</a>,
here’s
<a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507-GGUF">Thinking</a>)
- both of them are 4GB downloads that use around 4.3GB of my M2 MacBook
Pro’s system RAM while running. Both are way more capable than I would
expect from such small files.
</p>
<p>
Qwen3-4B-Thinking is the first model I’ve tried which called out the
absurdity of being asked to draw
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">a
pelican riding a bicycle</a>!
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd41769de4791b98ba43a17c6ff32ee1">the
full transcript</a> - some highlights from the thinking trace:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Okay, the user asked for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle. That’s…
oddly specific and completely unrealistic.
</p>
<p>
First reaction: Pelicans don’t ride bicycles. They’re birds that fly or
swim, not human-like vehicles. This feels like a mix-up - maybe they
meant “a cyclist” but typed “pelican”? Or perhaps it’s a joke?
</p>
<p>
Hmm, user might be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A kid playing with words (pelican + bicycle = silly combo)
</li>
<li>
Someone testing if I’ll generate impossible images
</li>
<li>
Actually wanting a pelican <em>on</em> a bike for art project? But that
still doesn’t make sense biologically
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Checks SVG capabilities</em> SVG is for vector graphics, but this
request violates physics and biology. If I tried to draw it literally:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Pelican would be too big for a bike frame
</li>
<li>
Bike wheels would be tiny compared to bird wings
</li>
<li>
No realistic way to show “riding” since pelicans don’t have legs for
pedaling
</li>
</ul>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
<em>Self-check</em>: Am I being too pedantic? Nah - if someone asks for
impossible things, it’s better to gently correct than make fake art that
could confuse them. […]
</p>
<p>
I appreciate your creative request! 🦅🚴‍♂️ However, <strong>pelicans don’t
ride bicycles</strong> (they’re birds that fly/swim, not humans with
bike skills). Generating this as a literal SVG would be biologically
impossible and visually confusing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“This request violates physics and biology” - Qwen3-4B-Thinking saying
what no other model ever thought to express.
</p>
<p>
I also really enjoyed the “Am I being too pedantic? Nah” line. This
model is sassy!
</p>
<p>
It continued on to spit out two SVGS: the first titled “Most Likely: A
Human Cyclist” and the second “Artistic Interpretation: Pelican
<em>On</em> a Bicycle (For Fun!)”.
</p>
<p>
They were both terrible. Here’s the human one:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-thinking-human.png" alt="It's a green horizontal line, three abstract black shapes, a brown circle and the word Person" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the supposed pelican:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-thinking-pelican.png" alt="A blue circle, with a small black shape that might be a wing and a black shape that could maybe be the head? It's awful. Red text overlaps it that says This is art - pelicans don't ride bikes! - there is no attempt at a bicycle." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
I like Qwen’s decision to include the clarifying annotation “This is art
- pelicans don’t ride bikes!”:
</p>
<p>
I tried the Qwen3-4B-Instruct non-thinking model too. It
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ad927a3849d0aece043afc97559be4bf">answered
much faster</a> (no time spent questioning my choice of task with its
thinking tokens) and gave me this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-instruct-2507-pelican.png" alt="A bunch of shaps. Pelican Riding a Bike! transposed on top. The yellow and orange bits might be a pelican I guess. The bicycle has two wheels overlapping too close and a single bar in the wrong direction." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
4B is such an interesting model size. These models should run on almost
anything and, at least on my M2 MacBook, they run <em>fast</em>. I’m
getting 50+ tokens per second and they’re using just less than 4.5GB of
RAM while running.
</p>
<p>
The question is always how useful such a tiny model can be. Clearly it’s
not great for SVG pelican illustrations!
</p>
<p>
I did get a useful result out of the <code>-Thinking</code> variant for
a <code>jq</code> expression I needed. I prompted:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
queries[0].rows is an array of objects each with a markdown key - write
a jq bash one liner to output a raw string if that markdown concatenated
together with double newlines between each
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It thought
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3f76749aa710f4a2d6405ebcf5b00ac4">for
3 minutes 13 seconds</a> before spitting out a recipe that did roughly
what I wanted:
</p>
<pre><code>jq -r '.queries[0].rows[] | .markdown' | tr '\n' '\n\n'</code></pre>
<p>
I’m not sure that was worth waiting three minutes for though!
</p>
<p>
These models have a 262,144 token context - wildly impressive, <em>if it
works</em>.
</p>
<p>
So I tried another experiment: I used the Instruct model to summarize
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44851557">this Hacker News
conversation about GPT-5</a>.
</p>
<p>
I did this with the
<a href="https://github.com/agustif/llm-lmstudio">llm-lmstudio</a>
plugin for LLM combined with my
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes">hn-summary.sh
script</a>, which meant I could run the experiment like this:
</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 44851557 -m qwen3-4b-instruct-2507
</code></pre>
<p>
I believe this is 15,785 tokens - so nothing close to the 262,144
maximum but still an interesting test of a 4GB local model.
</p>
<p>
The good news is Qwen spat out a genuinely useful summary of the
conversation! You can
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4c5a1912f73e0d68b456b18000a76f0d#response">read
that here</a> - it’s the best I’ve seen yet from a model running on my
laptop, though honestly I’ve not tried many other recent models in this
way.
</p>
<p>
The bad news… it took almost five minutes to process and return the
result!
</p>
<p>
As a loose calculation, if the model can output 50 tokens/second maybe
there’s a similar speed for processing incoming input.. in which case
15785 / 50 = 315 seconds which is 5m15s.
</p>
<p>
Hosted models can crunch through 15,000 tokens of input in just a few
seconds. I guess this is one of the more material limitations of running
models on Apple silicon as opposed to dedicated GPUs.
</p>
<p>
I think I’m going to spend some more time with these models. They’re
fun, they have personality and I’m confident there are classes of useful
problems they will prove capable at despite their small size. Their
ability at summarization should make them a good fit for local RAG, and
I’ve not started exploring their tool calling abilities yet.
