<h2 id="glm-4.5-reasoning-coding-and-agentic-abililties">GLM-4.5:
Reasoning, Coding, and Agentic Abililties</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5">GLM-4.5: Reasoning, Coding,
and Agentic Abililties</a></strong>
</p>
Another day, another significant new open weight model release from a
Chinese frontier AI lab.
</p>
<p>
This time it‚Äôs Z.ai - who rebranded (at least in English) from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhipu_AI">Zhipu AI</a> a few
months ago. They just dropped
<a href="https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.5-Base">GLM-4.5-Base</a>,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.5">GLM-4.5</a> and
<a href="https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.5-Air">GLM-4.5 Air</a> on
Hugging Face, all under an MIT license.
</p>
<p>
These are MoE hybrid reasoning models with thinking and non-thinking
modes, similar to Qwen 3. GLM-4.5 is 355 billion total parameters with
32 billion active, GLM-4.5-Air is 106 billion total parameters and 12
billion active.
</p>
<p>
They started using MIT a few months ago for their
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/zai-org/glm-4-0414-67f3cbcb34dd9d252707cb2e">GLM-4-0414</a>
models - their older releases used a janky non-open-source custom
license.
</p>
<p>
Z.ai‚Äôs own benchmarking (across 12 common benchmarks) ranked their
GLM-4.5 3rd behind o3 and Grok-4 and just ahead of Claude Opus 4. They
ranked GLM-4.5 Air 6th place just ahead of Claude 4 Sonnet. I haven‚Äôt
seen any independent benchmarks yet.
</p>
<p>
The other models they included in their own benchmarks were o4-mini
(high), Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-235B-Thinking-2507, DeepSeek-R1-0528, Kimi
K2, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-V3-0324. Notably absent: any of Meta‚Äôs Llama
models, or any of Mistral‚Äôs. Did they deliberately only compare
themselves to open weight models from other Chinese AI labs?
</p>
<p>
Both models have a 128,000 context length and are trained for tool
calling, which honestly feels like table stakes for any model released
in 2025 at this point.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs interesting to see them use Claude Code to run their own coding
benchmarks:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To assess GLM-4.5‚Äôs agentic coding capabilities, we utilized Claude Code
to evaluate performance against Claude-4-Sonnet, Kimi K2, and
Qwen3-Coder across 52 coding tasks spanning frontend development, tool
development, data analysis, testing, and algorithm implementation. [‚Ä¶]
The empirical results demonstrate that GLM-4.5 achieves a 53.9% win rate
against Kimi K2 and exhibits dominant performance over Qwen3-Coder with
an 80.8% success rate. While GLM-4.5 shows competitive performance,
further optimization opportunities remain when compared to
Claude-4-Sonnet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They published the dataset for that benchmark as
<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zai-org/CC-Bench-trajectories">zai-org/CC-Bench-trajectories</a>
on Hugging Face. I think they‚Äôre using the word ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù for what I
would call a chat transcript.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unlike DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi K2, we reduce the width (hidden dimension
and number of routed experts) of the model while increasing the height
(number of layers), as we found that deeper models exhibit better
reasoning capacity.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They pre-trained on 15 trillion tokens, then an additional 7 trillion
for code and reasoning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our base model undergoes several training stages. During pre-training,
the model is first trained on 15T tokens of a general pre-training
corpus, followed by 7T tokens of a code &amp; reasoning corpus. After
pre-training, we introduce additional stages to further enhance the
model‚Äôs performance on key downstream domains.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They also open sourced their post-training reinforcement learning
harness, which they‚Äôve called <strong>slime</strong>. That‚Äôs available
at <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/slime">THUDM/slime</a> on GitHub -
THUDM is the Knowledge Engineer Group @ Tsinghua University, the
University from which Zhipu AI spun out as an independent company.
</p>
<p>
This time I ran my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">pelican
bechmark</a> using the <a href="https://chat.z.ai/">chat.z.ai</a> chat
interface, which offers free access (no account required) to both GLM
4.5 and GLM 4.5 Air. I had reasoning enabled for both.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what I got for ‚ÄúGenerate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle‚Äù on
<a href="https://chat.z.ai/s/014a8c13-7b73-40e8-bbf9-6a94482caa2e">GLM
4.5</a>. I like how the pelican has its wings on the handlebars:

The bird has an orange beak and is positioned on the bike seat, with its orange webbed feet gripping what appears to be chopsticks or utensils near the handlebars. The bicycle has a simple red frame with two wheels, and there are motion lines behind it suggesting movement. The background is a soft blue-gray color, giving the image a clean, minimalist cartoon style. The overall design has a playful, humorous quality to it." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/glm-4.5-pelican.jpg" />

<img alt="Description by Claude Sonnet 4: This image shows a cute, minimalist illustration of a snowman riding a bicycle. The snowman has a simple design with a round white body, small black dot for an eye, and an orange rectangular nose (likely representing a carrot). The snowman appears to be in motion on a black bicycle with two wheels, with small orange arrows near the pedals suggesting movement. There are curved lines on either side of the image indicating motion or wind. The overall style is clean and whimsical, using a limited color palette of white, black, orange, and gray against a light background." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/glm-4.5-air-pelican.jpg" />

quantized model running on a M4 Mac with 128GB of RAM, and it looks like
a very strong contender for a local model that can write useful code.
The cheapest 128GB Mac Studio costs around $3,500 right now, so
genuinely great open weight coding models are creeping closer to being
affordable on consumer machines.</p>

<h2 id="the-many-many-many-javascript-runtimes-of-the-last-decade-1">The
many, many, many JavaScript runtimes of the last decade</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-27, from: Whatever, Jamie blog (Jamie Birch)</p>
<p>
<center>
<img alt="Jamie jogging on a sports track, wearing a JavaScript vest" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a502daab-842f-4157-a1e5-13a129fd67e0.JPG?w=960&amp;fit=max" width="400"/>

</p>
<p>
This last decade has seen an inundation of new JavaScript runtimes (and
engines in equal measure), enabling us to run JavaScript in all manner
of contexts with precise fitness for task. Through these, we‚Äôve seen the
language spread to the Cloud, the edge, Smart TVs, mobile devices, and
even microcontrollers.
</p>
<p>
In this article, we‚Äôll explore what‚Äôs driving this diversity, and why no
one runtime or engine suffices for all purposes.
</p>
<h1>
Edge computing
</h1>
<p>
The first consumer ‚Äúedge computing‚Äù solution was introduced in 2002 by
Akamai, who enabled building on the edge using
<a href="https://www.akamai.com/blog/news/20-years-of-edge-computing" target="_blank">Java
and .NET</a>. But it would be a long time before JavaScript would join
those languages ‚Äì for one thing, JavaScript wouldn‚Äôt be useful as a
server-side language until Node.js emerged in 2009, and for another,
Node.js wouldn‚Äôt be employed in a serverless context until AWS Lambda in
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/run-code-cloud/" target="_blank">2014</a>.
It was only with the announcement of Lambda@Edge (in preview from
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-lambda-at-the-edge/" target="_blank">December
2016</a>; released
<a href="https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/aws_history_and_timeline_amazon_lambda.html" target="_blank">March
2017</a>) that JavaScript would finally be seen on the edge, again
running on Node.js.
</p>
<p>
But Amazon‚Äôs monopoly was to be short-lived. For just six months later
came the
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers" target="_blank">release</a>
of Cloudflare Workers, a purpose-built minimal runtime revolving around
the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" target="_blank">Service
Worker</a> API. It was devised to open an
‚Äú<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477333/000119312519222176/d735023ds1.htm#:~:text=This%20opens%20up%20an%20entirely%20new%20market%20for%20us%3A%20compute%20and%20storage." target="_blank">entirely
new market</a>‚Äù to Cloudflare: compute and storage. And this was notably
different to Amazon‚Äôs venture ‚Äì for the first time in the over twenty
years since JavaScript‚Äôs inception, a company had managed to directly
productise a JavaScript runtime.
</p>
<p>
Cloudflare Workers was a phenomenal success, with
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/press-releases/2018/cloudflare-workers-opens-edge-computing-to-everyone/" target="_blank">billions
of tasks</a> run in the half year following its beta release. This scent
of opportunity triggered a gold rush. Deno
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA" target="_blank">appeared</a>
shortly after in 2018 as a challenger to Node.js, and within three
years,
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/the-deno-company" target="_blank">Deno
Land Inc</a> had formed, launching
<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3622914/deno-company-unveils-server-side-javascript-hosting-service.html" target="_blank">Deno
Deploy</a>, an edge network intended to
<a href="https://tinyclouds.org/javascript_containers" target="_blank">chase
after</a> Cloudflare. With an initial treasure chest of
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/the-deno-company" target="_blank">$4.9
million</a> and raising a
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/series-a" target="_blank">$21 million</a>
Series A funding round the year after that, it is clear that Cloudflare
weren‚Äôt the only ones who believed in the value of the niche.
</p>
<p>
The rush continued in 2022. No sooner had
<a href="https://wintercg.org" target="_blank">WinterCG</a> been
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/announcing-wintercg" target="_blank">formed</a>
to start defining a common ground for all these new JavaScript runtimes
popping up than <a href="https://bun.sh" target="_blank">Bun</a>
appeared, quickly raising
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/wwd11n/oven_the_company_behind_bun_gets_7m/" target="_blank">$7
million</a> <sup>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220824190839/https://oven.sh/" target="_blank">[archive]</a>
</sup> to
<a href="https://imgur.com/Zn5uMON" target="_blank">provide</a>
serverless hosting, continuous integration, and‚Ä¶ edge computing. Wasmer
followed suit in 2023, stepping into the Service Workers arena with
<a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-winterjs-service-workers" target="_blank">WinterJS</a>
and
<a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wasmer-edge" target="_blank">Wasmer
Edge</a>. And not to be outdone, the very next year AWS responded with
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39304188" target="_blank">LLRT</a>,
another low-latency runtime just right for the edge (though not yet
having an edge worker offering).
</p>
<p>
For all the overlap in strategy, notable is the variety in engines
underpinning all these runtimes. While Deno and CloudFlare Workers
(which run on the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/tree/main" target="_blank">workerd</a>
runtime) continue Node.js‚Äôs tradition of using
<a href="https://v8.dev" target="_blank">V8</a>, we see Bun employing
<a href="https://docs.webkit.org/Deep%20Dive/JSC/JavaScriptCore.html" target="_blank">JavaScriptCore</a>,
WinterJS using
<a href="https://spidermonkey.dev" target="_blank">SpiderMonkey</a>, and
LLRT on
<a href="https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs" target="_blank">QuickJS</a>.
No longer is the backend solely a stage for Node.js and V8 ‚Äì it‚Äôs now
fashionable to pick a runtime and engine optimised for the task.
</p>
<h1>
Microcontrollers
</h1>
<p>
Many of the above runtimes would have a hard time running on a
microcontroller, though. For the unfamiliar, AWS defines them
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-microprocessors-microcontrollers/" target="_blank">as
follows</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
‚Ä¶ a microcontroller is the basic computing unit inside smart electronic
devices like washing machines and thermostats. It‚Äôs a very tiny computer
with its own RAM, ROM, and I/O systems, all embedded on a single chip.
It can process digital signals and respond to user input, but its
computing capacity is limited.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At the low end, microcontrollers may cost as little as
<a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/the-terrible-3-cent-mcu/" target="_blank">3
cents</a>, have mere bytes of RAM, run in under a milliamp of current,
have an 8-bit architecture, and/or have under a kilobyte of storage.
</p>
<p>
Given these specs, full-blown Node.js would be well out of the question,
so many took to producing slim-as-possible engines ‚Äì
<a href="https://duktape.org" target="_blank">Duktape</a>,
<a href="https://www.espruino.com" target="_blank">Espruino</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/cesanta/mjs" target="_blank">mjs</a> in
2013, <a href="https://jerryscript.net" target="_blank">JerryScript</a>
in 2014,
<a href="https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable" target="_blank">Moddable</a>
in 2018, and
<a href="https://github.com/cesanta/elk" target="_blank">elk</a> in
2021. These projects pride themselves in running on under 64 kB of RAM
(in fact apparently little more than 100 bytes, in the case of Elk!),
though do make tradeoffs in other areas like
<a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/bench.html" target="_blank">performance</a>
to do so.
</p>
<p>
These engines then spawned new runtimes, though not necessarily serving
the very lowest end of microcontrollers. JerryScript underlies
<a href="https://github.com/jerryscript-project/iotjs" target="_blank">IoT.js</a>
(2015) and
<a href="https://github.com/iamblue/microlattice" target="_blank">Microlattice.js</a>
(2016), both Internet of Things runtimes;
<a href="https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/tree/public/xs" target="_blank">XS</a>
(2018?) underlies Moddable; and DukTape underlies
<a href="https://github.com/neonious/lowjs" target="_blank">low.js</a>
(2018), a low-resource reimplementation of Node.js.
</p>
<p>
It goes to show that venture capital needn‚Äôt be a lure to develop a
JavaScript runtime; sometimes people just want to run JavaScript on a
device no matter what. Sometimes, they want to call JavaScript even when
working in a different language ‚Äì which brings us onto our next topic.
</p>
<h1>
Polyglot engines
</h1>
<p>
Although most JavaScript engines are based on a bespoke virtual machine
(VM) used only by the engines themselves, some are based on established
VMs, enabling zero-cost interop with other languages. In this space, C++
isn‚Äôt necessarily king, and it‚Äôs interesting to see how many ways there
are to write a JavaScript engine.
</p>
<p>
The earliest polyglot engine was
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rhino" target="_blank">Rhino</a>,
which was made in 1997 as an effort to write Netscape Navigator ‚Äì
JavaScript engine and all ‚Äì fully in Java. Rhino supports two-way
interop between Java and JavaScript, based on the JVM. That is to say,
it allows JavaScript to implement Java interfaces and call Java class
methods, while allowing Java to define JavaScript classes, run scripts,
and more. By 2006, it was included in JDK 6, and by 2008, it was the
basis of the Helma runtime, nowadays known as
<a href="https://github.com/ringo/ringojs" target="_blank">RingoJS</a>.
</p>
<p>
It was, however,
<a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/oracle-graalvm-announces-support-for-nashorn-migration-c04810d75c1f" target="_blank">superseded</a>
in JDK 8 (2014) by
<a href="https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn" target="_blank">Nashorn</a>,
itself superseded in JDK 11 by
<a href="https://github.com/oracle/graaljs" target="_blank">Graal.js</a>
(2018) which supports both
<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/js/RunOnJDK/" target="_blank">the
JVM and GraalVM</a>. This is an interesting line of history, as ‚Äì all
being Mozilla or Oracle projects ‚Äì these three may be the only
JavaScript runtimes rightfully allowed to use the JavaScript trademark
(pending
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle3" target="_blank">Deno
vs.¬†Oracle</a>). Graal.js well deserves its seat on top however, going
as far as supporting the whole Node.js SDK, by virtue of
<a href="https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/tree/master/graal-nodejs" target="_blank">embedding
its entire codebase</a>.
</p>
<p>
This lineage is just the tip of the iceberg, though. There‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/sebastienros/jint" target="_blank">jint</a>
(2013), for .NET, written in C#. There‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/jtolio/pynarcissus" target="_blank">PyNarcissus</a>
(2009),
<a href="https://github.com/progval/rpython-langjs" target="_blank">langjs</a>
(2009), and
<a href="https://github.com/polydojo/jispy" target="_blank">jispy</a>
(2014), for Python. There‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/haileys/twostroke" target="_blank">twostroke</a>
(2011) and
<a href="https://github.com/opal/opal" target="_blank">Opal</a> (2013),
for Ruby. There‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/elsaland/elsa" target="_blank">elsa</a>
(2020) for Go. There‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa" target="_blank">Boa</a> (2018),
<a href="https://github.com/DelSkayn/toyjs" target="_blank">toyjs</a>
(2020),
<a href="https://github.com/DelSkayn/rquickjs" target="_blank">rquickjs</a>
(2020),
<a href="https://github.com/Redfire75369/spiderfire" target="_blank">spiderfire</a>
(2021),
<a href="https://github.com/trynova/nova" target="_blank">Nova</a>
(2022), and
<a href="https://github.com/drogus/jaws" target="_blank">jaws</a> (2024)
for Rust. There‚Äôs
<a href="https://codeberg.org/kiesel-js/kiesel" target="_blank">Kiesel</a>
(2023) for Zig, and the list surely goes on. Though arguably not all of
these projects are fully ‚Äúpolyglot‚Äù ‚Äì some are merely interpreters and
don‚Äôt offer two-way language interop.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript engines are even being implemented in <em>JavaScript</em>!
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/narcissus" target="_blank">Narcissus</a>
(2007-2010), originally created by Brendan Eich, was used by Mozilla as
a test-bed for rapidly prototyping new JavaScript language features.
<a href="https://github.com/tmikov/jscomp" target="_blank">Jscomp</a>
followed in 2015, an AoT compiler written in JavaScript that generated
C++ executable code. More recently,
<a href="https://github.com/CanadaHonk" target="_blank">Oliver
Medhurst</a> has carried on the torch with
<a href="https://github.com/CanadaHonk/porffor" target="_blank">Porffor</a>
(2023), compiling instead to WASM (or, as an extra step, C). It follows
on from their equally notable web engine,
<a href="https://github.com/CanadaHonk/shadow" target="_blank">Shadow</a>
(2023), similarly written in JavaScript. While starting out as a hobby
project, Porffor has shown such worth as to attract financial support
from Chris Wanstrath, enabling Oliver to work
<a href="https://goose.icu/porffor/" target="_blank">full-time</a> on it
as of 2024, leading to a
<a href="https://x.com/CanadaHonk/status/1901847489621213338" target="_blank">58%
conformance</a> score on Test262 less than a year later.
</p>
<p>
This demand to call JavaScript from other languages and even build new
JavaScript engines in it underlines the strength of its ecosystem and
the ergonomics of the language. Though nowhere is this ecosystem
advantage as clear as it is in the world of native apps.
</p>
<h1>
Native apps
</h1>
<p>
JavaScript‚Äôs web origins make it a language well suited for building GUI
apps, and so it was only a matter of time before it began being employed
in native apps, often as a basis for cross-platform frameworks. A point
of constant contention in this space is what balance to strike between
fidelity to the web platform and fidelity to the native platform, so
where better to start than the frameworks that went all in on the web?
</p>
<h2>
Web view based apps
</h2>
<h3>
On mobile
</h3>
<p>
The iPhone‚Äôs release in 2007 set a new bar for mobile hardware,
normalising the use of desktop-grade web tech on mobile. But with iOS,
Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, WebOS, Symbian, Samsung Bada, and
Firefox OS all vying for market share at once, developing for just one
platform posed a significant opportunity cost. In 2009, Adobe answered
this quandry by releasing PhoneGap, a framework for embedding web apps
into native apps via a ‚Äúweb view‚Äù (which of course included a JavaScript
runtime).
</p>
<p>
PhoneGap proved popular, with over 23,000 apps having been built on
their build service (according to a contradictory chart)
<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/phone-gap-stats-growth/8729016#8" target="_blank">by
2011</a>, and having been ‚Äúdownloaded over 1 million times‚Äù and ‚Äúused by
over 400,000 developers‚Äù
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121223030104/http://phonegap.com/about/" target="_blank">by
2012</a>. Along the way, it was opensourced as
<a href="https://cordova.apache.org" target="_blank">Cordova</a>, and a
UI toolkit was created for it, Ionic. The team behind Ionic would go on
in 2019 to
<a href="https://ionic.io/blog/announcing-capacitor-1-0" target="_blank">announce</a>
their successor for Cordova,
<a href="https://capacitorjs.com" target="_blank">Capacitor</a>, which
brought an improved native plugins API and added support for targeting
desktop via another up-and-coming framework, Electron.
</p>
<h3>
On desktop
</h3>
<p>
Electron, now a household name for web view-based desktop app
development, traces its roots back to
<a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js" target="_blank">node-webkit</a>,
a project with releases dating as far back as
<a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/blob/f652bbc398ed8b8e99953c8a7446df275f9c99c7/src/version.h" target="_blank">2012</a>.
While the latter was originally based on Node.js and WebKit, it was
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8887706" target="_blank">renamed
to NW.js in 2015</a> due to plans to migrate to Chromium (an effort
which was completed with
<a href="https://nwjs.io/blog/v0.13.0/" target="_blank">v0.13.0</a> in
2016). Electron‚Äôs history runs alongside this ‚Äì in 2013, GitHub began
work on
<a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/a915cf2e81a44603bfdd4121458a001db9b2c0e2" target="_blank">Atom
Shell</a>, an NW.js-like framework built by a former NW.js core
contributor to use as the foundation for their
<a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/5cb6aa053834ff0b1d1b9c9aeabae30fe15dd75f" target="_blank">Atom</a>
text editor. While Atom itself would one day be sunset, Atom Shell would
live on, being
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171109205411/http://electronjs.org/blog/electron" target="_blank">renamed
to Electron</a> in 2015. Although NW.js is an active project to this
day, Electron has very much taken the limelight, coming to dominate the
market for desktop apps, with many of the industry-leading apps like
Discord, Slack, Linear, and Visual Studio Code all being based on it.

<h3>
On Smart TVs
</h3>
<p>
Beyond mobile and desktop, there‚Äôs also the esoteric Smart TV platform.
Many Smart TVs run forks of desktop web browsers, with additional APIs
for interacting with native TV functionality such as the broadcast
stream,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_object_carousel" target="_blank">object
carousel</a>, remote control keysets, and DRM systems.
</p>
<p>
Web-based Smart TV specifications/platforms include
<a href="https://www.oipf.tv/web-spec/volume5.html" target="_blank">OIPF</a>
(2008-2015),
<a href="https://www.hbbtv.org/resource-library/specifications/" target="_blank">HbbTV</a>
(2010 to present), and
<a href="https://www.atsc.org/nextgen-tv/resources/" target="_blank">ATSC
3.0</a> (2016 to present). There are also endless platforms with
different SDKs, such as
<a href="https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/references" target="_blank">webOS</a>,
<a href="https://www.youview.com/open-source" target="_blank">YouView</a>,
<a href="https://www.freeview.co.uk/freeview-play" target="_blank">Freeview
Play</a>,
<a href="https://www.freesat.co.uk/why-freesat" target="_blank">Freesat</a>,
and more. On some platforms, one negotiates with an infrastructure
provider to serve an app over broadcast; on other platforms, one
negotiates with the platform owner to have the app distributed with the
devices; and on others (e.g.¬†platforms based on Android TV and Apple
TV), one submits the app to an app store.
</p>
<p>
The popular Amazon Fire TV (2014) and Fire TV Stick (2014) are based on
<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/build-and-test-your-hybrid-app.html" target="_blank">Chromium</a>,
as Samsung Tizen TVs have been
<a href="https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/specifications/web-engine-specifications.html" target="_blank">since
2017</a> (using WebKit before that), and all three of these employ
Cordova, showing it‚Äôs not purely for mobile devices. Roku is different,
with apps being programmed in
<a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/language/brightscript-language-reference.md" target="_blank">BrightScript</a>
(not an ECMAScript language). And while Apple TV used to offer a
framework known as
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/tvmljs" target="_blank">TVMLKit
JS</a> (2015), based on JavaScriptCore, it was not based on web
technologies, beyond implementing a very small amount of the DOM spec.
</p>
<p>
With more than
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210813024801/https://www.strategyanalytics.com/access-services/devices/connected-home/consumer-electronics/reports/report-detail/global-connected-tv-device-vendor-market-share-q4-2019" target="_blank">1.26
billion</a> internet-connected TV devices installed worldwide and HbbTV
devices present in over
<a href="https://www.hbbtv.org/news-events/major-milestone-hbbtv-reaches-100-million-homes-in-europe/" target="_blank">100
million homes in Europe</a> alone, Smart TVs account for a surprisingly
large segment of JavaScript runtimes. Only through this common language
and the ubiquitous web platform is it practical to deploy apps to the
sheer number of different device types in this market.
</p>
<h2>
React Native
</h2>
<h3>
On mobile
</h3>
<p>
As the mobile landscape began to settle down to a landscape dominated
mostly by iOS and Android, Facebook announced a new cross-platform
framework in
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/03/26/android/react-native-bringing-modern-web-techniques-to-mobile/" target="_blank">2015</a>
targeting the both of them: React Native. The framework enabled
developers to write a React app that would render native platform views,
based on a JavaScript runtime that could call out to native
functionality and respond to native events via posting serialisable
messages across a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Initially, this JavaScript runtime was based on JavaScriptCore, as it
came included in the iOS SDK (and had done since iOS 7 in 2013) and so
saved significant app size for iOS users. Being also heavily optimised
for mobile usage, it was the smart choice at the time. However, after a
few years of seeing how it performed in practice, Facebook would seek to
improve upon it ‚Äì and so in 2019, they
<a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/07/17/hermes" target="_blank">announced</a>
Hermes, a new engine tailor-made for React Native.
</p>
<p>
Hermes boasted improved startup times thanks to various tricks such as
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2019/07/12/android/hermes/" target="_blank">Ahead
of Time (AoT) compilation</a> (working around Apple‚Äôs ban on JIT) and
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/hermes/issues/907#issuecomment-1411144097" target="_blank">memory
mapping</a> of its bytecode into RAM. It also cut down on bundle size
for Android (where JavaScriptCore is not a system framework) and memory
utilisation for both platforms. Hermes delivered so well on its promises
that it was made the
<a href="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2022/07/08/hermes-as-the-default" target="_blank">default</a>
from 2022, and Meta are even preparing a successor,
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tmikov2023/static-hermes-react-native-eu-2023-announcement" target="_blank">Static
Hermes</a> (2023), which will support an arbitrary mix of native and
interpreted code, both ‚Äútyped‚Äù and ‚Äúuntyped‚Äù, to afford performance on a
par with C/C++.
</p>
<p>
Hermes wasn‚Äôt the only option explored, however. From 2018, React Native
began to implement an engine-agnostic
<a href="https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page#fast-javascriptnative-interfacing" target="_blank">JavaScript
Interface (JSI)</a>, which (besides eschewing message-posting in favour
of direct native bindings) has enabled it to be adapted for use with
various engines. JSI has been implemented for
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/hermes/tree/main/API/jsi/jsi" target="_blank">Hermes</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/ReactCommon/jsc/JSCRuntime.cpp" target="_blank">JSC</a>
(both by Meta), V8 (independently by
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/v8-jsi" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/Kudo/react-native-v8" target="_blank">Expo</a>;
see Kudo Chien‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e0b2O6NRz4" target="_blank">talk</a>
on the latter),
<a href="https://github.com/tudorms/QuickJSI" target="_blank">QuickJS</a>
(by Microsoft, for a hackathon),
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/tree/261dda2ee168fd83c0c5960bfcd24777bdf5c2b8/vnext/Chakra" target="_blank">Chakra</a>
(by Microsoft, for use in React Native Windows, as Chakra is included
with Windows), and even
<a href="https://github.com/semmypurewal/duktape-jsi" target="_blank">Duktape</a>
(by Semmy Purewal)!
</p>
<p>
In fact, React Native looks set to become the most engine-agnostic
JavaScript runtime around, as Microsoft, Callstack, and the React Native
community (myself included!) are currently working hard on delivering
<a href="https://www.callstack.com/blog/announcing-node-api-support-for-react-native" target="_blank">support
for Node-API</a>, which is supported even more widely than JSI (more on
that later). Considering also the first-class native code interop
promised to come with Static Hermes, it‚Äôs come a long way since its
roots as a single-engine, message-posting runtime.
</p>
<p>
But, how popular is it compared to web view-based app development
frameworks? Evan Bacon reported that by 2023,
<a href="https://x.com/Baconbrix/status/1711960805942444478" target="_blank">only
74 of the top 2,479 iOS apps</a> used either Cordova or Capacitor, and
in fact most still used only the former. Whereas, by 2025,
<a href="https://x.com/Baconbrix/status/1888633966938276267" target="_blank">30
of the top 100 iOS apps</a> were written in React Native, compared to
only 3 web view-centric apps. RevenueCat (the leading In-App Purchases
solution, used by
<a href="https://www.revenuecat.com" target="_blank">over 50,000
apps</a>), reports that React Native is ‚Äúon track‚Äù to becoming the most
popular app development framework using their platform, with
<a href="https://x.com/jeiting/status/1930625117802873109" target="_blank">34%</a>
of RevenueCat-using apps being based on it, and fewer than 1% to be
accounted for by frameworks such as Cordova.
</p>
<h3>
On desktop
</h3>
<p>
It‚Äôs a rather different story for desktop platforms, however. While
Microsoft maintains fully-featured implementations of React Native for
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/" target="_blank">macOS
and Windows</a> (independent from
<a href="https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos" target="_blank">ptmt</a>‚Äôs
macOS implementation in 2015), the ecosystem for these platforms is a
small fraction of what it is for iOS and Android, with just
<a href="https://reactnative.directory/?windows=true&amp;macos=true" target="_blank">20</a>
native modules in React Native Directory indicating support for desktop
in contrast to
<a href="https://reactnative.directory/?ios=true&amp;android=true" target="_blank">1,698</a>
for mobile at the time of writing. This is reflected in the smaller
usership, with only
<a href="https://results.2024.stateofreactnative.com/en-US/developer-background/#developer_background_target_platforms" target="_blank">around
100 correspondents</a> in the State of React Native 2024 survey
targeting desktop, in contrast to over 3,000 targeting mobile.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup" target="_blank">recommended</a>
meta-framework for using React Native, Expo, still lacks support for
desktop, and while Microsoft has employed React Native in
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/resources-showcase" target="_blank">various</a>
Office apps and even the
<a href="https://x.com/alxfazio/status/1926731799226462646" target="_blank">Start
Menu</a>, it is mainly as a brownfield solution, making small
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/2025-05-09-office-modernize/" target="_blank">content
islands</a> within the apps. For greenfield apps, Electron is very much
more the vogue, with
<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/apps" target="_blank">hundreds</a>
of apps listed on their showcase alone.
</p>
<p>
Some attempts have been made to target Linux, such as React Native Linux
(a Qt-based fork by Canonical, later renamed to
<a href="https://github.com/status-im/react-native-desktop-qt" target="_blank">React
Native Desktop</a>) (2017-2021) and
<a href="https://github.com/react-native-skia/react-native-skia" target="_blank">React
Native Skia</a> (2020), but none see mainstream usage, with the latter
used by
<a href="https://results.2024.stateofreactnative.com/en-US/developer-background/#developer_background_target_platforms" target="_blank">just
20 correspondents</a> in the aforementioned survey. Again, Electron is
presumably the bigger fish here.
</p>
<h3>
On Smart TVs
</h3>
<p>
React Native does have a significant foothold in the Smart TV space,
though, with implementations for both tvOS
(<a href="https://youtu.be/zrYiQr6CBg8?si=wB6JGlSx17JPxOF6&amp;t=271" target="_blank">2016</a>)
and Android TV
(<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/16500#issuecomment-378351727" target="_blank">2018</a>)
seeing popular usage. With the fall of
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221230183253/https://developer.youi.tv/" target="_blank">You.i
TV</a> (whose proprietary
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220814072714/https://www.youi.tv/youi-engine/" target="_blank">You.i
Engine One</a> deployed to 14 different platforms), the leaders in this
space are now
<a href="https://www.callstack.com/insights/tv-development" target="_blank">Callstack</a>,
deploying to a
<a href="https://x.com/grabbou/status/1930362533187334164" target="_blank">similarly
large</a> stable. Notable React Native apps include
<a href="https://medium.com/crunchyroll/velocity-crunchyrolls-universal-react-player-e70a61b6dfa7" target="_blank">Crunchyroll</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos/issues/15#issuecomment-988239453" target="_blank">NFL</a>,
<a href="https://expo.dev/blog/how-to-build-tv-apps" target="_blank">Bloomberg,
Yahoo Finance, and more</a>.
</p>
<h2>
NativeScript
</h2>
<p>
By no means were native apps a two-horse race between Cordova and React
Native, though.
<a href="https://nativescript.org" target="_blank">NativeScript</a>,
announced in
<a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/announcing-nativescript---cross-platform-framework-for-building-native-mobile-applications" target="_blank">2014</a>,
came out of the doors offering three separate runtimes with full
JavaScript bindings to the
<a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/ios-jsc" target="_blank">iOS</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/android" target="_blank">Android</a>,
and
<a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/windows-runtime" target="_blank">Universal
Windows</a> platforms (via JavaScriptCore, V8, and V8 again
respectively), abstracted by a cross-platform app development framework.
While the decline of Windows Phone led to the Windows runtime being
sunset in 2016, the iOS and Android runtimes continue to this day,
standardising
<a href="https://blog.nativescript.org/the-new-ios-runtime-powered-by-v8/" target="_blank">on
V8</a> in 2019 (essentially once V8 supported
<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/jitless" target="_blank">JITless mode</a>
to enable its use on the App Store). And while the proof-of-concept
<a href="https://blog.nativescript.org/running-the-nativescript-runtime-for-ios-on-apple-tv/" target="_blank">tvOS
runtime</a> demonstrated in 2015 never took off, the
<a href="https://blog.nativescript.org/nativescript-app-sample-running-on-android-wear/" target="_blank">Android
Wear</a> (2015) and
<a href="https://blog.nativescript.org/building-an-android-tv-app-with-nativescript/" target="_blank">Android
TV</a> runtimes (2018) have seen use in industry.
</p>
<p>
More recently, NativeScript has increased focus on enabling the runtimes
to be used standalone (rather than as part of an end-to-end app
development framework), rearchitecturing the runtimes as engine-agnostic
libraries of JS‚ÜîÔ∏énative bindings via
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html" target="_blank">Node-API</a>.
These new
<a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/runtime-node-api" target="_blank">iOS</a>
(2023) and
<a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/napi-android" target="_blank">Android</a>
(2024) libraries can upgrade any JavaScript engine to give it full
platform access, provided the engine supports Node-API, which is quite a
long list. Indeed, Node-API has been implemented for V8 (by
<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/77710251e10982f847d2d3dfcf5d920b0a03a539/src/node_api.cc" target="_blank">Node.js</a>,

<p>
While
<a href="https://x.com/Baconbrix/status/1888633966938276267" target="_blank">none
of the top 100 iOS apps</a> use NativeScript today, the new Node-API

such as React Native and Electron, responding to
<a href="https://x.com/Baconbrix/status/1773376900095775118" target="_blank">pain-points</a>
of native API access, much like the (pre-Node-API)

<a href="https://x.com/birch_js/status/1774855694271045666" target="_blank">Expo
integration</a> (by me!) demonstrated this in 2024, though work is
ongoing to allow it to be used without patching and forking.
</p>
<h2>
Node.js
</h2>
<p>
While the above-mentioned runtimes each form part of an end-to-end (and
usually cross-platform) app development framework, Node.js has mostly
been employed in native apps just as a tool for accessing the Node.js
SDK and/or native addons, with little success getting involved with
creating graphical user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
It wasn‚Äôt until nearly a decade after its release that Node.js was
ported to mobile ‚Äì work that was undertaken by Janea Systems
<a href="https://www.janeasystems.com/blog/announcing-node-js-mobile-apps-true-node-js-runtime-android-ios" target="_blank">in
2017</a>. One of the major obstacles to deploying on iOS was that the
App Store did not allow apps that used JIT compilation. Janea Systems
worked around this by forking
<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore" target="_blank">Node-ChakraCore</a>,
a Microsoft project that swapped out V8 for ChakraCore to run without
JIT. This was a fashion at the time, with
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/spidernode" target="_blank">SpiderNode</a>
(2017) adopting Spidermonkey,
<a href="https://github.com/mceSystems/node-jsc" target="_blank">node-jsc</a>
(2018) adopting JavaScriptCore (which led to
<a href="https://github.com/mceSystems/node-native-script" target="_blank">node-native-script</a>
the same year, demoed
<a href="https://github.com/mceSystems/NodeIOS-Demo-Project" target="_blank">here</a>),
and
<a href="https://github.com/Samsung/node-jerryscript" target="_blank">node-jerryscript</a>
(2019) adopting JerryScript.
</p>
<p>
Janea Systems were eventually able to
<a href="https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile/blob/1b0223dc74dfa359e61131ee24e0fa386c6d12aa/doc_mobile/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L146" target="_blank">adopt
V8</a> once
<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/jitless" target="_blank">JITless</a> mode
propagated from V8 in 2019 to Node.js in
<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32594" target="_blank">2020</a>.
Although they had demoed using Node.js
<a href="https://www.janeasystems.com/blog/node-js-meets-ios" target="_blank">alongside
React Native</a> as early as 2017, it never really caught on for that
use-case, and Node.js for mobile remained a smaller player in mobile app
development. It continues to see usage, however, with the baton
<a href="https://nodejs-mobile.github.io/blog/reboot/" target="_blank">passing</a>
from
<a href="https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile" target="_blank">Janea
Systems</a> to a new
<a href="https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile" target="_blank">fork</a>
by Andr√© Staltz in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Besides Janea Systems‚Äôs port, Samsung created their own
<a href="https://github.com/Samsung/lwnode" target="_blank">Lightweight
Node.js</a> (2021) based on their earlier engine
<a href="https://github.com/Samsung/escargot" target="_blank">Escargot</a>
(2016) for ‚Äúmid-range devices such as mobile phone, tablet and TV‚Äù,
which probably sees use on Tizen OS, though the project may not see much
use outside of Samsung.
</p>
<p>
On the desktop side, there have been countless libraries to expose
native app development functionality via Node.js. For macOS AppKit,
there has been
<a href="https://github.com/TooTallNate/NodObjC" target="_blank">NodObjC</a>
(2011),
<a href="https://github.com/lukaskollmer/objc" target="_blank">objc</a>
(2017), and
<a href="https://x.com/birch_js/status/1726120371278229944" target="_blank">NativeScript</a>
(2023), for example. For WinRT,
<a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT" target="_blank">NodeRT</a>
(2014) (echoed by the Deno-based
<a href="https://github.com/DjDeveloperr/deno_winrt" target="_blank">deno_winrt</a>
in 2023). And for Qt,
<a href="https://github.com/NickCis/nodeQt" target="_blank">nodeQt</a>
(2011),
<a href="https://github.com/arturadib/node-qt" target="_blank">node-qt</a>
(2012),
<a href="https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui" target="_blank">NodeGUI</a>
(2019). Despite affording full platform access, though, none of these
have taken off as end-to-end app development solutions competitive with
Electron.

JavaScript has ridden the wave of the personal device boom like no other
programming language. While motivated to break free of the browser to
make full use of native APIs, no framework has been successful in
departing fully from the conventions of the web platform, with GUI
programming still being firmly inspired by browser APIs (as with React
Native), if not entirely delegated to web views (as with Electron).
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
Developers want to run JavaScript in every context possible, and over
the last ten years, they have raced to do so. From previously being
confined to the browser, now the language is seen in basically every
device category, and ‚Äì in serverless contexts ‚Äì people are even paying
to execute it.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript runtimes exist to cater to all manner of resource
constraints, from the cheapest chip to the meanest machine (though
perhaps with less of a foothold in supercomputers, which did not come up
during this research). There are great options for interop with other
languages, often to facilitate access to system APIs (which frameworks
like React Native make extensive use of).
</p>
<p>
Lastly, JavaScript continues to show its strength as a language for GUI
programming, being employed in a variety of ways to develop native apps
on mobile phones and Smart TVs, though with web view based apps still
being the vogue on desktop.
</p>
<p>
Why is there no one ‚Äúbest‚Äù runtime, then? Simply, with so many different
contexts to run JavaScript in, there are just too many conflicting
factors to optimise for. Startup performance, runtime performance,
bundle size, API support, and ease of native access all fight for
priority. While the browser-native engines V8 and JavaScriptCore have
maintained their popularity outside the browser, they are beginning to
face competition from runtimes based on new engines such as Hermes,
workerd, and QuickJS in certain areas.
</p>
<p>
But healthy competition and freedom of choice are only ever good things.
The old guard are forced to innovate, and a high standard is maintained
for newcomers. For developers, it‚Äôs the most all-purpose language one
could learn and the single safest technology choice for the future.

Addendum
</h1>
<p>
I started writing this article in April 2024,
<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1044735046919127160/1270142406058049546/1270192881835180126" target="_blank">stretching
the limits</a> of Buttondown‚Äôs edit history at over 5,260 revisions by
August, before continuing to hack away at it on and off for another 12
months. Even now, I can hardly call it finished. I wanted to do the
subject justice, but there‚Äôs just too much to cover and I‚Äôd like to
finally post this thing so that I can write something else. There‚Äôs
surely far more to say about WebAssembly, emulators, wearables, and
runtimes for gaming (with a side-dish of ActionScript?), but let‚Äôs keep
that Pandora‚Äôs Box closed for now.
</p>
<p>
During the course of writing, a few new runtimes were released. Most
notably, ByteDance
<a href="https://lynxjs.org/blog/lynx-unlock-native-for-more.html" target="_blank">announced</a>
the cross-platform framework
<a href="https://lynxjs.org" target="_blank">Lynx</a> (2025), whose
(same-named) runtime is based on their new
<a href="https://github.com/lynx-family/primjs" target="_blank">PrimJS</a>
engine (itself based on QuickJS). I‚Äôve not had any time to dig into it,
but I can say it fascinates me that the runtime additionally supports
<a href="https://github.com/lynx-family/primjs/tree/567851d49fc7a45c66f3d4f849e8a53d502b728b/src/napi" target="_blank">JavaScriptCore,
QuickJS, and V8</a> through Node-API. Curiously, while Android defaults
to using PrimJS throughout, iOS defaults to a mixture of PrimJS on the
main thread and
<a href="https://lynxjs.org/guide/scripting-runtime/index.html#background-thread" target="_blank">JavaScriptCore
on the background thread</a>. This makes it rather an oddity amongst all
other runtimes covered above.
</p>
<p>
And in focusing too hard on non-browser contexts, I appear to have
embarrassingly omitted
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/tree/64f1a76636847dff701a254f4b22700edf7354f8/Libraries/LibWeb" target="_blank">LibWeb</a>,
a browser engine (including a JavaScript runtime) based on the
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/tree/64f1a76636847dff701a254f4b22700edf7354f8/Libraries/LibJS" target="_blank">LibJS</a>
engine from the up-and-coming
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird" target="_blank">Ladybird</a>
browser (2020), which I‚Äôve been following closely.
</p>
<p>
Besides those, I have a list of honourable mentions that I simply didn‚Äôt
manage to weave into the story (though admittedly with some being
outside the ‚Äúlast decade‚Äù boundary). Namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs" target="_blank">gjs</a>
(2008): A JavaScript runtime based on SpiderMonkey, with bindings to
GNOME.

interop</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
‚Ä¶ and there are surely many more that deserve a mention!
</p>
<p>
With that, thank you for reading! I hope this article raises awareness
of JavaScript runtimes beyond the usual ‚Äúbrowsers and Node.js‚Äù
narrative, and begins to convey the true scale of the iceberg.
