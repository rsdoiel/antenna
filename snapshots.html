<b>We deployed 100 reinforcement learning (RL)-controlled cars into
rush-hour highway traffic to smooth congestion and reduce fuel
consumption for everyone.</b> Our goal is to tackle
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNokBgtSUvQ" target="_blank">“stop-and-go”
waves</a>, those frustrating slowdowns and speedups that usually have no
clear cause but lead to congestion and significant energy waste. To
train efficient flow-smoothing controllers, we built fast, data-driven
simulations that RL agents interact with, learning to maximize energy
efficiency while maintaining throughput and operating safely around
human drivers.
</p>
<p>
Overall, a small proportion of well-controlled autonomous vehicles (AVs)
is enough to significantly improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency for
all drivers on the road. Moreover, the trained controllers are designed
to be deployable on most modern vehicles, operating in a decentralized
manner and relying on standard radar sensors. In our
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858625" target="_blank">latest

<br /> <i>A stop-and-go wave moving backwards through highway
traffic.</i>
</p>
<p>
If you drive, you’ve surely experienced the frustration of stop-and-go
waves, those seemingly inexplicable traffic slowdowns that appear out of
nowhere and then suddenly clear up. These waves are often caused by
small fluctuations in our driving behavior that get amplified through
the flow of traffic. We naturally adjust our speed based on the vehicle
in front of us. If the gap opens, we speed up to keep up. If they brake,
we also slow down. But due to our nonzero reaction time, we might brake
just a bit harder than the vehicle in front. The next driver behind us
does the same, and this keeps amplifying. Over time, what started as an
insignificant slowdown turns into a full stop further back in traffic.
These waves move backward through the traffic stream, leading to
significant drops in energy efficiency due to frequent accelerations,
accompanied by increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and accident risk.
</p>
<p>
And this isn’t an isolated phenomenon! These waves are ubiquitous on
busy roads when the traffic density exceeds a critical threshold. So how
can we address this problem? Traditional approaches like ramp metering
and variable speed limits attempt to manage traffic flow, but they often
require costly infrastructure and centralized coordination. A more
scalable approach is to use AVs, which can dynamically adjust their
driving behavior in real-time. However, simply inserting AVs among human
drivers isn’t enough: they must also drive in a smarter way that makes
traffic better for everyone, which is where RL comes in.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px;">

<br /> <i><b>Fundamental diagram of traffic flow.</b> The number of cars
on the road (density) affects how much traffic is moving forward (flow).
At low density, adding more cars increases flow because more vehicles
can pass through. But beyond a critical threshold, cars start blocking
each other, leading to congestion, where adding more cars actually slows
down overall movement.</i>
</p>
<h2 id="reinforcement-learning-for-wave-smoothing-avs">
Reinforcement learning for wave-smoothing AVs
</h2>
<p>
RL is a powerful control approach where an agent learns to maximize a
reward signal through interactions with an environment. The agent
collects experience through trial and error, learns from its mistakes,
and improves over time. In our case, the environment is a mixed-autonomy
traffic scenario, where AVs learn driving strategies to dampen
stop-and-go waves and reduce fuel consumption for both themselves and
nearby human-driven vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Training these RL agents requires fast simulations with realistic
traffic dynamics that can replicate highway stop-and-go behavior. To
achieve this, we leveraged experimental data collected on Interstate 24
(I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee, and used it to build simulations where
vehicles replay highway trajectories, creating unstable traffic that AVs
driving behind them learn to smooth out.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">
<video autoplay muted playsinline disableRemotePlayback loop style="width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; outline: none; border: none; background: transparent; display: block; border-radius: 5px" cover="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/simulation.png">

</video>
<br /> <i>Simulation replaying a highway trajectory that exhibits
several stop-and-go waves.</i>
</p>
<p>
We designed the AVs with deployment in mind, ensuring that they can
operate using only basic sensor information about themselves and the
vehicle in front. The observations consist of the AV’s speed, the speed
of the leading vehicle, and the space gap between them. Given these
inputs, the RL agent then prescribes either an instantaneous
acceleration or a desired speed for the AV. The key advantage of using
only these local measurements is that the RL controllers can be deployed
on most modern vehicles in a decentralized way, without requiring
additional infrastructure.
</p>
<h3 id="reward-design">
Reward design
</h3>
<p>
The most challenging part is designing a reward function that, when
maximized, aligns with the different objectives that we desire the AVs
to achieve:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wave smoothing:</strong> Reduce stop-and-go oscillations.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Lower fuel consumption for all
vehicles, not just AVs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety:</strong> Ensure reasonable following distances and avoid
abrupt braking.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Driving comfort:</strong> Avoid aggressive accelerations and
decelerations.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adherence to human driving norms:</strong> Ensure a “normal”
driving behavior that doesn’t make surrounding drivers uncomfortable.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Balancing these objectives together is difficult, as suitable
coefficients for each term must be found. For instance, if minimizing
fuel consumption dominates the reward, RL AVs learn to come to a stop in
the middle of the highway because that is energy optimal. To prevent
this, we introduced dynamic minimum and maximum gap thresholds to ensure
safe and reasonable behavior while optimizing fuel efficiency. We also
penalized the fuel consumption of human-driven vehicles behind the AV to
discourage it from learning a selfish behavior that optimizes energy
savings for the AV at the expense of surrounding traffic. Overall, we
aim to strike a balance between energy savings and having a reasonable
and safe driving behavior.

<br /> <i>Illustration of the dynamic minimum and maximum gap
thresholds, within which the AV can operate freely to smooth traffic as
efficiently as possible.</i>
</p>
<p>
The typical behavior learned by the AVs is to maintain slightly larger
gaps than human drivers, allowing them to absorb upcoming, possibly
abrupt, traffic slowdowns more effectively. In simulation, this approach
resulted in significant fuel savings of up to 20% across all road users
in the most congested scenarios, with fewer than 5% of AVs on the road.
And these AVs don’t have to be special vehicles! They can simply be
standard consumer cars equipped with a smart adaptive cruise control
(ACC), which is what we tested at scale.
</p>

accelerate as fast as its leader, leading to decreasing wave amplitude
over time and thus energy savings. </i>

</p>
<p>
Given the promising simulation results, the natural next step was to
bridge the gap from simulation to the highway. We took the trained RL
controllers and deployed them on 100 vehicles on the I-24 during peak
traffic hours over several days. This large-scale experiment, which we
called the MegaVanderTest, is the largest mixed-autonomy
traffic-smoothing experiment ever conducted.
</p>
<p>
Before deploying RL controllers in the field, we trained and evaluated
them extensively in simulation and validated them on the hardware.
Overall, the steps towards deployment involved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Training in data-driven simulations:</strong> We used highway
traffic data from I-24 to create a training environment with realistic
wave dynamics, then validate the trained agent’s performance and
robustness in a variety of new traffic scenarios.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deployment on hardware:</strong> After being validated in
robotics software, the trained controller is uploaded onto the car and
is able to control the set speed of the vehicle. We operate through the
vehicle’s on-board cruise control, which acts as a lower-level safety
controller.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Modular control framework:</strong> One key challenge during the
test was not having access to the leading vehicle information sensors.
To overcome this, the RL controller was integrated into a hierarchical
system, the MegaController, which combines a speed planner guide that
accounts for downstream traffic conditions, with the RL controller as
the final decision maker.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Validation on hardware:</strong> The RL agents were designed to
operate in an environment where most vehicles were human-driven,
requiring robust policies that adapt to unpredictable behavior. We
verify this by driving the RL-controlled vehicles on the road under
careful human supervision, making changes to the control based on
feedback.
</li>
</ul>

&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Once validated, the RL controllers were deployed on 100 cars and driven
on I-24 during morning rush hour. Surrounding traffic was unaware of the
experiment, ensuring unbiased driver behavior. Data was collected during
the experiment from dozens of overhead cameras placed along the highway,
which led to the extraction of millions of individual vehicle
trajectories through a computer vision pipeline. Metrics computed on
these trajectories indicate a trend of reduced fuel consumption around
AVs, as expected from simulation results and previous smaller validation
deployments. For instance, we can observe that the closer people are
driving behind our AVs, the less fuel they appear to consume on average
(which is calculated using a calibrated energy model):
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/fuel_data.png" width="80%" />
<br /> <i>Average fuel consumption as a function of distance behind the
nearest engaged RL-controlled AV in the downstream traffic. As human
drivers get further away behind AVs, their average fuel consumption
increases.</i>
</p>
<p>
Another way to measure the impact is to measure the variance of the
speeds and accelerations: the lower the variance, the less amplitude the
waves should have, which is what we observe from the field test data.
Overall, although getting precise measurements from a large amount of
camera video data is complicated, we observe a trend of 15 to 20% of
energy savings around our controlled cars.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/data_scatter.png" width="50%" />
<br /> <i>Data points from all vehicles on the highway over a single day
of the experiment, plotted in speed-acceleration space. The cluster to
the left of the red line represents congestion, while the one on the
right corresponds to free flow. We observe that the congestion cluster
is smaller when AVs are present, as measured by computing the area of a
soft convex envelope or by fitting a Gaussian kernel.</i>
</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">
Final thoughts
</h2>
<p>
The 100-car field operational test was decentralized, with no explicit
cooperation or communication between AVs, reflective of current autonomy
deployment, and bringing us one step closer to smoother, more
energy-efficient highways. Yet, there is still vast potential for
improvement. Scaling up simulations to be faster and more accurate with
better human-driving models is crucial for bridging the
simulation-to-reality gap. Equipping AVs with additional traffic data,
whether through advanced sensors or centralized planning, could further
improve the performance of the controllers. For instance, while
multi-agent RL is promising for improving cooperative control
strategies, it remains an open question how enabling explicit
communication between AVs over 5G networks could further improve
stability and further mitigate stop-and-go waves. Crucially, our
controllers integrate seamlessly with existing adaptive cruise control
(ACC) systems, making field deployment feasible at scale. The more
vehicles equipped with smart traffic-smoothing control, the fewer waves
we’ll see on our roads, meaning less pollution and fuel savings for
everyone!

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.8">shot-scraper
1.8</a></strong>
</p>
I’ve added a new feature to
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> that makes
it easier to share scripts for other people to use with the
<a href="">shot-scraper javascript</a> command.
</p>
<p>
<code>shot-scraper javascript</code> lets you load up a web page in an
invisible Chrome browser (via Playwright), execute some JavaScript
against that page and output the results to your terminal. It’s a fun
way of running complex screen-scraping routines as part of a terminal
session, or even chained together with other commands using pipes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>-i/–input</code> option lets you load that JavaScript from a
file on disk - but now you can also use a <code>gh:</code> prefix to
specify loading code from GitHub instead.
</p>
<p>
To quote
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.8">the
release notes</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>shot-scraper javascript</code> can now optionally
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/javascript.html#running-javascript-from-github">load
scripts hosted on GitHub</a> via the new <code>gh:</code> prefix to the
<code>shot-scraper javascript -i/–input</code> option.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/173">#173</a>
</p>
<p>
Scripts can be referenced as
<code>gh:username/repo/path/to/script.js</code> or, if the GitHub user
has created a dedicated <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repository and
placed scripts in the root of it, using
<code>gh:username/name-of-script</code>.
</p>
<p>
For example, to run this
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts/blob/main/readability.js">readability.js</a>
script against any web page you can use the following:
</p>
<pre><code>shot-scraper javascript --input gh:simonw/readability \
  https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/qwen25-vl-32b/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/60e196ec39a5a75dcabfd75fbe911a4c">output
from that example</a> starts like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json">

</div>
<p>
My
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts">simonw/shot-scraper-scripts</a>
repo only has that one file in it so far, but I’m looking forward to
growing that collection and hopefully seeing other people create and
share their own <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repos as well.
</p>
<p>
<p>This feature is an imitation of
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/809">a similar feature</a>
that’s coming in the next release of LLM.</p>

<h2 id="microsoftplaywright-mcp">microsoft/playwright-mcp</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">microsoft/playwright-mcp</a></strong>
</p>
The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP
(<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Model Context
Protocol</a>) server wrapping Playwright, and it’s pretty fascinating.
</p>
<p>
They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP
clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an
automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate
pages that they visit.
</p>
<p>
Trying it out is quite easy if you have Claude Desktop and Node.js
installed already. Edit your <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code>
file:
</p>
<pre><code>code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
</code></pre>
<p>
And add this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json">
<pre>{
  <span class="pl-ent">"mcpServers"</span>: {
    <span class="pl-ent">"playwright"</span>: {
      <span class="pl-ent">"command"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>npx<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
      <span class="pl-ent">"args"</span>: [
        <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>@playwright/mcp@latest<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
      ]
    }
  }
}</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now when you launch Claude Desktop various new browser automation tools
will be available to it, and you can tell Claude to navigate to a
website and interact with it.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screenshot of Claude interface showing a conversation about Datasette. The interface shows Claude responding to a user (SW) after navigating to datasette.io. Claude's response includes page details (URL: https://datasette.io/, Title: Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data) and a summary of what's visible on the site: a description of Datasette as an open-source tool for exploring and publishing data, the tagline &quot;Find stories in data&quot;, navigation options, and features including exploratory data analysis, instant data publishing, and rapid prototyping." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-playwright.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I ran the following to get a list of the available tools:
</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp
cd playwright-mcp/src/tools
files-to-prompt . | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \
  'Output a detailed description of these tools'
</code></pre>
<p>
The
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/69200999149221c549c1f62e7befa20f">full
output is here</a>, but here’s the truncated tool list:

<p>I’m happy and grateful to announce that the Marginalia Search project
has been accepted for a second nlnet grant. All the details are not yet
finalized, but tentatively the grant will go toward addressing most of
the items in the project backlog for 2025. I’ve already been working
full time on the project since summer 2023, and this grant secures
additional development time, and extends the runway to a comfortable
degree.</p>

<h2 id="qwen2.5-vl-32b-smarter-and-lighter">Qwen2.5-VL-32B: Smarter and
Lighter</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/">Qwen2.5-VL-32B:
Smarter and Lighter</a></strong>
</p>
The second big open weight LLM release from China today - the first
being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/deepseek/">DeepSeek
v3-0324</a>.
</p>
<p>
Qwen’s previous vision model was Qwen2.5 VL,
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl/">released
in January</a> in 3B, 7B and 72B sizes.
</p>
<p>
Today’s Apache 2.0 licensed release is a 32B model, which is quickly
becoming my personal favourite model size - large enough to have
GPT-4-class capabilities, but small enough that on my 64GB Mac there’s
still enough RAM for me to run other memory-hungry applications like
Firefox and VS Code.
</p>
<p>
Qwen claim that the new model (when compared to their previous 2.5 VL
family) can “align more closely with human preferences”, is better at
“mathematical reasoning” and provides “enhanced accuracy and detailed
analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual
logic deduction”.
</p>
<p>
They also offer some presumably carefully selected benchmark results
showing it out-performing Gemma 3-27B, Mistral Small 3.1 24B and
GPT-4o-0513 (there have been two more recent GPT-4o releases since that
one, 2024-08-16 and 2024-11-20).
</p>
<p>
As usual, Prince Canuma had MLX versions of the models live within hours
of the release, in
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit">4
bit</a>,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-6bit">6
bit</a>,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-8bit">8
bit</a>, and
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-bf16">bf16</a>
variants.
</p>
<p>
I ran the 4bit version (a 18GB model download) using <code>uv</code> and
Prince’s <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a> like
this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>numpy&lt;2<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> --with mlx-vlm \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit \
    --max-tokens 1000 \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --prompt <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Describe this image.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
    --image Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here’s the image:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="A map image, described below" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the resulting description, which I found to be <em>very</em>
impressive:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This image appears to be a map highlighting specific areas along the
coastline, likely in California, based on the geographical features and
place names. Here is a detailed description of the image:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Geographic Features</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map shows a section of the coastline, with land on the right and the
sea on the left.
</li>
<li>
The land area includes parts of SanMateo County, as noted in the
top-right corner.
</li>
<li>
The coastline features several named locations, including:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Point Montara</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pillar Point</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Kings Rock</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>VicenteCreek</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>DennistonCreek</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>State Beach</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Highlighted Areas</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map contains two distinct areas marked with different colors:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Red Area (Top Section)</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Labeled as “MONTARA” and “MONTARA M R” (possibly referring to a “Marine
Reserves” or similar protected area).
</li>
<li>
This area is marked with a dark red color and extends from the coastline
inland.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Blue Area (Bottom Section)</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Labeled as “PILLAR” and “PILLAR P O I N T” along with “SMCA” (Special
Management Area).
</li>
<li>
This area is marked with a blue color and is located closer to the
coastline, including the area around “Pillar Point.”
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Depth Contours</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map includes depth markings in the sea, indicating the bathymetrical
features:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>20 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked in the upper-left part of
the sea.
</li>
<li>
<strong>10 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked closer to the coastline.
</li>
<li>
<strong>30 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked further out to sea.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Other Features</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>State Beach</strong>: Marked near the top-right, indicating a
protected recreational area.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Kings Rock</strong>: A prominent feature near the coastline,
likely a rocky outcropping.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Creeks</strong>: The map shows several creeks, including
<strong>VicenteCreek</strong> and <strong>DennistonCreek</strong>, which
flow into the sea.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Protected Areas</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map highlights specific protected areas:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marine Reserves</strong>:
<ul>
<li>
“MONTARA M R” (Marine Reserves) in red.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Management Area (SMCA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>
“PILLAR P O I N T” in blue, indicating a Special Management Area.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Grid and Coordinates</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The map includes a grid with latitude and longitude markings:
<ul>
<li>
Latitude ranges from approximately 37°25’N to 37°35’N.
</li>
<li>
Longitude ranges from approximately 122°22.5’W to 122°35.5’W.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Topography</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The land area shows topographic features, including elevations and
vegetation, with green areas indicating higher elevations or vegetated
land.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Other Labels</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>“SMR”</strong>: Likely stands for “State Managed Reserves.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>“SMCA”</strong>: Likely stands for “Special Management Control
Area.”
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In summary, this map highlights specific protected areas along the
coastline, including a red “Marine Reserves” area and a blue “Special
Management Area” near “Pillar Point.” The map also includes depth
markings, geographical features, and place names, providing a detailed
view of the region’s natural and protected areas.

Linux adds microphone support for MacBooks with Apple Silicon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
The Asahi Linux project has done a lot of work over the past few years
to allow users to install and run Linux on recent Macs with Apple
Silicon processors. But while most features are already working
(including displays, graphics drivers, USB and wireless ports, and
cameras), there are others that have long been considered […]

<h2 id="deepseek-aideepseek-v3-0324">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324</a></strong>
</p>
Chinese AI lab DeepSeek just released the latest version of their
enormous DeepSeek v3 model, baking the release date into the name
<code>DeepSeek-V3-0324</code>.
</p>
<p>
The license is MIT (that’s new - previous DeepSeek v3 had a custom
license), the README is empty and the release adds up a to a total of
641 GB of files, mostly of the form
<code>model-00035-of-000163.safetensors</code>.
</p>
<p>
The model only came out a few hours ago and MLX developer Awni Hannun
already
<a href="https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1904177084609827054">has
it running</a> at &gt;20 tokens/second on a 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio
($9,499 of ostensibly consumer-grade hardware) via
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-lm/">mlx-lm</a> and this
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit">mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit</a>
4bit quantization, which reduces the on-disk size to 352 GB.
</p>
<p>
I think that means if you have that machine you can run it with my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin like
this, but I’ve not tried myself!
</p>
<pre><code>llm mlx download-model mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>
The new model is also
<a href="https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">listed
on OpenRouter</a>. You can try a chat at
<a href="https://openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what the chat interface
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3ce2bf5836743dfaf07d994578b261ba">gave
me</a> for “Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle”:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="There's a pelican, and a bicycle, but both of them look disassembled." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/deepseek-v3-pelican.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I have two API keys with OpenRouter - one of them worked with the model,
the other gave me a <code>No endpoints found matching your data
policy</code> error - I think because I had a setting on that key
disallowing models from training on my activity. The key that worked was
a free key with no attached billing credentials.
</p>
<p>
For my working API key the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a>
plugin let me run a prompt like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter
# Paste key here
llm -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free "best fact about a pelican"
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s that “best fact” - the terminal output included Markdown and an
emoji combo, here that’s rendered.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most fascinating facts about pelicans is their <strong>unique
throat pouch</strong>, called a <strong>gular sac</strong>, which can
hold up to <strong>3 gallons (11 liters) of water</strong>—three times
more than their stomach!
</p>
<p>
Here’s why it’s amazing:<br /> - <strong>Fishing Tool</strong>: They use
it like a net to scoop up fish, then drain the water before
swallowing.<br /> - <strong>Cooling Mechanism</strong>: On hot days,
pelicans flutter the pouch to stay cool by evaporating water.<br /> -
<strong>Built-in “Shopping Cart”</strong>: Some species even use it to
carry food back to their chicks.
</p>
<p>
Bonus fact: Pelicans often <strong>fish cooperatively</strong>, herding
fish into shallow water for an easy catch.
</p>
<p>
Would you like more cool pelican facts? 🐦🌊

<p>
In putting this post together I
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/fc65bf9b-ae2d-4b23-bd09-ed0d54ff4b56">got
Claude</a> to build me

tool</a> for finding the total on-disk size of a Hugging Face
repository, which is available in their API but not currently displayed
on their website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Here’s a notable independent benchmark
<a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1904304052500148423">from
Paul Gauthier</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
DeepSeek’s new V3 scored 55% on aider’s

significantly improving over the prior version. It’s the #2
non-thinking/reasoning model, behind only Sonnet 3.7. V3 is competitive

<h2 id="newsboat-2.39-is-out">Newsboat 2.39 is out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Newsboat News</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;
            The new key-binding system mentioned in the previous entry is
            finally here! After years of work, done primarily by Dennis van
            der Schagt, we now have a &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; command that:

            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    can create multi-key bindings, i.e. one can bind not
                    just single letters (with Control or Shift), but also
                    sequences of letters (each with their own modifiers);
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    allows each binding to execute multiple actions, just
                    like our existing &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; command. Unlike macros,
                    &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t require a &quot;macro prefix&quot;,
                        so one can finally bind a sequence of operations
                        to a &lt;emph&gt;single&lt;/emph&gt; key;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    allows adding documentation strings to each binding,
                    which are then shown in the help dialog. This again is
                    an improvement upon macros, which had no descriptions and
                    didn&#39;t have a way for the user to provide their own;
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    adds alternative syntax for keys. Instead of the usual
                    &lt;code&gt;^R&lt;/code&gt; syntax, one can now use
                    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;C-r&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; a la Tmux or Emacs. Hopefully
                    this makes multi-key bindings easier to read.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The feature is very new, and probably contains bugs. Please
            report them! In fact, it&#39;s so new that we didn&#39;t have time to
            finish the corresponding &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; command LOL.
            However, since Newsboat doesn&#39;t have any multi-key bindings
            by default, &lt;code&gt;unbind&lt;/code&gt; was deemed to not be a release blocker.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            The new feature also has a limitation in that multi-key bindings
            that have the same prefix must have the same length. In other
            words, it&#39;s fine to have &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abx&lt;/code&gt;
            bound simultaneously, but it&#39;s not possible to bind both
            &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt; at the same time.
            This is to avoid an ambiguity when the prefix is typed;
            in that case Newsboat would have to decide somehow
            if the next key is going to be &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            We are all very proud of this feature, and eagerly awaiting your
            feedback! Please try it, and open an issue if something doesn&#39;t
            work or could be improved.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            One more thing: we now require a compiler that accepts
            &lt;code&gt;-std=c++17&lt;/code&gt; flag. In other words, we dropped Clang 4
            support. This is due to libicu 75 requiring C++17; we depend on
            this library via libxml2, and the requirement bleeds through to
            us because we&#39;re indirectly including some of libicu header files.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Compilers without C++17 support are now considered deprecated.
            Future Newsboat releases will probably use some of C++17 features,
            at which point we&#39;ll drop support. If that&#39;s going to create
            problems for you, please file an issue.

<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html">Semantic
Diffusion</a></strong>
</p>
I
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattchughes.ca/post/3ll2sbdky3k2y">learned
about</a> this term today while complaining about how the definition of
“vibe coding” is already being distorted to mean “any time an LLM writes
code” as opposed to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">the
intended meaning</a> of “code I wrote with an LLM without even reviewing
what it wrote”.
</p>
<p>
I posted
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3ll2rtxeucs2e">this
salty note</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Feels like I’m losing the battle on this one, I keep seeing people use
“vibe coding” to mean any time an LLM is used to write code
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly frustrated because for a few glorious moments we had
the chance at having ONE piece of AI-related terminology with a clear,
widely accepted definition!
</p>
<p>
But it turns out people couldn’t be trusted to read all the way to the
end of Andrej’s tweet, so now we are back to yet another term where
different people assume it means different things
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Martin Fowler coined Semantic Diffusion in 2006 with this very clear
definition:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a
person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets
spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that
definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and
with it any usefulness to the term.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What’s happening with vibe coding right now is such a clear example of
this effect in action! I’ve seen
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/">the
same thing happen</a> to my own coinage
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">prompt
injection</a> over the past couple of years.
</p>
<p>
This kind of dillution of meaning is frustrating, but does appear to be
inevitable. As Martin Fowler points out it’s most likely to happen to
popular terms - the more popular a term is the higher the chance a game
of telephone will ensue where misunderstandings flourish as the chain
continues to grow.
</p>
<p>
Andrej Karpathy, who
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">coined</a>
vibe coding,
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1903870973126045712">posted
this</a> just now in reply to my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">article</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Good post! It will take some time to settle on definitions. Personally I
use “vibe coding” when I feel like this dog. My iOS app last night being
a good example. But I find that in practice I rarely go full out vibe
coding, and more often I still look at the code, I add complexity slowly
and I try to learn over time how the pieces work, to ask clarifying
questions etc.

<p>
This was part of Next.js internals used to help avoid applying
middleware recursively to requests that are re-dispatched through the
framework.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it also meant that attackers could send a
<code>x-middleware-subrequest</code> HTTP header with a colon-separated
list of middleware names to skip. If a site used middleware to apply an
authentication gate (as suggested
<a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication#protecting-your-routes-with-nextjs-middleware">in
the Next.js documentation</a>) an attacker could bypass that
authentication using this trick.
</p>
<p>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js 15.2.3 - here’s the
<a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927">official release
announcement</a> talking about the problem.</p>

<p>DOGE claimed they’d fix government inefficiency, but so far, they’ve
only broken it more. 🤷‍♂️ Firing workers ≠ fixing processes. If the people
suffer either way, is this really a solution?</p>

<blockquote cite="https://jacobian.org/2025/mar/13/beware-advice-from-old-heads/">
<p>
If you’re new to tech, taking [career] advice on what works for someone
with a 20-year career is likely to be about as effective as taking
career advice from a stockbroker or firefighter or nurse. There’ll be a
few things that generalize, but most advice won’t.
</p>
<p>
Further, even advice people with long careers on what worked for them
when <em>they</em> were getting started is unlikely to be advice that
works today. The tech industry of 15 or 20 years ago was, again,
<strong>dramatically</strong> different from tech today.
