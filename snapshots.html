The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. [...] Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.</p></blockquote>

      <h1>My review of Claude's new Code Interpreter, released under a very confusing name</h1>

(date: 2025-09-09, updated: 2025-09-09, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Today on the Anthropic blog: <strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files">Claude can now create and edit files</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claude can now create and edit Excel spreadsheets, documents, PowerPoint slide decks, and PDFs directly in <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> and the desktop app. [...]</p>
<p>File creation is now available as a preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan users. Pro users will get access in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then right at the <em>very end</em> of their post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature gives Claude internet access to create and analyze files, which may put your data at risk. Monitor chats closely when using this feature. <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude">Learn more</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And tucked away half way down their <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude">Create and edit files with Claude</a> help article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this feature, Claude can also do more advanced data analysis and data science work. Claude can create Python scripts for data analysis. Claude can create data visualizations in image files like PNG. You can also upload CSV, TSV, and other files for data analysis and visualization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Talk about <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/bury-the-lede-versus-lead">burying the lede</a>... this is their version of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a>, my all-time favorite feature of ChatGPT!</p>

<p>Claude can now write and execute custom Python (and Node.js) code in a server-side sandbox and use it to process and analyze data.</p>
<p>In a particularly egregious example of AI companies being terrible at naming features, the official name for this one really does appear to be <strong>Upgraded file creation and analysis</strong>. Sigh.</p>
<p>This is quite a confusing release, because Claude <em>already</em> had a variant of this feature, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/analysis-tool">released in October 2024</a> with the weak but more sensible name <strong>Analysis tool</strong>. Here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/24/claude-analysis-tool/">my notes from when that came out</a>. That tool worked by generating and executing JavaScript in the user's own browser.</p>
<p>The new tool works entirely differently. It's much closer in implementation to OpenAI's Code Interpreter: Claude now has access to a server-side container environment in which it can run shell commands and execute Python and Node.js code to manipulate data and both read and generate files.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Anthropic have a similar feature in their API called <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool">Code execution tool</a>, but today is the first time end-users of Claude have been able to execute arbitrary code in a server-side container.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="switching-it-on-in-settings-features">Switching it on in settings/features</h4>
<p>I have a Pro Plan but found the setting to enable it on the <a href="https://claude.ai/settings/features">claude.ai/settings/features</a>. It's possible my account was granted early access without me realizing, since the Pro plan isn't supposed to have it yet:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-analysis-toggle.jpg" alt="Experimental. Preview and provide feedback on upcoming enhancements to our platform. Please note: experimental features might influence Claude’s behavior and some interactions may differ from the standard experience. Analysis tool:  Claude can write and run code to process data, run analysis, and produce data visualizations in real time. Upgraded file creation and analysis: Allow Claude to create and edit docs, spreadsheets, presentations, PDFs, and data reports on web and desktop. Does not support versioning or remixing of Artifacts. This feature gives Claude network access to create and analyze files, which has security risks. Monitor chats closely when using this feature. The two features each have a toggle - the toggle for the file creation tool is turned on." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, toggling on the "Upgraded file creation and analysis" option toggles off the "Analysis tool" option, and vice versa. You can't have both at the same time.</p>
<p>I guess this is to help reduce confusion? It surprised me though as Claude can sometimes use the existing analysis tool to help it in the creation of artifacts, as I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/ai-powered-apps-with-claude/">noted here</a> when I wrote about the Claudeception feature they added in June.</p>
<h4 id="exploring-the-environment">Exploring the environment</h4>
<p>I started by using the tool to explore the tool. Here's my <a href="https://claude.ai/share/d796a596-380c-4db2-847d-2eeedc620bc0">first transcript</a> where I simply prompted the following to see what it could figure out about itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Tell me everything you can about your shell and Python environments</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's part of the output:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-files-1.jpg" alt="My prompt, then Claude shows: I'll explore my shell and Python environments to give you a comprehensive overview. • Getting system information and OS details • Checking shell type and version • Getting shell info and bash version • Checking Python version and locations - this one is expandedd to show: bash python3 -version &amp;&amp; which python3 &amp;&amp; which python Output Python 3.12.3 /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>And the key details it returned, each of which I've verified as true by checking the displayed output of the relevant commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>OS</strong>: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (Noble) running on Linux kernel 4.4.0-</li>
<li>
<strong>Architecture</strong>: x86_64</li>
<li>
<strong>Shell</strong>: GNU Bash 5.2.21(1)-release</li>
<li>
<strong>Current User</strong>: root (with access to /home/claude directory)</li>
<li>
<strong>Working Directory</strong>: Currently in root (/), but /home/claude is the main workspace</li>
<li>
<strong>Python Version</strong>: Python 3.12.3</li>
<li>
<strong>Python Executable</strong>: /usr/bin/python3</li>
<li>
<strong>Package Manager</strong>: pip 24.0</li>
<li>
<strong>Python Path</strong>: Standard system locations including:
<ul>
<li>/usr/lib/python3.12 (standard library)</li>
<li>/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (local packages)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Disk Space</strong>: 4.9GB total, with 4.6GB available</li>
<li>
<strong>Memory</strong>: 9.0GB RAM available, minimal usage currently</li>
<li>
<strong>Node.js</strong>: v18.19.1 available</li>
<li>
<strong>npm</strong>: Configured with global packages in <code>/home/claude/.npm-global</code>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have an Ubuntu 24.04.2 container with 9GB of RAM, ~5GB of disk, Python 3.12.3, and Node.js v18.19.1.</p>
<p>How about network access? I tried the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Can you access the Internet? Can you run curl? How about using Python http to fetch https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.json ?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, you can see the <a href="https://claude.ai/share/d796a596-380c-4db2-847d-2eeedc620bc0">detailed output in the transcript</a>. Claude tried <code>https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.json</code> and then <code>https://httpbin.org/json</code> and got a 403 forbidden error for both, then <code>https://google.com</code> and got this curious result:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>curl -s -I https://google.com</pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Tue, 09 Sep 2025 16:02:17 GMT
server: envoy

HTTP/2 403 
content-length: 13
content-type: text/plain
date: Tue, 09 Sep 2025 16:02:17 GMT
</code></pre>
<p>Claude did note that it can still use the <code>web_fetch</code> and <code>web_search</code> containers independently of that container environment, so it should be able to fetch web content using tools running outside of the container and then write it to a file there.</p>
<p>On a hunch I tried this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Run pip install sqlite-utils</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and it worked! Claude can <code>pip install</code> additional packages from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>.</p>

<p>A little more poking around revealed the following relevant environment variables:</p>
<pre><code>HTTPS_PROXY=http://21.0.0.167:15001
no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,metadata.google.internal,*.svc.cluster.local,*.local,*.googleapis.com,*.google.com
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,metadata.google.internal,*.svc.cluster.local,*.local,*.googleapis.com,*.google.com
https_proxy=http://21.0.0.167:15001
http_proxy=http://21.0.0.167:15001
</code></pre>
<p>So based on an earlier HTTP header there's an <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy proxy</a> running at an accessible port which apparently implements a strict allowlist.</p>
<p>I later noticed that <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_0ee9d698a1">the help page</a> includes a full description of what's on that allowlist:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So it looks like we have a <em>very</em> similar system to ChatGPT Code Interpreter. The key differences are that Claude's system can install additional Python packages and has Node.js pre-installed.</p>
<p>One important limitation from the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximum file size is 30MB per file for both uploads and downloads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ChatGPT <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8555545-file-uploads-faq">limit here</a> is 512MB. I've often uploaded 100MB+ SQLite database files to ChatGPT, so I'm a little disappointed by this lower limit for Claude.</p>
<h4 id="starting-with-something-easy">Starting with something easy</h4>
<p>I grabbed a copy of the SQLite database behind <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">my TILs website</a> (21.9MB <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/til.simonwillison.net/tils.db">from here</a>) and uploaded it to Claude, then prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Use your Python environment to explore this SQLite database and generate a PDF file containing a join diagram of all the tables</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://claude.ai/share/f91a95be-0fb0-4e14-b46c-792b47117a3d">that conversation</a>. It did an OK job, producing both <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/til_database_join_diagram.pdf">the PDF</a> I asked for and a PNG equivalent which looks like this (since created files are not available in shared chats):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/til_database_join_diagram.jpg" alt="Each table gets a box with a name and columns. A set of lines is overlaid which doesn't quite seem to represent the joins in a useful fashion." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>This isn't an ideal result - those join lines are difficult to follow - but I'm confident I could get from here to something I liked with only a little more prompting. The important thing is that the system clearly works, and can analyze data in uploaded SQLite files and use them to produce images and PDFs.</p>
<h4 id="something-much-harder-recreating-the-ai-adoption-chart">Something much harder: recreating the AI adoption chart</h4>
<p>Thankfully I have a fresh example of a really challenging ChatGPT Code Interpreter task from just last night, which I described in great detail in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/apollo-ai-adoption/">Recreating the Apollo AI adoption rate chart with GPT-5, Python and Pyodide</a>.</p>
<p>Short version: I took <a href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/">this chart</a> from Apollo Global and asked ChatGPT to recreate it based on a screenshot and an uploaded XLSX file.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/apollo-ai-chart.jpg" alt="AI adoption rates starting to decline for larger firms. A chart of AI adoption rate by firm size. Includes lines for 250+, 100-249, 50-99, 20-49, 10-19, 5-8 and 1-4 sized organizations. Chart starts in November 2023 with percentages ranging from 3 to 5, then all groups grow through August 2025 albeit with the 250+ group having a higher score than the others. That 25+ group peaks in Jul5 2025 at around 14% and then appears to slope slightly downwards to 12% by August. Some of the other lines also start to tip down, though not as much." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>This time I skipped the bit where I had ChatGPT hunt down the original data and jumped straight to the "recreate this chart" step. I used the exact same prompt as I provided to ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Use this data to recreate this chart using python</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And uploaded the same two files - <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/Employment-Size-Class-Sep-2025.xlsx">this XLSX file</a> and the <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/apollo-ai-chart.jpg">screenshot of the original chart</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-files-2.jpg" alt="Claude UI - prompt is &quot;Use this data to recreate this chart using python&quot; - I've selected Sonnet 4 and given it both the XLSX and the screenshot as attachments." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Claude wrote and ran a bunch of Python code and produced this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-attempt-1.jpg" alt="The chart has jagged lines, not smooth ones, but they do appear to show the correct numbers. The title and axis are positioned in ways that overlap other text a bit." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>That's not a bad first attempt - we'll sort out the jagged lines in a moment. With ChatGPT I later told it to plot a six-survey rolling average (since that's what Apollo had done with theirs), so I ran the exact same prompt against Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Plot it as a six survey rolling average</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-attempt-2.jpg" alt="The lines are more even now, and appear to match the numbers reported by Apollo. They still have a jagged look to them though." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>So I told Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Make those lines less jagged</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This did not do what I wanted:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-attempt-3.jpg" alt="The chart looks mostly the same. The lines are a tiny bit thicker." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>So I gave it a bit of a hint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>No not like that, I wanted the lines to be a smooth curve like in the original screenshot - you shouldn't have to use scipy for this or manipulate the data, I'm sure matplotlib can do this already</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little bit of sycophancy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're absolutely right! Matplotlib has built-in curve smoothing. I was overcomplicating it. Let me create a version that uses matplotlib's natural curve smoothing capabilities. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time it used the <code>antialiased=True</code> and <code>solid_capstyle='round'</code> options in matplotlib, which again wasn't what I was after. I tried one more thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>I did not mean smooth the rendering of the lines. I meant that I wanted curved and not straight lines between points.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Normally if I have to argue this much with a model I'll start a fresh session and try a different prompting strategy from the start.)</p>
<p>But this did give me what I was looking for:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-attempt-4.jpg" alt="This time the chart finally has smooth curves between points." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Oddly enough my ChatGPT chart suffered from that same overlapping title glitch, so I gave Claude the same prompt I had given ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fix the chart title, it looks like this:</code> (with a screenshot)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-attempt-5.jpg" alt="Now the chart shows a clear title at the top saying AI adoption rates starting to decline for larger firms" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>We got there in the end! I've shared <a href="https://claude.ai/share/cc32d405-cb53-4e52-a1a0-9b4df4e528ac">the full transcript of the chat</a>, although frustratingly the images and some of the code may not be visible. I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/806e1aa0e6c29ad64834037f779e0dc0">created this Gist</a> with copies of the files that it let me download.</p>
<h4 id="prompt-injection-risks">Prompt injection risks</h4>
<p>ChatGPT Code Interpreter has no access to the internet at all, which limits how much damage an attacker can do if they manage to sneak their own malicious instructions into the model's context.</p>
<p>Since Claude Code Interpreter (I'm <em>not</em> going to be calling it "Upgraded file creation and analysis"!) has a limited form of internet access, we need to worry about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a> and other prompt injection attacks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_0ee9d698a1">help article</a> actually covers this in some detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible for a bad actor to inconspicuously add instructions via external files or websites that trick Claude into:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloading and running untrusted code in the sandbox environment for malicious purposes.</li>
<li>Reading sensitive data from a <a href="http://claude.ai">claude.ai</a> connected knowledge source (e.g., Remote MCP, projects) and using the sandbox environment to make an external network request to leak the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means Claude can be tricked into sending information from its context (e.g., prompts, projects, data via MCP, Google integrations) to malicious third parties. To mitigate these risks, we recommend you monitor Claude while using the feature and stop it if you see it using or accessing data unexpectedly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"We recommend you monitor Claude while using the feature" smells me to me like unfairly outsourcing the problem to Anthropic's users, but I'm not sure what more they can do!</p>
<p>It's interesting that they still describe the external communication risk even though they've locked down a lot of network access. My best guess is that they know that allowlisting <code>github.com</code> opens an <em>enormous</em> array of potential exfiltration vectors.</p>
<p>Anthropic also note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have performed red-teaming and security testing on the feature. We have a continuous process for ongoing security testing and red-teaming of this feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I plan to be cautious using this feature with any data that I very much don't want to be leaked to a third party, if there's even the slightest chance that a malicious instructions might sneak its way in.</p>
<h4 id="my-verdict-on-claude-code-interpreter-so-far">My verdict on Claude Code Interpreter so far</h4>
<p>I'm generally very excited about this. Code Interpreter has been my most-valued LLM feature since it launched in early 2023, and the Claude version includes some upgrades on the original - package installation, Node.js support - that I expect will be very useful.</p>
<p>I don't particularly mark it down for taking a little more prompting to recreate the Apollo chart than ChatGPT did. For one thing I was using Claude Sonnet 4 - I expect Claude Opus 4.1 would have done better. I also have a much stronger intuition for Code Interpreter prompts that work with GPT-5.</p>
<p>I don't think my chart recreation exercise here should be taken as showing any meaningful differences between the two.</p>
<h4 id="ai-labs-find-explaining-this-feature-incredibly-difficult">AI labs find explaining this feature incredibly difficult</h4>
<p>I find it <em>fascinating</em> how difficult the AI labs find describing this feature to people! OpenAI went from "Code Interpreter" to "Advanced Data Analysis" and maybe back again? It's hard to even find their official landing page for that feature now. (I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68c070ff-fe9c-8006-91b5-cff799253836">got GPT-5 to look for it</a> and it hunted for 37 seconds and settled on the help page for <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8437071-data-analysis-with-chatgpt">Data analysis with ChatGPT</a>).</p>
<p>Anthropic already used the bad name "Analysis tool" for a different implementation, and now have the somehow-worse name "Upgraded file creation and analysis". Their launch announcement avoids even talking about code execution, focusing exclusively on the tool's ability to generate spreadsheets and PDFs!</p>
<p>I wonder if any of the AI labs will crack the code on how to name and explain this thing? I feel like it's still a very under-appreciated feature of LLMs, despite having been around for more than two years now.</p>

The Python Software Foundation's annual board member election is taking place right now, with votes (from previously affirmed voting members) accepted from September 2nd, 2:00 pm UTC through Tuesday, September 16th, 2:00 pm UTC.</p>
<p>I've served on the board since 2022 and I'm running for a second term. Here's the opening section of my <a href="https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2025-python-software-foundation-board/nominees/">nomination statement</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I'm Simon Willison. I've been a board member of the Python Software Foundation since 2022 and I'm running for re-election in 2025.</p>
<p>Last year I wrote a detailed article about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/18/board-of-the-python-software-foundation/">Things I’ve learned serving on the board of the Python Software Foundation</a>. I hope to continue learning and sharing what I've learned for a second three-year term.</p>
<p>One of my goals for a second term is to help deepen the relationship between the AI research world and the Python Software Foundation. There is an enormous amount of value being created in the AI space using Python and I would like to see more of that value flow back into the rest of the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>I see the Python Package Index (PyPI) as one of the most impactful projects of the Python Software Foundation and plan to continue to advocate for further investment in the PyPI team and infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a California resident I'm excited to see PyCon return to the West Coast, and I'm looking forward to getting involved in helping make PyCon 2026 and 2027 in Long Beach, California as successful as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm delighted to have been endorsed this year by <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/blog/psf-candidate-endorsements-2025.html">Al Sweigart</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@lorenipsum/115170249309856873">Loren Crary</a> and <a href="https://social.coop/@chrisjrn/115135449245231588">Christopher Neugebauer</a>. If you are a voting member I hope I have earned your vote this year.</p>

      <h1>Geoffrey Huntley is cursed</h1>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://ghuntley.com/cursed/">I ran Claude in a loop for three months, and it created a genz programming language called cursed</a></strong></p>
Geoffrey Huntley vibe-coded an entirely new programming language using Claude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The programming language is called "cursed". It's cursed in its lexical structure, it's cursed in how it was built, it's cursed that this is possible, it's cursed in how cheap this was, and it's cursed through how many times I've sworn at Claude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geoffrey's initial prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Hey, can you make me a programming language like Golang but all the lexical keywords are swapped so they're Gen Z slang?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he pushed it to keep on iterating over a three month period.</p>
<p>Here's Hello World:</p>
<pre><code>vibe main
yeet "vibez"

slay main() {
    vibez.spill("Hello, World!")
}
</code></pre>
<p>And here's <a href="https://github.com/ghuntley/cursed/blob/ecda33d496e1562e0e02efb25b6936ad94e79b72/test_suite/leetcode_comprehensive_suite/binary_search/704_binary_search_backup.%F0%9F%92%80">binary search</a>, part of <a href="https://github.com/ghuntley/cursed/tree/zig/test_suite/leetcode_comprehensive_suite">17+ LeetCode problems</a> that run as part of the test suite:</p>

        } otherwise {
            right = mid - 1
        }
    }
    damn -1
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a <em>substantial</em> project. The repository currently has <a href="https://github.com/ghuntley/cursed/commits/zig/">1,198 commits</a>. It has both an interpreter mode and a compiler mode, and can compile programs to native binaries (via LLVM) for macOS, Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>It looks like it was mostly built using Claude running via <a href="https://ampcode.com/">Sourcegraph's Amp</a>, which produces <a href="https://github.com/ghuntley/cursed/commit/ec5be8a4c4f6e82f6b93774a9b3b3f88308680dd">detailed commit messages</a>. The commits include links to archived Amp sessions but sadly those don't appear to be publicly visible.</p>
<p>The first version was written in C, then Geoffrey had Claude port it to Rust and then Zig. <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1965295152962097550">His cost estimate</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically it costs about 5k usd to build your own compiler now because cursed was implemented first in c, then rust, now zig. So yeah, it’s not one compiler it’s three editions of it. For a total of $14k USD.</p>

      <h1>Recreating the Apollo AI adoption rate chart with GPT-5, Python and Pyodide</h1>

(date: 2025-09-09, updated: 2025-09-09, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/apollo-ai-adoption/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/apollo-ai-adoption/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Apollo Global Management's "Chief Economist" Dr. Torsten Sløk released <a href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/">this interesting chart</a> which appears to show a slowdown in AI adoption rates among large (&gt;250 employees) companies:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/apollo-ai-chart.jpg" alt="AI adoption rates starting to decline for larger firms. A chart of AI adoption rate by firm size. Includes lines for 250+, 100-249, 50-99, 20-49, 10-19, 5-8 and 1-4 sized organizations. Chart starts in November 2023 with percentages ranging from 3 to 5, then all groups grow through August 2025 albeit with the 250+ group having a higher score than the others. That 25+ group peaks in Jul5 2025 at around 14% and then appears to slope slightly downwards to 12% by August. Some of the other lines also start to tip down, though not as much." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Here's the full description that accompanied the chart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms, and one question is whether a business has used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. Recent data by firm size shows that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees, see chart below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(My first thought on seeing that chart is that I hope it represents the <em>peak of inflated expectations</em> leading into the <em>trough of dissillusionment</em> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> (which Wikipedia calls "largely disputed, with studies pointing to it being inconsistently true at best"), since that means we might be reaching the end of the initial hype phase and heading towards the <em>slope of enlightenment</em>.)</p>
<h4 id="finding-the-us-census-data-with-gpt-5-search">Finding the US Census data with GPT-5 search</h4>
<p>This is the first I'd heard of the US Census Bureau running a biweekly (that's once every two weeks) survey about AI!</p>
<p>I decided to track down the numbers and see if I could recreate the chart myself. And since <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/">GPT-5 is really good at search now</a> I fed it the following prompt to see how well it could do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&gt; The US Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms, and one question is whether a business has used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. Recent data by firm size shows that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees, see chart below.</code></p>
<p><code>Find me that original data</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took 1m19s to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bf48cf-0e70-8006-a045-96fa8e7ddfc1">find exactly what I needed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the original U.S. Census Bureau source for that series:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BTOS “Employment size class” time series (XLSX)</strong> — biweekly shares of firms answering <strong>Yes</strong> to “In the last two weeks, did this business use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in producing goods or services?”, broken out by firm-size buckets (incl. <strong>250+ employees</strong>). Coverage: <strong>Sep 11, 2023 → Aug 24, 2025</strong>. (<a href="https://www.census.gov/hfp/btos/data_downloads">Census.gov</a>) [...]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That <a href="https://www.census.gov/hfp/btos/data_downloads">Census page</a> was not <em>at all</em> obvious. Thankfully GPT-5 had tipped me off to the "Employment size class" file, this link here:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/census-page.jpg" alt="US Census website. Business Trends and Outlook Survey, Updated August 28, 2025. Current Data has 6 visible XLSX files with names like WFH Supplement, WFH Questions 27-29, National, Sectur, Subsector and Emplomyent size class. A red arrow highlights that last one." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>So I downloaded that file, and confirmed that it was indeed a spreadsheet containing the data I wanted (in among all sorts of other survey questions). Here's <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/Employment-Size-Class-Sep-2025.xlsx">a 374KB XLSX copy</a> of the file I downloaded.</p>
<h4 id="recreating-the-chart-with-gpt-5-code-interpreter">Recreating the chart with GPT-5 code interpreter</h4>
<p>So what should I do with it now? I decided to see if GPT-5 could turn the spreadsheet back into that original chart, using Python running in its <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">code interpreter</a> tool.</p>
<p>So I uploaded the XLSX file back to ChatGPT, dropped in a screenshot of the Apollo chart and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Use this data to recreate this chart using python</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chart-prompt.jpg" alt="ChatGPT. I dropped in a screenshot of the chart, uploaded the spreadsheet which turned into an inline table browser UI and prompted it to recreate the chart using python." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I thought this was a pretty tall order, but it's always worth throwing big challenges at an LLM to learn from how well it does.</p>
<p>It <em>really worked hard on this</em>. I didn't time it exactly but it spent at least 7 minutes "reasoning" across 5 different thinking blocks, interspersed with over a dozen Python analysis sessions. It used <code>pandas</code> and <code>numpy</code> to explore the uploaded spreadsheet and find the right figures, then tried several attempts at plotting with <code>matplotlib</code>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell GPT-5 in ChatGPT can now feed charts it creates back into its own vision model, because it appeared to render a broken (empty) chart and then keep on trying to get it working.</p>
<p>It found a data dictionary in the last tab of the spreadsheet and used that to build a lookup table matching the letters <code>A</code> through <code>G</code> to the actual employee size buckets.</p>
<p>At the end of the process it spat out this chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recreated-chart-1.jpg" alt="matplotlib chart. The title is AI adoption rates starting to decline for larger firms, though there's a typography glitch in that title. It has a neat legend for the different size ranges, then a set of lines that look about right compared to the above graph - but they are more spiky and the numbers appear to trend up again at the end of the chart." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>At first glance I thought it had nailed it... but then I compared the chart more closely with the Apollo original and spotted some definite discrepancies. GPT-5's chart peaked at 14.5% but the highest value in Apollo's was more like 13.5%. The GPT-5 chart was spikier - and most interestingly it included a clear uptick in the last data point where Apollo's had trended downwards.</p>
<p>I decided it was time to look at the actual data. I opened up the spreadsheet in Numbers, found the AI question columns and manually reviewed them. They seemed to match the GPT-5 chart results - so why the difference to Apollo's?</p>
<p>Then I noticed a crucial detail in the Apollo chart that I had cropped out of my original screenshot!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Data is six-survey moving average.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I told ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Do the first question, plot it as a six survey rolling average</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked for the first question because it turned out there were two that were relevant in the survey spreadsheet.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the last two weeks, did this business use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in producing goods or services? (Examples of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents, voice recognition, etc.)</li>
<li>During the next six months, do you think this business will be using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in producing goods or services? (Examples of AI: machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents, voice recognition, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>It churned away for a little longer, added this code to the script:</p>

<p>And popped out this chart (after I told it to fix the glitch in the title):</p>

<p>I think it's done it! This is a very solid match for the Apollo original, recreated using <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>pandas</code> from the same underlying source data from the US Census.</p>

<p>I like how it generated <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai_adoption_rolling6_by_firm_size.svg">an SVG version</a> of the chart without me even asking for it.</p>
<p>You can access <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bf48cf-0e70-8006-a045-96fa8e7ddfc1">the ChatGPT transcript</a> to see full details of everything it did.</p>
<h4 id="rendering-that-chart-client-side-using-pyodide">Rendering that chart client-side using Pyodide</h4>
<p>I had one more challenge to try out. Could I render that same chart entirely in the browser using <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>, which can execute both Pandas and Matplotlib?</p>
<p>I fired up a new ChatGPT GPT-5 session and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Build a canvas that loads Pyodide and uses it to render an example bar chart with pandas and matplotlib and then displays that on the page</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My goal here was simply to see if I could get a proof of concept of a chart rendered, ideally using the Canvas feature of ChatGPT. Canvas is OpenAI's version of Claude Artifacts, which lets the model write and then execute HTML and JavaScript directly in the ChatGPT interface.</p>
<p>It worked! Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/c/68bf2993-ca94-832a-a95e-fb225911c0a6">the transcript</a> and here's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/pyodide-bar-chart">what it built me</a>, exported  to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> GitHub Pages site (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/pyodide-bar-chart.html">source code here</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pyodide-matplotlib.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a web application demonstrating Pyodide integration. Header reads &quot;Pyodide + pandas + matplotlib — Bar Chart&quot; with subtitle &quot;This page loads Pyodide in the browser, uses pandas to prep some data, renders a bar chart with matplotlib, and displays it below — all client-side.&quot; Left panel shows terminal output: &quot;Ready&quot;, &quot;# Python environment ready&quot;, &quot;• pandas 2.2.0&quot;, &quot;• numpy 1.26.4&quot;, &quot;• matplotlib 3.5.2&quot;, &quot;Running chart code...&quot;, &quot;Done.

Y-axis labeled &quot;Streams&quot; ranges 0-120, X-axis labeled &quot;Month&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>I've now proven to myself that I can render those Python charts directly in the browser. Next step: recreate the Apollo chart.</p>
<p>I knew it would need a way to load the spreadsheet that was CORS-enabled. I uploaded my copy to my <code>/static/cors-allow/2025/...</code> directory (configured in S3 to serve CORS headers), pasted in the finished plotting code from earlier and told ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Now update it to have less explanatory text and a less exciting design (black on white is fine) and run the equivalent of this:</code></p>
<p>(... pasted in Python code from earlier ...)</p>
<p><code>Load the XLSX sheet from https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/Employment-Size-Class-Sep-2025.xlsx</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It didn't quite work - I got an error about <code>openpyxl</code> which I manually researched the fix for and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Use await micropip.install("openpyxl") to install openpyxl - instead of using loadPackage</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to paste in another error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>zipfile.BadZipFile: File is not a zip file</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then one about a <code>SyntaxError: unmatched ')'</code> and a <code>TypeError: Legend.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ncols'</code> - copying and pasting error messages remains a frustrating but necessary part of the vibe-coding loop.</p>
<p>... but with those fixes in place, the resulting code worked! Visit <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ai-adoption">tools.simonwillison.net/ai-adoption</a> to see the final result:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recreated-chart-pyodide.jpg" alt="Web page. Title is AI adoption - 6-survey rolling average. Has a Run, Downlaed PNG, Downlaod SVG button.

<p>Here's the code for that page, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/ai-adoption.html">170 lines</a> all-in of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-ve-learned-from-this">What I've learned from this</h4>
<p>This was another of those curiosity-inspired investigations that turned into a whole set of useful lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-5 is great at tracking down US Census data, no matter how difficult their site is to understand if you don't work with their data often</li>
<li>It can do a very good job of turning data + a screenshot of a chart into a recreation of that chart using code interpreter, Pandas and matplotlib</li>
<li>Running Python + matplotlib in a browser via Pyodide is very easy and only takes a few dozen lines of code</li>
<li>Fetching an XLSX sheet into Pyodide is only a small extra step using <code>pyfetch</code> and <code>openpyxl</code>:
<pre style="margin-top: 0.5em"><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">micropip</span>
<span class="pl-k">await</span> <span class="pl-s1">micropip</span>.<span class="pl-c1">install</span>(<span class="pl-s">"openpyxl"</span>)
<span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">pyodide</span>.<span class="pl-s1">http</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">pyfetch</span>

</li>
<li>Another new-to-me pattern: you can render an image to the DOM from Pyodide code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/cf26ed8a6f243159bdc90a3d88f818261732103f/ai-adoption.html#L124">like this</a>:
<pre style="margin-top: 0.5em"><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">js</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">document</span>
<span class="pl-s1">document</span>.<span class="pl-c1">getElementById</span>(<span class="pl-s">'plot'</span>).<span class="pl-c1">src</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">'data:image/png;base64,'</span> <span class="pl-c1">+</span> <span class="pl-s1">img_b64</span></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I will most definitely be using these techniques again in future.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Coincidentally Claude released their own upgraded equivalent to ChatGPT Code Interpreter later on the day that I published this story, so I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/claude-code-interpreter/#something-much-harder-recreating-the-ai-adoption-chart">ran the same chart recreation experiment</a> against Claude Sonnet 4 to see how it compared.</p>

      <h1>Anthropic status: Model output quality</h1>

(date: 2025-09-09, updated: 2025-09-09, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/anthropic-model-output-quality/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/9/anthropic-model-output-quality/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/72f99lh1cj2c">Anthropic status: Model output quality</a></strong></p>
Anthropic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/30/claude-degraded-quality/">previously reported</a> model serving bugs that affected Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 for 56.5 hours. They've now fixed additional bugs affecting "a small percentage" of Sonnet 4 requests for almost a month, plus a less long-lived Haiku 3.5 issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolved issue 1 - A small percentage of Claude Sonnet 4 requests experienced degraded output quality due to a bug from Aug 5-Sep 4, with the impact increasing from Aug 29-Sep 4. A fix has been rolled out and this incident has been resolved. </p>
<p>Resolved issue 2 - A separate bug affected output quality for some Claude Haiku 3.5 and Claude Sonnet 4 requests from Aug 26-Sep 5. A fix has been rolled out and this incident has been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They directly address accusations that these stem from deliberate attempts to save money on serving models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Importantly, we never intentionally degrade model quality as a result of demand or other factors, and the issues mentioned above stem from unrelated bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The timing of these issues is really unfortunate, corresponding with the rollout of GPT-5 which I see as the non-Anthropic model to feel truly competitive with Claude for writing code since their release of Claude 3.5 back in  June last year.

      <h1>Load Llama-3.2 WebGPU in your browser from a local folder</h1>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llama-3.2-webgpu/">Load Llama-3.2 WebGPU in your browser from a local folder</a></strong></p>
Inspired by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45168953#45169054">a comment</a> on Hacker News I decided to see if it was possible to modify the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples/tree/main/llama-3.2-webgpu">transformers.js-examples/tree/main/llama-3.2-webgpu</a> Llama 3.2 chat demo (<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/llama-3.2-webgpu">online here</a>, I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/30/llama-32-webgpu/">wrote about it last November</a>) to add an option to open a local model file directly from a folder on disk, rather than waiting for it to download over the network.</p>
<p>I posed the problem to OpenAI's GPT-5-enabled Codex CLI like this:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples
cd transformers.js-examples/llama-3.2-webgpu
codex
</code></pre>
<p>Then this prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Modify this application such that it offers the user a file browse button for selecting their own local copy of the model file instead of loading it over the network. Provide a "download model" option too.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Codex churned away for several minutes, even running commands like <code>curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/transformers.js/main/src/models.js | sed -n '1,200p'</code> to inspect the source code of the underlying Transformers.js library.</p>
<p>After four prompts total (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3c46c9e609f6ee77367a760b5ca01bd2?permalink_comment_id=5751814#gistcomment-5751814">shown here</a>) it built something which worked!</p>
<p>To try it out you'll need your own local copy of the Llama 3.2 ONNX model. You can get that (a ~1.2GB) download) like so:</p>
<pre><code>git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-q4f16
</code></pre>
<p>Then visit my <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llama-3.2-webgpu/">llama-3.2-webgpu</a> page in Chrome or Firefox Nightly (since WebGPU is required), click "Browse folder", select that folder you just cloned, agree to the "Upload" confirmation (confusing since nothing is uploaded from your browser, the model file is opened locally on your machine) and click "Load local model".</p>
<p>Here's an animated demo (recorded in real-time, I didn't speed this up):</p>
<p><img alt="GIF. I follow the setup instructions, clicking to load a local model and browsing to the correct folder. Once loaded the model shows a chat interface, I run the example about time management which returns tokens at about 10/second." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/webgpu-llama-demo-small.gif" /></p>
<p>I pushed <a href="https://github.com/simonw/transformers.js-examples/commit/cdebf4128c6e30414d437affd4b13b6c9c79421d">a branch with those changes here</a>. The next step would be to modify this to support other models in addition to the Llama 3.2 demo, but I'm pleased to have got to this proof of concept with so little work beyond throwing some prompts at Codex to see if it could figure it out.</p>
<p>According to the Codex <code>/status</code> command <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3c46c9e609f6ee77367a760b5ca01bd2?permalink_comment_id=5751807#gistcomment-5751807">this used</a> 169,818 input tokens, 17,112 output tokens and 1,176,320 cached input tokens. At current GPT-5 token pricing ($1.25/million input, $0.125/million cached input, $10/million output) that would cost 53.942 cents, but Codex CLI hooks into my existing $20/month ChatGPT Plus plan so this was bundled into that.

      <p>
I thought this quote from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin">Ursula K. Le
Guin’s</a>’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness">Left Hand
of Darkness</a> speaks to the ethnographic method. Here, the character
Estraven, a native of the planet Gethen, is asking Genly Ai why he has
come alone as a visitor to the planet, and he responds:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alone, I cannot change your world. But I can be changed by it. Alone, I
must listen, as well as speak. Alone, the relationship I finally make,
if I make one, is not impersonal and not only political: it is
individual, it is personal, it is both more and less than political. Not
We and They; not I and It; but I and Thou. Not political, not pragmatic,
but mystical.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course UKLG was no stranger to ethnography and the role of cultural
observers, both her parents were anthropologists, and she studied the
subject. It’s ironic though, because the character of Genly Ai does have
a profound effect on the planetary civilization of Gethen…but it’s not
through some activity he performs alone, but through his relationships
with others that it comes about.

      <h1>GSoC 2025 - Byte Type: Supporting Raw Data Copies in the LLVM IR</h1>

(date: 2025-09-08, from: <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-byte-type/">https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-byte-type/</a>)
      <p>
      <p>This summer I participated in GSoC under the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure.The goal of the project was to add a new byte type to the LLVM IR, capable of representing raw memory values.This new addition enables the native implementation of memory-related intrinsics in the IR, including <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memmove</code> and <code>memcmp</code>, fixes existing unsound transformations and enables new optimizations, all with a minimal performance impact.</p><h1 id="background">Background</h1><p>One of LLVM&rsquo;s longstanding problems is the absence of a type capable of representing raw memory values.Currently, memory loads of raw bytes are performed through an appropriately sized integer type.However, integers are incapable of representing an arbitrary memory value.Firstly, they do not retain pointer provenance information, rendering them unable to fully specify the value of a pointer.Secondly, loading memory values containing <code>poison</code> bits through an integer type taints the loaded value, as integer values are either <code>poison</code> or have a fully-defined value, with no way to represent individual <code>poison</code> bits.</p><p>Source languages such as C<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and C++<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> provide proper types to inspect and manipulate raw memory.These include <code>char</code>, <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code>.C++17 introduced the <code>std::byte</code> type, which offers similar raw memory access capabilities, but does not support arithmetic operations.Currently, Clang lowers these types to the <code>i8</code> integer type, which does not accurately model their raw memory access semantics, motivating miscompilations such as the one reported in <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37469">bug report 37469</a>.</p><p>The absence of a similar type in the LLVM IR hinders the implementation of memory-related intrinsics such as <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memmove</code> and <code>memcmp</code>, and introduces additional friction when loading and converting memory values to other types, leading to implicit conversions that are hard to identify and reason about.The two core problems stemming from the absence of a proper type to access and manipulate raw memory, directly addressed by the byte type and explored throughout the remainder of this section, are summarized as follows:</p><ol><li>Integers do not track provenance, rendering them incapable of representing a pointer.</li><li>Loads through integer types spread <code>poison</code> values, which taints the load result if the loaded values contain at least one <code>poison</code> bit (as occurs with padded values).</li></ol><h2 id="pointer-provenance">Pointer Provenance</h2><p>According to the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM Language Reference</a>, pointers track provenance, which is <em>the ability to perform memory accesses through the pointer, in the sense of the pointer aliasing rules</em>.The main goal of tracking pointer provenance is to simplify alias analysis, yielding more precise results, which enables high-level optimizations.</p><p>Integers, unlike pointers, do not capture provenance information, being solely characterized by their numerical value.Therefore, loading a pointer through an integer type discards the pointer&rsquo;s provenance.This is problematic as such loads can cause pointer escapes that go unnoticed by alias analysis.Once alias analysis is compromised, simple optimizations that rely on the absence of aliasing become invalid, compromising the correctness of the whole compilation process.</p><p>Currently, Alive2 defines the result of loading a pointer value through an integer type as <code>poison</code>.This implies that loads through integer types fail to accurately recreate the original memory value, hindering pointer copies via integer types.In the following example, storing a pointer to memory and loading it through the <code>i64</code> type yields <code>poison</code>, invalidating the transformation.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

style="color:#75715e"></span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="undefined-behavior">Undefined Behavior</h2><p>LLVM’s <code>poison</code> value is used to represent unspecified values, such as padding bits.Loading such memory values through an integer type propagates <code>poison</code> values, as integer types are either <code>poison</code> or have a fully-defined value, not providing enough granularity to represent individual <code>poison</code> bits.This hinders the copy of padded values.</p><p>Moreover, this lack of granularity can lead to subtle issues that are often overlooked.The <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#bitcast-to-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a> defines the <code>bitcast</code> instruction as a <em>no-op cast because no bits change with this conversion</em>.Nonetheless, while scalar types are either <code>poison</code> or have a fully-defined value, vector types in LLVM track <code>poison</code> values on a per-lane basis.This introduces potential pitfalls when casting vector types to non-vector types, as the cast operation can inadvertently taint non-<code>poison</code> lanes.In the following example, considering the first lane of <code>%v</code> to be <code>poison</code>, the result of casting the vector to an <code>i64</code> value is <code>poison</code>, regardless of the value of the second lane.</p><div

[bitcast] conversion is done as if the value had been stored to memory and read back as [the destination type]</em>&quot;), this duality in the value representation between vector and scalar types integer constitutes a corner case that is not widely contemplated and often unnecessarily introduces undefined behavior.</p><h1 id="implementing-the-byte-type">Implementing the Byte Type</h1><p>Back in 2021, a <a href="https://github.com/georgemitenkov/GSoC-2021">GSoC project with a similar goal</a>, produced a working prototype of the byte type.This prototype introduced the byte type to the IR, lowered C and C++&rsquo;s raw memory access types to the byte type and implemented some optimizations over the new type.</p><p>The current project began by porting these patches to the latest version of LLVM, adapting the code to support the newly introduced opaque pointers.As the work progressed and new challenges emerged, the original proposal was iteratively refined.The implementation of the byte type in LLVM and Alive2 can be found <a href="https://github.com/pedroclobo/llvm-project/tree/byte-type">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pedroclobo/alive2/tree/byte-type">here</a>, respectively.</p><h2 id="byte-type">Byte Type</h2><p>The byte type is a first-class single-value type, with the same size and alignment as the equivalently sized integer type.Memory loads through the byte type yield the value&rsquo;s raw representation, without introducing any implicit casts.This allows the byte type to represent both pointer and non-pointer values.</p><p>Additionally, the byte type is equipped with the necessary granularity to represent <code>poison</code> values at the bit-level, such that loads of padded values through the byte type do not taint the loaded value.As a consequence, a <code>bitcast</code> between vector and scalar byte types preserves the raw byte value.In the following example, a <code>poison</code> lane does not taint the cast result, unlike with equivalently sized integer types.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-llvm"

IR:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Raw memory representation:</strong> Optimization passes can use the byte type to represent raw memory values, avoiding the introduction of implicit casts and treating both pointer and non-pointer values uniformly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bit-level <code>poison</code> representation:</strong> The byte type provides the necessary granularity to represent individual <code>poison</code> bits, providing greater flexibility than integer types, which either have a fully-defined value or are tainted by <code>poison</code> bits.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>bitcast</code> instruction:</strong> This instruction allows conversions from other primitive types to equivalently-sized byte types. Casts between vector and scalar byte types do not taint the cast result in the presence of <code>poison</code> lanes, as occurs with integer types.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>bytecast</code> instruction:</strong> This instruction enables the conversion of byte values to other primitive types. The standard version of the cast performs type punning, reinterpreting pointers as integers and vice-versa. The <code>exact</code> flag disallows type punning by returning <code>poison</code> if the type of the value held by the byte does not match the cast destination type.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>trunc</code> and <code>lshr</code> instructions:</strong> The <code>trunc</code> and <code>lshr</code> instructions accept byte operands, behaving similarly to their integer counterparts. The latter only accepts shift amounts that are multiples of 8, ruling out sub-byte accesses.</p></li></ul><h1 id="results">Results</h1><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>The implementation was evaluated using the Phoronix Test Suite automated benchmarking tool, from which a set of 20 C/C++ applications, listed below, were selected.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Benchmark</strong></th><th><strong>Version</strong></th><th><strong>LoC</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>aircrack-ng</td><td>1.7</td><td>66,988</td><td>Tool suite to test WiFi/WLAN network security</td></tr><tr><td>botan</td><td>2.17.3</td><td>147,832</td><td>C++ library for cryptographic operations</td></tr><tr><td>compress-7zip</td><td>24.05</td><td>247,211</td><td>File archiving tool based on the 7-Zip format</td></tr><tr><td>compress-pbzip2</td><td>1.1.13</td><td>10,187</td><td>Parallel implementation of bzip2</td></tr><tr><td>compress-zstd</td><td>1.5.4</td><td>90,489</td><td>Lossless compression tool using Zstandard</td></tr><tr><td>draco</td><td>1.5.6</td><td>50,007</td><td>3D mesh and point cloud compressing library</td></tr><tr><td>espeak</td><td>1.51</td><td>45,192</td><td>Compact open-source speech synthesizer</td></tr><tr><td>ffmpeg</td><td>7.0</td><td>1,291,957</td><td>Audio and video processing framework</td></tr><tr><td>fftw</td><td>3.3.10</td><td>264,128</td><td>Library for computing FFTs</td></tr><tr><td>graphics-magick</td><td>1.3.43</td><td>267,450</td><td>Toolkit for image editing and conversion</td></tr><tr><td>luajit</td><td>2.1-git</td><td>68,833</td><td>JIT-compiler of the Lua programming language</td></tr><tr><td>ngspice</td><td>34</td><td>527,637</td><td>Open-source circuit simulator</td></tr><tr><td>openssl</td><td>3.3</td><td>597,713</td><td>Implementation of SSL/TLS</td></tr><tr><td>redis</td><td>7.0.4</td><td>178,014</td><td>In-memory data store</td></tr><tr><td>rnnoise</td><td>0.2</td><td>146,693</td><td>Neural network for audio noise reduction</td></tr><tr><td>scimark2</td><td>2.0</td><td>800</td><td>Scientific computing suite written in ANSI C</td></tr><tr><td>sqlite-speedtest</td><td>3.30</td><td>250,607</td><td>Program for executing SQLite database tests</td></tr><tr><td>stockfish</td><td>17</td><td>11,054</td><td>Advanced open-source chess engine</td></tr><tr><td>tjbench</td><td>2.1.0</td><td>57,438</td><td>JPEG encoding and decoding tool</td></tr><tr><td>z3</td><td>4.14.1</td><td>512,002</td><td>SMT solver and theorem prover</td></tr></tbody></table><p>All programs were compiled with the <code>-O3</code> pipeline on an AMD EPYC 9554P 64-Core CPU.In order to minimize result variance, turbo boost, hyperthreading, and ASLR were disabled, the performance governor was used, and core pinning was applied.The plots, depicted below, display the compile time, object size, peak memory usage (maximum redisent set size) and run-time performance differences between the implementation and upstream LLVM.The results reveal that the addition of the byte type had a minimal impact on all of the addressed performance metrics.Each result is averaged over three runs.

      <h1>Is the LLM response wrong, or have you just failed to iterate it?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-07, updated: 2025-09-07, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/is-the-llm-response-wrong-or-have-you-just-failed-to-iterate-it/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/is-the-llm-response-wrong-or-have-you-just-failed-to-iterate-it/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://mikecaulfield.substack.com/p/is-the-llm-response-wrong-or-have">Is the LLM response wrong, or have you just failed to iterate it?</a></strong></p>
More from Mike Caulfield (see also <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/the-sift-method/">the SIFT method</a>). He starts with a <em>fantastic</em> example of Google's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/ai-mode/">AI mode</a> usually correctly handling a common piece of misinformation but occasionally falling for it (the curse of non-deterministic systems), then shows an example if what he calls a "sorting prompt" as a follow-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the evidence for and against this being a real photo of Shirley Slade?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The response starts with a non-committal "there is compelling evidence for and against...", then by the end has firmly convinced itself that the photo is indeed a fake. It reads like a fact-checking variant of "think step by step".</p>
<p>Mike neatly describes a problem I've also observed recently where "hallucination" is frequently mis-applied as meaning any time a model makes a mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term hallucination has become nearly worthless in the LLM discourse. It initially described a very weird, mostly non-humanlike behavior where LLMs would make up things out of whole cloth that did not seem to exist as claims referenced any known source material or claims inferable from any known source material. Hallucinations as stuff made up out of nothing. Subsequently people began calling any error or imperfect summary a hallucination, rendering the term worthless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example is the initial incorrect answers were not hallucinations: they correctly summarized online content that contained misinformation. The trick then is to encourage the model to look further, using "sorting prompts" like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Facts and misconceptions and hype about what I posted</li>
<li>What is the evidence for and against the claim I posted</li>
<li>Look at the most recent information on this issue, summarize how it shifts the analysis (if at all), and provide link to the latest info</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I appreciated this closing footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should platforms have more features to nudge users to this sort of iteration? Yes. They should. Getting people to iterate investigation rather than argue with LLMs would be a good first step out of this mess that the chatbot model has created.</p>

      <h1>The SIFT method</h1>

(date: 2025-09-07, updated: 2025-09-07, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/the-sift-method/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/the-sift-method/#atom-everything</a>)

      <p><strong><a href="https://guides.lib.uchicago.edu/c.php?g=1241077&amp;p=9082322">The SIFT method</a></strong></p>
The SIFT method is "an evaluation strategy developed by digital literacy expert, Mike Caulfield, to help determine whether online content can be trusted for credible or reliable sources of information."</p>
<p>This looks <em>extremely</em> useful as a framework for helping people more effectively consume information online (increasingly gathered with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-search/">the help of LLMs</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop</strong>. "Be aware of your emotional response to the headline or information in the article" to protect against clickbait, and don't read further or share until you've applied the other three steps.</li>
<li><strong>Investigate the Source</strong>. Apply <a href="https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/what-reading-laterally-means/">lateral reading</a>, checking what others say about the source rather than just trusting their "about" page.</li>
<li><strong>Find Better Coverage</strong>. "Use lateral reading to see if you can find other sources corroborating the same information or disputing it" and consult trusted fact checkers if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media to their Original Context</strong>. Try to find the original report or referenced material to learn more and check it isn't being represented out of context.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework really resonates with me: it formally captures and improves on a bunch of informal techniques I've tried to apply in my own work.

      <h1>AI mode is good, actually</h1>

(date: 2025-09-07, updated: 2025-09-07, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/ai-mode/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/ai-mode/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p>When I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/">how good ChatGPT with GPT-5</a> is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google's efforts around this are.</p>
<p>I'm glad I left that out, because it turns out Google's new "AI mode" is genuinely really good! It feels  very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results <em>much</em> faster.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/ai">www.google.com/ai</a></strong> (not available in the EU, as I found out this morning since I'm staying in France for a few days.)</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://share.google/aimode/SZNHD7Owi0Wv9d3Ci">what I got</a> for the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of search results page with navigation tabs &quot;AI Mode&quot; and more.  Main search query reads &quot;Anthropic but lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?&quot; Results show &quot;11 sites&quot; and include text: &quot;In 2024, Anthropic paid millions of dollars to buy physical books in bulk, which they then cut up, scanned, and discarded to train their AI models. This method was a major component of a copyright lawsuit settlement that Anthropic paid in September 2025. While Anthropic took this destructive, large-scale approach, other major AI labs have taken different routes to acquire book data.&quot; Followed by &quot;Here's how other AI companies have sourced book data:&quot; with bullet points for &quot;OpenAI and Microsoft: In June 2025, the companies announced a partnership with Harvard University libraries to train AI models on digitized, public-domain books. This non-destructive method provides high-quality text while preserving the original physical copies.&quot; &quot;Meta: Meta has been accused of relying on large-scale piracy to build its datasets for models like LLaMA. In 2025, a search tool revealed that Meta had copied more than 7.5 million books from the pirate site LibGen for its AI systems.&quot; &quot;Google: Decades before the current AI boom, Google pioneered non-destructive scanning methods for its Google Books project. This method became a successful legal precedent for digitizing copyrighted works for internal purposes. In 2024, Anthropic hired the former head of this project, Tom Turvey, to help with its own book-acquisition strategy." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ai-mode-books.jpg" /></p>
<p>I'll be honest: I hadn't spent much time with AI mode for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My expectations of "AI mode" were extremely low based on my terrible experience of "AI overviews"</li>
<li>The name "AI mode" is so generic!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on some initial experiments I'm impressed - Google finally seem to be taking full advantage of their search infrastructure for building out truly great AI-assisted search.</p>
<p>I do have one disappointment: AI mode will tell you that it's "running 5 searches" but it won't tell you what those searches are! Seeing the searches that were run is really important for me in evaluating the likely quality of the end results. I've had the same problem with Google's Gemini app in the past - the lack of transparency as to what it's doing really damages my trust.</p>

      <h1>GPT-5 Thinking in ChatGPT (aka Research Goblin) is shockingly good at search</h1>

(date: 2025-09-06, updated: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p>"Don't use chatbots as search engines" was great advice for several years... until it wasn't.</p>
<p>I wrote about how good OpenAI's o3 was at using its Bing-backed search tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/">back in April</a>. GPT-5 feels even better.</p>
<p>I've started calling it my <strong>Research Goblin</strong>. I can assign a task to it, no matter how trivial or complex, and it will do an often unreasonable amount of work to search the internet and figure out an answer.</p>
<p>This is excellent for satisfying curiosity, and occasionally useful for more important endeavors as well.</p>
<p>I always run my searches by selecting the "GPT-5 Thinking" model from the model picker - in my experience this leads to far more comprehensive (albeit much slower) results.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from just the last couple of days. Every single one of them was run on my phone, usually while I was doing something else. Most of them were dictated using the iPhone voice keyboard, which I find faster than typing. Plus, it's fun to talk to my Research Goblin.</p>

<h4 id="bouncy-travelators">Bouncy travelators</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>They used to be rubber bouncy travelators at Heathrow and they were really fun, have all been replaced by metal ones now and if so, when did that happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was traveling through Heathrow airport pondering what had happened to the fun bouncy rubber travelators.</p>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc2d98-9aac-8006-98b9-1424d98290f8">Here's what I got</a>. Research Goblin narrowed it down to some time between 2014-2018 but, more importantly, found me this <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/totalsf/article/sfo-bouncy-moving-walkway-airport-19845449.php">delightful 2024 article</a> by Peter Hartlaub in the San Francisco Chronicle with a history of the SFO bouncy walkways, now also sadly retired.</p>
<h4 id="identify-this-building">Identify this building</h4>

<p>Identify this building in reading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a photo I snapped out of the window on the train. It <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc2e21-1d24-8006-b083-00b3233e1c67">thought for 1m4s</a> and correctly identified it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blade,_Reading">The Blade</a>.</p>
<h2 id="starbucks-uk-cake-pops">Starbucks UK cake pops</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Starbucks in the UK don't sell cake pops! Do a deep investigative dive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Starbucks in Exeter railway station didn't have cake pops, and the lady I asked didn't know what they were.</p>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc71b4-68f4-8006-b462-cf32f61e7ec3">Here's the result</a>. It turns out Starbucks did launch cake pops in the UK <a href="https://www.nationalworld.com/lifestyle/starbucks-cake-pops-launched-in-uk-on-new-autumn-menu-full-list-of-items-4284537">in September 2023</a> but they aren't available at all outlets, in particular the licensed travel locations such as the one at Exeter St Davids station.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed how it established definitive proof by consulting <a href="https://www.starbucks.co.uk/sites/starbucks-uk-pwa/files/2024-11/HOL24_UK_AllergenBook_CORE_FOOD_v02.LR_.pdf">the nutrition and allergen guide PDF</a> on starbucks.co.uk, which does indeed list both the Birthday Cake Pop (my favourite) and the Cookies and Cream one (apparently discontinued in the USA, at least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lp5chq/just_learned_today_the_cookies_cream_cake_pop_has/">according to r/starbucks</a>).</p>
<h4 id="britannica-to-seed-wikipedia">Britannica to seed Wikipedia</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone on hacker News said:</p>
<p>&gt; I was looking at another thread about how Wikipedia was the best thing on the internet. But they only got the head start by taking copy of Encyclopedia Britannica and everything else</p>
<p>Find what they meant by that</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc3062-5a68-8006-a12b-cf7196a130ae">The result</a>. It turns out Wikipedia did seed itself with content from the out-of-copyright 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica... but that project took place in 2006, five years after Wikipedia first launched in 2001.</p>
<p>I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the single best article I can link somebody to that explains the 1911 Britannica thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it pointed me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Encyclopaedia_Britannica">Wikipedia:WikiProject Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> which includes a detailed explanation and a link to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:EB1911">the 13,000 pages</a> still tagged with the template from that project. I posted what I found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45135061#45137109">in a comment</a>.</p>
<p>Notably (for me anyway) I didn't feel the need to disclose my use of ChatGPT in finding that information - at this point that feels a little like disclosing that I ran a Google search.</p>
<h4 id="official-name-for-the-university-of-cambridge">Official name for the University of Cambridge</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the official legal name of the university of Cambridge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/iancal/">Here's the context for that one</a>. It thought for 19 seconds - the thinking trace reveals it knew the answer but wanted to confirm it. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc723d-a344-8006-9514-fb3ea2c2b43b">It answered</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.” <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/the-university-as-a-charity">University of Cambridge</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/legal">Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That first link gave me the citation I needed in order to be sure this was right.</p>
<p>Since this is my shortest example, here's a screenshot of the expanded "Thought for 19s" panel. I <em>always</em> expand the thoughts - seeing how it pulled together its answer is crucial for evaluating if the answer is likely to be useful or not.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cambridge-name.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an AI assistant's thought process and research. Header shows &quot;Thought for 19s&quot; followed by bullet points: &quot;The user asked for the official legal name of the University of Cambridge, and I think they mean the formal corporate name. It's probably 'The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,' similar to Oxford's. I'm going to verify by checking the web for precise information.&quot; &quot;The official name of Cambridge might include the serial comma, like 'Masters, and Scholars.' There's a similar structure with Oxford, which uses a comma after 'Masters' too. The University is an exempt charity, so you can cross-check with legal documents like statutes or charity records. I'll double-check.&quot; Shows search results for &quot;official legal name of University of Cambridge&quot; from en.wikipedia.org, www.cam.ac.uk, projects.propublica.org and &quot;10 more&quot; sources. Continues with &quot;The University of Cambridge's official legal name, based on the University website and Cambridge University Press, is 'The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,' with the serial comma after 'Masters.' It's clear from these authoritative sources, so I'll provide that straightforward answer, citing the University site.&quot; &quot;The official legal name of the University of Cambridge is 'The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge,' with the comma after Masters and the Oxford comma before 'and.' I'll answer concisely in one line and cite official sources to confirm. No need for extra UI elements here.&quot; Shows &quot;Done&quot; status. Final answer displays: &quot;The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.&quot; attributed to University of Cambridge, Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment, with &quot;Sources&quot; section at bottom." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<h4 id="history-of-the-caverns-in-exeter-quay">History of the caverns in Exeter quay</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Research On the waterfront restaurant in Exeter, is it dug into the cliffs somehow? History of the building, who built it, why and how</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were out to dinner <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xxvaPQiNWACtbq3H8">here</a> and noticed that the interior of the restaurant appeared to be a space dug into the cliff, which piqued my interest.</p>
<p>This was <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc32fb-d52c-8006-9259-0b984dc832b2">the ChatGPT session</a> that inspired the Research Goblin nickname. It just kept on digging!</p>
<p>The first reply took 2m40s and confirmed that yes, these quay buildings were carved into the red sandstone cliff <a href="https://www.exploredevon.info/activities/walk/exeter-quay/">in the 1820s-1830s</a>.</p>
<p>ChatGPT with GPT-5 really likes to suggest additional steps it can take. In this case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’d like, I can dig up the exact Historic England entry that covers the “Southern Warehouse” address and overlay it on a map of the vaults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often say "yes" purely out of curiosity to see what it will do next, and the offer to "overlay it on a map" was irresistible, like how would it even do that?</p>
<p>It did a <em>ton</em> of extra searches, found latitude and longitude coordinates for the restaurant (from Wikimedia Commons) and the warehouse buildings (from National Heritage List for England via Wikipedia), showed me that data in a table and then used Python to render this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/bad-chart.png" alt="Scatter plot titled &quot;On The Waterfront vs. Warehouse Vaults (Exeter Quay)&quot; with scientific notation &quot;+5.071e1&quot; in top left. Y-axis shows &quot;Latitude&quot; ranging from 0.0065 to 0.0090. X-axis shows &quot;Longitude&quot; ranging from -3.5310 to -3.5280. Three orange X markers plotted: &quot;Warehouse Vaults (6-11, The Quay) — HE 1223046&quot; at top center, &quot;On The Waterfront (4-9 Southern Warehouse)&quot; at middle left, and &quot;Warehouse Vaults (1-4, The Quay) — HE 1223045&quot; at bottom right" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Yeah, so that one is a bit of a miss!</p>
<p>But... the underlying research chain, as always, provided fascinating. I noticed that at one point it had searched for "Exeter Quay vaults map PDF", which inspired my next question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you find any PDF diagrams, showing the tunnels into the cliff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2m20s later it had found <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KgQ8hlUut3Q2r5wVMItggobi9P/2/844706/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">a planning document</a> and <a href="https://www.turner-locker.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cellar-1-The-Quay-TO-LET-2018-1.pdf">a letting brochure</a>, both PDFs, but noted that neither of them had the diagram I wanted. Evidently it actually "reads" the PDFs it finds as part of its activities, since it appears to have knowledge of the images contained within them as well as the text.</p>
<p>It concluded with this intriguing note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s strong evidence that a detailed plan/section <strong>does</strong> exist in the Exeter Archaeology report often cited by planners—<strong>“Archaeological, Historical and Conservation Study of the Exeter Canal Basin” (Exeter Archaeology Report 00.18, 2000)</strong>—but it isn’t online; it’s just cited in planning documents. You’d likely need to request it via the Devon Heritage Centre/Historic Environment Record.</p>
<p>If you want, I can keep hunting specialist archives for a digitized copy or a different report that includes the vault layouts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously I said "Yes do that" and 2m24s later it chucked out a whole host of extra links, an apology that it still hadn't found a detailed plan diagram and, under the section heading "What I recommend next (actionable + exact ask)":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re happy, I can draft an email you can paste to the right archivists. [...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Exeter Quayside cliff vaults – request for plan/section drawings
Hello,</p>
<p>I’m researching the cliff-cut vaults behind The Quay (On The Waterfront / Kings Wharf).
Could you supply scans or copies of any <strong>plans/sections/diagrams</strong> of these vaults—especially those in <strong>Exeter Archaeology Report 00.18 (2000)</strong> (Archaeological, Historical and Conservation Study of the Exeter Canal Basin) and any <strong>EMAFU/Exeter Archaeology drawings</strong> for “The Quay” showing the <strong>vault/tunnel layouts cut into the red sandstone cliff</strong>?</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a good thing my Research Goblin doesn't have the ability to send email (which we already know is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/31/snitchbench-with-llm/">very risky business</a>) or at this point I wouldn't be surprised if it started autonomously bothering archivists on my behalf!</p>
<h4 id="aldi-vs-lidl">Aldi vs Lidl</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In UK supermarket terms compare lidl and aldi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I saw an Aldi and a Lidl next to each other in Exeter and was curious as to how they compare. In this case my Research Goblin went <em>way</em> deeper than I had intended, thinking for 1m25s about market share and price surveys and loyalty schemes and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc7913-7ed8-8006-bd3f-63e540470cd7">answering</a> with ten paragraphs of detailed analysis.</p>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I just wanted the basic vibes like is one fancier than the other?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic bought lots of physical books and cut them up and scan them for training data. Do any other AI labs do the same thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relevant to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/anthropic-settlement/">today's big story</a>. Research Goblin was <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68bc771c-c188-8006-a8e5-4b1624f5bdf0">unable to find</a> any news stories or other evidence that any labs other than Anthropic are engaged in large scale book scanning for training data. That's not to say it isn't happening, but it's happening very quietly if that's the case.</p>
<h4 id="gpt-5-for-search-feels-competent">GPT-5 for search feels competent</h4>
<p>The word that best describes how I feel about GPT-5 search is that it feels <strong>competent</strong>.</p>
<p>I've thrown all sorts of things at it over the last few weeks and it rarely disappoints me. It almost always does better than if I were to dedicate the same amount of time to manually searching myself, mainly because it's much faster at running searches and evaluating the results than I am.</p>
<p>I particularly love that it works so well on mobile. I used to reserve my deeper research sessions to a laptop where I could open up dozens of tabs. I'll still do that for higher stakes activities but I'm finding the scope of curiosity satisfaction I can perform on the go with just my phone has increased quite dramatically.</p>
<p>I've mostly stopped using OpenAI's Deep Research feature, because ChatGPT search now gives me the results I'm interested in far more quickly for most queries.</p>
<p>As a developer who builds software on LLMs I see ChatGPT search as the gold standard for what can be achieved using tool calling combined with chain-of-thought. Techniques like RAG are <em>massively</em> more effective if you can reframe them as several levels of tool calling with a carefully selected set of powerful search tools.</p>
<p>The way that search tool integrates with reasoning is key, because it allows GPT-5 to execute a search, reason about the results and then execute follow-up searches - all as part of that initial "thinking" process.</p>
<p>Anthropic call this ability <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#interleaved-thinking">interleaved thinking</a> and it's also <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#keeping-reasoning-items-in-context">supported by the OpenAI Responses API</a>.</p>
<h4 id="tips-for-using-search-in-chatgpt">Tips for using search in ChatGPT</h4>
<p>As with all things AI, GPT-5 search rewards intuition gathered through experience. Any time a curious thought pops into my head I try to catch it and throw it at my Research Goblin. If it's something I'm certain it won't be able to handle then even better! I can learn from watching it fail.</p>
<p>I've been trying out hints like "go deep" which seem to trigger a more thorough research job. I enjoy throwing those at shallow and unimportant questions like the UK Starbucks cake pops one just to see what happens!</p>
<p>You can throw questions at it which have a single, unambiguous answer - but I think questions which are broader and don't have a "correct" answer can be a lot more fun. The UK supermarket rankings above are a great example of that.</p>
<p>Since I love a questionable analogy for LLMs Research Goblin is... well, it's a goblin. It's very industrious, not quite human and not entirely trustworthy. You have to be able to outwit it if you want to keep it gainfully employed.</p>

<p>This one is an incremental improvement - I've seen it referred to online as "Kimi K-2.1".

      <h1>Why I think the $1.5 billion Anthropic class action settlement may count as a win for Anthropic</h1>

(date: 2025-09-06, updated: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/anthropic-settlement/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/anthropic-settlement/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/anthropic/773087/anthropic-to-pay-1-5-billion-to-authors-in-landmark-ai-settlement">Anthropic to pay $1.5 billion to authors in landmark AI settlement</a></strong></p>
I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/24/anthropic-training/">the details of this case</a> when it was found that Anthropic's training on book content was fair use, but they needed to have purchased individual copies of the books first... and they had seeded their collection with pirated ebooks from Books3, PiLiMi and LibGen.</p>
<p>The remaining open question from that case was the penalty for pirating those 500,000 books. That question has now been resolved in a settlement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic has reached an agreement to pay “at least” a staggering $1.5 billion, plus interest, to authors to settle its class-action lawsuit. The amount breaks down to smaller payouts expected to be approximately $3,000 per book or work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's wild to me that a $1.5 billion settlement can feel like a win for Anthropic, but given that it's undisputed that they downloaded pirated books  (as did Meta and likely many other research teams) the maximum allowed penalty was $150,000 per book, so $3,000 per book is actually a significant discount.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell this case sets a precedent for Anthropic's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/24/anthropic-training/#purchase-and-scan">more recent approach</a> of buying millions of (mostly used) physical books and destructively scanning them for training as covered by "fair use". I'm not sure if other in-flight legal cases will find differently.</p>
<p>To be clear: it appears it is legal, at least in the USA, to buy a used copy of a physical book (used = the author gets nothing), chop the spine off, scan the pages, discard the paper copy and then train on the scanned content. The transformation from paper to scan is "fair use".</p>
<p>If this <em>does</em> hold it's going to be a great time to be a bulk retailer of used books!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The official website for the class action lawsuit is <a href="https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com">www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the coming weeks, and if the court preliminarily approves the settlement, the website will provide to find a full and easily searchable listing of all works covered by the settlement.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Atlantic have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/search-libgen-data-set/682094/">a search engine</a> to see if your work was included in LibGen, one of the pirated book sources involved in this case.</p>
<p>I had a look and it turns out the book I co-authored with 6 other people back in 2007 <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art/9780980285840/">The Art &amp; Science of JavaScript</a> is in there, so maybe I'm due for 1/7th of one of those $3,000 settlements!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Here's an interesting detail from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/05/anthropic-book-authors-copyright-settlement/">Washington Post story</a> about the settlement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic said in the settlement that the specific digital copies of books covered by the agreement were not used in the training of its commercially released AI models.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: I'm not confident that destroying the scanned books is a hard requirement here - I got that impression from <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25982181-authors-v-anthropic-ruling/#document/p16">this section</a> of the summary judgment in June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, every purchased print copy was copied in order to save storage space and to enable searchability as a digital copy. The print original was destroyed. One replaced the other. And, there is no evidence that the new, digital copy was shown, shared, or sold outside the company. This use was even more clearly transformative than those in <em>Texaco</em>, <em>Google</em>, and <em>Sony Betamax</em> (where the number of copies went up by at least one), and, of course, more transformative than those uses rejected in <em>Napster</em> (where the number went up by “millions” of copies shared for free with others).</p>

      <h1>Selling the Van</h1>

(date: 2025-09-06, from: <a href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/09/06/van/">https://inkdroid.org/2025/09/06/van/</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
I don’t know about you, but this presentation <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVG8W-0p6vg&amp;t=32s">Tech
Promised Everything. Did it deliver?</a> by <a
href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> seemed to pop up
all over the place for me recently, in podcasts and social media posts.
At some point I initially watched about 1/2 of it, and stopped because
although it seemed kind of sweet I couldn’t understand what the fuss was
about. Then later after seeing it mentioned in another context I
finished watching it. What follows will only make sense if you have seen
it. If you haven’t seen it already I recommend you just close this tab
in your browser and move on with your life.
</p>
<p>
The central conceit of the talk seemed to be that his family sold their
(highly valued) van in order to buy a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a> based
on the belief held by Hanselman, his parents, and his fifth grade
teacher Mrs Hill, that computing technology was a “gift” that was going
to “change everything” for the better. As the title suggests, his
presentation is asking whether it turned out that way or not.
</p>
<p>
After talking about the exponential growth of computing in the following
decades he goes on to describe how the use of Large Language Models
(LLM) in schools has resulted in course material being written with
LLMs, which are then completed by students with LLMs, and graded with
LLMs, with neither teacher or student engaging in a collaborative and
creative learning process. He suggests that this <em>is not</em>
realizing the promise of computer technology.
</p>
<p>
I agree, as I imagine you do too. I guess it was actually kind of brave
for Hanselman (a Microsoft employee, who essentially own OpenAI who
created ChatGPT) to get on a stage in front of a large audience and
compare generative AI technology, or Large Language Models, to “computer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad Libs</a>”, and that
not all is well with big-tech. If you’ve been following the news and
discourse around AI and LLMs at all then this certainly will not be news
to you. However, hearing it from Microsoft VP might seem a bit …
unusual?
</p>
<p>
Hanselman goes on to propose that a better use of the technology would
be for students to use generative AI to chat with Albert Einstein, Maya
Angelou, or Nelson Mandela. That the technology should allow us to do
things that “were not possible before” while maintaining “connection,
convenience and creativity”. That we should all learn how generative AI
works, so we can be more thoughtful about how we integrate it into our
lives.
</p>
<p>
But is it not already possible for students to understand Albert
Einstein, Maya Angelou and Nelson Mandela by reading <strong>what they
actually wrote</strong>, and <strong>what they actually said</strong>?
We have books, and recordings, and all kinds of information for teachers
and students to engage with, which we can source, cite and share,
preserve and make accessible. How is chatting with some massively
inefficient technology running in a centralized data center, that will
invent things that they might have said, better than what we have now?
The only thing that LLMs do seem to be better at currently is routing
around the copyright laws that prevent these works from being widely
available online.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that the reason why this talk resonated so much in tech
circles is that it is an <em><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologia">apology</a></em> for
generative AI, that recognizes the so called “AI bubble” that is
threatening to burst, while at the same time reinscribing, and
reauthorizing, the use of generative AI in society. It presents as a
meaningful critique, but is instead a piece of kitsch commentary that is
meant to appeal to a very specific demographic (people like me) who grew
up with these computers, and are grappling with their complicit
participation in a sociotechnical enterprise that has gone well off the
rails.
</p>
<p>
This is Big Tech consoling us, that it has a moral compass. Or more
generously, it is one person in Big Tech, trying to recover (on stage)
what it felt like to have a moral compass.
</p>
<p>
One truly startling moment in the talk was when Hanselman showed his
smart phone, smart ring, smart watch, and an insulin sensor on his arm,
to point out that it represents more computation than existed on the
planet in 1980. I’m not sure if this analogy holds, but in broad strokes
it does seem significant right?
</p>
<p>
But for me this analogy invites some questions. Who has these devices in
their pocket, on the wrist, on their finger, and stuck in their arm? How
many resources needed to be extracted for this to happen? Who benefited
from the extraction, manufacture, and dissemination of this technology?
Is all this compute power <em>actually</em> needed to do things we
couldn’t do before? How much centralization of compute (especially by
generative AI) in resource draining data centers run by multinational
corporations has occurred to allow these personal devices to
proliferate? Perhaps that will be the topic of part two of the talk? I’m
not holding my breath.
</p>
<p>
I also am not holding my breath for the “AI Bubble” to burst. I think it
will take more than changes in stock market valuations to right this
ship that drifted off course well before generative AI. Big Tech is a
symptom and not a cure.

      <p>
      I&rsquo;ve been using the CoPilot plugin for IntelliJ on and off for the last few years, and while initially pretty enthusiastic, I&rsquo;ve come to first disable it and then delete it altogether along with JetBrains&rsquo; local AI-completions, and generally felt this has been an improvement in productivity and a reduction of frustration.
CoPilot is pretty good at taking things that are already pretty fast, such as monotonous code transformations like mapping an object to a SQL statement, and then making that even faster.

Leonid Radvinsky, the secretive owner of OnlyFans, received a $700 million windfall last year, while the platform’s top tier of content creators — mostly women — earn millions annually. With $7.2 billion in annual gross revenue and just 46 employees, OnlyFans may be one of the most profitable companies on the planet. [&#8230;]</p>

      Antenna is a feed orient content management tool. It can use to build a and run a blog. What follows are the steps needed to create a simple blog using only Antenna application, Markdown and the Antenna YAML configuration files.

The first thing we need is a directory to hold our website. That can be done from a terminal on Linux, macOS or Windows using the following command.

~~~shell
mkdir myblog
~~~

We want to change into that directory.

~~~shell
cd myblog

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-embeddinggemma/">Introducing EmbeddingGemma</a></strong></p>
Brand new open weights (under the slightly janky <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms">Gemma license</a>) 308M parameter embedding model from Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the Gemma 3 architecture, EmbeddingGemma is trained on 100+ languages and is small enough to run on less than 200MB of RAM with quantization.</p>

<p>As usual for these smaller models there's a <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/embeddinggemma#transformersjs">Transformers.js</a> demo (<a href="https://twitter.com/xenovacom/status/1963638444233511016">via</a>) that runs directly in the browser (in Chrome variants) - <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/semantic-galaxy">Semantic Galaxy</a> loads a ~400MB model and then lets you run embeddings against hundreds of text sentences, map them in a 2D space and run similarity searches to zoom to points within that space.</p>

      <h1>Highlighted tools</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, updated: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/highlighted-tools/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/highlighted-tools/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Any time I share my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">collection of tools</a> built using vibe coding and AI-assisted development (now at 124, here's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">the definitive list</a>) someone will inevitably complain that they're mostly trivial.</p>
<p>A lot of them are! Here's a list of some that I think are genuinely useful and worth highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/ocr">OCR PDFs and images directly in your browser</a>. This is the tool that started the collection, and I still use it on a regular basis. You can open any PDF in it (even PDFs that are just scanned images with no embedded text) and it will extract out the text so you can copy-and-paste it. It uses PDF.js and Tesseract.js to do that entirely in the browser. I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/">how I originally built that here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations">Annotated Presentation Creator</a> - this one is <em>so useful</em>. I use it to turn talks that I've given into full annotated presentations, where each slide is accompanied by detailed notes. I have <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">29 blog entries</a> like that now and most of them were written with the help of this tool. Here's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">how I built that</a>, plus <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#annotated-presentations.html">follow-up prompts I used to improve it</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/image-resize-quality">Image resize, crop, and quality comparison</a> - I use this for every single image I post to my blog. It lets me drag (or paste) an image onto the page and then shows me a comparison of different sizes and quality settings, each of which I can download and then upload to my S3 bucket. I recently added a slightly janky but mobile-accessible cropping tool as well. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#image-resize-quality.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/social-media-cropper">Social Media Card Cropper</a> - this is an even more useful image tool. Bluesky, Twitter etc all benefit from a 2x1 aspect ratio "card" image. I built this custom tool for creating those - you can paste in an image and crop and zoom it to the right dimensions. I use this all the time. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#social-media-cropper.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/svg-render">SVG to JPEG/PNG</a> - every time I publish an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a> I use this tool to turn that SVG into a JPEG or PNG. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#svg-render.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/encrypt">Encrypt / decrypt message</a> - I often run workshops where I want to distribute API keys to the workshop participants. This tool lets me encrypt a message with a passphrase, then share the resulting URL to the encrypted message and tell people (with a note on a slide) how to decrypt it. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#encrypt.html">Prompt</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/jina-reader">Jina Reader</a> - enter a URL, get back a Markdown version of the page. It's a thin wrapper over the Jina Reader API, but it's useful because it adds a "copy to clipboard" button which means it's one of the fastest way to turn a webpage into data on a clipboard on my mobile phone. I use this several times a week. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#jina-reader.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> - a pricing comparison and token pricing calculator for various hosted LLMs. This one started out as a tool but graduated to its own domain name. Here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#llm-prices.html">prompting development history</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/open-sauce-2025">Open Sauce 2025</a> - an unofficial schedule for the Open Sauce conference, complete with option to export to ICS plus a search tool and now-and-next. I built this <em>entirely on my phone</em> using OpenAI Codex, including scraping the official schedule - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/17/vibe-scraping/">full details here</a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/hacker-news-histogram">Hacker News Multi-Term Histogram</a> - compare search terms on Hacker News to see how their relative popularity changed over time. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#hacker-news-histogram.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/passkeys">Passkey experiment</a> - a UI for trying out the Passkey / WebAuthn APIs that are built into browsers these days. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#passkeys.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/incomplete-json-printer">Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer</a> - do you ever find yourself staring at a screen full of JSON that isn't completely valid because it got truncated? This tool will pretty-print it anyway. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#incomplete-json-printer.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/bluesky-firehose">Bluesky WebSocket Feed Monitor</a> - I found out Bluesky has a Firehose API that can be accessed directly from the browser, so I vibe-coded up this tool to try it out. <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#bluesky-firehose.html">Prompts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In putting this list together I realized I wanted to be able to link to the prompts for each tool... but those were hidden inside a collapsed <code>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;</code> element for each one. So I fired up <a href="https://openai.com/codex/">OpenAI Codex</a> and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Update the script that builds the colophon.html page such that the generated page has a tiny bit of extra JavaScript - when the page is loaded as e.g. https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#jina-reader.html it should notice the #jina-reader.html fragment identifier and ensure that the Development history details/summary for that particular tool is expanded when the page loads.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/47">authored this PR for me</a> which fixed the problem.</p>

      <h1>Beyond Vibe Coding</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, updated: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/beyond-vibe-coding/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/beyond-vibe-coding/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://beyond.addy.ie/">Beyond Vibe Coding</a></strong></p>
Back in May I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/1/not-vibe-coding/">Two publishers and three authors fail to understand what “vibe coding” means</a> where I called out the authors of two forthcoming books on "vibe coding" for abusing that term to refer to all forms of AI-assisted development, when <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding</a> based on the <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original Karpathy definition</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be honest: I don't feel great about that post. I made an example of those two books to push my own agenda of encouraging "vibe coding" to avoid <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/23/semantic-diffusion/">semantic diffusion</a> but it felt (and feels) a bit mean.</p>
<p>... but maybe it had an effect? I recently spotted that Addy Osmani's book "Vibe Coding: The Future of Programming" has a new title, it's now called "Beyond Vibe Coding: From Coder to AI-Era Developer".</p>
<p>This title is <strong>so much better</strong>. Setting aside my earlier opinions, this positioning as a book to help people go <em>beyond</em> vibe coding and use LLMs as part of a professional engineering practice is a really great hook!</p>
<p>From Addy's new description of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vibe coding was never meant to describe all AI-assisted coding. It's a specific approach where you don't read the AI's code before running it. There's much more to consider beyond the prototype for production systems. [...]</p>
<p>AI-assisted engineering is a more structured approach that combines the creativity of vibe coding with the rigor of traditional engineering practices. It involves specs, rigor and emphasizes collaboration between human developers and AI tools, ensuring that the final product is not only functional but also maintainable and secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Vibe-Coding-Leveraging-AI-Assisted/dp/B0F6S5425Y">lists it</a> as releasing on September 23rd. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

      YouTuber Benn Jordan has never been to Israel, but Google's AI summary said he'd visited and made a video about it. Then the backlash started.

      <h1>Google antitrust remedies</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, updated: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/3/antitrust/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/3/antitrust/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf">gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf</a></strong></p>
Here's the 230 page PDF ruling on the 2023 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Google_LLC_(2023)">United States v. Google LLC federal antitrust case</a> - the case that could have resulted in Google selling off Chrome and cutting most of Mozilla's funding.</p>
<p>I made it through the first dozen pages - it's actually quite readable.</p>
<p>It opens with a clear summary of the case so far, bold highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, this court ruled that Defendant Google LLC had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” <strong>The court found that, for more than a decade, Google had entered into distribution agreements with browser developers, original equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers to be the out-of-the box, default general search engine (“GSE”) at key search access points</strong>. These access points were the most efficient channels for distributing a GSE, and Google paid billions to lock them up. The agreements harmed competition. <strong>They prevented rivals from accumulating the queries and associated data, or scale, to effectively compete and discouraged investment and entry into the market</strong>. And they enabled Google to earn monopoly profits from its search text ads, to amass an unparalleled volume of scale to improve its search product, and to remain the default GSE without fear of being displaced. Taken together, these agreements effectively “froze” the search ecosystem, resulting in markets in which Google has “no true competitor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's an interesting generative AI twist: when the case was first argued in 2023 generative AI wasn't an influential issue, but more recently Google seem to be arguing that it is an existential threat that they need to be able to take on without additional hindrance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The emergence of GenAl changed the course of this case. No witness at the liability trial testified that GenAl products posed a near-term threat to GSEs. <strong>The very first witness at the remedies hearing, by contrast, placed GenAl front and center as a nascent competitive threat</strong>. These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among GSEs as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAlI space. Many of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies are crafted with that latter objective in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked this note about the court's challenges in issuing effective remedies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding this power, courts must approach the task of crafting remedies with a healthy dose of humility. This court has done so. It has no expertise in the business of GSEs, the buying and selling of search text ads, or the engineering of GenAl technologies. <strong>And, unlike the typical case where the court’s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge’s forte</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On to the remedies. These ones looked particularly important to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Google will be barred from entering or maintaining any exclusive contract
relating to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant,
and the Gemini app. [...]</li>
<li>Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a
contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final
judgment. Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key
assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints. [...]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess Perplexity <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3dpr0kkyz4o">won't be buying Chrome</a> then!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other
consideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google
Search, Chrome, or its GenAl products. <strong>Cutting off payments from Google
almost certainly will impose substantial —in some cases, crippling—
downstream harms to distribution partners</strong>, related markets, and consumers,
which counsels against a broad payment ban.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks like a huge sigh of relief for Mozilla, who were at risk of losing a sizable portion of their income if Google's search distribution revenue were to be cut off.

      <p>
      Problem You need safe, predictable traffic control in prod. VirtualServices + DestinationRules give version routing, timeouts/retries, and circuit breaking without touching code.
Approach Define versioned subsets in a DestinationRule. Route via VirtualService with weights (canary → rollout). Add timeout, retries, and outlier detection. Shift weights, watch metrics, then cut over. Example (Config) # vs-dr.yaml apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: svc namespace: prod spec: host: svc.prod.svc.cluster.local subsets: - name: v1 labels: version: v1 - name: v2 labels: version: v2 trafficPolicy: tls: mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL outlierDetection: consecutive5xx: 5 interval: 5s baseEjectionTime: 30s maxEjectionPercent: 50 --- apiVersion: networking.

      <p><strong><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2025/making-xml-human-readable-without-xslt/">Making XML human-readable without XSLT</a></strong></p>
In response to the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/xslt/">recent discourse</a> about XSLT support in browsers, Jake Archibald shares a new-to-me alternative trick for making an XML document readable in a browser: adding the following element near the top of the XML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  src="script.js" defer="" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>script.js</code> will then be executed by the browser, and can swap out the XML with HTML by creating new elements using the correct namespace:</p>
<pre><code>const htmlEl = document.createElementNS(
  'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml',
  'html',
);
document.documentElement.replaceWith(htmlEl);
// Now populate the new DOM
</code></pre>

Neat Python library by Darren Burns adding pixel image support to the Rich terminal library, using tricks to render an image using full or half-height colored blocks.</p>

It was created for the Mach kernel (hence the name) and introduced in NeXTSTEP, the predecessor to macOS, as a replacement for the a.out format.

      <h1>Introducing gpt-realtime</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, updated: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/1/introducing-gpt-realtime/#atom-everything">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/1/introducing-gpt-realtime/#atom-everything</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/">Introducing gpt-realtime</a></strong></p>
Released a few days ago (August 28th), <code>gpt-realtime</code> is OpenAI's new "most advanced speech-to-speech model". It looks like this is a replacement for the older <code>gpt-4o-realtime-preview</code> model that was released <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/">last October</a>.</p>
<p>This is a slightly confusing release. The previous realtime model was clearly described as a variant of GPT-4o, sharing the same October 2023 training cut-off date as that model.</p>
<p>I had expected that <code>gpt-realtime</code> might be a GPT-5 relative, but its training date is still October 2023 whereas GPT-5 is September 2024.</p>
<p><code>gpt-realtime</code> also shares the relatively low 32,000 context token and 4,096 maximum output token limits of <code>gpt-4o-realtime-preview</code>.</p>
<p>The only reference I found to GPT-5 in the documentation for the new model was a note saying "Ambiguity and conflicting instructions degrade performance, similar to GPT-5."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-models-prompting#general-usage-tips">usage tips</a> for <code>gpt-realtime</code> have a few surprises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Iterate relentlessly</strong>. Small wording changes can make or break behavior.</p>
<p>Example: Swapping “inaudible” → “unintelligible” improved noisy input handling. [...]</p>
<p><strong>Convert non-text rules to text</strong>: The model responds better to clearly written text.</p>
<p>Example: Instead of writing, "IF x &gt; 3 THEN ESCALATE", write, "IF MORE THAN THREE FAILURES THEN ESCALATE."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a whole lot more prompting tips in the new <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide">Realtime Prompting Guide</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI list several key improvements to <code>gpt-realtime</code> including the ability to configure it with a list of MCP servers, "better instruction following" and the ability to send it images.</p>
<p>My biggest confusion came from <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">the pricing page</a>, which lists separate pricing for using the Realtime API with <code>gpt-realtime</code> and GPT-4o mini. This suggests to me that the old <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview">gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview</a> model is still available, despite it no longer being listed on the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">OpenAI models page</a>.</p>
<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview</code> is a <strong>lot</strong> cheaper:</p>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The mini model also has a much longer 128,000 token context window.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Turns out that was <a href="https://twitter.com/_agamble/status/1962839472837361807">a mistake in the documentation</a>, that mini model has a 16,000 token context size.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: OpenAI's <a href="https://twitter.com/pbbakkum/status/1962901822135525695">Peter Bakkum clarifies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different voice models in API and ChatGPT, but they share some recent improvements. The voices are also different.</p>
<p>gpt-realtime has a mix of data specific enough to itself that its not really 4o or 5</p>

Cloudflare launched this dashboard <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/expanded-ai-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/">back in February</a>, incorporating traffic analysis from Cloudflare's network along with insights from their popular 1.1.1.1 DNS service.</p>
<p>I found this chart particularly interesting, showing which documented AI crawlers are most active collecting training data - lead by GPTBot, ClaudeBot and Meta-ExternalAgent:</p>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing HTTP traffic by bot over time from August 26 to September 1. HTTP traffic by bot - HTTP request trends for top five most active AI bots. Crawl purpose: Training.

X-axis shows dates: Tue, Aug 26, Wed, Aug 27, Thu, Aug 28, Fri, Aug 29, Sat, Aug 30, Sun, Aug 31, Mon, Sep 1. Top right shows Crawl purpose dropdown set to &quot;Training&quot; with X and checkmark buttons." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/http-traffic-by-bot.jpg" /></p>
<p>Cloudflare's DNS data also hints at the popularity of different services. ChatGPT holds the first place, which is unsurprising - but second place is a hotly contested race between Claude and Perplexity and #4/#5/#6 is contested by GitHub Copilot, Perplexity, and Codeium/Windsurf.</p>
<p>Google Gemini comes in 7th, though since this is DNS based I imagine this is undercounting instances of Gemini on <code>google.com</code> as opposed to <code>gemini.google.com</code>.</p>

      <h1>GSoC 2025: Profiling and Testing Math Functions on GPUs</h1>

      <p>
      <p>With the increasing importance of GPU computing, having a robust and familiar C standard library becomes a valuable asset for developers. The LLVM project is actively working to provide this foundation, as a solid libc implementation enables more complex libraries to be developed for and used on GPUs.</p><p>A key part of this effort is providing the C standard math library (LLVM-libm) on GPUs, often reusing the same target-agnostic implementations developed for CPU targets. This context creates a twofold challenge. First, there is a need to systematically <strong>verify the conformance</strong> of these implementations to standards like OpenCL. Second, it is crucial to <strong>benchmark their performance</strong> against the highly-optimized vendor libraries to understand the trade-offs involved.</p><p>This Google Summer of Code 2025 project was designed to address both challenges by developing a framework for conformance testing as well as refining and expanding the existing benchmarking infrastructure. The work provides two benefits to the LLVM community:</p><ul><li>It <strong>empowers libc contributors</strong> with a robust tool to validate their GPU math function implementations.</li><li>It <strong>builds trust with end-users</strong> by providing transparent accuracy and performance data.</li></ul><p>This report details the work completed on this project.</p><h2 id="conformance-testing">Conformance Testing</h2><p>To address the goal of accuracy verification, I implemented a C++ framework for conformance testing within the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/offload/unittests/Conformance"><code>offload/unittests/Conformance</code></a> directory. This framework was designed to be extensible, easy to use, and capable of testing various implementation providers (<code>llvm-libm</code>, <code>cuda-math</code>, <code>hip-math</code>) across different hardware platforms (AMD, NVIDIA).</p><h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3><p>The framework&rsquo;s power and simplicity come from a few key components that work together:</p><ul><li><strong><code>DeviceContext</code></strong>: A lightweight wrapper around the new Offload API that abstracts away the low-level details of device discovery, resource management, and kernel launching.</li><li><strong><code>InputGenerator</code></strong>: An extensible interface for test input generation. The framework provides two concrete implementations:<ul><li><strong><code>ExhaustiveGenerator</code></strong>: Used for functions with small input spaces (e.g., half-precision functions and single-precision univariate functions), this generator iterates over every representable point in a given space, ensuring complete coverage.</li><li><strong><code>RandomGenerator</code></strong>: Used for functions with large input spaces (e.g., single-precision bivariate and double-precision functions), this generator produces a massive, deterministic stream of random points to sample the space thoroughly.</li></ul></li><li><strong><code>GpuMathTest</code></strong>: The main test harness class that orchestrates the entire process.

The second major goal of this project was to refine and expand the existing benchmarking framework to enable fair, reproducible, and insightful performance comparisons between LLVM-libc and vendor-optimized libraries. This effort involved overcoming several subtle challenges and significantly refactoring the infrastructure.</p><h3 id="key-enhancements">Key Enhancements</h3><p>The path to reliable performance data involved a series of foundational improvements to ensure that the results are fair, statistically sound, and reproducible. Key enhancements included:</p><ul><li><strong>Reproducibility and Fairness</strong>: The initial framework was enhanced with a deterministic, per-thread random number generator (PRNG) to ensure that LLVM-libc and vendor libraries are compared using the exact same input sequences. Additionally, to prevent misleading results caused by compiler optimizations, loop unrolling was explicitly disabled in the throughput measurement loop. This change prevents the compiler from aggressively optimizing the transparent libc code in a way that isn&rsquo;t possible for vendor libraries, ensuring a true apples-to-apples comparison.</li><li><strong>Statistical Soundness</strong>: The framework&rsquo;s statistical calculations were improved. The standard deviation is now computed correctly using a sum-of-squares approach, and results from multiple GPU threads are aggregated using a statistically sound pooled mean and variance. The timing logic was also refined to subtract a baseline measurement of the empty benchmark loop, isolating the true cost of the function call.</li><li><strong>Flexible Input Generation and New Benchmarks</strong>: To support a wider range of functions, the framework was refactored with a pluggable input generation system. New distribution classes, <code>UniformExponent</code> (for values spanning orders of magnitude) and <code>UniformLinear</code> (for linear ranges), were introduced. This new flexibility enabled the addition of a comprehensive suite of benchmarks for the <code>exp</code> and <code>log</code> families.</li></ul><h3 id="more-contributions">More Contributions</h3><p>The contributions that refined and expanded the benchmarking infrastructure were submitted in the following pull requests: <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153512">#153512</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153900">#153900</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153971">#153971</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/155727">#155727</a>.</p><h3 id="performance-results">Performance Results</h3><p>As an example, see below part of the output from the <code>log</code> function benchmark on an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. It highlights interesting performance characteristics. Notice the exceptionally low and nearly constant cycles per call for NVIDIA&rsquo;s <code>__nv_logf</code>. Its IR reveals this is due to a compact <code>float</code>-only routine (a fixed sequence of FMAs plus simple bit manipulations) with Flush-To-Zero enabled and no lookup tables or divergent memory accesses.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span

<p>This website is editable!</p>

<p>If you add <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/?edit=&amp;ref=rss"><code>?edit</code></a> to any URL on this site, it activates <strong>edit mode</strong>. In this mode, you can edit text and apply basic formatting to any element.</p>

<p>Of course, you won’t be able to save changes without having write access to my files, but I can. Using the Web <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access" target="_blank"><strong>File System API</strong></a>, it can update my local copy of the website’s source code.</p>

<p>In short, I can edit my site via my site. In fact, this article was written this way!</p>

<p>It’s still rough in some cases, but the solution is usable.</p>

<h2>But why?</h2>

<p>As usual, I made this mainly for fun. But having a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor for my posts has been a long time goal ever since I <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/vanilla-web-rewrite?ref=rss" target="_blank">rewrote my site in vanilla HTML</a>.</p>

<p>After I moved away from a static site generator, the need for an extra transformational build step disappeared, allowing the raw HTML source to be directly served in the client. This unlocked a path to source editing in the client! As well as other basic&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces" target="_blank">things</a>&nbsp;for free.</p>

<p>The HTML file can now act as the editing platform, in addition to being the coding and authoring medium, and of course, the publishing medium.</p>

<p>Anyway, these things don’t really impact visitors and readers of this site. It’s more about my writing and authoring experience. Thoughts can now go directly into the page the way it’s gonna be read.</p>

<p>I already felt a bit of that improved flow when I removed the build step and added a <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/simple-live-reload?ref=rss" target="_blank">live reload script</a>, minimising the development feedback loop. With direct editing, feedback loop is instant — no more switching between the text editor and the browser! It’s been extremely valuable during the proofreading and editing phase.</p>

<h2>Content, editable</h2>

<p>Browsers support editing HTML natively via the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute. Set this attribute on any element and it becomes editable. It’s a barebones way to get a WYSIWYG editor in HTML. This is what I’m using as of time of writing.</p>

<p><code>contenteditable</code> formatting options are limited though, and browser implementations vary. Not a problem for now.</p>

<p>Whether <code>contenteditable</code> was good <a href="https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480" target="_blank">or terrible</a>&nbsp;was a minor detail in the bigger picture. The real problem was the <em>Document Object Model</em>…</p>

<h2>DOM vs source</h2>

<p>When I said no build step I kinda lied. You see, there's still an inherent compilation step that happens <em>inside the browser</em>. This step is the parsing of HTML into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" target="_blank"><strong>Document Object Model</strong></a>, or the <strong>DOM</strong>. The “DOM” essentially are the elements that you actually interact with on a webpage.</p>
<box-note>Technically, the DOM is the interface to the elements themselves. For general purposes, <em>the interface is the abstraction</em>.</box-note>
<p>The contenteditable editor edits the DOM, not the HTML source code itself. I needed to somehow save the corresponding DOM edits into the source. It was not very straightforward.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/dom.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="450" height="300">

<p>HTML to DOM conversion is one way. DOM to source HTML would be another thing. And no, <code>innerHTML</code>/<code>outerHTML</code> is not the exact inverse operation.</p>

<p>For example, simply saving <code>html.outerHTML</code> to a file won’t work, because <code>outerHTML</code> (or any DOM introspection method, for that matter) takes a snapshot of the current state of the DOM, including <em>dynamically rendered elements</em>. This would break interactive elements and custom elements in the source, as the rendered elements would incorrectly overwrite the original markup.</p>

<p>Saving the generated <code>outerHTML</code> directly would also mess up any manual formatting that I make in the source code, collapsing whitespaces and forcing HTML entities. <small>(I don’t use Prettier; it produces invalid HTML)</small></p>

<h2>Solution: source patching</h2>

<p>So I made an algorithm to patch the source according to changes made in the DOM. What it does is listen for changes in the DOM tree, and tries to identify the ‘smallest’ textual patch needed to update the source.</p>

<p>It starts with the <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver" target="_blank">MutationObserver API</a></strong>. MutationObserver lets the code respond to changes in the DOM. For each change, the API provides the relevant node(s), as well as the two surrounding unchanged siblings.</p>
<box-note>
  <details>
    <summary>Btw, the MutationObserver API has been <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1105" target="_blank">somewhat</a> <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1111" target="_blank">unwieldy</a>.</summary>

    <p>It only provides coarse details about each change, not like a detailed diff. Also, a single user interaction (say, pressing the Enter key) could cause multiple mutations to fire (the Enter key causes a &lt;p&gt; to be inserted, then a &lt;br&gt; inside the p). Some mutations also end up cancelling each other in the same callback or across multiple callbacks (e.g. span that is added and removed immediately). The exact order and amount of effects also vary by browser.</p>

    <p>My workaround was to collapse multiple mutations into one logical change per resulting subtree.</p>
  </details>
</box-note>
<p>The idea is to update the relevant part of the source without changing the rest. To do this, it finds two anchor points around the mutation. These two points must remain stable throughout the mutation in both DOM and source. Only the content between them are replaced.</p>

<p>So for each change, the steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the unchanged element before the change.
  </li><li>Find the unchanged element after the change.
  </li><li>Use their <em>positions in source</em> as boundaries.
  </li><li>Splice the source <em>between the two boundaries</em> with the updated HTML.
</li></ol>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/splice.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy">

<p>Then there’s the subproblem of mapping the position of the boundary elements in the source code. Extracting the position of any given DOM element in the source code is a bit more involved:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get the element’s ‘address’, or its path in the DOM (unique steps from the root to the element).
  </li><li>Scan the source HTML, tag by tag, keeping track of your current ‘address’ by identifying opening and closing tags.
  </li><li>Compare the current tag’s path-in-source against the element’s path-in-DOM.
  </li><li>If paths match, then the current tag corresponds to the element!
</li></ol>
<card-box>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <code>getPositionInSource</code> pseudocode
    </summary>

    <code-block>
      <pre><code>/** Gets the position of the given Element in the source code */
getPositionInSource(element: Element, source: string) {
  // Get the DOM path of the target
  domPath: Element = [];
  while (element) {
    domPath.unshift(element);
    element = element.parentElement;
  }

  let startIndex, endIndex;

  sourcePath = [];
  //                 match all HTML tags
  for (tag of source.matchAll(/&lt;\/?[a-z0-9-]+/gi)) {
    // Note: does not handle void elements and optional end tags
    if (isOpenTag(tag)) {
      sourcePath.push(tag);

      if (matchPath(domPath, sourcePath)) {
        // Source path and DOM path matches!
        // This is the target element's opening tag
        startIndex = tag.index;
      }
    } else { // is a closing tag
      if (matchPath(domPath, sourcePath)) {
        // Source path and DOM path matches!
        // This is the target element's closing tag
        endIndex = source.indexOf("&gt;", tag.index);
        return { startIndex, endIndex };
      }

      sourcePath.pop();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
    </code-block>

    <p>Handling void elements (e.g. <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>) and optional end tags (e.g. <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s with no end tags) require a bit more logic to keep the current path accurate, but the main idea remains the same.</p>
  </details>
</card-box>
<p>The main algorithm can be described as basically a contextual find-and-replace. Instead of searching for the text to be replaced, it finds the surrounding text and replaces the content in the middle.</p>

<p>This preserves the source code’s original formatting and avoids overwriting dynamic elements! Yay!</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of room for improvement. My current issue is that it’s converting nearby HTML entities to rendered versions (e.g. <code>'&amp;hellip;'</code> to <code>'…'</code>). I think I’d need to implement a more fine-grained editing within an individual text node to solve that.</p>

<p>There are probably a bunch more edges cases that I haven’t discovered, but hey it works well enough to write the text you’re reading!</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://leanrada.com/tools/edit.js" target="_blank">code for the edit mode</a> for more details! Note: This script was made specifically for myself and my site.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>The algorithm doesn’t have to be perfect; I can always fall back to editing the source if certain things don’t work. A good thing about this is that I can switch to either method any time because in the end I'm working on the same HTML file.</p>

<p>When I first imagined this solution, I thought I would only be using it to do the final edits just before publishing a post, but here I am actually writing a whole post.</p>

<p>I can now imagine a workflow where I write the main text in the browser, then go into the HTML to insert media, mark up code blocks, custom elements, and other formatting. And of course, I’d use a code editor to code the interactive sections that I enjoy adding to my posts.</p>

<p>In the future, think I’d like to add more formatting options and UI for inserting code blocks, media, lists, headings, etc. Maybe use <a href="https://quilljs.com/" target="_blank">Quill</a> or something?</p>

<p>The top thing I would love to have is inserting hyperlinks. During final passes on a post, I like to sprinkle hyperlinks on interesting terms, even if just to link the <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> entry.</p>

<p>I’ll post about any improvements I make along the way. This could be a series! I mean, it already kind of is:</p>

      <h1>Building Your Own Antenna</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2025/08/31/Building_Your_Own_Antenna.html">https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2025/08/31/Building_Your_Own_Antenna.html</a>)
      <p>
      I have been prototyping my personal news site called [Antenna](https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna) since 2023. It was inspired by Dave Winer's [news.scripting.com](https://news.scripting.com). It has always run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspberry Pi OS (Linux). The content is available over my home network and I make it public by publishing via GitHub pages. Over the last two years it has become the first place I go to consume content from the web (second is Dave's news.scripting.com).

This past month (August 2025), my prototype website lead me to write a new application I am calling [antenna](https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp) after the website that inspired it.

Having the feeds in a simple text format means I curate the feeds more. When I relied on OPML it became just enough extra work hand editing XML that I wanted something simpler. I started with a feed file format inspired by [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org). It was a little too simple, wound up writing scripts to convert that format to something more general (e.g. OPML). I decided to pick something better known for my new application. That got me thinking. Lots of people know Markdown. A collection is a list of zero or more links. That's is easy to express as Markdown. It has the advantage of being able to be convert to other formats as needed (example using a Pandoc filter to render as OPML).

What about other configuration I might need?

The Markdown community has supported Metadata for the Markdown document as "front matter" expressed in YAML. That suggested YAML has been seen by the many in in the Markdown community. YAML front matter is also documented. Why not use it for specific configuration of my collection of feeds? I can use it to express the extra fields that can be included in the channel metadata for rendering RSS 2.0 files. YAML can also serve as the configuration language for the Antenna application. Seems like a good match. I think people who work with Markdown maybe interested in generating static websites, they may have knowledge of YAML so that aligns with my applcation. ...

      <h1>Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality</h1>

      <p><strong><a href="https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/h26lykctfnsz">Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality</a></strong></p>
Notable because often when people complain of degraded model quality it turns out to be unfounded - Anthropic in the past have emphasized that they don't change the model weights after releasing them without changing the version number.</p>
<p>In this case a botched upgrade of their inference stack cause a genuine model degradation for 56.5 hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 17:30 UTC on Aug 25th to 02:00 UTC on Aug 28th, Claude Opus 4.1 experienced a degradation in quality for some requests. Users may have seen lower intelligence, malformed responses or issues with tool calling in Claude Code.</p>
<p>This was caused by a rollout of our inference stack, which we have since rolled back for Claude Opus 4.1. [...]</p>

      <h1>Writing Mac and iOS Apps Shouldn’t Be So Difficult</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html">https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>In the ’90s and early 2000s I worked for UserLand Software — <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> was founder and CEO — on a Mac app called UserLand Frontier.</p>

<p>The app was a scripting system and hash-table-oriented database that powered the early blogging and podcasting worlds. (That sounds grand, but it’s probably an understatement — but this post isn’t all about Frontier’s impact on the web, so I won’t go into details.)</p>

<p>The app was implemented in two pieces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>kernel</em>, written in C, implemented the database, networking, inter-application communication, various built-in data types, script compiler and evaluator and debugger, and so on</li>
  <li>The <em>scripts</em> used the kernel and implemented most of the actual app behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it was an app, it had plenty of UI — menus, contextual menus, buttons, larger UI components, and so on. What was brilliant was that you could, for instance, add and edit menus, and when you chose a menu command it would run your script. (Or when you clicked a toolbar button, etc.)</p>

<p>You could write an entire static blog publishing system and the UI to go with it without ever restarting the app. Click a thing, then see what happens in the app — and if it’s not right you’d edit the script, which would be automatically recompiled when called the next time.</p>

<p>In other words, there was absolutely no friction when it came to iteration. Write some code without restarting and see your changes immediately.</p>

<h3 id="how-good-was-this-really-in-practice">How good was this really in practice?</h3>

<p>You might imagine that we could do this for an hour or so before having to make changes to the kernel. Not so.</p>

<p>In fact, for the first three years I was there (might have been longer), I never even <em>saw</em> the kernel code. I worked all day every day as a professional developer at the script level, never having to restart the app. Just iterating like this all day long.</p>

<p>You might also imagine that the app was sluggish and slow since much of it was scripts instead of C code. It wasn’t! Scripts could be slow for the same reasons any code could be slow (I/O, of course, and algorithms and data structures not suited to the problem at hand) — but the app never felt slow.</p>

<p>I’ll remind you of the timing: <em>this was the ’90s.</em> We worked this way for real, and we were amazingly productive.</p>

<p>A scripting language plus key bits implemented in C was more than fast enough for an app. Even all those years ago.</p>

<h3 id="a-scripting-language-built-for-productivity">A scripting language built for productivity</h3>

<p>I’m not writing this article to praise Frontier — I’m talking about it to make a point, which I’ll get to.</p>

<p>But I wanted to bring up a second aspect to this: it’s not just frictionless iteration that was so great, it was also the scripting language and environment.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of this was how easy persistence was. I mentioned the hash-table-based database. Hash tables could contain hash tables (Swift developers: picture a Dictionary inside a Dictionary, and so on).</p>

<p>(We just called them tables for short — but remember that these are hash tables, not tables in a SQL database.)</p>

<p>In any script, at any time, without any ceremony, you could read and write from the database simply using dot notation: <code>user.prefs.city = "Seattle"</code> would set the value of <code>city</code> in the <code>prefs</code> table which was contained by the <code>user</code> table. This value would persist between runs of the app, because it was stored in the database.</p>

<p>(You could also pass around addresses of things too — it was quite common to pass the address of a table to another script, so that the other script wouldn’t need to hardcode a location.)</p>

<p>It was utterly automatic. And it meant that while we did have to choose where in the database to store things, and how to structure our storage, we didn’t have to choose a storage mechanism. It was the database.</p>

<p>(Note: of course we could read and write files, and did so when necessary. But the point is that the database handled almost all our persistence and in a super-easy way.)</p>

<p>(Also note: the database had a UI. It was visible and browsable. You could and often did hand-edit it. Even the scripts lived in the database, and were addressable via dot notation, like everything else.)</p>

<h3 id="we-had-nice-things">We had nice things!</h3>

<p>I’ll say again — this was in the ’90s, more than 25 years ago, and it was a great way of working on an app.</p>

<p>I’m not saying apps these days need to be Frontier-like in any details. But it seems absolutely bizarre to me that we — we who write Mac and iOS apps — still have to build and run the app, make changes, build and run the app, and so on, all day long. In the year 2025.</p>

<p>And it seems retro in the worst way that we’re still using anything other than a scripting language for most of our code. We should be using something simple and light that can configure toolbars, handle networking callbacks, query databases, manage views, and so on. And maybe with a DSL for SwiftUI-like declarative UI.</p>

<p>Almost none of that code needs to be in a lower-level language like Swift or Objective-C. It really doesn’t. (I say this as a performance junkie!)</p>

<p>It could be in Ruby, Lua, Python, or JavaScript. Better still would be a new language invented specifically for the problem of writing apps, something designed to make the common challenges of app writing easier.</p>

<p>We did have this stuff decades ago. Not for app making in general, sure — but now it’s 25 years later, and a company like Apple could make this real for all its app makers.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why things are the way they are right now, and you can point to a string of good decisions. No doubt.</p>

<p>But we can think outside of what we have now and ask: what would make app writing easier? What would make it a better experience? How could we get more done for our users with fewer bugs and faster turnaround?</p>

<p>I’m not saying that Frontier’s specific choices are the answer — I’m saying that the combination of frictionless iteration plus a purpose-built scripting language was extremely powerful, and we could use those things now.</p>

<p>And at some point I suspect these things are going to be table stakes for any platform that wants to attract developers. If you were a new developer right now, would you pick Xcode’s build-and-run, edit, build-and-run, edit — plus the growing complexity of Swift — over something like Electron and JavaScript?</p>

<h3 id="random-notes">Random notes</h3>

<p>Yes, I know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC">PyObjc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyCocoa">RubyCocoa</a>. Without first-class support in Apple’s developer tools, these were never going to work as popular alternatives.</p>

<p>I also know about (and use) Swift playgrounds and SwiftUI previews. Neither of these are as satisfying to use as I’d like, and neither of these are nearly as great as frictionless iteration in the actual app.</p>

<p>I also remember Xcode fix-and-continue, which didn’t work well enough to solve the problem of frictionless iteration.</p>

<p>Anyway… One more thing about Frontier: we had a system where people could get updates to the app automatically via the web. Those updates were just serialized versions of scripts at various database locations, which would get unpacked and stored in each user’s database. (Those who opted-in, of course.) The app would not have to be restarted to get bug fixes and new features! And of course the updates were very small, since they didn’t include the entire app. This seems so futuristic, but we had this in 1999. Why couldn’t we have this now?</p>

      <p>
      How you engage with the world changes how you experience the world, and how the world experiences you.
A snarky and cynical approach, by its default assumption that things are shit, or if they are not yet shit will inevitably turn to; such an approach will give your world a malodorous brownish tint.
Granted, snark gives you plausible deniability, a motte-and-bailey that protects you from direct criticism, encountering backlash you can always backpedal and say it was just a joke that you accidentally took a bit too far.

      Matt Massicotte (Mastodon): So, no doubt there&#8217;s lots of historical stuff going on here.But, that still doesn&#8217;t explain how much trouble people have with ModelActor. I&#8217;m not sure anyone has ever used ModelActor without at least some surprises.[&#8230;]Actors exist to protect mutable state. The purpose of a ModelActor is to own and isolate the ModelContext.

      Howard Oakley: App extensions or appexes perform a wide range of tasks, from providing support for file systems like ExFAT to generating thumbnails for QuickLook and enabling Spotlight to index the contents of files. Although they&#8217;re relatively old, macOS made major changes in their management in Ventura, and they&#8217;ve become popular in many third-party apps. [&#8230;]

      Choosing the right LLM has become a full-time job. New models appear almost daily, each offering different capabilities, prices, and quirks, from reasoning strengths to cost efficiency to code generation. This competition creates strong incentives for AI labs to carve out a niche and gives new startups room to emerge, resulting in a fragmented landscape [&#8230;]

      <h1>Tough Season in the Apple Fields</h1>

      <p>
      <p>
<p>We’re adopting Liquid Glass for NetNewsWire 7, which we’ll release some time after the new versions of macOS and iOS come out.</p>

<p>Stuart Breckenridge has been doing great work on getting this done — and he’s written up a couple blog posts (with screenshots!) on his progress. See:</p>

<p><a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-ii-netnewswire-mac/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part II (NetNewsWire Mac)</a><br />
<a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-iii-netnewswire-ios/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part III (NetNewsWire iOS)</a></p>

<p>Since the app is made with mostly stock Apple UI, you might think that using Liquid Glass would be very little work, that it might be pretty automatic or just a matter of checking a few boxes. But that’s not true this year: it’s been a fair amount of work.</p>

<p>Other apps, apps with more custom UI, will probably have even more work, but even for us it’s been more than a bit.</p>

<p>And we’re not done. There will be little things (hopefully just little things) still to do before shipping. Including verifying that it all works as expected on the actual OS releases.</p>

<p>But all credit to Stuart, who got right on this and did a superb job.</p>

<p>(Note: if you want to see the code, you can: it’s on our <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/tree/experimental/liquid-glass">experimental/liquid-glass branch</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="but-my-mac">But My Mac</h3>

<p>As pleased as I am with Stuart’s work, I’m not pleased with Liquid Glass itself.</p>

<p>I don’t really care about it on iOS/iPadOS, because whatever. I don’t love those devices. I love Macs because it’s on Macs where you can set out to make new things that change the world.</p>

<p>(Okay. Fine. On iPhones and iPads you <em>can</em>, I guess, but generally it’s much harder, and it has to be an approved activity using an approved app. And one thing you definitely can’t do on those devices is create apps. [All apologies to people who do manage to edit their podcast episodes on an iPad or write at length on an iPhone. Cool! But I hope that even those folks will grant me my point.])</p>

<p>And so I seriously dislike the experience of using a Mac with Liquid Glass. The UI has become the star, but the drunken star, blurry, illegible, and physically unstable. It makes making things way more of a struggle than it used to be.</p>

<p>We had pretty good Mac UI, but Apple took the bad parts of it — the translucency and blurriness already there — and dialed it way up and called it content-centric. But it seems to me the opposite. Liquid Glass is Liquid-Glass-centric.</p>

<h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>

<p>First thing: I have many friends at Apple and I didn’t want to write any of this. And there are legions of engineers and designers who I don’t know but whose work I respect greatly. It’s not their fault that this is the direction of the UI.</p>

<p>And this is not the first time we’re going through a rough patch with Apple. I think of them as seasons — we had, for instance, terrible-keyboard season not so long ago. We were wondering if Apple would just stop making Macs altogether. But then that passed and we even got these wonderful Apple Silicon machines. Seasons end.</p>

<p>And we’re in a tough season with Swift these days too. It’s gotten so complex and difficult that I find myself daydreaming about going back to Objective-C. Objective-C is definitely funny-looking, but once you get past that it’s actually small and simple.</p>

<p>But with <a href="https://www.donnywals.com/what-is-approachable-concurrency-in-xcode-26/">Swift approachable concurrency</a> and other changes I can see eventually getting through this season and to a pretty great place, so I’m optimistic.</p>

<p>Seasons do end, in other words, or mostly seem to end (though not the App Store monopoly season, not so far), and I’ve resolved to just wait for Liquid Glass’s replacement. Perhaps along the way it will get refined enough so that people like me can use it without eye strain.</p>

<h3 id="better-perspective">Better Perspective</h3>

<p>But far, far worse than any of the above is Tim Cook’s gold statue presented to the President. And everything that went along with that. I felt utterly sick and I bet you did too. (And it made me seriously wonder if I wanted to continue writing apps for Apple platforms.)</p>

<p>I understand John Gruber’s argument in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">Gold, Frankincense, and Silicon</a> that maybe Cook’s move was the best possible move in a terribly corrupted system.</p>

<p>But what’s the use of being so rich and so powerful, I would ask Tim Cook, if you, even more than regular people, have to debase yourself before the dictator?</p>

<p>It’s tempting to think that our current government is just a season, like the bad keyboards or like Liquid Glass will eventually prove to be. Wait till the mid-terms or the next presidential election, you might think.</p>

<p>But there’s no reason to think that this authoritarian turn is just a season. Something besides just wishing and waiting for better is required.</p>

      Juli Clover: Apple today provided developers with the eighth betas of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 for testing purposes, with the updates coming a week after Apple seeded the seventh betas. The release notes don&#8217;t call out any changes since beta 5. Steve Troughton-Smith: Historically, since iOS 13, beta 8 has been the last beta [&#8230;]

      <h1>Firing Junior Developers Is Indeed the “Dumbest Thing”</h1>

      <p>
      Matt Garman’s statement that firing junior developers because AI can do their work is the “dumbest thing I’ve ever heard” has almost achieved meme status. I’ve seen it quoted everywhere. We agree. It’s a point we’ve made many times over the past few years. If we eliminate junior developers, where will the seniors come from? [&#8230;]

      <p>I have a friend with whom I like to go travelling on a bicycle. We usually go for a couple of weeks, and we&rsquo;ve been doing it regularly over the past five years. We&rsquo;ve cycled in France and England so far. Both countries have many affordable campsites, and there&rsquo;s always a decent hotel/Airbnb not too far for when it&rsquo;s raining.</p>

<p>But this year we travelled through Switzerland, which is prohibitively expensive, and somewhat lacking in terms of places to camp. We were aware of <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers</a> and decided to give it a try. It was fantastic, and opened our eyes on what travelling and <a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/connect/">connecting</a> with people can be like. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever travel like we used to anymore.</p>

      Bluesky’s decision to drop out of the Mississippi market, while understandable, is a clear sign that we cannot take our digital access for granted.

      <h1>Permacomputing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-23, from: <a href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/08/23/permacomputing/">https://inkdroid.org/2025/08/23/permacomputing/</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
I enjoyed listening to this talk by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Rabbits">Devine Lu
Linvega</a> about the nomad life and the principles of <a
href="https://permacomputing.net/">Permacomputing</a> while I was on a
walk, and then watching it later when I was at home for the visuals.
</p>
<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNYxAdjl1f0?si=EKH2ejbDFNkZy-uP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
One of the things that I found myself thinking about when listening was
the somewhat unstated principle of <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/tag/practice/">Practice</a>, which 100
Rabbits work exemplifies so well. Watching the video afterwards then
drove this point home, because of the artistry that went into the
slides. There are certainly technical aspects to sustainable computing,
but culture, shared values, and techniques are just, or perhaps even
more, important.
</p>
<p>
I think a written version of the talk will get published over at <a
href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100r.co</a> at some point but I
wanted to jot down some of my own notes.
</p>
<p>
Permacomputing practice includes work along a continuum, where each step
is further away from a resource rich environment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Frugal (being careful about the resources that you use)
</li>
<li>
Salvage (limited to what is already produced)
</li>
<li>
Collapse (utilizing what has survived collapse of infrastructure).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is a technological bent to a lot of permacomputing practice
(computing is in the name after all). But there is no need for it to be
exclusively related to tech. It involves an engagement with community,
and is fundamentally about “exploring the value of absence”. Finding
where technologies don’t have a strengthening effect on the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Devine sees three aspects of permacomputing design:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Design for Disassembly: encourages repair by allowing a product to be
taken apart and for users to discover how to repair it.
</li>
<li>
Design for Encapsulation: be able to replicate the environment of a
product: code and data can be migrated and/or emulated. Docker, JVM,
[UXN], as examples of this thinking.
</li>
<li>
Design for Descent: designing for degradation, failures of internet,
energy, etc (resilience).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilience itself is a deep area of practice that includes: - agility -
preparedness - elasticity - redundancy
</p>
<p>
Devine notes that permacomputing sort of fits within a longer trajectory
of digital preservation work, and mentions some previous projects: PADI,
Cedar, CAMiLEON, Domesday Project. These projects were well funded, did
good work, but are now largely defunct, with only some scraps of
information remaining in the Wayback Machine.
</p>
<p>
This reminded me of my own experience with digital preservation grant
funding, and how paradoxically it is at odds with the goals of
sustainability and preservation. Even when granting organizations
require a plan for a sustainability plan, the types of activities and
practices that are born into a resource rich environment can be
difficult to sustain, unless they participate in some way with resource
extraction. The discipline of doing work on a boat, as a nomad, (or some
equivalent frugality) helps to shape sustainable computing practice.
</p>
<p>
Another aspect is the importance of piracy to digital preservation or
that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from
Preservation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This reminded me of Abigail De Kosnik’s book <a
href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4087/Rogue-ArchivesDigital-Cultural-Memory-and-Media">Rogue
Archives: Digital Cultural Memory and Media Fandom</a>. I think the in
built community, frugality, and decentralization of a sharing economy is
often overlooked as a key to digital preservation and its something that
permacomputing really stresses.
</p>
<p>
There is also the idea of aligning engineering with primitives from the
natural world, e.g. the mathematics behind the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">Arecibo Message</a>
which were designed to translate across species and planetary
ecosystems. Whether it achieved that or not is hard to say, but the goal
of reaching for computational primitives that could be rediscovered is
an interesting angle. I think it’s very important for data preservation
standards. I feel like this sort of minimalist thinking lay behind the
design of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">BagIt</a>, which
aimed to allow data to be moved through time and space, without the loss
of data and context.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately permacomputing is about “exploring the boundaries
<em>between</em> suffocating minimalism and unsustainable maximalism”.
It’s an invitation to slow down, and participate and learn to control
the tools so they don’t control us. Where does your work sit along that
continuum?

      As an acquisitions editor at O&#8217;Reilly, I spend considerable time tracking our authors&#8217; digital footprints. Their social media posts, speaking engagements, and online thought leadership don&#8217;t just reflect expertise—they directly impact book sales and reveal promotional strategies worth replicating. Not surprisingly, some of our best-selling authors are social media mavens whose posting output is staggering. [&#8230;]

      <p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my career working in New York City. Every morning, I&rsquo;d walk past those towering skyscrapers, genuinely amazed at what humans can build together. The engineering, the coordination, the trust required. It&rsquo;s breathtaking.</p>
<p>What fascinates me most is the foundation. While everyone admires the gleaming towers, I think about the engineers who spent months planning what goes sixty feet underground. That invisible work makes everything else possible. No Instagram posts about foundation concrete. No TED talk talks about rebar placement.</p>

      <h1>GHC 9.14.1-alpha1 is now available</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/blog/20250819-ghc-9.14.1-alpha1-released.html">http://haskell.org/ghc/blog/20250819-ghc-9.14.1-alpha1-released.html</a>)
      <p>
      <h1>GHC 9.14.1-alpha1 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">bgamari - 2025-08-19</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
first alpha prerelease of GHC 9.14.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-alpha1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>GHC 9.14 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Significant improvements in specialisation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma now allows use of type application syntax</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
as well as type arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of
<code>newtype</code>s</p></li>
<li><p>the specialiser is now able to produce specialisations with
polymorphic typeclass constraints, considerably broadening its scope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Significant improvements in the GHCi debugger</p></li>
<li><p>Record fields can be defined to be non-linear when LinearTypes is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>RequiredTypeArgments can now be used in more contexts</p></li>
<li><p>SSE/AVX support in the x86 native code generator backend</p></li>
<li><p>A major update of the Windows toolchain</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-alpha1/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html">release notes</a>. Given the
many specialisation improvements and their potential for regression, we would
very much appreciate testing and performance characterisation on downstream
workloads.</p>
<p>Due to unexpected complications, this initial prerelease comes a bit later than
expected. Consequently, we expect to have three condensed alphas prior to the
release candidate, in contrast to the scheduled three. We expect the next alpha
will come the week of 9 Sept. 2025, while the third will come 23 Sept. 2025,
with the release candidate coming 7 Oct. 2025.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Mercury, Channable, Tweag I/O, Serokell, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/homepage/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>
