Welcome back! In our last update, we had exciting news - it’s now
possible to flash a PureOS Crimson image to your Librem 5.
</p>
<p>
That’s a large step toward our first milestone. Now, we need essential
functionality. The goal of the first milestone is to enable broad
testing of applications by the community, and essential functionality
has to work in order to get good feedback about applications.

For a phone, sound is about as essential as it gets.

My <code>files-to-prompt</code> tool
(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/">originally
built using Claude 3 Opus back in April</a>) had been accumulating a
bunch of issues and PRs - I finally got around to spending some time
with it and pushed a fresh release:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>

output. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/danclaytondev">Dan

</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I use this tool myself on an almost daily basis - it’s fantastic for
quickly answering questions about code. Recently I’ve been plugging it
into Gemini 2.0 with its 2 million token context length, running recipes
like this one:
</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py
cd componentize-py
files-to-prompt . -c | llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \
  -s 'How does this work? Does it include a python compiler or AST trick of some sort?'
</code></pre>
<p>
I ran that question against the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py">bytecodealliance/componentize-py</a>
repo - which provides a tool for turning Python code into compiled WASM
- and got
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a9d72e7f903417fb49e1d7a531ee8f97">this
really useful answer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s another example. I decided to have o3-mini review how Datasette
handles concurrent SQLite connections from async Python code - so I ran
this:
</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/simonw/datasette
cd datasette/datasette
files-to-prompt database.py utils/__init__.py -c | \
  llm -m o3-mini -o reasoning_effort high \
  -s 'Output in markdown a detailed analysis of how this code handles the challenge of running SQLite queries from a Python asyncio application. Explain how it works in the first section, then explore the pros and cons of this design. In a final section propose alternative mechanisms that might work better.'
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/76c8c433f4a65cf01a5c9121453683ab">the
result</a>. It did an extremely good job of explaining how my code works
- despite being fed just the Python and none of the other documentation.
Then it made some solid recommendations for potential alternatives.
</p>
<p>
I added a couple of follow-up questions (using <code>llm -c</code>)
which resulted in
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/76c8c433f4a65cf01a5c9121453683ab?permalink_comment_id=5438685#gistcomment-5438685">a
full working prototype</a> of an alternative threadpool mechanism, plus
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/76c8c433f4a65cf01a5c9121453683ab?permalink_comment_id=5438691#gistcomment-5438691">some
benchmarks</a>.
</p>
<p>
One final example: I decided to see if there were any undocumented
features in <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>, so I
checked out the repo and ran a prompt against just the <code>.go</code>
files in that project:
</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream
cd litestream
files-to-prompt . -e go -c | llm -m o3-mini \
  -s 'Write extensive user documentation for this project in markdown'
</code></pre>
<p>
<p>Once again, o3-mini provided a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cbf339032f99fee72af5fd5455bc7235">really
impressively detailed</a> set of unofficial documentation derived purely
from reading the source.</p>

your PATH</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, updated: 2025-02-14, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/02/13/how-to-add-a-directory-to-your-path/">How
to add a directory to your PATH</a></strong>
</p>
<em>Classic</em> Julia Evans piece here, answering a question which you
might assume is obvious but very much isn’t.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of useful tips in here, plus the best explanation I’ve ever seen
of the three different Bash configuration options:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bash has three possible config files: <code>~/.bashrc</code>,
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I’d recommend
testing this way:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
add <code>echo hi there</code> to your <code>~/.bashrc</code>
</li>
<li>
Restart your terminal
</li>
<li>
If you see “hi there”, that means <code>~/.bashrc</code> is being used!
Hooray!
</li>
<li>
Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>
</li>
<li>
You can also try <code>~/.profile</code> if the first two options don’t
work.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
This article also reminded me to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/15/path-tips-on-wizard-zines/">try
which -a again</a>, which gave me this confusing result for
<code>datasette</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>% which -a datasette
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/datasette
/Users/simon/.local/bin/datasette
/Users/simon/.local/bin/datasette
</code></pre>
<p>
Why is the second path in there twice? I figured out how to use
<code>rg</code> to search just the dot-files in my home directory:
</p>
<pre><code>rg local/bin -g '/.*' --max-depth 1
</code></pre>
<p>
And found that I have both a <code>.zshrc</code> and
<code>.zprofile</code> file that are adding that to my path:
</p>
<pre><code>.zshrc.backup
4:export PATH="$PATH:/Users/simon/.local/bin"

.zprofile
5:export PATH="$PATH:/Users/simon/.local/bin"

.zshrc
7:export PATH="$PATH:/Users/simon/.local/bin"

The link below holds the slides from a talk I gave last year for the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s annual tech conference. They are mostly
self-explanatory, with the possible exception of the “attractive
nuisance” slide, for which I explained how a small package with good
intentions can accumulate both a large set of dependents and a large set
of dependencies, turning it into a vector for bloat and malfeasance.

<h2 id="shot-scraper-1.6-with-support-for-http-archives">shot-scraper
1.6 with support for HTTP Archives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, updated: 2025-02-13, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.6">shot-scraper
1.6 with support for HTTP Archives</a></strong>
</p>
New release of my
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> CLI tool
for taking screenshots and scraping web pages.
</p>
<p>
The big new feature is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)">HTTP Archive
(HAR)</a> support. The new
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/har.html">shot-scraper
har command</a> can now create an archive of a page and all of its
dependents like this:
</p>
<pre><code>shot-scraper har https://datasette.io/
</code></pre>
<p>
This produces a <code>datasette-io.har</code> file (currently 163KB)
which is JSON representing the full set of requests used to render that
page. Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b1fdf434e460814efdb89c95c354f794">a
copy of that file</a>. You can visualize that
<a href="https://ericduran.github.io/chromeHAR/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/b1fdf434e460814efdb89c95c354f794/raw/924c1eb12b940ff02cefa2cc068f23c9d3cc5895/datasette.har.json">here
using ericduran.github.io/chromeHAR</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The HAR viewer shows a line for each of the loaded resources, with options to view timing information" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/har-viewer.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
That JSON includes full copies of all of the responses, base64 encoded
if they are binary files such as images.
</p>
<p>
You can add the <code>–zip</code> flag to instead get a
<code>datasette-io.har.zip</code> file, containing JSON data in
<code>har.har</code> but with the response bodies saved as separate
files in that archive.
</p>
<p>
The <code>shot-scraper multi</code> command lets you run
<code>shot-scraper</code> against multiple URLs in sequence, specified
using a YAML file. That command now takes a <code>–har</code> option (or
<code>–har-zip</code> or <code>–har-file name-of-file)</code>,
<a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/multi.html#recording-to-an-http-archive">described
in the documentation</a>, which will produce a HAR at the same time as
taking the screenshots.
</p>
<p>
Shots are usually defined in YAML that looks like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml">
<pre>- <span class="pl-ent">output</span>: <span class="pl-s">example.com.png</span>
  <span class="pl-ent">url</span>: <span class="pl-s">http://www.example.com/</span>
- <span class="pl-ent">output</span>: <span class="pl-s">w3c.org.png</span>
  <span class="pl-ent">url</span>: <span class="pl-s">https://www.w3.org/</span></pre>
</div>
<p>
You can now omit the <code>output:</code> keys and generate a HAR file
without taking any screenshots at all:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml">
<pre>- <span class="pl-ent">url</span>: <span class="pl-s">http://www.example.com/</span>
- <span class="pl-ent">url</span>: <span class="pl-s">https://www.w3.org/</span></pre>
</div>
<p>
Run like this:
</p>
<pre><code>shot-scraper multi shots.yml --har
</code></pre>
<p>
Which outputs:
</p>
<pre><code>Skipping screenshot of 'https://www.example.com/'
Skipping screenshot of 'https://www.w3.org/'
Wrote to HAR file: trace.har
</code></pre>
<p>
<p><code>shot-scraper</code> is built on top of Playwright, and the new
features use the
<a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/next/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-record-har-path">browser.new_context(record_har_path=…)</a>
parameter.</p>

<strong><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20250212">python-build-standalone

</p>
Exciting news
<a href="https://twitter.com/charliermarsh/status/1889837406322565305">from
Charlie Marsh</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We just shipped the latest Python 3.14 alpha (3.14.0a5) to uv and
python-build-standalone. This is the first release that includes the
tail-calling interpreter.
</p>
<p>
Our initial benchmarks show a ~20-30% performance improvement across
CPython.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an optimization that was first discussed
<a href="https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/642">in
faster-cpython</a> in January 2024, then landed earlier this month
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128563">by Ken Jin</a>
and included in the 3.14a05 release. The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call">alpha
release notes</a> say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A new type of interpreter based on tail calls has been added to CPython.
For certain newer compilers, this interpreter provides significantly
better performance. Preliminary numbers on our machines suggest anywhere
from -3% to 30% faster Python code, and a geometric mean of 9-15% faster
on pyperformance depending on platform and architecture. The baseline is
Python 3.14 built with Clang 19 without this new interpreter.
</p>
<p>
This interpreter currently only works with Clang 19 and newer on x86-64
and AArch64 architectures. However, we expect that a future release of
GCC will support this as well.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Including this in
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone</a>
means it’s now trivial to try out via
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>. I upgraded to the
latest <code>uv</code> like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>pip install -U uv</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then ran <code>uv python list</code> to see the available versions:
</p>
<pre><code>cpython-3.14.0a5+freethreaded-macos-aarch64-none    &lt;download available&gt;
cpython-3.14.0a5-macos-aarch64-none                 &lt;download available&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>
I downloaded the new alpha like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv python install cpython-3.14.0a5</pre>
</div>
<p>
And tried it out like so:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run --python 3.14.0a5 python</pre>
</div>
<p>
The Astral team have been using Ken’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Fidget-Spinner/e7bf204bf605680b0fc1540fe3777acf">bm_pystones.py</a>
benchmarks script. I grabbed a copy like this:

</div>
<p>
And ran it with <code>uv</code>:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run --python 3.14.0a5 bm_pystones.py</pre>
</div>
<p>
Giving:
</p>
<pre><code>Pystone(1.1) time for 50000 passes = 0.0511138

</code></pre>
<p>
Inspired by Charlie’s
<a href="https://twitter.com/charliermarsh/status/1889837406322565305">example</a>
I decided to try the
<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a>
benchmarking tool, which can run multiple commands to statistically
compare their performance. I came up with this recipe:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>brew install hyperfine
hyperfine <span class="pl-cce">\ </span>                           
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>uv run --python 3.14.0a5 bm_pystones.py<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>uv run --python 3.13 bm_pystones.py<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  -n tail-calling \
  -n baseline \
  --warmup 10</pre>
</div>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/hyperfine-uv.jpg" alt="Running that command produced: Benchmark 1: tail-calling   Time (mean ± σ):      71.5 ms ±   0.9 ms    [User: 65.3 ms, System: 5.0 ms]   Range (min … max):    69.7 ms …  73.1 ms    40 runs   Benchmark 2: baseline   Time (mean ± σ):      79.7 ms ±   0.9 ms    [User: 73.9 ms, System: 4.5 ms]   Range (min … max):    78.5 ms …  82.3 ms    36 runs   Summary   tail-calling ran     1.12 ± 0.02 times faster than baseline" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
<p>So 3.14.0a5 scored 1.12 times faster than 3.13 on the benchmark (on
my extremely overloaded M2 MacBook Pro).</p>

bug</a> in <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, using
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite">Datasette Lite</a>. I
figure it’s a good opportunity to highlight how useful it is to have a
URL-addressable Python environment, powered by Pyodide and WebAssembly.

Datasette Lite
</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/">Datasette Lite</a> is a version of
<a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> that runs entirely in your
browser. It runs on <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a>, which I
think is still the most underappreciated project in the Python
ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
I built Datasette Lite
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/">almost
three years ago</a> as a weekend hack project to try and see if I could
get Datasette - a server-side Python web application - to run entirely
in the browser.
</p>
<p>
I’ve added a bunch of features since then,
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/blob/main/README.md">described
in the README</a> - most significantly the ability to load SQLite
databases, CSV files, JSON files or Parquet files by passing a URL to a
query string parameter.
</p>
<p>
I built Datasette Lite almost as a joke, thinking nobody would want to
wait for a full Python interpreter to download to their browser each
time they wanted to explore some data. It turns out internet connections
are fast these days and having a version of Datasette that needs a
browser, GitHub Pages and <em>nothing else</em> is actually extremely
useful.
</p>

<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database">this
Excel sheet</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The NSF grants that Ted Cruz has singled out for advancing “neo-Marxist
class warfare propaganda,” in Datasette-Lite:
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://data-house-lake.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/cruz_nhs.db#/cruz_nhs/grants">lite.datasette.io?url=https://…</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Let’s look at that URL in full:
</p>
<p>
<code>https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://data-house-lake.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/cruz_nhs.db#/cruz_nhs/grants</code>
</p>
<p>
The <code>?url=</code> parameter there poins to a SQLite database file,
hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces and served with the all-important
<code>access-control-allow-origin: *</code> header which allows
Datasette Lite to load it across domains.
</p>
<p>
The <code>#/cruz_nhs/grants</code> part of the URL tells Datasette Lite
which page to load when you visit the link.
</p>
<p>
Anything after the <code>#</code> in Datasette Lite is a URL that gets
passed on to the WebAssembly-hosted Datasette instance. Any query string
items before that can be used to affect the initial state of the
Datasette instance, to import data or even to install additional
plugins.
</p>
<h4 id="the-datasette-1-0-alphas">
The Datasette 1.0 alphas
</h4>
<p>
I’ve shipped <em>a lot</em> of Datasette alphas - the most recent is
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a17-2025-02-06">Datasette
1.0a17</a>. Those alphas get published to
<a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, which means they can be installed
using <code>pip install datasette==1.0a17</code>.
</p>
<p>
A while back
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/issues/75">I added the
same ability</a> to Datasette Lite itself. You can now pass
<code>&amp;ref=1.0a17</code> to the Datasette Lite URL to load that
specific version of Datasette.
</p>
<p>
This works thanks to the magic of Pyodide’s
<a href="https://micropip.pyodide.org/">micropip</a> mechanism. Every
time you load Datasette Lite in your browser it’s actually using
<code>micropip</code> to install the packages it needs directly from
PyPI. The code looks something like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-js">

</p>
<p>
That <code>settings</code> object has been passed to the Web Worker that
loads Datasette, incorporating various query string parameters.
</p>
<p>
This all means I can pass <code>?ref=1.0a17</code> to Datasette Lite to
load a specific version, or <code>?ref=pre</code> to get the most
recently released pre-release version.
</p>
<h4 id="this-works-for-plugins-too">
This works for plugins, too
</h4>
<p>
Since loading extra packages from PyPI via <code>micropip</code> is so
easy, I went a step further and added plugin support.
</p>
<p>
The <code>?install=</code> parameter can be passed multiple times, each
time specifying a Datasette plugin from PyPI that should be installed
into the browser.
</p>
<p>
The README includes
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-plugins">a
bunch of examples</a> of this mechanism in action. Here’s a fun one
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-mp3-audio&amp;csv=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/0a30d52feeb3ff60f7d8636b0bde296b/raw/c078a9e5a0151331e2e46c04c1ebe7edc9f45e8c/scotrail-announcements.csv#/data/scotrail-announcements">that
loads datasette-mp3-audio</a> to provide inline MP3 playing widgets,
originally created for my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/21/scotrail/">ScotRail audio
announcements</a> project.
</p>
<p>
This only works for some plugins. They need to be pure Python wheels -
getting plugins with compiled binary dependencies to work in Pyodide
WebAssembly requires a whole set of steps that I haven’t quite figured
out.
</p>
<p>
Frustratingly, it doesn’t work for plugins that run their own JavaScript
yet! I may need to rearchitect significant chunks of both Datasette and
Datasette Lite to make that work.
</p>
<p>
It’s also worth noting that this is a remote code execution security
hole. I don’t think that’s a problem here, because
<code>lite.datasette.io</code> is deliberately hosted on the subdomain
of a domain that I <em>never</em> intend to use cookies on. It’s
possible to vandalize the visual display of
<code>lite.datasette.io</code> but it shouldn’t be possible to steal any
private data or do any lasting damage.
</p>
<h4 id="datasette-visible-internal-db">
datasette-visible-internal-db
</h4>
<p>
This evening’s debugging exercise used a plugin called
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/datasette-visible-internal-db/">datasette-visible-internal-db</a>.
</p>
<p>
Datasette’s
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#datasette-s-internal-database">internal
database</a> is an invisible SQLite database that sits at the heart of
Datasette, tracking things like loaded metadata and the schemas of the
currently attached tables.
</p>
<p>
Being invisible means we can use it for features that shouldn’t be
visible to users - plugins that record API secrets or permissions or
track comments or data import progress, for example.
</p>
<p>
In Python code it’s accessed like this:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-s1">internal_db</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_internal_database</span>()</pre>
<p>
As opposed to Datasette’s other databases which are accessed like so:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-s1">db</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_database</span>(<span class="pl-s">"my-database"</span>)</pre>
<p>
Sometimes, when hacking on Datasette, it’s useful to be able to browse
the internal database using the default Datasette UI.
</p>
<p>
That’s what <code>datasette-visible-internal-db</code> does. The plugin
implementation is
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-visible-internal-db/blob/759e7001f91d3076d9f42eddb03fbaf6d1c7b9bb/datasette_visible_internal_db.py">just
five lines of code</a>:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>

<span class="pl-en">@<span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>.<span class="pl-c1">hookimpl</span></span>
<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">startup</span>(<span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>):
    <span class="pl-s1">db</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_internal_database</span>()
    <span class="pl-s1">datasette</span>.<span class="pl-c1">add_database</span>(<span class="pl-s1">db</span>, <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"_internal"</span>, <span class="pl-s1">route</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"_internal"</span>)</pre>
<p>
On startup the plugin grabs a reference to that internal database and
then registers it using Datasette’s
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#add-database-db-name-none-route-none">add_database()
method</a>. That’s all it takes to have it show up as a visible database
on the <code>/_internal</code> path within Datasette.
</p>
<h4 id="spotting-the-bug">
Spotting the bug
</h4>
<p>
I was poking around with this today out of pure curiosity - I hadn’t
tried <code>?install=datasette-visible-internal-db</code> with Datasette
Lite before and I wanted to see if it worked.
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name">that
URL from earlier</a>, this time with commentary:
</p>
<pre><code>https://lite.datasette.io/ // Datasette Lite
  ?install=datasette-visible-internal-db // Install the visible internal DB plugin
  &amp;ref=1.0a17 // Load the 1.0a17 alpha release
  #/_internal/catalog_columns // Navigate to the /_internal/catalog_columns table page
  &amp;_facet=database_name // Facet by database_name for good measure
</code></pre>
<p>
And this is what I saw:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-lite-bug.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Datasette Lite. catalog_columns table has 382 rows. database_name facet shows content 237, fixtures 97, _internal 48. A table shows columns for Link, database_name, table_name, cid and name - a red arrow points to a hyperlinked _internal in the database_name column." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
This all looked good… until I clicked on that <code>_internal</code>
link in the <code>database_name</code> column… and it took me to
<a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/databases/_internal">this
/_internal/databases/_internal 404 page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why was that a 404? Datasette introspects the SQLite table schema to
identify foreign key relationships, then turns those into hyperlinks.
The SQL schema for that <code>catalog_columns</code> table (displayed at
the bottom of the table page) looked like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-sql">
<pre><span class="pl-k">CREATE</span> <span class="pl-k">TABLE</span> <span class="pl-en">catalog_columns</span> (
    database_name <span class="pl-k">TEXT</span>,
    table_name <span class="pl-k">TEXT</span>,
    cid <span class="pl-k">INTEGER</span>,
    name <span class="pl-k">TEXT</span>,
    type <span class="pl-k">TEXT</span>,
    <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>notnull<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-k">INTEGER</span>,
    default_value <span class="pl-k">TEXT</span>, <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">--</span> renamed from dflt_value</span>
    is_pk <span class="pl-k">INTEGER</span>, <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">--</span> renamed from pk</span>
    hidden <span class="pl-k">INTEGER</span>,
    <span class="pl-k">PRIMARY KEY</span> (database_name, table_name, name),
    <span class="pl-k">FOREIGN KEY</span> (database_name) <span class="pl-k">REFERENCES</span> databases(database_name),
    <span class="pl-k">FOREIGN KEY</span> (database_name, table_name) <span class="pl-k">REFERENCES</span> tables(database_name, table_name)
);</pre>
</div>
<p>
Those foreign key references are a bug! I renamed the internal tables
from <code>databases</code> and <code>tables</code> to
<code>catalog_databases</code> and <code>catalog_tables</code> quite a
while ago, but apparently forgot to update the references - and SQLite
let me get away with it.

<p>
I fixed the bug
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/e59fd0175708f2b14d4e3c08ea16631bda0aaed3">in
this commit</a>. As is often the case the most interesting part of the

<p>
This uses Datasette’s
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#await-db-execute-fn-fn">await
db.execute_fn()</a> method, which lets you run Python code that accesses
SQLite in a thread. That code can then use the blocking
<code>sqlite-utils</code>
<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#introspecting-tables-and-views">introspection
methods</a> - here I’m looping through every table in that internal
database, looping through each tables <code>.foreign_keys</code> and
confirming that the <code>.other_table</code> and
<code>.other_column</code> values reference a table and column that
genuinely exist.
</p>
<p>
I ran this test, watched it fail, then applied the fix and it passed.
</p>
<h4 id="url-addressable-steps-to-reproduce">
URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce
</h4>
<p>
The idea I most wanted to highlight here is the enormous value provided
by <strong>URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Having good Steps To Reproduce is crucial for productively fixing bugs.
Something you can <em>click on</em> to see the bug is the most effective
form of STR there is.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, these URLs will continue to work long into the future.
</p>
<p>
The great thing about a system like Datasette Lite is that everything is
statically hosted files. The application itself is hosted on GitHub
Pages, and it works by loading additional files from various different
CDNs. The only dynamic aspect is cached lookups against the PyPI API,
which I expect to stay stable for a long time to come.
</p>
<p>
As a stable component of the Web platform
<a href="https://caniuse.com/wasm">for almost 8 years</a> WebAssembly is
clearly here to stay. I expect we’ll be able to execute today’s WASM
code in browsers 20+ years from now.
</p>
<p>
I’m confident that the patterns I’ve been exploring in Datasette Lite
over the past few years could be just as valuable for other projects.
Imagine demonstrating bugs in a Django application using a static
WebAssembly build, archived forever as part of an issue tracking system.
</p>
<p>
I think WebAssembly and Pyodide still have a great deal of untapped
potential for the wider Python world.

We want AI to “just work” for you; we realize how complicated our model

<p>
We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic

<p>
We will next ship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our
last non-chain-of-thought model.
</p>
<p>
After that, a top goal for us is to unify o-series models and GPT-series
models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to
think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide
range of tasks.
</p>
<p>
In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that
integrates a lot of our technology, including o3. We will no longer ship
o3 as a standalone model.

<p>date: 2025-02-12, updated: 2025-02-12, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/nomic-embed-text-v2">Nomic
Embed Text V2: An Open Source, Multilingual, Mixture-of-Experts
Embedding Model</a></strong>
</p>
Nomic continue to release the most interesting and powerful embedding
models. Their latest is Embed Text V2, an Apache 2.0 licensed
multi-lingual 1.9GB model (here it is
<a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe">on
Hugging Face</a>) trained on “1.6 billion high-quality data pairs”,
which is the first embedding model I’ve seen to use a Mixture of Experts
architecture:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In our experiments, we found that alternating MoE layers with 8 experts
and top-2 routing provides the optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. This results in 475M total parameters in the model, but only
305M active during training and inference.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I first tried it out using <code>uv run</code> like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run \
  --with einops \
  --with sentence-transformers \
  --python 3.13 python</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">sentence_transformers</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">SentenceTransformer</span>
<span class="pl-s1">model</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">SentenceTransformer</span>(<span class="pl-s">"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe"</span>, <span class="pl-s1">trust_remote_code</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">True</span>)
<span class="pl-s1">sentences</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> [<span class="pl-s">"Hello!"</span>, <span class="pl-s">"¡Hola!"</span>]
<span class="pl-s1">embeddings</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">model</span>.<span class="pl-c1">encode</span>(<span class="pl-s1">sentences</span>, <span class="pl-s1">prompt_name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"passage"</span>)
<span class="pl-en">print</span>(<span class="pl-s1">embeddings</span>)</pre>
<p>
Then I got it working on my laptop using the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-tranformers</a>
plugin like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm install einops # additional necessary package
llm sentence-transformers register nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe --trust-remote-code

llm embed -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe -c 'string to embed'
</code></pre>
<p>
This outputs a 768 item JSON array of floating point numbers to the
terminal. These are
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/matryoshka">Matryoshka
embeddings</a> which means you can truncate that down to just the first
256 items and get similarity calculations that still work albeit
slightly less well.
</p>
<p>
To use this for RAG you’ll need to conform to Nomic’s custom prompt
format. For documents to be searched:
</p>
<pre><code>search_document: text of document goes here
</code></pre>
<p>
And for search queries:
</p>
<pre><code>search_query: term to search for
</code></pre>
<p>
I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/745">landed a new
–prepend option</a> for the
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi">llm
embed-multi</a> command to help with that, but it’s not out in a full
release just yet.
</p>
<p>
<p>I also released
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers/releases/tag/0.3">llm-sentence-transformers
0.3</a> with some minor improvements to make running this model more
smooth.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-1">Building a SNAP LLM eval: part
1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, updated: 2025-02-12, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.propel.app/insights/building-a-snap-llm-eval-part-1/">Building
a SNAP LLM eval: part 1</a></strong>
</p>
Dave Guarino
(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/26/dave-guarino/">previously</a>)
has been exploring using LLM-driven systems to help people apply for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program">SNAP</a>,
the US Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka food stamps).
</p>
<p>
This is a domain which existing models know <em>some</em> things about,
but which is full of critical details around things like eligibility
criteria where accuracy really matters.
</p>
<p>
Domain-specific evals like this are still pretty rare. As Dave puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is also not a lot of public, easily digestible writing out there
on building evals in specific domains. So one of our hopes in sharing
this is that it helps others build evals for domains they know deeply.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Having robust evals addresses multiple challenges. The first is
establishing how good the raw models are for a particular domain. A more
important one is to help in developing additional systems on top of
these models, where an eval is crucial for understanding if RAG or
prompt engineering tricks are paying off.
</p>
<p>
Step 1 doesn’t involve writing any code at all:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Meaningful, real problem spaces inevitably have a lot of
<em>nuance</em>. So in working on our SNAP eval, the first step has just
been using lots of models — a lot. […]
</p>
<p>
Just using the models and taking notes on the nuanced “good”, “meh”,
“bad!” is a much faster way to get to a useful starting eval set than
writing or automating evals in code.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>I’ve been complaining for a while that there isn’t nearly enough
guidance about evals out there. This piece is an excellent step towards
filling that gap.</p>

(By the way, <em>[hikes up grandpa pants]</em>, we used to call these
“blog memes,” and because we didn’t I didn’t have many IRL friends who
were also internet culture, at least not that I knew of, I’d never heard
the word out loud and definitely thought it was pronounced “meh-mehs.”
And then memes evolved into something different — what we now commonly
think of as internet jokes and viral trends, rather than these early
“blog challenges.”)

<p>A fascinating new paper shows that LLMs can recursively self-improve.
They can be trained on older versions of themselves and continuously get
better. This immediately made me think, “this is it, it’s the AI

forever and become a… (well that sentence can end a lot of ways)</p>

<strong><a href="https://github.com/vagos/llm-sort">llm-sort</a></strong>
</p>
Delightful <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> plugin by
Evangelos Lamprou which adds the ability to perform “semantic search” -
allowing you to sort the contents of a file based on using a prompt
against an LLM to determine sort order.
</p>
<p>
Best illustrated by these examples from the README:
</p>
<pre><code>llm sort --query "Which names is more suitable for a pet monkey?" names.txt

cat titles.txt | llm sort --query "Which book should I read to cook better?"
</code></pre>
<p>
It works using this pairwise prompt, which is executed multiple times
using Python’s <code>sorted(documents,
key=functools.cmp_to_key(compare_callback))</code> mechanism:
</p>
<pre><code>Given the query:
{query}

Compare the following two lines:

Line A:
{docA}

Line B:
{docB}

Which line is more relevant to the query? Please answer with "Line A" or "Line B".

<p>
<p>This made me realize that <em>so many</em> of the patterns we were
using against Mechanical Turk a decade+ ago can provide hints about
potential ways to apply LLMs.</p>

The philosophy of technology is fundamentally concerned with
interrogating the epistemic, ontological, and ethical underpinnings of
human engagements with technological systems, artifacts, and
infrastructures. It compels us to reflect not only on the instrumental
logic that drives technological development—e.g., assumptions of
efficiency, optimization, and progress—but also on the deeper
ontological and epistemological entanglements that shape […]

<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
This past weekend I’ve been experimenting with AI-assisted coding to
port basic docs-as-code elements to old operating systems and platforms,
such as the venerable Intel 386. While this might strike you as a
bizarre display of futility, I find this sort of retrocomputing exercise
to be quite beneficial, if not enlightening. Something just clicks when
you stop and walk backwards.

brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat</a></strong>
</p>
Mistral <a href="https://mistral.ai/en/news/all-new-le-chat">announced a
major upgrade</a> to their <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/chat">Le
Chat</a> web UI (their version of ChatGPT) a few days ago, and one of
the signature features was performance.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that performance boost comes from hosting their model on
Cerebras:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We are excited to bring our technology to Mistral – specifically the
flagship 123B parameter Mistral Large 2 model. Using our Wafer Scale
Engine technology, we achieve over 1,100 tokens per second on text
queries.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Given Cerebras’s so far unrivaled inference performance I’m surprised
that no other AI lab has formed a partnership like this already.</p>

<p>I subscribed to Wired yesterday. Their coverage of the Musk coup is

<p>Recommend listening to the segment of this week's On The Media about
what's going on at the DoJ. I know you don't need more to be depressed
about, but something big is changing there, and you should know. Begins
at 12:51.</p>

<h2 id="minimizing-the-runtime-of-a-sql-dag">Minimizing the runtime of a
SQL DAG</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-08, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>
I recently looked into reducing the runtime of
<a href="https://www.carbonfact.com/">Carbonfact</a>’s SQL DAG. Our DAG
is made up of roughly 160 SQL queries. It takes about 10 minutes to run
with BigQuery, using on-demand pricing. It’s decent. However, the
results of our DAG feed customer dashboards, and we have the (bad) habit
of refreshing the DAG several times a day. Reducing the runtime by a few
minutes can be a nice quality-of-life improvement.
