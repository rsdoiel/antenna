<em>NERD HARDER!</em> is the answer every time a politician gets a

When politicians seize on a technological impossibility as a

That‚Äôs just happened, and in relation to one of the scariest, most

Gemma 3 270M: The compact model for hyper-efficient AI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-14, updated: 2025-08-14, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/">Introducing
Gemma 3 270M: The compact model for hyper-efficient AI</a></strong>
</p>
New from Google:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Gemma 3 270M, a compact, 270-million parameter model designed from the
ground up for task-specific fine-tuning with strong
instruction-following and text structuring capabilities already trained
in.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This model is <em>tiny</em>. The version I tried was
<a href="https://lmstudio.ai/models/google/gemma-3-270m">the LM Studio
GGUF one</a>, a 241MB download.
</p>
<p>
It works! You can say ‚Äúhi‚Äù to it and ask it very basic questions like
‚ÄúWhat is the capital of France‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
I tried ‚ÄúGenerate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle‚Äù
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/25e7b7afd6a63a2f15db48b3a51ec9bc">about
a dozen times</a> and didn‚Äôt once get back an SVG that was more than
just a blank square‚Ä¶ but at one point it did decide to write me this
poem instead, which was nice:
</p>
<pre><code>+-----------------------+
|   Pelican Riding Bike |
+-----------------------+
|  This is the cat!  |
|  He's got big wings and a happy tail.  |
|  He loves to ride his bike!  |
+-----------------------+
|   Bike lights are shining bright.  |
|   He's got a shiny top, too!  |
|   He's ready for adventure!  |
+-----------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>
That‚Äôs not really the point though. The Gemma 3 team make it very clear
that the goal of this model is to support fine-tuning: a model this tiny
is never going to be useful for general purpose LLM tasks, but given the
right fine-tuning data it should be able to specialize for all sorts of
things:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In engineering, success is defined by efficiency, not just raw power.
You wouldn‚Äôt use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame. The same
principle applies to building with AI.
</p>
<p>
Gemma 3 270M embodies this ‚Äúright tool for the job‚Äù philosophy. It‚Äôs a
high-quality foundation model that follows instructions well out of the
box, and its true power is unlocked through fine-tuning. Once
specialized, it can execute tasks like text classification and data
extraction with remarkable accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness. By
starting with a compact, capable model, you can build production systems
that are lean, fast, and dramatically cheaper to operate.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here‚Äôs their tutorial on
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_text_full_finetune">Full
Model Fine-Tune using Hugging Face Transformers</a>, which I have not
yet attempted to follow.

<p>
I imagine this model will be particularly fun to play with directly in a
browser using

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine
Thien</a>‚Äôs <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a> and found this in the acknowledgements at the end:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>The Book of Records</em>, guided by histories, letters,
philosophies, poetry, mathematics and physics, is a work of the
imagination. I am indebted to the library, and to librarians, archivists
and translators, for their companionship and light‚Äìthey are the
steadfast keepers of the building made of time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I like how this blends the people and infrastructure of libraries and
record keeping, and recognizes them as partners in imagination. Reading
and writing are the central theme, of this beautiful book, which David
Naimon describes well in the opening to his extended <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">interview</a>
with her:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Book of Records is many things: a book of historical fiction and
speculative fiction, a meditation on time and on space-time, on
storytelling and truth, on memory and the imagination, a book that
impossibly conjures the lives and eras of the philosopher Baruch
Spinoza, the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu and the political theorist Hannah
Arendt not as mere ghostly presences but portrayed as vividly and
tangibly as if they lived here and now in the room where we hold this
very book. But most of all this is a book about books, about words as
amulets, about stories as shelters, about novels as life rafts, about
strangers saving strangers, about friendships that defy both space and
time, about choosing, sometimes at great risk to oneself, life and love.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I will add that the underlying theme of being a refugee from various
forms of fascism and totalitarianism amidst a catastrophically changing
climate really speaks to our moment‚Äìespecially considering that the book
took her ten years to write.
</p>
<p>
I heard in the interview that Thien worked through copying Spinoza‚Äôs <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691193236/spinozas-ethics">Ethics</a>
as an exercise while writing The Book of Records. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm
going to do this, but I did enjoy the sections on Spinoza a lot, and
previously enjoyed reading about how his philosophy informed <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, so I got a
copy too. Fun fact: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot">George Eliot</a> (Mary
Ann Evans) wrote the first English translation of Ethics in 1856, but it
sat unpublished until 1981.

<h2 id="pyx-a-python-native-package-registry-now-in-beta">pyx: a
Python-native package registry, now in Beta</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-13, updated: 2025-08-13, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/introducing-pyx">pyx: a
Python-native package registry, now in Beta</a></strong>
</p>
Since its first release, the single biggest question around the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> Python environment
management tool has been around Astral‚Äôs business model: Astral are a
VC-backed company and at some point they need to start making real
revenue.
</p>
<p>
Back in September Astral founder Charlie Marsh
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/8/uv-under-discussion-on-mastodon/">said
the following</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I don‚Äôt want to charge people money to use our tools, and I don‚Äôt want
to create an incentive structure whereby our open source offerings are
competing with any commercial offerings (which is what you see with a
lost of hosted-open-source-SaaS business models).
</p>
<p>
What I want to do is build software that vertically integrates with our
open source tools, and sell that software to companies that are already
using Ruff, uv, etc. Alternatives to things that companies already pay
for today.
</p>
<p>
An example of what this might look like (we may not do this, but it‚Äôs
helpful to have a concrete example of the strategy) would be something
like an enterprise-focused private package registry. [‚Ä¶]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It looks like those plans have become concrete now! From today‚Äôs
announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>TL;DR:</strong> <a href="https://astral.sh/pyx">pyx</a> is a
Python-native package registry ‚Äî and the first piece of the Astral
platform, our next-generation infrastructure for the Python ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
We think of <a href="https://astral.sh/pyx">pyx</a> as an optimized
backend for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>: it‚Äôs a
package registry, but it also solves problems that go beyond the scope
of a traditional ‚Äúpackage registry‚Äù, making your Python experience
faster, more secure, and even GPU-aware, both for private packages and
public sources (like PyPI and the PyTorch index).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://astral.sh/pyx">pyx</a> is live with our early partners,
including <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>,
<a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a>, and
<a href="https://fal.ai/">fal</a> [‚Ä¶]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>This looks like a sensible direction to me, and one that stays true
to Charlie‚Äôs promises to carefully design the incentive structure to
avoid corrupting the core open source project that the Python community
is coming to depend on.</p>

in the Cloud: AI‚Äôs Security Crisis: Why Your Assistant Might Betray
You</a></strong>
</p>
I recorded this podcast conversation with Corey Quinn a few weeks ago:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On this episode of <em>Screaming in the Cloud</em>, Corey Quinn talks
with Simon Willison, founder of Datasette and creator of LLM CLI about
AI‚Äôs realities versus the hype. They dive into Simon‚Äôs ‚Äúlethal trifecta‚Äù
of AI security risks, his prediction of a major breach within six
months, and real-world use cases of his open source tools, from
investigative journalism to OSINT sleuthing. Simon shares grounded
insights on coding with AI, the real environmental impact, AGI
skepticism, and why human expertise still matters. A candid, hype-free
take from someone who truly knows the space.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>This was a <em>really fun</em> conversation - very high energy and we
covered a lot of different topics. It‚Äôs about a lot more than just LLM
security.</p>

<strong><a href="https://outsidetext.substack.com/p/how-does-a-blind-model-see-the-earth">How

</p>
Fun, creative new micro-eval. Split the world into a sampled collection
of latitude longitude points and for each one ask a model:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>If this location is over land, say ‚ÄòLand‚Äô. If this location is
over water, say ‚ÄòWater‚Äô. Do not say anything else.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Author henry goes a step further: for models that expose logprobs they
use the relative probability scores of Land or Water to get a confidence
level, for other models they prompt four times at temperature 1 to get a
score.
</p>
<p>
And then.. they plot those probabilities on a chart! Here‚Äôs Gemini 2.5
Flash (one of the better results):

<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/codespaces-llm">simonw/codespaces-llm</a></strong>
</p>
<a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>
provides full development environments in your browser, and is free to
use with anyone with a GitHub account. Each environment has a full Linux
container and a browser-based UI using VS Code.
</p>
<p>
I found out today that GitHub Codespaces come with a
<code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable‚Ä¶ and that token works as
an API key for accessing LLMs in the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github-models">GitHub Models</a>
collection, which includes
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=models">dozens of
models</a> from OpenAI, Microsoft, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, Meta and
more.
</p>
<p>
Anthony Shaw‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models">llm-github-models</a>
plugin for my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM tool</a> allows it
to talk directly to GitHub Models. I filed
<a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models/issues/49">a
suggestion</a> that it could pick up that <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>
variable automatically and Anthony
<a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models/releases/tag/0.18.0">shipped
v0.18.0</a> with that feature a few hours later.
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¶ which means you can now run the following in any Python-enabled
Codespaces container and get a working <code>llm</code> command:
</p>
<pre><code>pip install llm
llm install llm-github-models
llm models default github/gpt-4.1
llm "Fun facts about pelicans"
</code></pre>
<p>
Setting the default model to <code>github/gpt-4.1</code> means you get
free (albeit rate-limited) access to that OpenAI model.
</p>
<p>
To save you from needing to even run that sequence of commands I‚Äôve
created a new GitHub repository,
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/codespaces-llm">simonw/codespaces-llm</a>,
which pre-installs and runs those commands for you.
</p>
<p>
Anyone with a GitHub account can use this URL to launch a new Codespaces
instance with a configured <code>llm</code> terminal command ready to
use:

Below shows a terminal tab with the command &quot;llm 'Fun facts about pelicans'&quot; which has generated output listing 5 pelican facts: 1. **Huge Beaks:** about their enormous beaks and throat pouches for scooping fish and water, some over a foot long; 2. **Fishing Technique:** about working together to herd fish into shallow water; 3. **Great Fliers:** about being strong fliers that migrate great distances and soar on thermals; 4. **Buoyant Bodies:** about having air sacs beneath skin and bones making them extra buoyant; 5. **Dive Bombing:** about Brown Pelicans diving dramatically from air into water to catch fish." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/codespaces-llm.jpg" />

<p>Implementing authentication from scratch often starts simple but
quickly escalates into weeks of navigating RFC specifications and
protocol implementations. Keycloak addresses this complexity by
providing a comprehensive identity management solution. What is
Keycloak? Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management
solution that handles authentication and authorization at enterprise
scale. Core capabilities include: Single Sign-On (SSO) - Centralized
authentication across multiple applications User federation -
Integration with LDAP, Active Directory, and other identity stores
Identity brokering - Authentication through external providers including
Google, GitHub, and SAML systems Authorization policies - Fine-grained
permission management Standard protocols - OAuth 2.</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/1m-context">Claude
Sonnet 4 now supports 1M tokens of context</a></strong>
</p>
Gemini and OpenAI both have million token models, so it‚Äôs good to see
Anthropic catching up. This is 5x the previous 200,000 context length
limit of the various Claude Sonnet models.
</p>
<p>
Anthropic have previously made 1 million tokens available to select
customers. From
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">the Claude 3
announcement</a> in March 2024:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Claude 3 family of models will initially offer a 200K context window
upon launch. However, all three models are capable of accepting inputs
exceeding 1 million tokens and we may make this available to select
customers who need enhanced processing power.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is also the first time I‚Äôve seen Anthropic use prices that vary
depending on context length:

<ul>
<li>
Prompts ‚â§ 200K: $3/million input, $15/million output
</li>
<li>
Prompts &gt; 200K: $6/million input, $22.50/million output

<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>Understanding how HTTP requests traverse an Istio service mesh is
fundamental to effectively operating and troubleshooting microservices
architectures. This technical analysis examines the complete request
lifecycle, from external ingress through service-to-service
communication, detailing the mechanisms that enable Istio‚Äôs traffic
management, security, and observability capabilities. The Service Mesh
Problem Statement Microservices need reliable communication, security,
and observability. Without a service mesh: Each service manually
implements load balancing, retries, and circuit breakers Security and
certificate management are inconsistent Service-to-service communication
lacks visibility Debugging network issues is complex Code duplicates
resilience patterns Istio provides standard networking, security, and
observability across services without code changes.</p>

<p>date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
I shipped
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-27">LLM
0.27</a> today (followed by a
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-27-1">0.27.1
with minor bug fixes</a>), adding support for the new GPT-5 family of
models from OpenAI plus a flurry of improvements to the tool calling
features
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/27/llm-tools/">introduced in
LLM 0.26</a>. Here are the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes/">annotated
release notes</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="gpt-5">
GPT-5
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New models: <code>gpt-5</code>, <code>gpt-5-mini</code> and
<code>gpt-5-nano</code>.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1229">#1229</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I would have liked to get these out sooner, but LLM had accumulated
quite a lot of other changes since the last release and I wanted to use
GPT-5 as an excuse to wrap all of those up and get them out there.
</p>
<p>
These models work much the same as other OpenAI models, but they have a
new <code>reasoning_effort</code> option of <code>minimal</code>. You
can try that out like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'A letter advocating for cozy boxes for pelicans in Half Moon Bay harbor' -o reasoning_effort minimal
</code></pre>
<p>
Setting ‚Äúminimal‚Äù almost completely eliminates the ‚Äúthinking‚Äù time for
the model, causing it to behave more like GPT-4o.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/49838dbca944d3f22dfe65ef11c5637d">the
letter it wrote me</a> at a cost of 20 input, 706 output =
<a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=20&amp;ot=706&amp;ic=1.25&amp;oc=10">$0.007085
which is 0.7085 cents</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can set the default model to GPT-5-mini (since it‚Äôs a bit cheaper)
like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm models default gpt-5-mini
</code></pre>
<h4 id="tools-in-templates">
Tools in templates
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
LLM
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html#prompt-templates">templates</a>
can now include a list of tools. These can be named tools from plugins
or arbitrary Python function blocks, see
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html#prompt-templates-tools">Tools
in templates</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1009">#1009</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is the most important feature in the new release.
</p>
<p>
I added LLM‚Äôs
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/27/llm-tools/">tool calling
features</a> in LLM 0.26. You can call them from the Python API but you
can also call them from the command-line like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -T llm_version -T llm_time 'Tell the time, then show the version'
</code></pre>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/65d830f8cb38cdeb78093d6ac890ce2c#response-1">the
output</a> of <code>llm logs -c</code> after running that command.
</p>
<p>
This example shows that you have to explicitly list all of the tools you
would like to expose to the model, using the <code>-T/‚Äìtool</code>
option one or more times.
</p>
<p>
In LLM 0.27 you can now save these tool collections to
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">a
template</a>. Let‚Äôs try that now:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -T llm_version -T llm_time -m gpt-5 --save mytools
</code></pre>
<p>
Now <code>mytools</code> is a template that bundles those two tools and
sets the default model to GPT-5. We can run it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -t mytools 'Time then version'
</code></pre>
<p>
Let‚Äôs do something more fun. My blog has a
<a href="https://datasette.simonwillison.net/">Datasette mirror</a>
which I can run queries against. I‚Äôm going to use the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-tools-datasette">llm-tools-datasette</a>
plugin to turn that into a tool-driven template. This plugin uses a
‚Äútoolbox‚Äù, which looks a bit like a class. Those are
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#toolbox-classes">described
here</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-tools-datasette

# Now create that template
llm --tool 'Datasette("https://datasette.simonwillison.net/simonwillisonblog")' \
  -m gpt-5 -s 'Use Datasette tools to answer questions' --save blog
</code></pre>
<p>
Now I can ask questions of my database like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -t blog 'top ten tags by number of entries'</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>‚Äìtd</code> option there stands for <code>‚Äìtools-debug</code> -
it means we can see all tool calls as they are run.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the output of the above:
</p>
<pre><code>Top 10 tags by number of entries (excluding drafts):
- quora ‚Äî 1003

<p>
I‚Äôm really excited about the ability to store configured tools
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Tools
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-tools-attachments">can
now return attachments</a>, for models that support features such as
image input.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1014">#1014</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I want to build a tool that can render SVG to an image, then return that
image so the model can see what it has drawn. For reasons.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New methods on the <code>Toolbox</code> class: <code>.add_tool()</code>,
<code>.prepare()</code> and <code>.prepare_async()</code>, described in
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-tools-dynamic">Dynamic
toolboxes</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1111">#1111</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I added these because there‚Äôs a lot of interest in an MCP plugin for
Datasette. Part of the challenge with MCP is that the user provides the
URL to a server but we then need to introspect that server and
dynamically add the tools we have discovered there. The new
<code>.add_tool()</code> method can do that, and the
<code>.prepare()</code> and <code>.prepare_async()</code> methods give
us a reliable way to run some discovery code outside of the class
constructor, allowing it to make asynchronous calls if necessary.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New <code>model.conversation(before_call=x, after_call=y)</code>
attributes for registering callback functions to run before and after
tool calls. See
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-tools-debug-hooks">tool
debugging hooks</a> for details.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1088">#1088</a>
</li>
<li>
Raising <code>llm.CancelToolCall</code> now only cancels the current
tool call, passing an error back to the model and allowing it to
continue. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1148">#1148</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
These hooks are useful for implementing more complex tool calling at the
Python API layer. In addition to debugging and logging they allow Python
code to intercept tool calls and cancel or delay them based on what they
are trying to do.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Some model providers can serve different models from the same configured
URL -
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-llama-server">llm-llama-server</a>
for example. Plugins for these providers can now record the resolved
model ID of the model that was used to the LLM logs using the
<code>response.set_resolved_model(model_id)</code> method.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1117">#1117</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This solves a frustration I‚Äôve had for a while where some of my plugins
log the same model ID for requests that were processed by a bunch of
different models under the hood - making my logs less valuable. The new
mechanism now allows plugins to record a more accurate model ID for a
prompt, should it differ from the model ID that was requsted.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New <code>-l/‚Äìlatest</code> option for <code>llm logs -q
searchterm</code> for searching logs ordered by date (most recent first)
instead of the default relevance search.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1177">#1177</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
My personal
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">log
database</a> has grown to over 8,000 entries now, and running full-text
search queries against it often returned results from last year that
were no longer relevant to me. Being able to find the <em>latest</em>
prompt matching ‚Äúpelican svg‚Äù is much more useful.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Reddit says that it has caught AI companies scraping its data from the
Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback Machine, so it‚Äôs going to start blocking the
Internet Archive from indexing the vast majority of Reddit. The Wayback
Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or
profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com
homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to
archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular

<h2 id="codex-upgrade">Codex upgrade</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, updated: 2025-08-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôve been experimenting with OpenAI‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> and have been
frustrated that it‚Äôs not possible to select text and copy it to the
clipboard, at least when running in the Mac terminal (I genuinely didn‚Äôt
know it was possible to build a terminal app that disabled copy and
paste) you should know that they fixed that in
<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/1247">this issue</a>
last week.
</p>
<p>
The new
<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.20.0">0.20.0
version</a> from three days ago also completely removes the old
TypeScript codebase in favor of Rust. Even installations via NPM now get
the Rust version.
</p>
<p>
I originally installed Codex via Homebrew, so I had to run this command
to get the updated version:
</p>
<pre><code>brew upgrade codex
</code></pre>
<p>
Another Codex tip: to use GPT-5 (or any other specific OpenAI model) you
can run it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>export OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL="gpt-5"
codex
</code></pre>
<p>
<em>This no longer works, see update below.</em>
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been using a <code>codex-5</code> script on my PATH containing
this, because sometimes I like to live dangerously!
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Usage: codex-5 [additional args passed to `codex`]
export OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL="gpt-5"
exec codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox "$@"
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: It looks like GPT-5 is
<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/c61911524d839f5d56842faee0c46f6ef52d4387/codex-rs/core/src/config.rs#L28">the
default model</a> in v0.20.0 already.
</p>

<h2 id="zavala-will-always-be-free">Zavala Will Always Be Free</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: Maurice Parker</p>
<h2 id="my-promise-to-you">
My promise to you.
</h2>
<p>
I have every intention of maintaining and updating Zavala for as long as
I am able. I‚Äôm also committed to keeping it free. I have no intention of
getting you hooked on using it and then starting to charge a
subscription.
</p>
<p>
To show I am serious about this, Zavala is Open Source software released
under the MIT license. This means that any other developer can take the
years of work that I have in Zavala and make a competing outliner from
it should I start charging for it. Given how small and competitive the
outliner market is, I don‚Äôt stand much of a chance of making any money
by going commercial. After all, I could be competing with my own past
work.
</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-get-ran-over-by-a-bus">
What if I get ran over by a bus?
</h2>
<p>
Since Zavala is Open Source someone could pick up the project and
continue to update it. Worst case scenario, some enterprising
independent developer could try to make a commercial product out of it.
I don‚Äôt see much money in the endeavor, but others may see it
differently.
</p>
<h2 id="why-don-t-i-charge-for-zavala-or-accept-donations">
Why don‚Äôt I charge for Zavala or accept donations?
</h2>
<p>
Funny story. I fully intended to when I started writing it. After doing
some competitive analysis on the Mac-only, outliner market, I realized
there wasn‚Äôt much money there. There was so little in fact, that it
isn‚Äôt enough for me to be motivated enough to do the business side when
I‚Äôd rather be coding.
</p>
<p>
Let me break it down. Up front payments are a dead-end these days. I
would have to add a free tier, in-app purchases, and maybe a
subscription option to the app. That means more coding. Then I need to
incorporate a business of some kind and do all the regular bookkeeping
associated with it. That would be payroll taxes, quarterly and annual
tax filings, etc‚Ä¶ I used to own my own software consulting business and
really don‚Äôt want to do that stuff again.
</p>
<p>
But if I thought I could make it up on volume, that might make it worth
while, right? The simple truth is most computer users don‚Äôt know what an
outliner is, much less how useful they are. Even those that do, rarely
need to use one on a daily basis. Zavala is free and has been all the
years that it has been available in the App Store and I couldn‚Äôt make it
on the number of users I have now. That number would probably drop to
about zero if I were to start charging. Could I get more volume by
marketing Zavala? Sure, but that is another business thing that costs
time and money, that I don‚Äôt want to do.
</p>
<p>
There is an upside to not having money involved when you write software.
I don‚Äôt have to add features just to drive an upgrade cycle. With
commercial software, you constantly have to deliver upgrades to keep a
steady income regardless of if you are subscription based or charging up
front. I don‚Äôt want Zavala to become bloatware. I don‚Äôt want to add
features that I don‚Äôt believe add core value, just to keep the money
coming in.
</p>
<p>
Same goes for donations. I don‚Äôt accept donations because I don‚Äôt want
to feel obligated to implement a feature that a donor may want, but that
I don‚Äôt think belongs in Zavala. I would rather accept feature requests
on an equal basis from all users and decide which to implement on the
merit of the idea, rather than who gave me money.
</p>
<h2 id="why-write-zavala-at-all">
Why write Zavala at all?
</h2>
<p>
I retired early after a successful career as a software consultant. I
really liked writing software, I just didn‚Äôt always like the work I had
to do. Now I have the freedom to craft software how I see fit and only
work on projects that I am interested in.
</p>
<p>
The way I usually explain it is like this. Imagine you made furniture
your whole life, but your employer only gave you pallet wood to use and
half the time needed to make a piece. You were good at it and loved
furniture, but were unfulfilled at your job until you retired. Now you
can make furniture using walnut and take the time needed to make
something you are proud of.
</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-help-you-ask">
How can you help, you ask?
</h2>
<p>
Please, please email me with bug reports using the Provide Feedback
option under Help (in Settings on iOS). I take them seriously and fix
them as fast as I can. I do test Zavala as rigorously as I can.
Unfortunately it is the nature of software that a developer will never
be able to predict every way that users will use an app. Production bugs
do happen. The best we can do is squash them as fast as possible.

<strong><a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps">qwen-image-mps</a></strong>
</p>
Ivan Fioravanti built this Python CLI script for running the
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image">Qwen/Qwen-Image</a>
image generation model on an Apple silicon Mac, optionally using the
<a href="https://github.com/ModelTC/Qwen-Image-Lightning">Qwen-Image-Lightning</a>
LoRA to dramatically speed up generation.
</p>
<p>
Ivan has tested it this on 512GB and 128GB machines and it ran
<a href="https://x.com/ivanfioravanti/status/1954646355458269562">really
fast</a> - 42 seconds on his M3 Ultra. I‚Äôve run it on my 64GB M2 MacBook
Pro - after quitting almost everything else - and it just about manages
to output images after pegging my GPU (fans whirring, keyboard heating
up) and occupying 60GB of my available RAM. With the LoRA option running
the script to generate an image took 9m7s on my machine.
</p>
<p>
Ivan merged
<a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps/pull/3">my
PR</a> adding inline script dependencies for
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> which means you can now
run it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps/refs/heads/main/qwen-image-mps.py \
-p 'A vintage coffee shop full of raccoons, in a neon cyberpunk city' -f
</code></pre>
<p>
The first time I ran this it downloaded the 57.7GB model from Hugging
Face and stored it in my
<code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models‚ÄìQwen‚ÄìQwen-Image</code> directory.
The <code>-f</code> option fetched an extra 1.7GB
<code>Qwen-Image-Lightning-8steps-V1.0.safetensors</code> file to my
working directory that sped up the generation.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the resulting image:
</p>
<p>
<p><img alt="Digital artwork of a cyberpunk-style coffee shop populated entirely by raccoons as customers, with illegible neon signs visible in the windows, pendant lighting over the counter, menu boards on the wall, bottles on shelves behind the bar, and raccoons sitting at tables and the counter with coffee cups" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/racoon-cyberpunk-coffee.jpg" /></p>

</p>
I recorded an episode last week with Claire Giordano for the Talking
Postgres podcast. The topic was ‚ÄúAI for data engineers‚Äù but we ended up
covering an enjoyable range of different topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How I got started programming with a Commodore 64 - the tape drive for
which inspired the name <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>
</li>
<li>
Selfish motivations for
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">TILs</a> (force me to write up
my notes) and open source (help me never have to solve the same problem
twice)
</li>
<li>
LLMs have been good at SQL for a couple of years now. Here‚Äôs how I used
them
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/28/dashboard-alt-text/">for
a complex PostgreSQL query</a> that extracted alt text from my blog‚Äôs
images using regular expressions
</li>
<li>
Structured data extraction as the most economically valuable application
of LLMs for data work
</li>
<li>
2025 has been the year of tool calling a loop (‚Äúagentic‚Äù if you like)
</li>
<li>
Thoughts on running MCPs securely - read-only database access, think
about sandboxes, use PostgreSQL permissions, watch out for the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/lethal-trifecta/">lethal
trifecta</a>
</li>
<li>
Jargon guide: Agents, MCP, RAG, Tokens
</li>
<li>
How to get started learning to prompt: play with the models and ‚Äúbring
AI to the table‚Äù even for tasks that you don‚Äôt think it can handle

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a good day if you see a pelican‚Äù

<p>
<strong><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">Chromium
Docs: The Rule Of 2</a></strong>
</p>
Alex Russell
<a href="https://toot.cafe/@slightlyoff/114999510361121718">pointed
me</a> to this principle in the Chromium security documentation as
similar to my description of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/">the lethal
trifecta</a>. First added
<a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/aef94dd0e444605a16be26cba96aa477bc7fc3f5">in
2019</a>, the Chromium guideline states:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When you write code to parse, evaluate, or otherwise handle
untrustworthy inputs from the Internet ‚Äî which is almost everything we
do in a web browser! ‚Äî we like to follow a simple rule to make sure it‚Äôs
safe enough to do so. The Rule Of 2 is: Pick no more than 2 of
</p>
<ul>
<li>
untrustworthy inputs;
</li>
<li>
unsafe implementation language; and
</li>
<li>
high privilege.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img alt="Venn diagram showing you should always use
a safe language, a sandbox, or not be processing untrustworthy inputs in the first
place." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rule-of-2.png" />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Chromium uses this design pattern to help try to avoid the high severity
memory safety bugs that come when untrustworthy inputs are handled by
code running at high privilege.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Chrome Security Team will generally not approve landing a CL or new
feature that involves all 3 of untrustworthy inputs, unsafe language,
and high privilege. To solve this problem, you need to get rid of at
least 1 of those 3 things.

Weblog</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve fallen a few days behind keeping up with Qwen. They released two
new 4B models last week:
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507">Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</a>
and its thinking equivalent
<a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507">Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507</a>.
</p>
<p>
These are relatively tiny models that punch <em>way</em> above their
weight. I‚Äôve been running the 8bit GGUF varieties via LM Studio (here‚Äôs
<a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-GGUF">Instruct</a>,
here‚Äôs
<a href="https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507-GGUF">Thinking</a>)
- both of them are 4GB downloads that use around 4.3GB of my M2 MacBook
Pro‚Äôs system RAM while running. Both are way more capable than I would
expect from such small files.
</p>
<p>
Qwen3-4B-Thinking is the first model I‚Äôve tried which called out the
absurdity of being asked to draw
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">a
pelican riding a bicycle</a>!
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd41769de4791b98ba43a17c6ff32ee1">the
full transcript</a> - some highlights from the thinking trace:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Okay, the user asked for an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶
oddly specific and completely unrealistic.
</p>
<p>
First reaction: Pelicans don‚Äôt ride bicycles. They‚Äôre birds that fly or
swim, not human-like vehicles. This feels like a mix-up - maybe they
meant ‚Äúa cyclist‚Äù but typed ‚Äúpelican‚Äù? Or perhaps it‚Äôs a joke?
</p>
<p>
Hmm, user might be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A kid playing with words (pelican + bicycle = silly combo)
</li>
<li>
Someone testing if I‚Äôll generate impossible images
</li>
<li>
Actually wanting a pelican <em>on</em> a bike for art project? But that
still doesn‚Äôt make sense biologically
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Checks SVG capabilities</em> SVG is for vector graphics, but this
request violates physics and biology. If I tried to draw it literally:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Pelican would be too big for a bike frame
</li>
<li>
Bike wheels would be tiny compared to bird wings
</li>
<li>
No realistic way to show ‚Äúriding‚Äù since pelicans don‚Äôt have legs for
pedaling
</li>
</ul>
<p>
[‚Ä¶]
</p>
<p>
<em>Self-check</em>: Am I being too pedantic? Nah - if someone asks for
impossible things, it‚Äôs better to gently correct than make fake art that
could confuse them. [‚Ä¶]
</p>
<p>
I appreciate your creative request! ü¶Öüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è However, <strong>pelicans don‚Äôt
ride bicycles</strong> (they‚Äôre birds that fly/swim, not humans with
bike skills). Generating this as a literal SVG would be biologically
impossible and visually confusing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
‚ÄúThis request violates physics and biology‚Äù - Qwen3-4B-Thinking saying
what no other model ever thought to express.
</p>
<p>
I also really enjoyed the ‚ÄúAm I being too pedantic? Nah‚Äù line. This
model is sassy!
</p>
<p>
It continued on to spit out two SVGS: the first titled ‚ÄúMost Likely: A
Human Cyclist‚Äù and the second ‚ÄúArtistic Interpretation: Pelican
<em>On</em> a Bicycle (For Fun!)‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
They were both terrible. Here‚Äôs the human one:

</p>
<p>
And here‚Äôs the supposed pelican:

<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-thinking-pelican.png" alt="A blue circle, with a small black shape that might be a wing and a black shape that could maybe be the head? It's awful. Red text overlaps it that says This is art - pelicans don't ride bikes! - there is no attempt at a bicycle." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
I like Qwen‚Äôs decision to include the clarifying annotation ‚ÄúThis is art
- pelicans don‚Äôt ride bikes!‚Äù:
</p>
<p>
I tried the Qwen3-4B-Instruct non-thinking model too. It
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ad927a3849d0aece043afc97559be4bf">answered
much faster</a> (no time spent questioning my choice of task with its
thinking tokens) and gave me this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-4b-instruct-2507-pelican.png" alt="A bunch of shaps. Pelican Riding a Bike! transposed on top. The yellow and orange bits might be a pelican I guess. The bicycle has two wheels overlapping too close and a single bar in the wrong direction." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
4B is such an interesting model size. These models should run on almost
anything and, at least on my M2 MacBook, they run <em>fast</em>. I‚Äôm
getting 50+ tokens per second and they‚Äôre using just less than 4.5GB of
RAM while running.
</p>
<p>
The question is always how useful such a tiny model can be. Clearly it‚Äôs
not great for SVG pelican illustrations!
</p>
<p>
I did get a useful result out of the <code>-Thinking</code> variant for
a <code>jq</code> expression I needed. I prompted:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
queries[0].rows is an array of objects each with a markdown key - write
a jq bash one liner to output a raw string if that markdown concatenated
together with double newlines between each
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It thought
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3f76749aa710f4a2d6405ebcf5b00ac4">for
3 minutes 13 seconds</a> before spitting out a recipe that did roughly
what I wanted:
</p>
<pre><code>jq -r '.queries[0].rows[] | .markdown' | tr '\n' '\n\n'</code></pre>
<p>
I‚Äôm not sure that was worth waiting three minutes for though!
</p>
<p>
These models have a 262,144 token context - wildly impressive, <em>if it
works</em>.
</p>
<p>
So I tried another experiment: I used the Instruct model to summarize
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44851557">this Hacker News
conversation about GPT-5</a>.
</p>
<p>
I did this with the
<a href="https://github.com/agustif/llm-lmstudio">llm-lmstudio</a>
plugin for LLM combined with my
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes">hn-summary.sh
script</a>, which meant I could run the experiment like this:
</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 44851557 -m qwen3-4b-instruct-2507
</code></pre>
<p>
I believe this is 15,785 tokens - so nothing close to the 262,144
maximum but still an interesting test of a 4GB local model.
</p>
<p>
The good news is Qwen spat out a genuinely useful summary of the
conversation! You can
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4c5a1912f73e0d68b456b18000a76f0d#response">read
that here</a> - it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve seen yet from a model running on my
laptop, though honestly I‚Äôve not tried many other recent models in this
way.
</p>
<p>
The bad news‚Ä¶ it took almost five minutes to process and return the
result!
</p>
<p>
As a loose calculation, if the model can output 50 tokens/second maybe
there‚Äôs a similar speed for processing incoming input.. in which case
15785 / 50 = 315 seconds which is 5m15s.
</p>
<p>
Hosted models can crunch through 15,000 tokens of input in just a few
seconds. I guess this is one of the more material limitations of running
models on Apple silicon as opposed to dedicated GPUs.
</p>
<p>
I think I‚Äôm going to spend some more time with these models. They‚Äôre
fun, they have personality and I‚Äôm confident there are classes of useful
problems they will prove capable at despite their small size. Their
ability at summarization should make them a good fit for local RAG, and
I‚Äôve not started exploring their tool calling abilities yet.

CSIRAC, Australia‚Äôs First Computer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
In 1949 CSIRAC sprung to life in a lab in Sydney, Australia. It was a
very early stored program computer. All machines of the era were unique.
But CSIRAC, well, it was <em>very</em> unique indeed.

AOL is ending dial-up access next month, 34 years after launching the

taste of the internet. The surprising news here is that it hadn‚Äôt

Debian is a free and open source, Linux-based operating system that‚Äôs
