<h2 id="calling-a-wrap-on-my-weeknotes">Calling a wrap on my
weeknotes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
After <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">192 posts</a>
that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I‚Äôve decided to call a
wrap on my weeknotes habit. The
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/13/weeknotestwitter-sqlite-datasette-rure/">original
goal</a> was to stay transparent during my 2019-2020 JSK fellowship, and
I kept them up after that as an accountability mechanism and to get into
a habit of writing regularly.
</p>
<p>
Over the past two years I‚Äôve adopted new posting habits which are
solving those problems in other ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I post something here almost every day. I actually maintained a daily
posting streak throughout 2024, which I
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/">ended
in January</a>, but I‚Äôm still posting most days and plan to keep that
up.
</li>
<li>
Every time I ship a new release of one of my projects I link to it from
here. This replaces the ‚Äúrecent releases‚Äù section of my weeknotes.
</li>
<li>
I try to have a longer form piece of writing that‚Äôs suitable for
inclusion in <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> at
least once every two weeks. That‚Äôs another accountability mechanism
that‚Äôs working well for me.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One downside of weeknotes is that I‚Äôd sometimes save something to
include in them, which could lead to several items getting bundled
together in a way that reduced their potential impact as standalone
posts.
</p>
<p>
I got to the point with weeknotes where I was feeling guilty about not
keeping them up. Given the volume of content I‚Äôm publishing already that
felt like a sign that they were no longer providing the value they once
did!
</p>
<p>
I still think weeknotes are an excellent habit for anyone who wants to
write more frequently and be more transparent about their work. It feels
healthy to be able to end a habit that‚Äôs finished serving its purpose.

<h2 id="openai-platform-o1-pro">OpenAI platform: o1-pro</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1-pro">OpenAI
platform: o1-pro</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed
through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and
$600/million tokens for output. That‚Äôs 10x the price of their o1 and
o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their
cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!
</p>
<p>
Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token
context window, 100,000 max output tokens, Sep 30 2023 knowledge cut-off
date and it supports function calling, structured outputs and image
inputs.
</p>
<p>
o1-pro doesn‚Äôt support streaming, and most significantly for developers
is the first OpenAI model to <em>only</em> be available via their new
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses">Responses
API</a>. This means tools that are built against their Chat Completions
API (like my own <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) have to do
a whole lot more work to support the new model - my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/839">issue for that is
here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since LLM doesn‚Äôt support this new model yet I had to make do with
<code>curl</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0439d0255360c68b8f621133860710b1">the
full JSON</a> I got back - 81 input tokens and 1552 output tokens for a
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">total cost</a> of
94.335 cents.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Clearly a bird riding a bicycle. The pedals are in the wrong place and the bird doesn't quite have the majestic beak of a pelican." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o1-pro-pelican.png" />
</p>
<p>
I took a risk and added <code>‚Äúreasoning‚Äù: {‚Äúeffort‚Äù: ‚Äúhigh‚Äù}</code> to
see if I could get a better pelican with more reasoning:
</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>
Surprisingly that used <em>less</em> output tokens - 1459 compared to
1552 earlier (cost: 88.755 cents) -
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/085d81e1160157572c9bd361b01374c4">producing
this JSON</a> which rendered as a slightly better pelican:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="A bit better - no pedals, so they cannot be in the wrong place. The bird has a slightly more majestic beak." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o1-pro-high-pelican.png" />
</p>
<p>
<p>It was cheaper because while it spent 960 reasoning tokens as opposed
to 704 for the previous pelican it omitted the explanatory text around
the SVG, saving on total output.</p>

all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong>Vibe coding</strong> is having a moment. The term
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">was
coined by Andrej Karpathy</a> just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and
has since been featured
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/personaltech/vibecoding-ai-software-programming.html">in
the New York Times</a>,
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">Ars
Technica</a>,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/ai-software-coding-programmer-expertise-jobs-threat">the
Guardian</a> and countless online discussions.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm concerned that the definition is already escaping its original
intent. I‚Äôm seeing people apply the term ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù to all forms of
code written with the assistance of AI. I think that both dilutes the
term and gives a false impression of what‚Äôs possible with responsible
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted
programming</a>.
</p>
<p>
Vibe coding is <em>not</em> the same thing as writing code with the help
of LLMs!
</p>
<p>
To quote Andrej‚Äôs
<a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original
tweet</a> in full (with my emphasis added):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There‚Äôs a new kind of coding I call ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù, where you fully give
in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and <strong>forget that the code
even exists</strong>. It‚Äôs possible because the LLMs (e.g.¬†Cursor
Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer
with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
I ask for the dumbest things like ‚Äúdecrease the padding on the sidebar
by half‚Äù because I‚Äôm too lazy to find it. I ‚ÄúAccept All‚Äù always, I don‚Äôt
read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them
in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my
usual comprehension, I‚Äôd have to really read through it for a while.
Sometimes the LLMs can‚Äôt fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for
random changes until it goes away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It‚Äôs not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite
amusing</strong>. I‚Äôm building a project or webapp, but it‚Äôs not really
coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff,
and it mostly works.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I <em>love</em> this definition. Andrej is an extremely talented and
experienced programmer - he has no need for AI assistance at all. He‚Äôs
using LLMs like this because it‚Äôs fun to try out wild new ideas, and the
speed at which an LLM can produce code is an order of magnitude faster
than even the most skilled human programmers. For low stakes projects
and prototypes why not just <em>let it rip</em>?
</p>
<p>
When I talk about vibe coding I mean <strong>building software with an
LLM without reviewing the code it writes</strong>.
</p>
<h4 id="using-llms-for-code-responsibly-is-not-vibe-coding">
Using LLMs for code responsibly is not vibe coding
</h4>
<p>
Let‚Äôs contrast this ‚Äúforget that the code even exists‚Äù approach to how
professional software developers use LLMs.
</p>
<p>
The job of a software developer is not (just) to churn out code and
features. We need to create code that demonstrably works, and can be
understood by other humans (and machines), and that will support
continued development in the future.
</p>
<p>
We need to consider performance, accessibility, security,
maintainability, cost efficiency. Software engineering is all about
trade-offs - our job is to pick from dozens of potential solutions by
balancing all manner of requirements, both explicit and implied.
</p>
<p>
We also <em>need</em> to read the code. My golden rule for
production-quality AI-assisted programming is that I won‚Äôt commit any
code to my repository if I couldn‚Äôt explain exactly what it does to
somebody else.
</p>
<p>
If an LLM wrote the code for you, and you then reviewed it, tested it
thoroughly and made sure you could explain how it works to someone else
that‚Äôs not vibe coding, it‚Äôs software development. The usage of an LLM
to support that activity is immaterial.
</p>
<p>
I wrote extensively about my own process in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">Here‚Äôs
how I use LLMs to help me write code</a>. Vibe coding only describes a
small subset of my approach.
</p>
<h4 id="let-s-not-lose-track-of-what-makes-vibe-coding-special">
Let‚Äôs not lose track of what makes vibe coding special
</h4>
<p>
I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù to become a negative term that‚Äôs synonymous
with irresponsible AI-assisted programming either. This weird new shape
of programming has so much to offer the world!
</p>
<p>
I believe <strong>everyone deserves the ability</strong> to automate
tedious tasks in their lives with computers. You shouldn‚Äôt need a
computer science degree or programming bootcamp in order to get
computers to do extremely specific tasks for you.
</p>
<p>
If vibe coding grants millions of new people the ability to build their
own custom tools, I could not be happier about it.
</p>
<p>
Some of those people will get bitten by the programming bug and go on to
become proficient software developers. One of the biggest barriers to
that profession is the incredibly steep initial learning curve - vibe
coding shaves that initial barrier down to almost flat.
</p>
<p>
Vibe coding also has a ton to offer experienced developers. I‚Äôve talked
before about how
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">using
LLMs for code is difficult</a> - figuring out what does and doesn‚Äôt work
is a case of building intuition over time, and there are plenty of
hidden sharp edges and traps along the way.
</p>
<p>
I think vibe coding is the best tool we have to help experienced
developers build that intuition as to what LLMs can and cannot do for
them. I‚Äôve published more than
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">80 experiments</a> I
built with vibe coding and I‚Äôve learned so much along the way. I would
encourage any other developer, no matter their skill level, to try the
same.
</p>
<h4 id="when-is-it-ok-to-vibe-code-">
When is it OK to vibe code?
</h4>
<p>
If you‚Äôre an experienced engineer this is likely obvious to you already,
so I‚Äôm writing this section for people who are just getting started
building software.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Projects should be <strong>low stakes</strong>. Think about how much
harm the code you are writing could cause if it has bugs or security
vulnerabilities. Could somebody be harmed - damaged reputation, lost
money or something worse? This is particularly important if you plan to
build software that will be used by other people!
</li>
<li>
Consider <strong>security</strong>. This is a really difficult one -
security is a huge topic. Some high level notes:
<ul>
<li>
Watch out for <strong>secrets</strong> - anything that looks similar in
shape to a password, such as the API key used to access an online tool.
If your code involves secrets you need to take care not to accidentally
expose them, which means you need to understand how the code works!
</li>
<li>
Think about <strong>data privacy</strong>. If you are building a tool
that has access to private data - anything you wouldn‚Äôt want to display
to the world in a screen-sharing session - approach with caution. It‚Äôs
possible to vibe code personal tools that you paste private information
into but you need to be very sure you understand if there are ways that
data might leave your machine.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Be a <strong>good network citizen</strong>. Anything that makes requests
out to other platforms could increase the load (and hence the cost) on
those services. This is a reason I like
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">Claude
Artifacts</a> - their sandbox prevents accidents from causing harm
elsewhere.
</li>
<li>
Is <strong>your money on the line</strong>? I‚Äôve seen horror stories
about people who vibe coded a feature against some API without a billing
limit and racked up thousands of dollars in charges. Be very careful
about using vibe coding against anything that‚Äôs charged based on usage.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you‚Äôre going to vibe code anything that might be used by other
people, I recommend checking in with someone more experienced for a vibe
check (hah) before you share it with the world.
</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-make-vibe-coding-better-">
How do we make vibe coding better?
</h4>
<p>
I think there are some fascinating software design challenges to be
solved here.
</p>
<p>
Safe vibe coding for complete beginners starts with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>.
Claude Artifacts was one of the first widely available vibe coding
platforms and their approach to sandboxing is fantastic: code is
restricted to running in a locked down <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, can
load only approved libraries and can‚Äôt make any network requests to
other sites.
</p>
<p>
This makes it very difficult for people to mess up and cause any harm
with their projects. It also greatly limits what those projects can do -
you can‚Äôt use a Claude Artifact project to access data from external
APIs for example, or even to build software that runs your own prompts
against an LLM.
</p>
<p>
Other popular vibe coding tools like Cursor (which was initially
intended for professional developers) have far less safety rails.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs plenty of room for innovation in this space. I‚Äôm hoping to see a
cambrian explosion in tooling to help people build their own custom
tools as productively and safely as possible.
</p>
<h4 id="go-forth-and-vibe-code">
Go forth and vibe code
</h4>
<p>
I really don‚Äôt want to discourage people who are new to software from
trying out vibe coding. The best way to learn anything is to build a
project!
</p>
<p>
For experienced programmers this is an amazing way to start developing
an intuition for what LLMs can and can‚Äôt do. For beginners there‚Äôs no
better way to open your eyes to what‚Äôs possible to achieve with code
itself.
</p>
<p>
But please, don‚Äôt confuse vibe coding with all other uses of LLMs for
code.

<strong><a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/thoughts-on-future-ai.html">My
Thoughts on the Future of "AI"</a></strong>
</p>
Nicholas Carlini, previously deeply skeptical about the utility of LLMs,
discusses at length his thoughts on where the technology might go.
</p>
<p>
He presents compelling, detailed arguments for both ends of the spectrum
- his key message is that it‚Äôs best to maintain very wide error bars for
what might happen next:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if, in three to five years, language models are
capable of performing most (all?) cognitive economically-useful tasks
beyond the level of human experts. And I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if,
in five years, the best models we have are better than the ones we have
today, but only in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ways where costs continue to decrease
considerably and capabilities continue to get better but there‚Äôs no
fundamental paradigm shift that upends the world order. To deny the
<em>potential</em> for either of these possibilities seems to me to be a
mistake.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If LLMs do hit a wall, it‚Äôs not at all clear what that wall might be:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I still believe there is something fundamental that will get in the way
of our ability to build LLMs that grow exponentially in capability. But
I will freely admit to you now that I have no earthly idea what that
limitation will be. I have no evidence that this line exists, other than
to make some form of vague argument that when you try and scale
something across many orders of magnitude, you‚Äôll probably run into
problems you didn‚Äôt see coming.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There‚Äôs lots of great stuff in here. I particularly liked this
explanation of how you get R1:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You take DeepSeek v3, and ask it to solve a bunch of hard problems, and
when it gets the answers right, you train it to do more of that and less
of whatever it did when it got the answers wrong. The idea here is
actually really simple, and it works surprisingly well.

Pebble was an early innovator in the smartwatch space, but the company

of the companies partnering with Google entered the space. So Pebble
sold it assets to Fitbit in 2016 and basically shut down. But Pebble‚Äôs

The new¬†HP Omen Transcend 14 is a compact gaming laptop that packs an
Intel Arrow Lake-H processor and NVIDIA RTX 50-Series graphics into a
body that measures 313 x 234 x 18mm (12.3‚Ä≥ x 9.2‚Ä≥ x 0.7‚Ä≥) and weighs
1.675 kg (3.7 pounds). That makes the new laptop a little heavier than
the 2024 model [‚Ä¶]

The¬†HP OmniBook 7 Aero¬†is a thin and light laptop that picks up where
the HP Pavilion Aero 13 lineup left off. While HP has dropped the
Pavilion name and given the new laptop the same OmniBook 7 branding as
some of the company‚Äôs other recent premium notebooks, the emphasis here

<p>i am sure Ezra Klein is wrong. The reason trump won is the Dems ran
the country and campaign with the same weak approach Schumer
demonstrated so well last week. If there were a supportable choice, I
would‚Äôve voted against them too. Sometimes people get left behind.
That‚Äôs the leadership of the Dems, and it isn‚Äôt about age, Jeffries had

<strong><a href="https://sno.ws/opentimes/">OpenTimes</a></strong>
</p>
Spectacular new open geospatial project by <a href="https://sno.ws/">Dan
Snow</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
OpenTimes is a database of pre-computed, point-to-point travel times
between United States Census geographies. It lets you download bulk
travel time data for free and with no limits.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://opentimes.org/?id=060816135022&amp;mode=car#9.76/37.5566/-122.3085">what
I get</a> for travel times by car from El Granada, California:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Isochrone map showing driving times from the El Granada census tract to other places in the San Francisco Bay Area" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opentimes.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
The technical details are <em>fascinating</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The entire OpenTimes backend is just static Parquet files on
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/">Cloudflare‚Äôs
R2</a>. There‚Äôs no RDBMS or running service, just files and a CDN. The
whole thing costs about $10/month to host and costs nothing to serve. In
my opinion, this is a <em>great</em> way to serve infrequently updated,
large public datasets at low cost (as long as you partition the files
correctly).
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sure enough, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">R2
pricing</a> charges ‚Äúbased on the total volume of data stored‚Äù - $0.015
/ GB-month for standard storage, then $0.36 / million requests for
‚ÄúClass B‚Äù operations which include reads. They charge nothing for
outbound bandwidth.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
All travel times were calculated by pre-building the inputs (OSM, OSRM
networks) and then distributing the compute over
<a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/workflows/calculate-times.yaml">hundreds
of GitHub Actions jobs</a>. This worked shockingly well for this
specific workload (and was also completely free).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here‚Äôs a
<a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/runs/13094249792">GitHub

params.yaml file</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The query layer uses a single DuckDB database file with <em>views</em>
that point to static Parquet files via HTTP. This lets you query a table
with hundreds of billions of records after downloading just the ~5MB
pointer file.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a really creative use of DuckDB‚Äôs feature that lets you run
queries against large data from a laptop using HTTP range queries to
avoid downloading the whole thing.

In answer to a question about adding public transit times
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392521#43393183">Dan
said</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the next year or so maybe. The biggest obstacles to adding public
transit are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Collecting all the necessary scheduling data (e.g.¬†GTFS feeds) for every
transit system in the county. Not insurmountable since there are
services that do this currently.
</li>
<li>
Finding a routing engine that can compute nation-scale travel time
matrices quickly. Currently, the two fastest open-source engines I‚Äôve
tried (OSRM and Valhalla) don‚Äôt support public transit for matrix
calculations and the engines that do support public transit (R5,
OpenTripPlanner, etc.) are too slow.
</li>
</ul>

GIMP is a free and open source image editing population that‚Äôs been
around for more than two decades. And it‚Äôs spent most of that time on
version 2 dot something or other. But after seven years of active
development toward the next version, GIMP 3.0 is finally here. The

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-small-3-1">Mistral
Small 3.1</a></strong>
</p>
Mistral Small 3
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">came
out in January</a> and was a notable, genuinely excellent local model
that used an Apache 2.0 license.
</p>
<p>
Mistral Small 3.1 offers a significant improvement: it‚Äôs multi-modal
(images) and has an increased 128,000 token context length, while still
‚Äúfitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized‚Äù
(according to their
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503">model
card</a>). Mistral‚Äôs own benchmarks show it outperforming Gemma 3 and
GPT-4o Mini, but I haven‚Äôt seen confirmation from external benchmarks.
</p>
<p>
Despite their mention of a 32GB MacBook I haven‚Äôt actually seen any
quantized GGUF or MLX releases yet, which is a little surprising since
they partnered with Ollama on launch day for their previous Mistral
Small 3. I expect we‚Äôll see various quantized models released by the
community shortly.
</p>
<p>
The model <em>is</em> available via their
<a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">La Plateforme API</a>, which
means you can access it via my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> plugin.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the model describing
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg">my
photo of two pelicans in flight</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mistral
# Run this if you have previously installed the plugin:
llm mistral refresh
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-2503 'describe' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
The image depicts two brown pelicans in flight against a clear blue sky.
Pelicans are large water birds known for their long bills and large
throat pouches, which they use for catching fish. The birds in the image
have long, pointed wings and are soaring gracefully. Their bodies are
streamlined, and their heads and necks are elongated. The pelicans
appear to be in mid-flight, possibly gliding or searching for food. The
clear blue sky in the background provides a stark contrast, highlighting
the birds‚Äô silhouettes and making them stand out prominently.

Mystery</h2>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">
When I was down at VCF SoCal I ran into a strange machine: the Keypact
Micro-VIP. It‚Äôs a terminal without a keyboard, covered in dials, with a
speaker and a switch labeled ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. This chance encounter with the
unknown sent me down a wild path. It involved the creeping spread of
computing, chicken feed, door to door life insurance salesmen, and at
least one early hacker.

on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380129">Backstory
on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</a></strong>
</p>
My TIL about
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">Styling
an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a> (here‚Äôs
the
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/side-panel-dialog">interactive
demo</a>) showed up
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225">on Hacker
News</a> this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from
Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There‚Äôs quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that
the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for
window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being
surprisingly widely used.
</p>
<p>
The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively
complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).
</p>
<p>
Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add
‚Äúoverflow:auto‚Äù, and some form of ‚Äúmax-height‚Äù/‚Äúmax-width‚Äù to ensure
that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.
</p>
<p>
The better solution to this was to add ‚Äúmax-height:stretch‚Äù,
‚Äúmax-width:stretch‚Äù. You can see
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r513642207">the
discussion for this here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the ‚Äústretch‚Äù
keyword. (Blink
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2nDt3B9E/m/kP_rKOaDAgAJ?pli=1">likely
will ‚Äúsoon‚Äù</a>)
</p>
<p>
However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a
specification - and nobody implemented it (‚Äú-webit-fill-available‚Äù would
have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn‚Äôt
have this working the same yet).
</p>
<p>
Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of ‚Äúbox-sizing:content-box‚Äù
being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that
we didn‚Äôt want to touch). [‚Ä¶]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I particularly enjoyed this insight into the challenges of evolving the
standards that underlie the web, even for something this small:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour
is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will
start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably
worse not to have done anything.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also from the comments I learned that Firefox DevTools <em>can</em> show
you user-agent styles, but that option is turned off by default -
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-update-firefox-can-show-browser-styles">notes
on that here</a>. Once I turned this option on I saw references to an
<code>html.css</code> stylesheet, so I dug around and
<a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/res/html.css">found
that in the Firefox source code</a>. Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commits/HEAD/layout/style/res/html.css">the
commit history</a> for that file on the official GitHub mirror, which
provides a detailed history of how Firefox default HTML styles have
evolved with the standards over time.
</p>
<p>
And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380255">via
uallo</a> here are the same default HTML styles for other browsers:

<p>There was a time, 1999 specifically, when writing for the web in a
web browser was a strange and new idea. That era lasted until 2006 when
Twitter emerged, removing almost all the features of writing and adding
character limits. That had enormous impact on the political and creative
worlds. The era of wood chipping people and ideas.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit">mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</a></strong>
</p>
OLMo 2 32B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/ai2/">claims
to be</a> ‚Äúthe first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and
details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o
mini‚Äù. Thanks to the MLX project here‚Äôs a recipe that worked for me to
run it on my Mac, via my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin.
</p>
<p>
To install the model:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>
That downloads 17GB to
<code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models‚Äìmlx-community‚ÄìOLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</code>.
</p>
<p>
To start an interactive chat with OLMo 2:
</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>
Or to run a prompt:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o unlimited 1
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output
tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn‚Äôt enough
to attempt to draw a pelican.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53f00731d494439d4aeca6bdd55368ca">pelican
it drew</a> is refreshingly abstract:
