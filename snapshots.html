id="phoenix.new-is-flys-entry-into-the-prompt-driven-app-development-space">Phoenix.new
is Fly‚Äôs entry into the prompt-driven app development space</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a fascinating new entrant into the AI-assisted-programming /
coding-agents space by <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, introduced
on their blog in
<a href="https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/">Phoenix.new
‚Äì The Remote AI Runtime for Phoenix</a>: describe an app in a prompt,
get a full Phoenix application, backed by SQLite and running on Fly‚Äôs
hosting platform. The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du7GmWGUM5Y">official
Phoenix.new YouTube launch video</a> is a good way to get a sense for
what this does.
</p>
<h4 id="background-on-phoenix-and-elixir-and-fly">
Background on Phoenix and Elixir and Fly
</h4>
<p>
First, some background.
<a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is an open
source web framework for Elixir, the Ruby-like language that compiles to
Erlang‚Äôs BEAM bytecode and runs on top of the highly concurrent Erlang
runtime. The signature feature of the framework is
<a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/main/README.md#feature-highlights">Phoenix
LiveView</a>, a toolkit for building realtime interfaces through
streaming diffs to server-side HTML over a WebSocket connection.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix was created by Chris McCord 11 years ago, and Chris joined Fly
nearly four years ago. <a href="http://phoenix.new/">Phoenix.new</a> is
his latest project.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix LiveView is a really great fit for Fly‚Äôs geographically
distributed application serving infrastructure. Fly co-founder Kurt
Mackey <a href="https://fly.io/blog/low-latency-liveview/">wrote about
that</a> in April 2021, before they had hired Chris, describing how
LiveView benefits from low latency by ‚Äúmoving app processes close to
users‚Äù - something Fly has been designed to help with from the start.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs one major challenge though: Elixir is still a niche programming
language, which means the number of people out there who are ready to
spin up a new Phoenix app has always been artificially limited.
</p>
<p>
Fly‚Äôs solution? Get LLMs to shave that learning curve down to <em>almost
nothing</em>.
</p>
<h4 id="prompt-driven-application-development-with-phoenix-new">
Prompt-driven application development with Phoenix.new
</h4>
<p>
Phoenix.new is a prompt-driven application development platform. You
describe what you want to build, then watch as an LLM-powered coding
agent writes, tests and iterates on code to help achieve that goal. It‚Äôs
in the same broad category as
<a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a>,
<a href="https://v0.dev/">v0.dev</a> and and
<a href="https://townie.val.run/">Val Town‚Äôs Townie</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important problems to solve with coding agents is to
give them a robust sandbox where they can run code without breaking
things outside of that space. Fly, at their heart, are a sandboxing
company - their <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines</a>
product makes it trivial to spin up a new sandboxed VM in just a few
seconds. I‚Äôm building <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette
Cloud</a> on Fly for exactly that reason.
</p>
<p>
I tried out Phoenix.new with the following starter prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>A notebook application. Notes are rich text, using a nice visual
markdown editors. The first line of a note becomes the title. Notes have
a URL that is a 6 character random text string - thise can be used to
link notes to each other by dropping in an @ sign and that text string.
A hash and then text becomes a tag, clicking a tag goes to a page with
that tag on. Notes are all in SQLite FTS so they can be searched with a
search tool.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Watching it work was <em>fascinating</em>. It provides a full IDE-style
environment in the browser, running a dedicated container and with a
forwarded port to allow you to interact with the running application
<em>while it is being built</em>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/phoenix-new.jpg" alt="Browser IDE interface showing a notebook app development project with a left sidebar containing a chat session that starts &quot;What would you like to build?&quot; with options like &quot;todo list&quot;, &quot;chat app&quot;, &quot;product landing page&quot;, then a main editor displaying plan.md file with detailed development steps including &quot;Generate a Phoenix LiveView project called 'notebook'&quot; and &quot;Start the server so you can view the app as we build it&quot;. The bottom has a terminal showing &quot;All dependencies are up to date&quot;, &quot;Generated notebook app&quot;, &quot;Done in 241ms&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
It spun up a <code>plan.md</code>, planned out the approach and started
working through the code. Most interestingly, it constantly tested the
application it was building using a testing tool that looked similar to
my own <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a>.
Here‚Äôs an example of the output from that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can see the issue! The page is still showing the ‚ÄúWelcome to your
Notebook‚Äù message instead of the form. Let me wait a moment for the
JavaScript to execute and then check if the form appeared.
</p>
<p>
<code>$ web http://localhost:4000 ‚Äìjs ‚ÄúsetTimeout(() =&gt; {
document.querySelector(‚Äòbutton[phx-click="start_creating"]‚Äô).click(); },
500); setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log(‚ÄòForm visible?‚Äô,
!!document.querySelector(‚Äòtextarea‚Äô)); console.log(‚ÄòCreating note
state:‚Äô, document.body.innerHTML.includes(‚ÄòCreate New Note‚Äô)); },
2000);‚Äù</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm used to coding agents that write and execute their own tests, but
this is the most impressive example I‚Äôve seen of a coding agent that
actively interacts with and tests the live application while it is
iterating on the code.
</p>
<p>
Most interestingly of all, since LiveView is a realtime framework, I
could interact directly with the application at the same time as the
machine was writing and testing it, seeing any changes it made instantly
in my browser!
</p>
<p>
How did it do? It got there in the end, but with hindsight my initial
prompt was a little too complex: I had to rescue it after it got stuck
in an error loop trying to implement SQLite full-text search. Just like
a project you build yourself it turns out to work much better if you
start with the simplest possible version of the application and then
iterate on it to add additional features.
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite details is how Git integration works. Phoenix.new
commits constantly as it works, and a menu option for ‚ÄúClone X to your
local computer‚Äù then gives you a command that looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>git clone
‚Äúhttps://phoenix.new/git/WENQLj‚Ä¶big-random-string‚Ä¶VHFW/$RANDOM/notebook‚Äù</code>
</p>
<p>
Run that locally to get a full copy of the repo! I ran the following to
push it to a new repository in my GitHub account:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>git remote add github https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook.git
git push -u github main</pre>
</div>
<p>
You can see the code (and the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook/commits">commit
history</a>) in my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook">simonw/phoenix-new-notebook</a>
repo.
</p>
<h4 id="how-much-did-i-learn-">
How much did I learn?
</h4>
<p>
My initial experiments with Phoenix.new were very much
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe
coding</a> - I interacted with the resulting application but didn‚Äôt pay
a great deal of attention to the code that was being written, despite it
being presented to me in an IDE that made it very easy to review what
was going on.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I didn‚Äôt learn much about the low-level syntax details of
how Phoenix and Elixir work. I did however get a strong feel for the
<em>shape</em> of Elixir and Phoenix at a high level as the code danced
past my eye.
</p>
<p>
It turns out having an LLM write an application in front of you is a
great way to start building understanding of what a framework can do.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs almost like watching a YouTube livestream of an experienced
developer speed running building an application, except that app is
exactly what you asked them to build and you can interject and send them
in a new direction at any moment.
</p>
<h4 id="expanding-beyond-elixir-and-phoenix">
Expanding beyond Elixir and Phoenix
</h4>
<p>
Chris‚Äôs announcement included this note:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At this point you might be wondering ‚Äì can I just ask it to build a
Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can.
</p>
<p>
Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care
about are already installed. We‚Äôre still figuring out where to take
this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in
my plans.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The browser-based IDE includes a terminal, and I checked and
<code>python3</code> and <code>python3 -m pip install datasette</code>
work there already.
</p>
<p>
If Fly do evolve this into a framework-agnostic tool for building web
apps they‚Äôll probably need to rebrand it from Phoenix.new to something a
bit more generic!
</p>
<p>
Phoenix.new is currently priced as a $20/month subscription. Val Town
recently switched the pricing for their similar Townie assistant from a
subscription to to <a href="https://blog.val.town/townie-credits">pay
per use</a>, presumably because for many users this kind of tool is
something they would only use intermittently, although given the
capabilities of Phoenix.new it‚Äôs possible it could become a monthly
driver for people, especially as it expands out to cover more
frameworks.
