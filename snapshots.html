<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Michael Tsai</p>
<p>Krish Shah (via Hacker News): TrackWeight is a macOS application that
transforms your MacBook’s trackpad into an accurate weighing scale by
leveraging the Force Touch pressure sensors built into modern MacBook
trackpads.[…]TrackWeight utilizes the Open Multi-Touch Support library

events on macOS. This library […]</p>

version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal
standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/">Advanced
version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal
standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI beat them to the punch in terms of publicity by
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">publishing
their results on Saturday</a>, but a team from Google Gemini achieved an
equally impressive result on this year’s International Mathematics
Olympiad scoring a gold medal performance with their custom research
model.
</p>
<p>
(I saw an unconfirmed rumor that the Gemini team had to wait until
Monday for approval from Google PR.)
</p>
<p>
It’s interesting that Gemini achieved the <em>exact same score</em> as
OpenAI, 35/42, and were able to solve the same set of questions - 1
through 5, failing only to answer 6, which is designed to be the hardest
question.
</p>
<p>
Each question is worth seven points, so 35/42 cents corresponds to full
marks on five out of the six problems.
</p>
<p>
Only 6 of
<a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2025">the
630 human contestants</a> this year scored all 7 points for question 6
this year, and just 55 more had greater than 0 points for that question.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI claimed their model had not been optimized for IMO questions.
Gemini’s model was different - emphasis mine:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We achieved this year’s result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep
Think – an enhanced reasoning mode for complex problems that
incorporates some of our latest research techniques, including parallel
thinking. This setup enables the model to simultaneously explore and
combine multiple possible solutions before giving a final answer, rather
than pursuing a single, linear chain of thought.
</p>
<p>
To make the most of the reasoning capabilities of Deep Think, we
additionally trained this version of Gemini on novel reinforcement
learning techniques that can leverage more multi-step reasoning,
problem-solving and theorem-proving data. <strong>We also provided
Gemini with access to a curated corpus of high-quality solutions to
mathematics problems, and added some general hints and tips on how to
approach IMO problems to its instructions</strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Gemini team, like the OpenAI team, achieved this result with
<a href="https://x.com/fredzhang0/status/1947364744412758305">no tool
use or internet access</a> for the model.
</p>
<p>
Gemini’s solutions are listed
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/IMO_2025.pdf">in
this PDF</a>. If you are mathematically inclined you can compare them
with OpenAI’s solutions
<a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/">on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last year Google DeepMind
<a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">achieved
a silver medal in IMO</a>, solving four of the six problems using custom
models called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical
language for our systems to understand. In the official competition,
students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems
solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the
others.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>This year’s result, scoring gold with a single model, within the
allotted time and with no manual step to translate the problems first,
is much more impressive.</p>

<p>
An AI tool that
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">gets
gold on the IMO</a> is obviously immensely impressive. Does it mean math
is “solved”? Is an AI-generated proof of the Riemann hypothesis clearly
on the horizon? Obviously not.
</p>
<p>
Worth keeping timescales in mind here: IMO competitors spend an average
of 1.5 hrs on each problem. High-quality math research, by contrast,
takes month or years.
</p>
<p>
What are the obstructions to AI performing high-quality autonomous math
research? I don’t claim to know for sure, but I think they include many
of the same obstructions that prevent it from doing many jobs: Long
context, long-term planning, consistency, unclear rewards, lack of
training data, etc.
</p>
<p>
It’s possible that some or all of these will be solved soon (or have
been solved) but I think it’s worth being cautious about over-indexing
on recent (amazing) progress.

<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve been writing documentation and technical articles for more than a
decade now. One piece of feedback I consistently got from managers and
peers during all these years is how <em>fast</em> I am when producing
and releasing docs. For example, I was once asked to document a new
feature from a team I wasn’t serving two weeks ahead of launch.
Everything was new to me, but I had most of the docs drafted after four
days. By launch, the docs had been deemed ready to go live.

LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update)</h2>

<strong><a href="https://antirez.com/news/154">Coding with LLMs in the
summer of 2025 (an update)</a></strong>
</p>
Salvatore Sanfilippo describes his current AI-assisted development
workflow. He’s all-in on LLMs for code review, exploratory prototyping,
pair-design and writing “part of the code under your clear
specifications”, but warns against leaning too hard on pure vibe coding:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But while LLMs can write part of a code base with success (under your
strict supervision, see later), and produce a very sensible speedup in
development (or, the ability to develop more/better in the same time
used in the past — which is what I do), when left alone with nontrivial
goals they tend to produce fragile code bases that are larger than
needed, complex, full of local minima choices, suboptimal in many ways.
Moreover they just fail completely when the task at hand is more complex
than a given level.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are plenty of useful tips in there, especially around carefully
managing your context:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When your goal is to reason with an LLM about implementing or fixing
some code, you need to provide extensive information to the LLM: papers,
big parts of the target code base (all the code base if possible, unless
this is going to make the context window so large than the LLM
performances will be impaired). And a brain dump of all your
understanding of what should be done.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Salvatore warns against relying too hard on tools which hide the context
for you, like editors with integrated coding agents. He prefers pasting
exactly what’s needed into the LLM web interface - I share his
preference there.
</p>
<p>
His conclusions here match
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">my
experience</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You will be able to do things that are otherwise at the borders of your
knowledge / expertise while learning much in the process (yes, you can
learn from LLMs, as you can learn from books or colleagues: it is one of
the forms of education possible, a new one). Yet, everything produced
will follow your idea of code and product, and will be of high quality
and will not random fail because of errors and shortcomings introduced
by the LLM. You will also retain a strong understanding of all the code
written and its design.

The MeLE Overclock X2 is a compact desktop computer that’s barely larger

Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to
make ChatGPT build something. Lucky for us: in many of those cases the
AI picks Python. We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate
an expansion in the kinds of people who might want to attend a Python
conference. Yet many of these new programmers are not even aware that
programming communities and conferences exist. It’s in the Python
community’s interest to find ways to pull them in.

There’s a bigger opportunity in computer science and programming
(academically conveyed or self-taught) now than ever before, by far, in
my opinion. The move to AI is like replacing shovels with bulldozers.
Every business will benefit from this and they’ll need people to do it.
