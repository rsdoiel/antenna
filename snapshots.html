Circulation of Rhetoric from Stall Walls to Social Feeds: Notes from the
Analog Underground</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News</p>
There is something profoundly democratic about a bathroom stall. No
velvet rope, no blue check, no institutional imprimatur‚Äînot even a
username. Just a flat surface, a stylus, and the uncorked bile of a
writer who neither sought nor needed your permission. And while many a
self-serious theorist has long since baptized digital platforms as the

<h2 id="copying-spinoza">Copying Spinoza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve run into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> a few
times, sometimes in unexpected places like <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, but I‚Äôve not
yet spent any time reading his work. He popped up in a recent Between
the Covers <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">podcast</a>
interview with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine Thien</a>
about her new book <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a>. You‚Äôll have to listen to the interview, or read the
book, to get a sense of how the book works, but it‚Äôs my understanding
that the main character is a refugee, and yet was able to bring with her
three slim books from a series calle dThe Great Lives of Voyagers, one
of which is about Spinoza, the others being about Du Fu and Hannah
Arendt. I believe that readings of these fictional books form part of
The Book of Records.
</p>
<p>
During the interview Thien was asked about the importance of these
stories, and friendships to her work as a writer‚Ä¶not only friendships
with contemporaries, but across time as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It‚Äôs certainly true when I placed all the stories side by side, or as
they began to weave through each other, that it became clear that all of
them are at times, many times, sometimes, saved by another, and none of
their work would reach us had these acts of friendship not occurred. And
Moriel asked about that idea of friendship across the centuries between
the living and the dead. I was always struck by Hannah Arendt writing
about Rahel Varnhagen and saying she was my best friend even though she
had died a hundred years ago before her. I often felt this with the
three figures who were moving around in the Sea, that they were amazed
that we wanted to sit with them, even if we didn‚Äôt always agree with
them, even if we might have quite serious critiques of some of their
ideas. But even then, the desire to value the teacher, to value the
teaching, and to understand what it was that each of us might be looking
for each time we sit with a text, with a person, with another human
being, <em>I only really feel like I was with Spinoza when I, over many
months, copied up Ethics.</em> I understood then the way the geometry
would work on a person‚Äôs mind, that it is such a step-by-step process,
that text. One thing really must be understood before one moves to the
next proposition. One has to draw the angles of the triangle and the
measurements and understand what a triangle is before one can begin to
‚Äúconstellate‚Äù it with other things. That‚Äôs very much how Ethics works.
It is this seed, that everything that it contains is in it from its
first axioms, its first propositions, and you can kind of unfold them
and see how that all works.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This idea of <em>copying</em> Spinoza‚Äôs Ethics in an effort to form an
understanding and a friendship with him is compelling. I kind of would
like to try this. To get a copy of Ethics, and a blank notebook and just
copy it out. I thought maybe it would be fun to try do this with others,
to meet and discuss, and share our notebooks? If this sounds like
something you might like to do please <a
href="mailto:ehs@pobox.com">get in touch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I learned while reading about Spinoza‚Äôs <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza%27s_Ethics">Ethics,
Demonstrated in Geometric Order</a> on Wikipedia is that the first
translation into English was done by [George Eliot] in 1883, and it was
left unpublished until almost a hundred years later in 1981. Spinoza
wrote the book over 14 years and it was only published after he died.

<strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-embedding/">Qwen3
Embedding</a></strong>
</p>
New family of embedding models from Qwen, in three sizes: 0.6B, 4B, 8B -
and two categories: Text Embedding and Text Reranking.
</p>
<p>
The full collection
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-embedding-6841b2055b99c44d9a4c371f">can
be browsed</a> on Hugging Face. The smallest available model is the 0.6B
Q8 one, which is available as a 639MB GGUF. I tried it out using my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a>
plugin like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
llm embed -m sentence-transformers/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B -c hi | jq length
</code></pre>
<p>
This output 1024, confirming that Qwen3 0.6B produces 1024 length
embedding vectors.
</p>
<p>
These new models are the highest scoring open-weight models on the well
regarded <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB
leaderboard</a> - they‚Äôre licensed Apache 2.0.
</p>

Most models show 99% zero-shot performance with green highlighting, except gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct at rank 6 which shows &quot;NA&quot; with red highlighting and a warning triangle icon." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-mteb.jpg" />

<p>
You can also try them out in your web browser, thanks to a
