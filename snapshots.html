<h2 id="making-my-github-heatmap-widget">Making my GitHub heatmap
widget</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
<em>For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available

</p>
<p>
This post is about how I made the GitHub heatmap widget on my site.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the raw, live WebComponent <code>&lt;gh-contribs&gt;</code> by
the way:

<h2>
Scraping the data
</h2>
<p>
First, I had to scrape the heatmap data. I don’t know if there’s a
proper API, but I found an endpoint that renders an HTML partial of what
I wanted.
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, the GitHub website today works using partial HTMLs to
update its UI without reloading the whole page. I think this endpoint
populates the contribution graph section of the profile page.
</p>
<p>
The endpoint that returns a user’s contribution graph is
<a href="https://github.com/users/Kalabasa/contributions" target="_blank"><code>https://github.com/users/{username}/contributions</code></a>.
I presume the user has to have contribution stats public. This
undocumented API could also break at any time. 😬
</p>

<figcaption>
The response HTML for my github.com/users/Kalabasa/contributions
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Loading this endpoint gives you an unstyled piece of HTML containing an
HTML table of contribution data and other UI. The table cells are
invisible because of the lack of styles! When embedded in the profile
page, it inherits the appropriate styling in context.
</p>
<p><img alt="styled contribution table" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/github-heatmap-widget/contributions-styled.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="741" height="204"></p>
<p>
The first column is the weekday label, and the rest of the cells seem to
represent a single day each. The data is encoded in the HTML that
presents the data! This reminds me of
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/" target="_blank">Hypermedia as
the Engine of Application State</a>. html = data.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr style="height: 10px"&gt;
  &lt;td class="ContributionCalendar-label" style="position: relative"&gt;
    &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Monday&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span aria-hidden="true" style="clip-path: None; position: absolute; bottom: -3px"&gt;
      Mon
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;

    class="ContributionCalendar-day"&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
  <!--...--></code></pre>
<p>
What I was looking for here was the <code>data-level</code> attribute on
each cell. It contains a coarse integer value that indicates the
activity level for the day.
</p>
<p>
Coupled with the <code>data-date</code> attribute, it became rather easy
to scrape this data! Instead of keeping track of columns and rows, I
just go through each <code>data-date</code> and <code>data-level</code>
as a (date,level) data point.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my parse function using
<a href="https://cheerio.js.org/" target="_blank">cheerio</a>, a jQuery
clone for Node.js.
</p>
<pre><code>const res = await fetch(
  "https://github.com/users/Kalabasa/contributions");
let data = parseContribs(await res.text());

/**
 * Parses a GitHub contribution calendar HTML string and extracts contribution data.
 *
 * @param {string} html - The HTML string containing the GitHub contribution calendar.
 * @returns {{ date: Date, level: number }[]} Array of contribution objects with date and activity level.
 * @throws {Error} If the contribution calendar table cannot be found in the HTML.
 */
function parseContribs(html) {
  const ch = cheerio.load(html);
  const chTable = ch("table.ContributionCalendar-grid");
  if (!chTable.length) throw new Error("Can't find table.");
  const chDays = chTable.find("[data-date]");
  const data = chDays
    .map((_, el) =&gt; {
      const chDay = ch(el);
      const date = new Date(chDay.attr("data-date"));
      const level = parseInt(chDay.attr("data-level"), 10);
      return { date, level };
    })
    .get();
  return data;
}</code></pre>
<p>This data is scraped at regular intervals, reformatted into a grid,
and saved into a compact JSON format for later consumption and rendering
by the WebComponent on the client.</p>
<pre><code>// gh-contribs.json
[
  [1,2,1,2,2,1,1],
  [0,1,0,2,0,1,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,0],
  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0],
  [0,0,1,0,0,0]
]</code></pre>
<h2>
Rendering the data
</h2>
<p>
The reason why the data is reformatted into a grid like that is to make
the rendering logic straightforward. The data is structured so that it
can be directly converted into HTML without thinking in dates and weeks
that are in the original data.
</p>
<p>
Here are the current JSON and WebComponent side by side. Each row in the
data gets directly rendered as a column in the component.
</p>
<auto-grid> <code-block language="js">
<pre><code>
      <pre>Interactive content: <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/github-heatmap-widget/?ref=rss">Visit the post to interact with this content.</a>
Alternative name: Inline script</pre>

<pre>Interactive content: <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/github-heatmap-widget/?ref=rss">Visit the post to interact with this content.</a>
Alternative name: Gh Contribs</pre>
</auto-grid>
<p>
As such, <code>&lt;gh-contribs&gt;</code>’s initialisation logic is
really simple:
</p>
<pre><code>const contribs = await fetch(
  "path/to/gh-contribs.json"
).then((res) =&gt; res.json());

let htmlString = "";
for (const col of contribs) {
  for (const level of col) {
    htmlString += html`&lt;div data-level="${level}"&gt;${level}&lt;/div&gt;`;
  }
}
this.innerHTML = htmlString;</code></pre>
<p>Add some CSS and it’s done:</p>
<pre><code>gh-contribs {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(7, auto);
  gap: 12px;
  div {
    position: relative;
    width: 18px;
    height: 18px;
    background: #222c2c;
    color: transparent;
    &amp;::after {
      content: "";
      position: absolute;
      inset: 0;
      background: #54f8c1;
    }
    &amp;[data-level="0"]::after {
      opacity: 0;
    }
    &amp;[data-level="1"]::after {
      opacity: 0.3;
    }
    &amp;[data-level="2"]::after {
      opacity: 0.6;
    }
    &amp;[data-level="3"]::after {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<h2>
Why not use the original HTML?
</h2>
<p>
Why not just embed the contributions HTML from GitHub? Slice the
relevant <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s…? Why
parse the original HTML table, convert it to JSON, then render it as
HTML again?
</p>
<p>
The main reason to do [HTML → JSON → HTML] is to remain flexible. As you
know, that endpoint is undocumented. Also, depending on the HTML
structure of the original is risky. Risk of breakage, risk of unwanted
content, etc.
</p>
<p>
This way, I can change how I get the data without refactoring the
WebComponent. I could go [<strong>GitHub API</strong> → JSON → HTML] or
[<strong>local git script</strong> → JSON → HTML] or whatever.
</p>
<p>
It also works the other end. I actually rewrote this widget recently
(from statically-generated HTML into a WebComponent) without having to
change the scraper script or the JSON data structure.
</p>
<h2>
Final touches
</h2>
<p>
The WebComponent renders just the grid itself for flexibility. This let
me use it in different ways, like with an icon and heading as in the
home page.

ChatGPT sharing dialog demonstrates how difficult it is to design

<p>date: 2025-08-03, updated: 2025-08-03, from: Simon Willison’s

<p>
ChatGPT just removed their “make this chat discoverable” sharing
feature, after it turned out a material volume of users had
inadvertantly made their private chats available via Google search.
</p>
<p>
Dane Stuckey, CISO for OpenAI,
<a href="https://x.com/cryps1s/status/1951041845938499669">on
Twitter</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We just removed a feature from <span class="citation"
data-cites="ChatGPTapp">@ChatGPTapp</span> that allowed users to make
their conversations discoverable by search engines, such as Google. This
was a short-lived experiment to help people discover useful
conversations. […]
</p>
<p>
Ultimately we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for
folks to accidentally share things they didn’t intend to, so we’re
removing the option.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There’s been some media coverage of this issue - here are examples from
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/your-public-chatgpt-queries-are-getting-indexed-by-google-and-other-search-engines/">TechCrunch</a>,
<a href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/chatgpt/openai-pulls-chat-sharing-tool-after-google-search-privacy-scare">TechRadar</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/be-careful-what-you-tell-chatgpt-your-chats-could-show-up-on-google-search">PCMag</a>.
</p>
<p>
It turned out users had shared extremely private conversations and made
them discoverable by search engines, which meant that various
<code>site:chatgpt.com …</code> searches were turning up all sorts of
potentially embarrassing details.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what that UI looked like before they removed the option:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/chatgpt-share.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a chat sharing dialog with title &quot;Public link created&quot; and X close button. Text reads &quot;A public link to your chat has been created.

The sharing URL shown is &quot;https://chatgpt.com/share/688b95ef-f986&quot; with a black &quot;Copy link&quot; button. At bottom are three social sharing icons for LinkedIn, Reddit, and X." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen a bunch of commentary, both on Twitter and
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44778764">this Hacker News
thread</a>, from people who are baffled that anyone could be confused by
such a clear option in the UI.
</p>
<p>
I think that confusion is warranted. Let’s break it down.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the microcopy in question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Make this chat discoverable</strong><br /> Allows it to be shown
in web searches.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first problem here is the choice of terminology. “Discoverable” is
not a widely understood term - it’s insider jargon. “Allows it to be
shown in web searches” is better, but still requires a surprisng depth
of understanding from users before they can make an informed decision.
</p>
<p>
Here’s everything a user would need to understand for this to make sense
to them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What a URL is, and how it’s posssible to create a URL that is
semi-public in that it’s unguessable by others but can still be read by
anyone you share it with. That concept is a pretty tall order just on
its own!
</li>
<li>
What a web search engine is - that in this case it’s intended as a
generic term for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo etc.
</li>
<li>
That “web search” here means “those public search engines other people
can use” and not something like “the private search feature you use on
this website”.
</li>
<li>
A loose understanding of how search engines work: that they have
indexes, and those indexes can selectively include or exclude content.
</li>
<li>
That sites like ChatGPT get to control whether or not their content is
included in those indexes.
</li>
<li>
That the nature of a “secret URL” is that, once shared and made
discoverable, anyone with that link (or who finds it through search) can
now view the full content of that page.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
ChatGPT has over a billion users now. That means there is a giant range
of levels of technical expertise among those users. We can’t assume that
everyone understands the above concepts necessary to understand the
implications of checking that box.
</p>
<p>
And even if they have the pre-requisite knowledge required to understand
this, <strong>users don’t read</strong>.
</p>
<p>
When people are using an application they are always looking for the
absolute shortest path to achieving their goal. Any dialog box or
question that appears is something to be skipped over as quickly as
possible.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, a lot of users may have learned to just say “yes” to any
question. This option about making something “discoverable”? Sure,
whatever, click the box and keep on going.
</p>
<p>
I think there’s another factor at play here too: the option itself makes
almost no sense.
</p>
<p>
How many people looking for a way to share their chats are going to
think “and you know what? Stick this in Google too”?
</p>
<p>
It’s such a tiny fraction of the audience that a logical conclusion,
when faced with the above option, could well be that obviously it
wouldn’t put my chats in Google because who on Earth would ever want
that to happen?
</p>
<p>
I think OpenAI made the right call disabling this feature. The value it
can provide for the tiny set of people who decide to use it is massively
outweighed by the potential for less discerning users to cause
themselves harm by inadvertently sharing their private conversations
with the world.
</p>
<h4 id="meta-ai-does-this-even-worse">
Meta AI does this even worse
</h4>
<p>
A much worse example of this anti-pattern is Meta AI’s decision to
provide a “Post to feed” button in their own Meta AI chat app:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/meta-ai-share.jpg" alt="Sharing dialog has two options: Post to feed - share this conversation to the public feed so anyone can see it and engage. and Share a link: Create a link to share this conversation with specific people." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
I think their microcopy here is <em>top notch</em> - the text here uses
clear language and should be easy for anyone to understand.
</p>
<p>
(I took this screenshot today though, so it’s possible the text has been
recently updated.)
</p>
<p>
And yet… Futurism, June 14th:
<a href="https://futurism.com/meta-ai-embarassing">People Don’t Realize
Meta’s AI App Is Publicly Blasting Their Humiliating Secrets to the
World</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once again, when your users number in the millions some of them are
going to randomly click things without understanding the consequences.
</p>
<p>
The Meta AI iPhone app (fun fact: it can talk to you in the voice of
Dame Judi Dench or John Cena) shows that public feed on the homepage
when you first open the app, presumably to try and help people get over
the blank slate “what is this thing even for” problem. They do not
appear keen on losing this feature!

to <a href="https://www.qbitai.com/2024/07/168071.html">this Chinese

Ivan Fioravanti
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/models?search=xbai-o4">got
it working under MLX</a> in 4bit, 5bit, 6bit, 8bit and 4bit-DWQ sizes. I
tried his
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/XBai-o4-6bit">6bit one</a>
(a 24.81GB download) in LM Studio and had it “Generate an SVG of a
pelican riding a bicycle”. It thought for 39.49 seconds
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/78182fc3409e36f8d22217992967b9d6#response">thinking
trace here</a>) and gave me this:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The pelican is blue and looks a little like a sad elephant. The bicycle looks more like a flat motorbike. The pelican has a blue tail and orange legs." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/xbai-o4-pelican.png" />
</p>
<p>
I also had it “Write an HTML and JavaScript page implementing space
invaders”, which you can
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/space-invaders-xbai-o4-6bit-mlx">try
out here</a>. It’s not great - the invaders don’t fire bullets (it
listed that as a “potential improvement”) and I don’t think it’s
winnable due to timing issues, but it’s an interesting addition to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/space-invaders/">my
collection</a>.
</p>
<p>
LM Studio reported a constant memory usage of 25.54GB and according to
Activity Monitor used 87.5% of my GPU and around 39% of a CPU core.
</p>
<p>
It did a <em>lot</em> of work in the thinking trace - which took 10m35s!
- including writing the first draft of much of the code that ended up in
the finished result. Here’s an extract:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let me think of variables:
</p>
<p>
<code>let enemyDirection = 1; // 1 for right, -1 for left</code>
</p>
<p>
In the game loop: <code>enemies.forEach(enemy =&gt; {&gt; enemy.x +=
enemyDirection * enemy.dx;&gt; });</code> Then check if any enemy is out
of bounds. If so, reverse direction and move all enemies down.
</p>
<p>
But how to check if any enemy is at the edge?
</p>
<p>
Maybe find the max x of all enemies and see if it exceeds
<code>canvas.width - enemy.width</code>.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, track the leftmost and rightmost positions of enemies.
Maybe a bit complex.
</p>
<p>
For simplicity, perhaps check if any enemy’s <code>x + width &gt;
canvas.width or x &lt; 0</code>.
</p>
</blockquote>

My initial impressions are that I’m not as impressed with this model for
running on my own laptop as I was with
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/31/qwen3-coder-flash/">Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct</a>
or

Air</a>.
</p>
<p>
<p>But… how extraordinary is it that <em>another</em> Chinese AI lab has
been able to produce a competitive model, this time with far less
fanfare than we’ve seen from Qwen and Moonshot AI and Z.ai.</p>

<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>

be the next big thing in 2025. It hasn’t quite turned out that way.</p>

<h2 id="from-asyncawait-to-virtual-threads">From Async/Await to Virtual
Threads</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, updated: 2025-08-03, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/7/26/virtual-threads/">From
Async/Await to Virtual Threads</a></strong>
</p>
Armin Ronacher has long been critical of async/await in Python, both for
necessitating
<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">colored
functions</a> and because of the more subtle challenges they introduce
like
<a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">managing
back pressure</a>.
</p>
<p>
Armin
<a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/11/18/threads-beat-async-await/">argued
convincingly</a> for the threaded programming model back in December.
Now he’s expanded upon that with a description of how virtual threads
might make sense in Python.
</p>
<p>
Virtual threads behave like real system threads but can vastly outnumber
them, since they can be paused and scheduled to run on a real thread
when needed. Go uses this trick to implement goroutines which can then
support millions of virtual threads on a single system.
</p>
<p>
Python core developer Mark Shannon
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/add-virtual-threads-to-python/91403">started
a conversation</a> about the potential for seeing virtual threads to
Python back in May.
</p>
<p>
<p>Assuming this proposal turns into something concrete I don’t expect
we will see it in a production Python release for a few more years. In
the meantime there are some exciting improvements to the Python
concurrency story - most notably
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-pep734">around
sub-interpreters</a> - coming up this year in Python 3.14.</p>
