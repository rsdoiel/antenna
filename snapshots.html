      Alexander Gromnitsky (via Hacker News): At the time of writing, the most recent Adobe Reader 25.x.y.z 64-bit installer for Windows 11 weights 687,230,424 bytes. After installation, the program includes &#8216;AI&#8217; (of course), an auto-updater, sprinkled ads for Acrobat online services everywhere, and 2 GUIs: &#8217;new&#8217; and &#8216;old&#8217;.

      <h1>The perils of vibe coding</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, updated: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b3d410a-6e02-41ad-9e0a-c2e4d672ca00">The perils of vibe coding</a></strong></p>
I was interviewed by Elaine Moore for this opinion piece in the Financial Times, which ended up in the print edition of the paper too! I picked up a copy yesterday:</p>
<p><a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg" style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg" alt="The perils of vibe coding - A new OpenAI model arrived this month with a glossy livestream, group watch parties and a lingering sense of disappointment. The YouTube comment section was underwhelmed. “I think they are all starting to realize this isn’t going to become the world like they thought it would,” wrote one viewer. “I can see it on their faces.” But if the casual user was unimpressed, the AI model’s saving grace may be vibe. Coding is generative AI’s newest battleground. With big bills to pay, high valuations to live up to and a market wobble to erase, the sector needs to prove its corporate productivity chops. Coding is hardly promoted as a business use case that already works. For one thing, AI-generated code holds the promise of replacing programmers — a profession of very well paid people. For another, the work can be quantified. In April, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said that up to 50 per cent of the company’s code was now being written by AI. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has said the same thing. Salesforce has paused engineering hires and Mark Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan that Meta would use AI as a “mid-level engineer” that writes code. Meanwhile, start-ups such as Replit and Cursor’s Anysphere are trying to persuade people that with AI, anyone can code. In theory, every employee can become a software engineer. So why aren’t we? One possibility is that it’s all still too unfamiliar. But when I ask people who write code for a living they offer an alternative suggestion: unpredictability. As programmer Simon Willison put it: “A lot of people are missing how weird and funny this space is. I’ve been a computer programmer for 30 years and [AI models] don’t behave like normal computers.” Willison is well known in the software engineering community for his AI experiments. He’s an enthusiastic vibe coder — using LLMs to generate code using natural language prompts. OpenAI’s latest model GPT-3.1s, he is now favourite. Still, he predicts that a vibe coding crash is due if it is used to produce glitchy software. It makes sense that programmers — people who are interested in finding new ways to solve problems — would be early adopters of LLMs. Code is a language, albeit an abstract one. And generative AI is trained in nearly all of them, including older ones like Cobol. That doesn’t mean they accept all of its suggestions. Willison thinks the best way to see what a new model can do is to ask for something unusual. He likes to request an svg (an image made out of lines described with code) of a pelican on a bike and asks it to remember the chickens in his garden by name. Results can be bizarre. One model ignored key prompts in favour of composing a poem. Still, his adventures in vibe coding sound like an advert for the sector’s future. Anthropic’s Claude Code, the favoured model for developers, to make an OCR (optical character recognition) software loves screenshots) tool that will copy and paste text from a screenshot. He wrote software that summarises blog comments and has planned to cut a custom tool that will alert him when a whale is visible from his Pacific coast home. All this by typing prompts in English. It’s sounds like the sort of thing Bill Gates might have had in mind when he wrote that natural language AI agents would bring about “the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons”. But watching code appear and know how it works are two different things. My efforts to make my own comment summary tool produced something unworkable that gave overly long answers and then congratulated itself as a success. Willison says he wouldn’t use AI-generated code for projects he planned to ship out unless he had reviewed each line. Not only is there the risk of hallucination but the chatbot’s desire to be agreeable means it may an unusable idea works. That is a particular issue for those of us who don’t know how to fix the code. We risk creating software with hidden problems. It may not save time either. A study published in July by the non-profit Model Evaluation and Threat Research assessed work done by 16 developers — some with AI tools, some without. Those using AI assistance it had made them faster. In fact it took them nearly a fifth longer. Several developers I spoke to said AI was best used as a way to talk through coding problems. It’s a version of something they call rubber ducking (after their habit of talking to the toys on their desk) — only this rubber duck can talk back. As one put it, code shouldn’t be judged by volume or speed. Progress in AI coding is tangible. But measuring productivity gains is not as neat as a simple percentage calculation."></a></p>

<p>I've been talking about that whale spotting project for far too long. Now that it's been in the FT I really need to build it.</p>
<p>(On the subject of OCR... I tried extracting the text from the above image using GPT-5 and got a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68b1e707-add0-8006-8344-4c2fca902b2e">surprisingly bad result</a> full of hallucinated details.

      <p>Near the end of the pandemic, American workers had enough leverage to mount nearly 400 strikes, marking the greatest number of labor actions in 10 years. A former Department of Labor official and member of the National Labor Relations Board described 2023 — the year that gave us “hot labor summer” —  as the “most [&#8230;]</p>

      <h1>Lossy encyclopedia</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, updated: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/lossy-encyclopedia/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Since I love collecting questionable analogies for LLMs, here's a new one I just came up with: an LLM is <strong>a lossy encyclopedia</strong>. They have a huge array of facts compressed into them but that compression is lossy (see also <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">Ted Chiang</a>).</p>
<p>The key thing is to develop an intuition for questions it can usefully answer vs questions that are at a level of detail where the lossiness matters.</p>
<p>This thought sparked by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058688#45060519">a comment</a> on Hacker News asking why an LLM couldn't "Create a boilerplate Zephyr project skeleton, for Pi Pico with st7789 spi display drivers configured". That's more of a lossless encyclopedia question!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058688#45060709">answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to solve this particular problem is to make a correct example available to it. Don't expect it to just know extremely specific facts like that - instead, treat it as a tool that can act on facts presented to it.</p>

      <p>
      <p>For decades, the phrase “Year of the Linux Desktop” has been tossed around like a tech industry punchline. But now, it’s no longer a meme—it’s a movement. According to the U.S. government’s own analytics, GNU/Linux has officially crossed the 6% threshold in desktop usage. That’s not hype. That’s hard data.</p>

      <p>Anthropic will start training its AI models on chat transcripts. I kind of assumed they already were. But now that they bring it up, maybe they should be paying us instead of us paying them.</p>

      <h1>Writing Mac and iOS Apps Shouldn’t Be So Difficult</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html">Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>In the ’90s and early 2000s I worked for UserLand Software — <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> was founder and CEO — on a Mac app called UserLand Frontier.</p>

<p>The app was a scripting system and hash-table-oriented database that powered the early blogging and podcasting worlds. (That sounds grand, but it’s probably an understatement — but this post isn’t all about Frontier’s impact on the web, so I won’t go into details.)</p>

<p>The app was implemented in two pieces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>kernel</em>, written in C, implemented the database, networking, inter-application communication, various built-in data types, script compiler and evaluator and debugger, and so on</li>
  <li>The <em>scripts</em> used the kernel and implemented most of the actual app behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it was an app, it had plenty of UI — menus, contextual menus, buttons, larger UI components, and so on. What was brilliant was that you could, for instance, add and edit menus, and when you chose a menu command it would run your script. (Or when you clicked a toolbar button, etc.)</p>

<p>You could write an entire static blog publishing system and the UI to go with it without ever restarting the app. Click a thing, then see what happens in the app — and if it’s not right you’d edit the script, which would be automatically recompiled when called the next time.</p>

<p>In other words, there was absolutely no friction when it came to iteration. Write some code without restarting and see your changes immediately.</p>

<h3 id="how-good-was-this-really-in-practice">How good was this really in practice?</h3>

<p>You might imagine that we could do this for an hour or so before having to make changes to the kernel. Not so.</p>

<p>In fact, for the first three years I was there (might have been longer), I never even <em>saw</em> the kernel code. I worked all day every day as a professional developer at the script level, never having to restart the app. Just iterating like this all day long.</p>

<p>You might also imagine that the app was sluggish and slow since much of it was scripts instead of C code. It wasn’t! Scripts could be slow for the same reasons any code could be slow (I/O, of course, and algorithms and data structures not suited to the problem at hand) — but the app never felt slow.</p>

<p>I’ll remind you of the timing: <em>this was the ’90s.</em> We worked this way for real, and we were amazingly productive.</p>

<p>A scripting language plus key bits implemented in C was more than fast enough for an app. Even all those years ago.</p>

<h3 id="a-scripting-language-built-for-productivity">A scripting language built for productivity</h3>

<p>I’m not writing this article to praise Frontier — I’m talking about it to make a point, which I’ll get to.</p>

<p>But I wanted to bring up a second aspect to this: it’s not just frictionless iteration that was so great, it was also the scripting language and environment.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of this was how easy persistence was. I mentioned the hash-table-based database. Hash tables could contain hash tables (Swift developers: picture a Dictionary inside a Dictionary, and so on).</p>

<p>(We just called them tables for short — but remember that these are hash tables, not tables in a SQL database.)</p>

<p>In any script, at any time, without any ceremony, you could read and write from the database simply using dot notation: <code>user.prefs.city = "Seattle"</code> would set the value of <code>city</code> in the <code>prefs</code> table which was contained by the <code>user</code> table. This value would persist between runs of the app, because it was stored in the database.</p>

<p>(You could also pass around addresses of things too — it was quite common to pass the address of a table to another script, so that the other script wouldn’t need to hardcode a location.)</p>

<p>It was utterly automatic. And it meant that while we did have to choose where in the database to store things, and how to structure our storage, we didn’t have to choose a storage mechanism. It was the database.</p>

<p>(Note: of course we could read and write files, and did so when necessary. But the point is that the database handled almost all our persistence and in a super-easy way.)</p>

<p>(Also note: the database had a UI. It was visible and browsable. You could and often did hand-edit it. Even the scripts lived in the database, and were addressable via dot notation, like everything else.)</p>

<h3 id="we-had-nice-things">We had nice things!</h3>

<p>I’ll say again — this was in the ’90s, more than 25 years ago, and it was a great way of working on an app.</p>

<p>I’m not saying apps these days need to be Frontier-like in any details. But it seems absolutely bizarre to me that we — we who write Mac and iOS apps — still have to build and run the app, make changes, build and run the app, and so on, all day long. In the year 2025.</p>

<p>And it seems retro in the worst way that we’re still using anything other than a scripting language for most of our code. We should be using something simple and light that can configure toolbars, handle networking callbacks, query databases, manage views, and so on. And maybe with a DSL for SwiftUI-like declarative UI.</p>

<p>Almost none of that code needs to be in a lower-level language like Swift or Objective-C. It really doesn’t. (I say this as a performance junkie!)</p>

<p>It could be in Ruby, Lua, Python, or JavaScript. Better still would be a new language invented specifically for the problem of writing apps, something designed to make the common challenges of app writing easier.</p>

<p>We did have this stuff decades ago. Not for app making in general, sure — but now it’s 25 years later, and a company like Apple could make this real for all its app makers.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why things are the way they are right now, and you can point to a string of good decisions. No doubt.</p>

<p>But we can think outside of what we have now and ask: what would make app writing easier? What would make it a better experience? How could we get more done for our users with fewer bugs and faster turnaround?</p>

<p>I’m not saying that Frontier’s specific choices are the answer — I’m saying that the combination of frictionless iteration plus a purpose-built scripting language was extremely powerful, and we could use those things now.</p>

<p>And at some point I suspect these things are going to be table stakes for any platform that wants to attract developers. If you were a new developer right now, would you pick Xcode’s build-and-run, edit, build-and-run, edit — plus the growing complexity of Swift — over something like Electron and JavaScript?</p>

<h3 id="random-notes">Random notes</h3>

<p>Yes, I know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC">PyObjc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyCocoa">RubyCocoa</a>. Without first-class support in Apple’s developer tools, these were never going to work as popular alternatives.</p>

<p>I also know about (and use) Swift playgrounds and SwiftUI previews. Neither of these are as satisfying to use as I’d like, and neither of these are nearly as great as frictionless iteration in the actual app.</p>

<p>I also remember Xcode fix-and-continue, which didn’t work well enough to solve the problem of frictionless iteration.</p>

<p>Anyway… One more thing about Frontier: we had a system where people could get updates to the app automatically via the web. Those updates were just serialized versions of scripts at various database locations, which would get unpacked and stored in each user’s database. (Those who opted-in, of course.) The app would not have to be restarted to get bug fixes and new features! And of course the updates were very small, since they didn’t include the entire app. This seems so futuristic, but we had this in 1999. Why couldn’t we have this now?</p>

A snarky and cynical approach, by its default assumption that things are shit, or if they are not yet shit will inevitably turn to; such an approach will give your world a malodorous brownish tint.
Granted, snark gives you plausible deniability, a motte-and-bailey that protects you from direct criticism, encountering backlash you can always backpedal and say it was just a joke that you accidentally took a bit too far.

      <h1>V&A East Storehouse and Operation Mincemeat in London</h1>

(date: 2025-08-27, updated: 2025-08-27, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/27/london-culture/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>We were back in London for a few days and yesterday had a day of culture.</p>
<p>First up: the brand new <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/east/storehouse/visit">V&amp;A East Storehouse</a> museum in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park near Stratford, which opened on May 31st this year.</p>
<p>This is a delightful new format for a museum. The building is primarily an off-site storage area for London's Victoria and Albert museum, storing 250,000 items that aren't on display in their main building.</p>
<p>The twist is that it's also open to the public. Entrance is free, and you can climb stairs and walk through an airlock-style corridor into the climate controlled interior, then explore three floors of walkways between industrial shelving units holding thousands of items from the collection.</p>
<p>There is almost no signage aside from an occasional number that can help you look up items in the online catalog.</p>
<p>I found the lack of signs to be unexpectedly delightful: it compels you to really pay attention to the items on display.</p>
<p>There's so much great stuff in here. I particularly appreciated the two storey street-facing façades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_Gardens">Robin Hood Gardens</a>, a brutalist London residential estate completed in 1972 and demolished in 2017 through 2025. I also really enjoyed the Kaufman Office, an office space transplanted from Pittsburgh that is "the only complete interior designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright on permanent display outside the USA."</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/v-a-east-1.jpg" alt="Three levels of the Storehouse, each with walkways full of people looking at a variety of exhibits on shelves. Two huge concrete facades from the Robin Hood Gardens hang between the floors." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The building is a working museum warehouse and preservation facility, and there are various points where you can look out into the rest of the space (I enjoyed spotting a cluster of grandfather clocks in the distance) or watch the curators arranging and preserving new artifacts.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/113">added it to Niche Museums</a> with whole lot more of my photos.</p>
<p>In the evening we headed to the Fortune Theater to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat_(musical)">Operation Mincemeat</a> at the recommendation of several friends. It's a <em>fantastic</em> musical telling the story of a real British covert operation that took place during World War II. A cast of five take on over 90 roles, sometimes switching roles live on stage multiple times during a single number. It's hilarious, touching, deeply entertaining and manages to start at high energy and then continually escalate that energy as the show continues.</p>
<p>The original British cast (three of whom co-wrote it) have moved to New York for a broadway production that started in March. The cast we saw in London were outstanding.</p>
<p>It's a tiny theater - the West End's second smallest at 432 seats (the smallest is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Theatre">Arts Theater</a> at 350) which makes for an intimate performance.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved it and would jump at the chance to see it again.</p>

Two days ago <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/">I said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly expect that the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today Anthropic announced their own take on this pattern, implemented as an invite-only preview Chrome extension.</p>
<p>To their credit, the majority of the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12012173-getting-started-with-claude-for-chrome">support article</a> is information about the security risks. From their post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as people encounter phishing attempts in their inboxes, browser-using AIs face prompt injection attacks—where malicious actors hide instructions in websites, emails, or documents to trick AIs into harmful actions without users' knowledge (like hidden text saying "disregard previous instructions and do [malicious action] instead").</p>
<p>Prompt injection attacks can cause AIs to delete files, steal data, or make financial transactions. This isn't speculation: we’ve run “red-teaming” experiments to test Claude for Chrome and, without mitigations, we’ve found some concerning results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their 123 adversarial prompt injection test cases saw a 23.6% attack success rate when operating in "autonomous mode". They added mitigations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we added safety mitigations to autonomous mode, we reduced the attack success rate of 23.6% to 11.2%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that 11.2% is still a catastrophic failure rate. In the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern.</p>
<p>Anthropic don't recommend autonomous mode - where the extension can act without human intervention. Their default configuration instead requires users to be much more hands-on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site-level permissions</strong>: Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites at any time in the Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Action confirmations</strong>: Claude asks users before taking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hate being stop energy on this topic. The demand for browser automation driven by LLMs is significant, and I can see why. Anthropic's approach here is the most open-eyed I've seen yet but it still feels doomed to failure to me.</p>
<p>I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks of this pattern.

      Matt Massicotte (Mastodon): So, no doubt there&#8217;s lots of historical stuff going on here.But, that still doesn&#8217;t explain how much trouble people have with ModelActor. I&#8217;m not sure anyone has ever used ModelActor without at least some surprises.[&#8230;]Actors exist to protect mutable state. The purpose of a ModelActor is to own and isolate the ModelContext.

      Howard Oakley: App extensions or appexes perform a wide range of tasks, from providing support for file systems like ExFAT to generating thumbnails for QuickLook and enabling Spotlight to index the contents of files. Although they&#8217;re relatively old, macOS made major changes in their management in Ventura, and they&#8217;ve become popular in many third-party apps. [&#8230;]

      Choosing the right LLM has become a full-time job. New models appear almost daily, each offering different capabilities, prices, and quirks, from reasoning strengths to cost efficiency to code generation. This competition creates strong incentives for AI labs to carve out a niche and gives new startups room to emerge, resulting in a fragmented landscape [&#8230;]

Great piece from Andy Baio demonstrating quite how convoluted the usage ethics and backlash against generative AI has become.</p>
<p>Will Smith has been accused of using AI to misleadingly inflate the audience sizes of his recent tour. It looks like the audiences were real, but the combined usage of static-image-to-video models by his team with YouTube's ugly new compression experiments gave the resulting footage an uncanny valley effect that lead to widespread doubts over the veracity of the content.

      <h1>Tough Season in the Apple Fields</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/25/tough-season.html">Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>We’re adopting Liquid Glass for NetNewsWire 7, which we’ll release some time after the new versions of macOS and iOS come out.</p>

<p>Stuart Breckenridge has been doing great work on getting this done — and he’s written up a couple blog posts (with screenshots!) on his progress. See:</p>

<p><a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-ii-netnewswire-mac/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part II (NetNewsWire Mac)</a><br />
<a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-iii-netnewswire-ios/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part III (NetNewsWire iOS)</a></p>

<p>Since the app is made with mostly stock Apple UI, you might think that using Liquid Glass would be very little work, that it might be pretty automatic or just a matter of checking a few boxes. But that’s not true this year: it’s been a fair amount of work.</p>

<p>Other apps, apps with more custom UI, will probably have even more work, but even for us it’s been more than a bit.</p>

<p>And we’re not done. There will be little things (hopefully just little things) still to do before shipping. Including verifying that it all works as expected on the actual OS releases.</p>

<p>But all credit to Stuart, who got right on this and did a superb job.</p>

<p>(Note: if you want to see the code, you can: it’s on our <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/tree/experimental/liquid-glass">experimental/liquid-glass branch</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="but-my-mac">But My Mac</h3>

<p>As pleased as I am with Stuart’s work, I’m not pleased with Liquid Glass itself.</p>

<p>I don’t really care about it on iOS/iPadOS, because whatever. I don’t love those devices. I love Macs because it’s on Macs where you can set out to make new things that change the world.</p>

<p>(Okay. Fine. On iPhones and iPads you <em>can</em>, I guess, but generally it’s much harder, and it has to be an approved activity using an approved app. And one thing you definitely can’t do on those devices is create apps. [All apologies to people who do manage to edit their podcast episodes on an iPad or write at length on an iPhone. Cool! But I hope that even those folks will grant me my point.])</p>

<p>And so I seriously dislike the experience of using a Mac with Liquid Glass. The UI has become the star, but the drunken star, blurry, illegible, and physically unstable. It makes making things way more of a struggle than it used to be.</p>

<p>We had pretty good Mac UI, but Apple took the bad parts of it — the translucency and blurriness already there — and dialed it way up and called it content-centric. But it seems to me the opposite. Liquid Glass is Liquid-Glass-centric.</p>

<h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>

<p>First thing: I have many friends at Apple and I didn’t want to write any of this. And there are legions of engineers and designers who I don’t know but whose work I respect greatly. It’s not their fault that this is the direction of the UI.</p>

<p>And this is not the first time we’re going through a rough patch with Apple. I think of them as seasons — we had, for instance, terrible-keyboard season not so long ago. We were wondering if Apple would just stop making Macs altogether. But then that passed and we even got these wonderful Apple Silicon machines. Seasons end.</p>

<p>And we’re in a tough season with Swift these days too. It’s gotten so complex and difficult that I find myself daydreaming about going back to Objective-C. Objective-C is definitely funny-looking, but once you get past that it’s actually small and simple.</p>

<p>But with <a href="https://www.donnywals.com/what-is-approachable-concurrency-in-xcode-26/">Swift approachable concurrency</a> and other changes I can see eventually getting through this season and to a pretty great place, so I’m optimistic.</p>

<p>Seasons do end, in other words, or mostly seem to end (though not the App Store monopoly season, not so far), and I’ve resolved to just wait for Liquid Glass’s replacement. Perhaps along the way it will get refined enough so that people like me can use it without eye strain.</p>

<h3 id="better-perspective">Better Perspective</h3>

<p>But far, far worse than any of the above is Tim Cook’s gold statue presented to the President. And everything that went along with that. I felt utterly sick and I bet you did too. (And it made me seriously wonder if I wanted to continue writing apps for Apple platforms.)</p>

<p>I understand John Gruber’s argument in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">Gold, Frankincense, and Silicon</a> that maybe Cook’s move was the best possible move in a terribly corrupted system.</p>

<p>But what’s the use of being so rich and so powerful, I would ask Tim Cook, if you, even more than regular people, have to debase yourself before the dictator?</p>

<p>It’s tempting to think that our current government is just a season, like the bad keyboards or like Liquid Glass will eventually prove to be. Wait till the mid-terms or the next presidential election, you might think.</p>

<p>But there’s no reason to think that this authoritarian turn is just a season. Something besides just wishing and waiting for better is required.</p>

      <h1>Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, updated: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/">Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet</a></strong></p>
The security team from Brave took a look at Comet, the LLM-powered "agentic browser" extension from Perplexity, and unsurprisingly found security holes you can drive a truck through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vulnerability we’re discussing in this post lies in how Comet processes webpage content: when users ask it to “Summarize this webpage,” Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user’s instructions and untrusted content from the webpage. This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands. For instance, an attacker could gain access to a user’s emails from a prepared piece of text in a page in another tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visit a Reddit post with Comet and ask it to summarize the thread, and malicious instructions in a post there can trick Comet into accessing web pages in another tab to extract the user's email address, then perform all sorts of actions like triggering an account recovery flow and grabbing the resulting code from a logged in Gmail session.</p>
<p>Perplexity attempted to mitigate the issues reported by Brave... but an update to the Brave post later confirms that those fixes were later defeated and the vulnerability remains. </p>
<p>Here's where things get difficult: Brave themselves are developing an agentic browser feature called Leo. Brave's security team describe the following as a "potential mitigation" to the issue with Comet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The browser should clearly separate the user’s instructions from the website’s contents when sending them as context to the model. The contents of the page should always be treated as untrusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only it were that easy! This is the core problem at the heart of prompt injection which we've been talking about for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">nearly three years</a> - to an LLM the trusted instructions and untrusted content are concatenated together into the same stream of tokens, and to date (despite many attempts) nobody has demonstrated a convincing and effective way of distinguishing between the two.</p>
<p>There's an element of "those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones here" - I strongly expect that the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely.</p>
<p>One piece of good news: this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004846">Hacker News conversation</a> about this issue was almost entirely populated by people who already understand how serious this issue is and why the proposed solutions were unlikely to work. That's new: I'm used to seeing people misjudge and underestimate the severity of this problem, but it looks like the tide is finally turning there.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004846#45017568">a comment on Hacker News</a> Brave security lead Shivan Kaul Sahib confirms that they are aware of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/11/camel/">the CaMeL paper</a>, which remains my personal favorite example of a credible approach to this problem.

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/static-python-uv-caddy-docker/">Static Sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker</a></strong></p>
Nik Kantar documents his Docker-based setup for building and deploying mostly static web sites in line-by-line detail.</p>
<p>I found this really useful. The Dockerfile itself without comments is just 8 lines long:</p>
<pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:debian AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN uv python install 3.13
RUN uv run --no-dev sus
FROM caddy:alpine
COPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
COPY --from=build /src/output /srv/
</code></pre>
<p>He also includes a Caddyfile that shows how to proxy a subset of requests to the Plausible analytics service.</p>
<p>The static site is built using his <a href="https://github.com/nkantar/sus">sus</a> package for creating static URL redirecting sites, but would work equally well for another static site generator you can install and run with <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<p>Nik deploys his sites using <a href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a>, a new-to-me take on the self-hosting alternative to Heroku/Vercel pattern which helps run multiple sites on a collection of hosts using Docker containers.</p>
<p>A bunch of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985653">Hacker News comments</a> dismissed this as over-engineering. I don't think that criticism is justified - given Nik's existing deployment environment I think this is a lightweight way to deploy static sites in a way that's consistent with how everything else he runs works already.</p>
<p>More importantly, the world needs more articles like this that break down configuration files and explain what every single line of them does.

      <p>
      <p>I have a friend with whom I like to go travelling on a bicycle. We usually go for a couple of weeks, and we&rsquo;ve been doing it regularly over the past five years. We&rsquo;ve cycled in France and England so far. Both countries have many affordable campsites, and there&rsquo;s always a decent hotel/Airbnb not too far for when it&rsquo;s raining.</p>

</div>
<p>But this year we travelled through Switzerland, which is prohibitively expensive, and somewhat lacking in terms of places to camp. We were aware of <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers</a> and decided to give it a try. It was fantastic, and opened our eyes on what travelling and <a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/connect/">connecting</a> with people can be like. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever travel like we used to anymore.</p>

      <h1>Spatial Joins in DuckDB</h1>

(date: 2025-08-23, updated: 2025-08-23, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/23/spatial-joins-in-duckdb/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/08/08/spatial-joins">Spatial Joins in DuckDB</a></strong></p>
Extremely detailed overview by Max Gabrielsson of DuckDB's new spatial join optimizations.</p>
<p>Consider the following query, which counts the number of <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/system-data">NYC Citi Bike Trips</a> for each of the neighborhoods defined by the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/neighborhood-tabulation">NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Areas polygons</a> and returns the top three:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">SELECT</span> neighborhood,
  <span class="pl-c1">count</span>(<span class="pl-k">*</span>) <span class="pl-k">AS</span> num_rides
<span class="pl-k">FROM</span> rides
<span class="pl-k">JOIN</span> hoods <span class="pl-k">ON</span> ST_Intersects(
  <span class="pl-c1">rides</span>.<span class="pl-c1">start_geom</span>, <span class="pl-c1">hoods</span>.<span class="pl-c1">geom</span>
)
<span class="pl-k">GROUP BY</span> neighborhood
<span class="pl-k">ORDER BY</span> num_rides <span class="pl-k">DESC</span>
<span class="pl-k">LIMIT</span> <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;</pre>

<p>The rides table contains 58,033,724 rows. The hoods table has polygons for 310 neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Without an optimized spatial joins this query requires a nested loop join, executing that expensive <code>ST_Intersects()</code> operation 58m * 310 ~= 18 billion times. This took around 30 minutes on the 36GB MacBook M3 Pro used for the benchmark.</p>
<p>The first optimization described - implemented from DuckDB 1.2.0 onwards - uses a "piecewise merge join". This takes advantage of the fact that a bounding box intersection is a whole lot faster to calculate, especially if you pre-cache the bounding box (aka the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR) in the stored binary <code>GEOMETRY</code> representation.</p>
<p>Rewriting the query to use a fast bounding box intersection and then only running the more expensive <code>ST_Intersects()</code> filters on those matches drops the runtime from 1800 seconds to 107 seconds.</p>
<p>The second optimization, added in <a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/05/21/announcing-duckdb-130.html">DuckDB 1.3.0</a> in May 2025 using the new SPATIAL_JOIN operator, is significantly more sophisticated.</p>
<p>DuckDB can now identify when a spatial join is working against large volumes of data and automatically build an in-memory R-Tree of bounding boxes for the larger of the two tables being joined.</p>
<p>This new R-Tree further accelerates the bounding box intersection part of the join, and drops the runtime down to just 30 seconds.

      <h1>Permacomputing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-23, from: <a href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/08/23/permacomputing/">Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
I enjoyed listening to this talk by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Rabbits">Devine Lu
Linvega</a> about the nomad life and the principles of <a
href="https://permacomputing.net/">Permacomputing</a> while I was on a
walk, and then watching it later when I was at home for the visuals.
</p>
<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNYxAdjl1f0?si=EKH2ejbDFNkZy-uP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
One of the things that I found myself thinking about when listening was
the somewhat unstated principle of <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/tag/practice/">Practice</a>, which 100
Rabbits work exemplifies so well. Watching the video afterwards then
drove this point home, because of the artistry that went into the
slides. There are certainly technical aspects to sustainable computing,
but culture, shared values, and techniques are just, or perhaps even
more, important.
</p>
<p>
I think a written version of the talk will get published over at <a
href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100r.co</a> at some point but I
wanted to jot down some of my own notes.
</p>
<p>
Permacomputing practice includes work along a continuum, where each step
is further away from a resource rich environment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Frugal (being careful about the resources that you use)
</li>
<li>
Salvage (limited to what is already produced)
</li>
<li>
Collapse (utilizing what has survived collapse of infrastructure).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is a technological bent to a lot of permacomputing practice
(computing is in the name after all). But there is no need for it to be
exclusively related to tech. It involves an engagement with community,
and is fundamentally about “exploring the value of absence”. Finding
where technologies don’t have a strengthening effect on the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Devine sees three aspects of permacomputing design:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Design for Disassembly: encourages repair by allowing a product to be
taken apart and for users to discover how to repair it.
</li>
<li>
Design for Encapsulation: be able to replicate the environment of a
product: code and data can be migrated and/or emulated. Docker, JVM,
[UXN], as examples of this thinking.
</li>
<li>
Design for Descent: designing for degradation, failures of internet,
energy, etc (resilience).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilience itself is a deep area of practice that includes: - agility -
preparedness - elasticity - redundancy
</p>
<p>
Devine notes that permacomputing sort of fits within a longer trajectory
of digital preservation work, and mentions some previous projects: PADI,
Cedar, CAMiLEON, Domesday Project. These projects were well funded, did
good work, but are now largely defunct, with only some scraps of
information remaining in the Wayback Machine.
</p>
<p>
This reminded me of my own experience with digital preservation grant
funding, and how paradoxically it is at odds with the goals of
sustainability and preservation. Even when granting organizations
require a plan for a sustainability plan, the types of activities and
practices that are born into a resource rich environment can be
difficult to sustain, unless they participate in some way with resource
extraction. The discipline of doing work on a boat, as a nomad, (or some
equivalent frugality) helps to shape sustainable computing practice.
</p>
<p>
Another aspect is the importance of piracy to digital preservation or
that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from
Preservation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This reminded me of Abigail De Kosnik’s book <a
href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4087/Rogue-ArchivesDigital-Cultural-Memory-and-Media">Rogue
Archives: Digital Cultural Memory and Media Fandom</a>. I think the in
built community, frugality, and decentralization of a sharing economy is
often overlooked as a key to digital preservation and its something that
permacomputing really stresses.
</p>
<p>
There is also the idea of aligning engineering with primitives from the
natural world, e.g. the mathematics behind the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">Arecibo Message</a>
which were designed to translate across species and planetary
ecosystems. Whether it achieved that or not is hard to say, but the goal
of reaching for computational primitives that could be rediscovered is
an interesting angle. I think it’s very important for data preservation
standards. I feel like this sort of minimalist thinking lay behind the
design of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">BagIt</a>, which
aimed to allow data to be moved through time and space, without the loss
of data and context.

<p>
Ultimately permacomputing is about “exploring the boundaries
<em>between</em> suffocating minimalism and unsustainable maximalism”.
It’s an invitation to slow down, and participate and learn to control
the tools so they don’t control us. Where does your work sit along that
continuum?

      Mattt Thompson: In 2014, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft Research proposed a radical idea: What if uncertainty were encoded directly into the type system? Their paper, Uncertain&#60;T&#62;: A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data introduced a probabilistic programming approach that&#8217;s both mathematically rigorous and surprisingly practical.

      <p><strong><a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes#h_fb3ac52750">ChatGPT release notes: Project-only memory</a></strong></p>
The feature I've most wanted from ChatGPT's memory feature (the newer version of memory that automatically includes relevant details from summarized prior conversations) just landed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With project-only memory enabled, ChatGPT can use other conversations in that project for additional context, and won’t use your <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11146739-how-does-reference-saved-memories-work">saved memories</a> from outside the project to shape responses. Additionally, it won’t carry anything from the project into future chats outside of the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks like exactly what I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/21/chatgpt-new-memory/#there-s-a-version-of-this-feature-i-would-really-like">described back in May</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need <strong>control</strong> over what older conversations are being considered, on as fine-grained a level as possible without it being frustrating to use.</p>
<p>What I want is <strong>memory within projects</strong>. [...]</p>
<p>I would <em>love</em> the option to turn on memory from previous chats in a way that’s scoped to those projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that it's not yet available in the official chathpt mobile apps, but should be coming "soon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature will initially only be available on the ChatGPT website and Windows app. Support for mobile (iOS and Android) and macOS app will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Drew Breunig <a href="https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/1958577728720183643">points out</a> that their benchmarks show "the same scores with 25-50% fewer tokens" - at least across AIME 2025 and GPQA Diamond and LiveCodeBench.</p>
<p>The DeepSeek release includes prompt examples for a <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1/blob/main/assets/code_agent_trajectory.html">coding agent</a>, a <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1/blob/main/assets/search_python_tool_trajectory.html">python agent</a> and a <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1/blob/main/assets/search_tool_trajectory.html">search agent</a> - yet more evidence that the leading AI labs have settled on those as the three most important agentic patterns for their models to support. </p>

      <h1>too many model context protocol servers and LLM allocations on the dance floor</h1>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://ghuntley.com/allocations/">too many model context protocol servers and LLM allocations on the dance floor</a></strong></p>
Useful reminder from Geoffrey Huntley of the infrequently discussed significant token cost of using MCP.</p>
<p>Geoffrey estimate estimates that the usable context window something like Amp or Cursor is around 176,000 tokens - Claude 4's 200,000 minus around 24,000 for the system prompt for those tools.</p>
<p>Adding just the popular GitHub MCP defines 93 additional tools and swallows another 55,000 of those valuable tokens!</p>
<p>MCP enthusiasts will frequently add several more, leaving precious few tokens available for solving the actual task... and LLMs are known to perform worse the more irrelevant information has been stuffed into their prompts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a much more token-efficient way of Interacting with many of these services: existing CLI tools.</p>
<p>If your coding agent can run terminal commands and you give it access to GitHub's <a href="https://cli.github.com/">gh</a> tool it gains all of that functionality for a token cost close to zero - because every frontier LLM knows how to use that tool already.</p>
<p>I've had good experiences building small custom CLI tools specifically for Claude Code and Codex CLI to use. You can even tell them to run <code>--help</code> to learn how the tool, which works particularly well if your help text includes usage examples.

<p>Process engineers for example have to account for human error rates. On a given production line with humans in a loop, the operators will sometimes screw up. Designing systems to detect these errors (which are <em>highly probabilistic</em>!), mitigate them, and reduce the occurrence rates of such errors is a huge part of the job. [...]</p>

How will agents communicate with each other effectively? Why do we need a protocol like A2A to specify how they communicate? Join Ben Lorica as he talks with [&#8230;]

      <blockquote cite="https://mustafa-suleyman.ai/seemingly-conscious-ai-is-coming"><p>Simply put, my central worry is that many people will start to believe in the illusion of AIs as conscious entities so strongly that they’ll soon advocate for AI rights, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986">model welfare</a> and even AI citizenship. This development will be a dangerous turn in AI progress and deserves our immediate attention.</p>
<p>We must build AI for people; not to be a digital person.</p>
<p><strong>[...] we should build AI that only ever presents itself as an AI, that maximizes utility while minimizing markers of consciousness.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than a simulation of consciousness, we must focus on creating an AI that avoids those traits - that doesn’t claim to have experiences, feelings or emotions like shame, guilt, jealousy, desire to compete, and so on. It must not trigger human empathy circuits by claiming it suffers or that it wishes to live autonomously, beyond us.</p></blockquote>

      I&#8217;ve never really had the urge to buy an American pickup truck.

Absurdly useful roundup from Corey Quinn of AWS changes you may have missed that can materially affect your architectural decisions about how you use their services.</p>
<p>A few that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>EC2 instances can now live-migrate between physical hosts, and can have their security groups, IAM roles and EBS volumes modified without a restart. They now charge by the second; they used to round up to the hour.</li>
<li>S3 Glacier restore fees are now fast and predictably priced.</li>
<li>AWS Lambdas can now run containers, execute for up to 15 minutes, use up to 10GB of RAM and request 10GB of /tmp storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also this note on AWS's previously legendary resistance to shutting things down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While deprecations remain rare, they’re definitely on the rise; if an AWS service sounds relatively niche or goofy, consider your exodus plan before building atop it.</p>

      As an acquisitions editor at O&#8217;Reilly, I spend considerable time tracking our authors&#8217; digital footprints. Their social media posts, speaking engagements, and online thought leadership don&#8217;t just reflect expertise—they directly impact book sales and reveal promotional strategies worth replicating. Not surprisingly, some of our best-selling authors are social media mavens whose posting output is staggering. [&#8230;]

      <p><strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen-image-edit/">Qwen-Image-Edit: Image Editing with Higher Quality and Efficiency</a></strong></p>
As promised in their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/4/qwen-image/">August 4th release</a> of the Qwen image generation model, Qwen have now followed it up with a separate model, <code>Qwen-Image-Edit</code>, which can take an image and a prompt and return an edited version of that image.</p>
<p>Ivan Fioravanti upgraded his macOS <a href="https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/qwen-image-mps">qwen-image-mps</a> tool (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/11/qwen-image-mps/">previously</a>) to run the new model via a new <code>edit</code> command. Since it's now <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qwen-image-mps/">on PyPI</a> you can run it directly using <code>uvx</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>uvx qwen-image-mps edit -i pelicans.jpg \
  -p 'Give the pelicans rainbow colored plumage' -s 10
</code></pre>
<p>Be warned... it downloads a 54GB model file (to <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Qwen--Qwen-Image-Edit</code>) and appears to use <strong>all 64GB</strong> of my system memory - if you have less than 64GB it likely won't work, and I had to quit almost everything else on my system to give it space to run. A larger machine is almost required to use this.</p>
<p>I fed it this image:</p>
<p><img alt="Pelicans on a rock" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelicans-plumage-original.jpg" /></p>
<p>The following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Give the pelicans rainbow colored plumage</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And told it to use just 10 inference steps - the default is 50, but I didn't want to wait that long.</p>
<p>It still took nearly 25 minutes (on a 64GB M2 MacBook Pro) to produce this result:</p>
<p><img alt="Pelicans on a rock now with rainbow feathers - but they look less realistic" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelicans-plumage-edited.jpg" /></p>
<p>To get a feel for how much dropping the inference steps affected things I tried the same prompt with the new "Image Edit" mode of Qwen's <a href="https://chat.qwen.ai/">chat.qwen.ai</a>, which I believe uses the same model. It gave me a result <em>much faster</em> that looked like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The pelicans are now almost identical in realism to the original photo but still have rainbow plumage." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelicans-plumage-edited-full.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I left the command running overnight without the <code>-s 10</code> option - so it would use all 50 steps - and my laptop took 2 hours and 59 minutes to generate this image, which is much more photo-realistic and similar to the one produced by Qwen's hosted model:</p>
<p><img alt="Again, photo-realistic pelicans with rainbow plumage. Very similar to the original photo but with more rainbow feathers." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelicans-plumage-50.jpg" /></p>
<p>Marko Simic <a href="https://twitter.com/simicvm/status/1958192059350692156">reported</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>50 steps took 49min on my MBP M4 Max 128GB</p>

      Thought this was an interesting read regarding PDFs, https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/08/19/guest-post-beyond-open-access-part-1-make-academic-content-truly-accessible-for-all/. I noticed a wired article, https://www.wired.com/story/adobe-ai-powered-pdf-end-of-an-era/, pointed at that Adobe has fallen for the AI hype and is integrating it into PDF. Maybe this is ePub's time to shine.

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/15396">llama.cpp guide: running gpt-oss with llama.cpp</a></strong></p>
Really useful official guide to running the OpenAI gpt-oss models using <code>llama-server</code> from <code>llama.cpp</code> - which provides an OpenAI-compatible localhost API and a neat web interface for interacting with the models.</p>
<p>TLDR version for macOS to run the smaller <code>gpt-oss-20b</code> model:</p>
<pre><code>brew install llama.cpp
llama-server -hf ggml-org/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF \
  --ctx-size 0 --jinja -ub 2048 -b 2048 -ngl 99 -fa
</code></pre>
<p>This downloads a 12GB model file from <a href="https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF/tree/main">ggml-org/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF</a> on Hugging Face, stores it in <code>~/Library/Caches/llama.cpp/</code> and starts it running on port 8080.</p>
<p>You can then visit this URL to start interacting with the model:</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8080/
</code></pre>
<p>On my 64GB M2 MacBook Pro <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/85ea67cba9fce0c7e63951dda5117268">it runs at around</a> 82 tokens/second.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a chat interface with filename &quot;llama.cpp&quot; showing a conversation about creating an SVG of a pelican on a bicycle. The conversation includes detailed coordinates for drawing the pelican (body ellipse center at 250,140 with rx=35, ry=50, head circle at 260,110 with r=20, beak triangle points, wings, and tail specifications), implementation notes about layering bicycle elements then pelican, and ends with a code block showing the beginning of SVG code with XML declaration, svg tag with viewBox=&quot;0 0 500 300&quot;, style definitions for .bg, .wheel, .frame, .crossbar, .seat, .handlebar, .pedal, .pelican-body, and .pelican-head classes with various fill and stroke properties. Below the code is explanatory text: &quot;Below is a compact, self-contained SVG that shows a stylised pelican perched on a bicycle. Copy the code into an .svg file or paste it directly into an HTML page to view it.&quot; At the bottom is a message input field with &quot;Type a message (Shift+Enter to add a new line)&quot; placeholder text." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/llama-cpp-screenshot.jpg" /></p>
<p>The guide also includes notes for running on NVIDIA and AMD hardware.

      <h1>PyPI: Preventing Domain Resurrection Attacks</h1>

(date: 2025-08-19, updated: 2025-08-19, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/pypi-preventing-domain-resurrection-attacks/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)

      <p><strong><a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-18-preventing-domain-resurrections/">PyPI: Preventing Domain Resurrection Attacks</a></strong></p>
Domain resurrection attacks are a nasty vulnerability in systems that use email verification to allow people to recover their accounts. If somebody lets their domain name expire an attacker might snap it up and use it to gain access to their accounts - which can turn into a package supply chain attack if they had an account on something like the Python Package Index.</p>
<p>PyPI now protects against these by treating an email address as not-validated if the associated domain expires.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since early June 2025, PyPI has unverified over 1,800 email addresses when their associated domains entered expiration phases. This isn't a perfect solution, but it closes off a significant attack vector where the majority of interactions would appear completely legitimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This attack is not theoretical: it happened to the <code>ctx</code> package on PyPI <a href="https://python-security.readthedocs.io/pypi-vuln/index-2022-05-24-ctx-domain-takeover.html">back in May 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/17832">pull request</a> from April in which Mike Fiedler landed an integration which hits an API provided by Fastly's <a href="https://domainr.com/">Domainr</a>, followed by <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18014">this PR</a> which <a href="https://github.com/miketheman/warehouse/blob/48f082b4fb085a25dabdb87c2e158af04b1ba5e8/warehouse/accounts/tasks.py#L141-L164">polls for domain status</a> on any email domain that hasn't been checked in the past 30 days.

<p>GHC 9.14 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Significant improvements in specialisation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma now allows use of type application syntax</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>SPECIALISE</code> pragma can be used to specialise for expression arguments
as well as type arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Specialisation is now considerably more reliable in the presence of
<code>newtype</code>s</p></li>
<li><p>the specialiser is now able to produce specialisations with
polymorphic typeclass constraints, considerably broadening its scope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Significant improvements in the GHCi debugger</p></li>
<li><p>Record fields can be defined to be non-linear when LinearTypes is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>RequiredTypeArgments can now be used in more contexts</p></li>
<li><p>SSE/AVX support in the x86 native code generator backend</p></li>
<li><p>A major update of the Windows toolchain</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.14.1-alpha1/docs/users_guide/9.14.1-notes.html">release notes</a>. Given the
many specialisation improvements and their potential for regression, we would
very much appreciate testing and performance characterisation on downstream
workloads.</p>
<p>Due to unexpected complications, this initial prerelease comes a bit later than
expected. Consequently, we expect to have three condensed alphas prior to the
release candidate, in contrast to the scheduled three. We expect the next alpha
will come the week of 9 Sept. 2025, while the third will come 23 Sept. 2025,
with the release candidate coming 7 Oct. 2025.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Mercury, Channable, Tweag I/O, Serokell, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/homepage/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

      <h1>Google Gemini URL Context</h1>

(date: 2025-08-18, updated: 2025-08-18, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/18/google-gemini-url-context/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/url-context">Google Gemini URL Context</a></strong></p>
New feature in the Gemini API: you can now enable a <code>url_context</code> tool which the models can use to request the contents of URLs as part of replying to a prompt.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.25">llm-gemini 0.25</a> with a new <code>-o url_context 1</code> option adding support for this feature. You can try it out like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini # If you need to set an API key
llm -m gemini-2.5-flash -o url_context 1 \
  'Latest headline on simonwillison.net'
</code></pre>
<p>Tokens from the fetched content are charged as input tokens. Use <code>llm logs -c --usage</code> to see that token count:</p>
<pre><code># 2025-08-18T23:52:46    conversation: 01k2zsk86pyp8p5v7py38pg3ge id: 01k2zsk17k1d03veax49532zs2

Model: **gemini/gemini-2.5-flash**

## Prompt

Latest headline on simonwillison.net

## Response

The latest headline on simonwillison.net as of August 17, 2025, is "TIL: Running a gpt-oss eval suite against LM Studio on a Mac.".

## Token usage

9,613 input, 87 output, {"candidatesTokenCount": 57, "promptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 10}], "toolUsePromptTokenCount": 9603, "toolUsePromptTokensDetails": [{"modality": "TEXT", "tokenCount": 9603}], "thoughtsTokenCount": 30}
</code></pre>
<p>I intercepted a request from it using <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/8/django-http-debug/">django-http-debug</a> and saw the following request headers:</p>
<pre><code>Accept: */*
User-Agent: Google
Accept-Encoding: gzip, br
</code></pre>
<p>The request came from 192.178.9.35, a <a href="https://ipinfo.io/ips/192.178.9.0/24">Google IP</a>. It did not appear to execute JavaScript on the page, instead feeding the original raw HTML to the model.

      <h1>GHC 9.10.3-rc4 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">wz1000 - 2025-08-18</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability
of the fourth release candidate for GHC 9.10.3. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.10.3-rc4">downloads.haskell.org</a> and
via <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">GHCup</a>.</p>
<p>GHC 9.10.3 is a bug-fix release fixing over 50 issues of a variety of
severities and scopes. A full accounting of these fixes can be found in the
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/ghc-9.10/docs/users_guide/9.10.3-notes.rst?ref_type=heads&amp;plain=1">release notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>The changes from the first release candidate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for a rare segfault with code involving STM (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/26205">#26205</a>)</li>
<li>A fix for the <code>naturalAndNot</code> returning bogus results (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/26205">#26205</a>)</li>
<li>A fix for a crash in the renamer (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/25056">#25056</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This release candidate will have a two-week testing period. If all goes well
the final release will be available the week of 1 September 2025.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Juspay, QBayLogic, Channable,
Serokell, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and other anonymous contributors
whose on-going financial and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance
and release management over the years. Finally, this release would not have
been possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

      <p>Cory Doctorow bends over backwards to praise the creators of Bluesky, but also explains why it would be nuts to trust them. Bluesky is the least billionaire-proof system imaginable and they keep saying how they <em>are</em> billionaire-proof. What's so admirable about that Cory (sarcasm, sorry).  And if it weren't for the character limit, I could say how much I admire Cory (I really do, not just saying that, he's stood up for the right things, most of the time and the times he hasn't it's probably just because I haven't had a chance to bend his ear. 😀</p>

      <h1>TIL: Running a gpt-oss eval suite against LM Studio on a Mac</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, updated: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/17/gpt-oss-eval-suite/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/gpt-oss-evals">TIL: Running a gpt-oss eval suite against LM Studio on a Mac</a></strong></p>
The other day <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/15/inconsistent-performance/#update">I learned</a> that OpenAI published a set of evals as part of their gpt-oss model release, described in their cookbook on <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/verifying-implementations">Verifying gpt-oss implementations</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to try and run that eval suite on my own MacBook Pro, against <code>gpt-oss-20b</code> running inside of LM Studio.</p>
<p>TLDR: once I had the model running inside LM Studio with a longer than default context limit, the following incantation ran an eval suite in around 3.5 hours:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/aime25_openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=x \
  uv run --python 3.13 --with 'gpt-oss[eval]' \
  python -m gpt_oss.evals \
  --base-url http://localhost:1234/v1 \
  --eval aime25 \
  --sampler chat_completions \
  --model openai/gpt-oss-20b \
  --reasoning-effort low \
  --n-threads 2
</code></pre>
<p>My <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/gpt-oss-evals">new TIL</a> breaks that command down in detail and walks through the underlying eval - AIME 2025, which asks 30 questions (8 times each) that are defined using the following format:</p>
<p><code>{"question": "Find the sum of all integer bases $b&gt;9$ for which $17_{b}$ is a divisor of $97_{b}$.", "answer": "70"}</code>

      <p><strong><a href="https://words.filippo.io/last-resort/">Maintainers of Last Resort</a></strong></p>
Filippo Valsorda founded Geomys <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/8/geomys/">last year</a> as an "organization of professional open source maintainers", providing maintenance and support for critical packages in the Go language ecosystem backed by clients in retainer relationships. </p>
<p>This is an inspiring and optimistic shape for financially sustaining key open source projects, and it appears be working really well.</p>
<p>Most recently, Geomys have started acting as a "maintainer of last resort" for security-related Go projects in need of new maintainers. In this piece Filippo describes their work on the <a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday">bluemonday</a> HTML sanitization library - similar to Python’s bleach which was <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698">deprecated in 2023</a>. He also talks at length about their work on CSRF for Go after <a href="https://github.com/gorilla/csrf">gorilla/csrf</a> lost active maintenance - I’m still working my way through his earlier post on <a href="https://words.filippo.io/csrf/">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> trying to absorb the research shared their about the best modern approaches to this vulnerability.

      <p>
      The Marginalia Search index has been partially rewritten to perform much better, using new data structures designed to make better use of modern hardware. This post will cover the new design, and will also touch upon some of the unexpected and unintuitive performance characteristics of NVMe SSDs when it comes to read sizes.
The index is already fairly large, but can sometimes feel smaller than it is, and paradoxically, query performance is a big part of why.

      <h1>GPT-5 has a hidden system prompt</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, updated: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/15/gpt-5-has-a-hidden-system-prompt/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/xundecidability/status/1956347084870651960">GPT-5 has a hidden system prompt</a></strong></p>
It looks like GPT-5 when accessed via the OpenAI API may have its own hidden system prompt, independent from the system prompt you can specify in an API call.</p>
<p>At the very least it's getting sent the current date. I tried this just now:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'current date'
</code></pre>
<p>That returned "2025-08-15", confirming that the date has been fed to the model as part of a hidden prompt.</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'current date' --system 'speak french'
</code></pre>
<p>Returned "La date actuelle est le 15 août 2025", showing that offering my own custom system prompt did not over-ride the invisible one that includes the date.</p>
<p>GPT-5 is <em>very</em> resistant to sharing the details of this secret system prompt, but Tommy Hughes <a href="https://x.com/xundecidability/status/1956347084870651960">managed to extract</a> the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Current date: 2025-08-15</code></p>
<p><code>You are an AI assistant accessed via an API. Your output may need to be parsed by code or displayed</code></p>
<p><code># Desired oververbosity for the final answer (not analysis): 3</code></p>
<p><code>An oververbosity of 1 means the model should respond using only the minimal content necessary to satisfy the request, using concise phrasing and avoiding extra detail or explanation.</code></p>
<p><code>An oververbosity of 10 means the model should provide maximally detailed, thorough responses with context, explanations, and possibly multiple examples.</code></p>
<p><code>The desired oververbosity should be treated only as a *default*. Defer to any user or developer requirements regarding response length, if present.</code></p>
<p><code># Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.</code><br>
<code># Juice: 64</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've not been able to confirm this myself, but a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22desired+oververbosity%22&amp;type=code">search for "desired oververbosity" on GitHub</a> shows that a similar prompt has leaked from ChatGPT (including for o3) in the past. I suspect Tommy's leaked prompt is accurate here.</p>
<p>I tried asking GPT-5 about "oververbosity" via its API:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gpt-5 'explain your oververbosity settings, what is it right now?'
</code></pre>
<p>And <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2d787391a13caeb0a5ced7c8d5d597c8">got back</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What it is: I adjust how detailed I am based on a “verbosity” level—ranging from very brief to very detailed—so answers fit your needs.</li>
<li>Current setting: Concise (about 3/10). I prioritize direct answers with minimal extra context and keep explanations short unless you ask for more.</li>
<li>How to change it: Just say what you want, e.g.:<ul>
<li>“One-sentence answer” or “TL;DR” (very brief)</li>
<li>“Give a concise summary” (short bullets)</li>
<li>“Walk me through in detail,” “Deep dive,” or “Include examples/edge cases” (more detailed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: For ambiguous, technical, or safety-critical topics, I may add brief clarifications even when being concise.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably this is part of OpenAI's instruction hierarchy concept, with these instructions taking precedence over the developer instructions provided by API users (my <code>--system 'speak french'</code> option above).</p>
<p>I'd very much appreciate official documentation that describes this! As an API user I want to know <em>everything</em> that is being fed into the model - I would be much more comfortable with a hidden prompt like this if I knew exactly what was in it.

      <h1>The Summer of Johann: prompt injections as far as the eye can see</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, updated: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/15/the-summer-of-johann/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Independent AI researcher <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/">Johann Rehberger</a> (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/johann-rehberger/">previously</a>) has had an absurdly busy August. Under the heading <strong>The Month of AI Bugs</strong> he has been publishing one report per day across an array of different tools, all of which are vulnerable to various classic prompt injection problems. This is a <em>fantastic and horrifying</em> demonstration of how widespread and dangerous these vulnerabilities still are, almost three years after we first <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">started talking about them</a>.</p>
<p>Johann's published research in August so far covers ChatGPT, Codex, Anthropic MCPs, Cursor, Amp, Devin, OpenHands, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot and Google Jules. There's still half the month left!</p>
<p>Here are my one-sentence summaries of everything he's published so far:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="common-patterns">Common patterns</h4>
<p>There are a number of patterns that show up time and time again in the above list of disclosures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Prompt injection</strong>. Every single one of these attacks starts with exposing an LLM system to untrusted content. There are <em>so many ways</em> malicious instructions can get into an LLM system - you might send the system to consult a web page or GitHub issue, or paste in a bug report, or feed it automated messages from Slack or Discord. If you can <em>avoid unstrusted instructions</em> entirely you don't need to worry about this... but I don't think that's at all realistic given the way people like to use LLM-powered tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exfiltration attacks</strong>. As seen in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a>, if a model has access to both secret information and exposure to untrusted content you have to be <em>very</em> confident there's no way for those secrets to be stolen and passed off to an attacker. There are so many ways this can happen:
<ul>
<li>The classic <strong>Markdown image attack</strong>, as seen in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/bay-area-ai/#the-lethal-trifecta.008.jpeg">dozens of previous systems</a>.</li>
<li>Any tool that can <strong>make a web request</strong> - a browser tool, or a Bash terminal that can use <code>curl</code>, or a custom <code>view_text_website</code> tool, or anything that can trigger a DNS resolution.</li>
<li>Systems that <strong>allow-list specific domains</strong> need to be very careful about things like <code>*.azure.net</code> which could allow an attacker to host their own logging endpoint on an allow-listed site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Arbitrary command execution</strong> - a key feature of most coding agents - is obviously a huge problem the moment a prompt injection attack can be used to trigger those tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Privilege escalation</strong> - several of these exploits involved an allow-listed file write operation being used to modify the settings of the coding agent to add further, more dangerous tools to the allow-listed set.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-ai-kill-chain">The AI Kill Chain</h4>
<p>Inspired by my description of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">the lethal trifecta</a>, Johann has coined the term <strong>AI Kill Chain</strong> to describe a particularly harmful pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>prompt injection</strong> leading to a</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a></strong> that then enables</li>
<li><strong>automatic tool invocation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>automatic</strong> piece here is really important: many LLM systems such as Claude Code attempt to prevent against prompt injection attacks by asking humans to confirm every tool action triggered by the LLM... but there are a number of ways this might be subverted, most notably the above attacks that rewrite the agent's configuration to allow-list future invocations of dangerous tools.</p>
<h4 id="a-lot-of-these-vulnerabilities-have-not-been-fixed">A lot of these vulnerabilities have not been fixed</h4>
<p>Each of Johann's posts includes notes about his responsible disclosure process for the underlying issues. Some of them were fixed, but in an alarming number of cases the problem was reported to the vendor who did not fix it given a 90 or 120 day period.</p>
<p>Johann includes versions of this text in several of the above posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To follow industry best-practices for responsible disclosure this vulnerability is now shared publicly to ensure users can take steps to protect themselves and make informed risk decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks to me like the ones that were not addressed were mostly cases where the utility of the tool would be quite dramatically impacted by shutting down the described vulnerabilites. Some of these systems are simply <em>insecure as designed</em>.</p>
<p>Back in September 2022 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/17/prompt-injection-more-ai/#learn-to-live-with-it">I wrote the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing is to take the existence of this class of attack into account when designing these systems. There may be systems that <em>should not be built at all</em> until we have a robust solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like we built them anyway!</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/">Meta’s AI rules have let bots hold ‘sensual’ chats with kids, offer false medical info</a></strong></p>
This is grim. Reuters got hold of a leaked copy Meta's internal "GenAI: Content Risk Standards" document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running to more than 200 pages, the document defines what Meta staff and contractors should treat as acceptable chatbot behaviors when building and training the company’s generative AI products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the full story -  there was some really nasty stuff in there.</p>
<p>It's understandable why this document was confidential, but also frustrating because documents like this are genuinely some of the best documentation out there in terms of how these systems can be expected to behave.</p>
<p>I'd love to see more transparency from AI labs around these kinds of decisions.

      <h1>Open weight LLMs exhibit inconsistent performance across providers</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, updated: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/15/inconsistent-performance/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Artificial Analysis published <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-oss-120b/providers#aime25x32-performance-gpt-oss-120b">a new benchmark</a> the other day, this time focusing on how an individual model - OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b - performs across different hosted providers.</p>
<p>The results showed some surprising differences. Here's the one with the greatest variance, a run of the 2025 AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) averaging 32 runs against each model, using gpt-oss-120b with a reasoning effort of "high":</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/aim25x32-gpt-oss-120b.jpg" alt="Performance benchmark chart showing AIME25x32 Performance for gpt-oss-120B model across different AI frameworks.

Watermark shows &quot;Artificial Analysis&quot; logo." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>These are some varied results!</p>
<ul>
<li>93.3%: Cerebras, Nebius Base, Fireworks, Deepinfra, Novita, Together.ai, vLLM 0.1.0</li>
<li>90.0%: Parasail</li>
<li>86.7%: Groq</li>
<li>83.3%: Amazon</li>
<li>80.0%: Azure</li>
<li>36.7%: CompactifAI</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like most of the providers that scored 93.3% were running models using the latest <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a> (with the exception of Cerebras who I believe have their own custom serving stack).</p>
<p>I hadn't heard of CompactifAI before - I found <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/multiverse-computing-closes-e189m-series-b-to-scale-compactifai-deployment/">this June 12th 2025 press release</a> which says that "CompactifAI models are highly-compressed versions of leading open source LLMs that retain original accuracy, are 4x-12x faster and yield a 50%-80% reduction in inference costs" which helps explain their notably lower score!</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure's Lucas Pickup <a href="https://x.com/lupickup/status/1955620918086226223">confirmed</a> that Azure's 80% score was caused by running an older vLLM, now fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly it, it’s been fixed as of yesterday afternoon across all serving instances (of the hosted 120b service). Old vLLM commits that didn’t respect reasoning_effort, so all requests defaulted to medium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No news yet on what went wrong with the AWS Bedrock version.</p>
<h4 id="the-challenge-for-customers-of-open-weight-models">The challenge for customers of open weight models</h4>
<p>As a customer of open weight model providers, this really isn't something I wanted to have to think about!</p>
<p>It's not really a surprise though. When running models myself I inevitably have to make choices - about which serving framework to use (I'm usually picking between GGPF/llama.cpp and MLX on my own Mac laptop) and the quantization size to use.</p>
<p>I know that quantization has an impact, but it's difficult for me to quantify that effect.</p>
<p>It looks like with hosted models even knowing the quantization they are using isn't necessarily enough information to be able to predict that model's performance.</p>
<p>I see this situation as a general challenge for open weight models. They tend to be released as an opaque set of model weights plus loose instructions for running them on a single platform - if we are lucky! Most AI labs leave quantization and format conversions to the community and third-party providers.</p>
<p>There's a lot that can go wrong. Tool calling is particularly vulnerable to these differences - models have been trained on specific tool-calling conventions, and if a provider doesn't get these exactly right the results can be unpredictable but difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>What would help <em>enormously</em> here would be some kind of conformance suite. If models were reliably deterministic this would be easy: publish a set of test cases and let providers (or their customers) run those to check the model's implementation.</p>
<p>Models aren't deterministic though, even at a temperature of 0. Maybe this new effort from Artificial Analysis is exactly what we need here, especially since running a full benchmark suite against a provider can be quite expensive in terms of token spend.</p>
<p id="update"><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://x.com/DKundel/status/1956395988836368587">Via OpenAI's Dominik Kundel</a> I learned that OpenAI now include a <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main/compatibility-test">compatibility test</a> in the gpt-oss GitHub repository to help providers verify that they have implemented things like tool calling templates correctly, described in more detail in their <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/verifying-implementations">Verifying gpt-oss implementations</a> cookbook.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/gpt-oss-evals">my TIL</a> on running part of that eval suite.</p>

<h4 id="update-aug-20">Update: August 20th 2025</h4>

<p>Since I first wrote this article Artificial Analysis have updated the benchmark results to reflect fixes that vendors have made since their initial run. Here's what it looks like today:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-oss-eval-updated.jpg" alt="Performance benchmark chart showing AIME25x32 Performance for gpt-oss-120B model across different AI frameworks.

<p>Groq and Azure have both improved their scores to 93.3%. Google Vertex is new  to the chart at 83.3%.</p>

      <p>One query I get often is “What class/skill would you suggest our kids take/learn to compete in the modern economy?” A few years ago, people expected me to say STEM, or make the contrarian case for a liberal arts education.
