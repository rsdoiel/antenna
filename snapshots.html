Most Windows computers aren’t nearly as crash-prone today as they were a
few decades ago. But crashes to happen, and for the past forty years
Microsoft has shown some form of a “Blue Screen of Death” when that
happens. After taking a brief detour to show a black screen for Windows

At first glance it would be easy to mistake the ONEXSUGAR Sugar 1 for a

    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-assisted programming has rapidly become commonplace in software development. This is largely due to rise of large language models (LLMs), which bring with them the promise of improved developer productivity and faster delivery. AI tools can excel when used surgically: fix this bug, document this function, generate a series of test cases. These bite-sized tasks are tightly scoped, so they are easy to specify and easy to validate. But once you ask AI to build larger components—like an entire authentication flow, a service layer, or even a full-stack CRUD application—you’re not just using AI to &lt;em&gt;assist&lt;/em&gt;, you’re instead opting to &lt;em&gt;delegate&lt;/em&gt; work to AI. This shift to delegation introduces a subtle but significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Imagine you ask an AI to build a complete feature, such as a new account
settings page in your web application. The LLM produces a
correct-seeming result very quickly, which feels like magic. You test
its output and find that a few things are off and require fixing. You go
back to the LLM and ask for a few tweaks. This fixes some things but
cause others to regress. You try again, but attempt to be more specific.
Before you know it, you’re drowning in prompt revisions or sifting
through code that doesn’t quite fit your architecture nor does it behave
exactly as you wanted.
</p>
<p>
This is where the constraint of AI delegation emerges: what we refer to
as the <em>AI delegation dilemma</em>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="a-triangle-of-trade-offs">
A triangle of trade-offs
</h2>
<p>
The more you ask the AI to do, the more you find yourself navigating a
three-way trade-off between the following priorities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Design Fidelity</strong>: The design and functionality of the
code reflects your desired intent—not the AI’s assumptions
</li>
<li>
<strong>Prompt Efficiency</strong>: Writing the prompts requires less
effort than writing the code yourself
</li>
<li>
<strong>Output Usability</strong>: There is minimal post-generation
cleanup or rewriting of the output code required of you
</li>
</ul>

The dilemma defines the inherent constraints when offloading large

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
You can only optimize for at most two at a time. Much like the classic
“Fast, Cheap, Good: pick two” triangle, this model shows the constraints
of AI-generated code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you want code that matches your intended design (Design Fidelity) and
generated results that are ready to use (Output Usability), you’ll spend
substantial time writing and revising the suitable prompts (loss of
Prompt Efficiency).
</li>
<li>
If you want a quick prompting experience (Prompt Efficiency) and don’t
want to spend time revising the output (Output Usability), you’ll have
to let the AI make design decisions and assumptions for you (loss of
Design Fidelity).
</li>
<li>
If you want to stay in control (Design Fidelity) and write prompts
quickly (Prompt Efficiency), you will have to make extensive revisions
to the AI’s output (loss of Output Usability).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We call this triangle of trade-offs <em>the AI delegation dilemma</em>.
Inherent to the AI delegation dilemma is the constraint that ‘pick 3’
isn’t possible. There are several reasons why.
</p>
<h2 id="the-roots-of-the-dilemma">
The roots of the dilemma
</h2>
<p>
Why the AI delegation dilemma is unavoidable requires examining the
roots of how modern LLMs work and the limitations one quickly runs into
when delegating work to AI.
</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-llms-and-code-generation">
The nature of LLMs and code generation
</h3>
<p>
LLMs operate by predicting the most probable sequence of tokens based on
their training data, which is vast but invariably leads to generic
outputs. They operate based on patterns and statistical prediction as
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stochastic
parrots</a>.” For code generation, additional techniques, such as
reinforcement learning, are used to hone the output of LLMs and produce
code that is favored by humans. This means they lack actual
comprehension and have no actual understanding of your specific
project’s nuances, architectural philosophy, organizational constraints,
or business logic that isn’t explicitly relayed.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.foxhound.systems/img/2025-06-27-ai-delegation-dilemma/parrot_1280.jpg" class="w-100 md-w-60" alt="An LLM is like a parrot that knows everything (in its training data) but understands nothing. This is a departure from real parrots, which understand quite a lot." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">
An LLM is like a parrot that knows everything (in its training data) but
understands nothing. This is a departure from real parrots, which
understand quite a lot.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The result of this is that LLMs produce <em>plausible</em> code, but not
necessarily <em>correct</em> nor <em>optimal</em> code for a specific
context. This is why LLMs are prone to not only failing to adhere to
your intent, but also even hallucinating code that is entirely
believable but completely wrong (ask an LLM to write code for you and it
won’t be long before it uses a nonexistent function or imports a
fake-but-real-sounding library).
</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-context-and-implicit-knowledge">
The cost of context and implicit knowledge
</h3>
<p>
Human developers implicitly carry vast amounts of context (team
conventions, project history, domain-specific nuances, unspoken
requirements, security best practices) that are difficult or impossible
to convey fully in a prompt. AI can typically only glimpse a small
portion of this through what is conveyed in a prompt or supplemental
file, often leading to generic or misaligned output.
</p>
<p>
The other issue regarding context acquisition by LLMs is that they
suffer from anterograde amnesia, which is the inability to form new
memories. OpenAI co-founder and Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy
<a href="https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?t=1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes
in a talk on the role of AI in software development</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
LLMs also suffer from anterograde amnesia. I’m alluding to the fact that
if you have a coworker who joins your organization, this coworker will
over time learn your organization and they will understand and gain a
huge amount of context about the organization. And they go home and they
sleep and they consolidate knowledge. They develop expertise over time.
LLMs don’t natively do this and this is not something that has really
been solved in the R&amp;D of LLMs.
</p>
<p>
Context windows are really like working memory and you have to program
the working memory quite directly because they don’t get smarter by
default. I think a lot of people get tripped up by the analogies in this
way.
</p>
<p>
In popular culture I recommend people watch these two movies:
<em>Memento</em> and <em>50 First Dates</em>. In both of these movies
the protagonists their weights are fixed and their context windows gets
wiped every single morning. It’s really problematic to go to work or
have relationships when this happens and this happens to all the time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The very essence of the dilemma is that the complete context for the
required features and functionality (the design fidelity) must be
relayed to the LLM (at the cost of prompt efficiency) or else
post-generation revisions are required (at the cost of output
usability). Achieving maximal design fidelity through prompting demands
a level of detail that effectively mirrors writing the code itself. To
get truly bespoke, usable code quickly, you’d need an AI that perfectly
understands your intricate design intent and all necessary context
without explicit instruction—a capability LLMs simply do not possess.
</p>
<p>
This means that a sacrifice must always be made: either in the ease of
prompting, the correctness and usability of the output, or the
relinquishing of full design control and settling for generic or
somewhat misaligned outputs. You need to be prepared to be highly
specific in giving instructions to an LLM and even after doing so, still
expect to spend significant time in follow-up prompts or manual code
revisions to achieve the results you want.
</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-dilemma">
Navigating the dilemma
</h2>
<p>
The AI delegation dilemma means that the LLM-wielding software developer
must make a series of trade offs when opting to delegate work to an LLM.
There are several different approaches in navigating the dilemma and the
best approach largely depends on the nature of the work that the
developer is performing.
</p>
<h3 id="picking-your-two-priorities-wisely">
Picking your two priorities wisely
</h3>
<p>
Each pair of priorities requires a different set of expectations and
leads to distinct usage of the LLM.
</p>
<h4 id="get-a-working-prototype-quickly-prompt-efficiency-output-usability-sacrificing-design-fidelity">
Get a working prototype quickly: Prompt Efficiency + Output Usability
(sacrificing Design Fidelity)
</h4>
<p>
For quick, immediately usable results without concern for the specifics,
you can write concise prompts and embrace generic solutions. This
approach works for rapid prototyping. Accept that the AI will make
design and functionality assumptions, and budget for potential
refactoring if the code later becomes critical.
</p>
<p>
The downside of this approach is obvious: you’re going to get generic
results that don’t necessarily do what you’d ideally want them to do.
Depending on the brevity of your prompts and your willingness to accept
whatever the LLM produces, you might end up with what is often referred
to as “AI slop,” or low quality output that is immediately recognizable
as automatically generated. Use this approach for production code at
your peril.
</p>
<h4 id="produce-a-useful-starting-point-design-fidelity-prompt-efficiency-sacrificing-output-usability">
Produce a useful starting point: Design Fidelity + Prompt Efficiency
(sacrificing Output Usability)
</h4>
<p>
If you need to maintain tight control over the design while keeping
prompting quick, view the AI as a brainstorming partner generating a
rough draft. This means using concise prompts to convey your intent, but
being ready for extensive manual editing and cleanup of the AI’s output,
utilizing it primarily for ideation or as a conceptual starting point.
</p>
<p>
This is a path to get the results you actually want while shaving away
some of the tedium in a new project, including things like writing
boilerplate code beyond what the framework provides for you, setting up
configuration, or creating template files that will be written in later
on.
</p>
<p>
With this approach, the downside—or, depending on your perspective,
upside—is that you’re only using the AI for a boost, recognizing that
most of the work will be done by you, the software developer.
</p>
<h4 id="create-comprehensive-specifications-for-maximal-precision-design-fidelity-output-usability-sacrificing-prompt-efficiency">
Create comprehensive specifications for maximal precision: Design
Fidelity + Output Usability (sacrificing Prompt Efficiency)
</h4>
<p>
When demanding usable code that aligns with your design and functional
requirements, be prepared for substantial effort in writing detailed
prompts iteratively. This means providing explicit examples, defining
all constraints, and enabling “thinking modes” allow the LLM to produce
a better result at the cost of more time.
</p>
<p>
Like the preceding approach, this tactic seeks to maintain Design
Fidelity over the results except it puts the onus of implementation on
the LLM rather than a human developer. The task of the human is to
supply all of the relevant details of the look, feel, and behavior of
the software in English (or whatever non-programming language is
chosen).
</p>
<p>
The downsides of this approach are the burdens associated with relaying
a level of detail that coerces the LLM to produce the correct results,
along with the need to subsequently review and test the extensive
outputs. As mentioned earlier, prompting with sufficient detail to
achieve the ultimate level of fidelity will converge with the level of
effort required in writing the code itself. Moreover, the limitations of
the context window that an LLM operates under means that very large
prompts are often at odds with good performance and cost. So even when
providing ample context, delegating the task to the LLM may be
impractical.
</p>
<h2 id="avoid-the-dilemma-entirely">
Avoid the dilemma entirely
</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.foxhound.systems/img/2025-06-27-ai-delegation-dilemma/exit_1280.jpg" class="w-100 md-w-60" alt="A photograph of an exit sign" />
<figcaption>
 
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Sometimes the best way to navigate the dilemma is to avoid it
altogether. When working on critical code with hyper-specific
requirements, large code bases that require large amounts of contextual
information, or when integrating with existing complex systems, it is
best to avoid delegating large amounts of work to an LLM.
</p>
<p>
For example, if working in a well-established code base, delegating a
large refactoring task to an LLM can result in significant deviation
from existing conventions, introduction of new assumptions, or other
undesirable changes. If inclined to use an LLM for such a task, the
safer path is to use it to assist with refactoring smaller pieces but
steer the high level process on your own.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that with large volumes of work delegated to an AI, the
burden or review and revision falls on you, the human developer. In the
same way that sometimes a senior engineer may avoid delegating a
critical task to a junior engineer because of the increased overall
burden caused by the need for more laborious review, avoiding delegation
to an AI will in many instances be the best way to get the highest
quality result for the lowest amount of total effort.
</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">
Takeaways
</h2>
<p>
AI-assisted programming brings with it the potential for additional
productivity, but it also introduces the AI delegation dilemma. This
fundamental trade-off between Design Fidelity, Prompt Efficiency, and
Output Usability means that when offloading larger programming tasks to
LLMs, you can achieve at most two out of the three priorities. This
isn’t a flaw in the tools themselves, but a consequence of their
probabilistic nature and their inherent lack of complete contextual
understanding of your specific project.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing this dilemma allows you to move beyond the initial “magic”
of AI code generation and adopt a more strategic approach. Whether you
choose to spend time on detailed prompting for precise output, accept
generic solutions for rapid prototyping, or use AI as a quick ideation
partner for later refinement, recognizing the trade offs is imperative.
And for truly critical, complex, or deeply integrated work, sometimes
the wisest choice is to avoid the delegation dilemma altogether, and
avoid using LLMs for wholesale code generation.

<h2 id="introducing-gemma-3n-the-developer-guide">Introducing Gemma 3n:
The developer guide</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-26, updated: 2025-06-26, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/">Introducing
Gemma 3n: The developer guide</a></strong>
</p>
Extremely consequential new open weights model release from Google
today:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Multimodal by design:</strong> Gemma 3n natively supports image,
audio, video, and text inputs and text outputs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Optimized for on-device:</strong> Engineered with a focus on
efficiency, Gemma 3n models are available in two sizes based on
<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/#per-layer-embeddings-(ple):-unlocking-more-memory-efficiency"><strong>effective</strong></a>
parameters: E2B and E4B. While their raw parameter count is 5B and 8B
respectively, architectural innovations allow them to run with a memory
footprint comparable to traditional 2B and 4B models, operating with as
little as 2GB (E2B) and 3GB (E4B) of memory.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is <strong>very</strong> exciting: a 2B and 4B model optimized for
end-user devices which accepts text, images <em>and</em> audio as
inputs!
</p>
<p>
Gemma 3n is also the most comprehensive day one launch I’ve seen for any
model: Google partnered with “AMD, Axolotl, Docker, Hugging Face,
llama.cpp, LMStudio, MLX, NVIDIA, Ollama, RedHat, SGLang, Unsloth, and
vLLM” so there are dozens of ways to try this out right now.
</p>
<p>
So far I’ve run two variants on my Mac laptop. Ollama offer
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3n">a 7.5GB version</a> (full
tag <code>gemma3n:e4b-it-q4_K_M0</code>) of the 4B model, which I ran
like this:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull gemma3n
llm install llm-ollama
llm -m gemma3n:latest "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p>
It drew me this:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The pelican looks a bit like a grey pig. It is floating above a bicycle that looks more like a rail cart." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3n-ollama.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
The Ollama version doesn’t appear to support image or audio input yet.
</p>
<p>
… but the <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a>
version does!
</p>
<p>
First I tried that on
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelican-joke-request.wav">this
WAV file</a> like so (using a recipe adapted from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-8R2UvUBrc">Prince Canuma’s
video</a>):
</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-vlm mlx_vlm.generate \
  --model gg-hf-gm/gemma-3n-E4B-it \
  --max-tokens 100 \
  --temperature 0.7 \
  --prompt "Transcribe the following speech segment in English:" \
  --audio pelican-joke-request.wav
</code></pre>
<p>
That downloaded a 15.74 GB bfloat16 version of the model and output the
following correct transcription:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tell me a joke about a pelican.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then I had it draw me a pelican for good measure:
</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-vlm mlx_vlm.generate \
  --model gg-hf-gm/gemma-3n-E4B-it \
  --max-tokens 100 \
  --temperature 0.7 \
  --prompt "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p>
I quite like this one:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The bicycle is a sin wave, but you can make out which bits are the frame and the wheels. The pelican is white with a black triangular bill. It's a much better attempt than the Ollama one." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3n-mlx-vlm.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
It’s interesting to see such a striking visual difference between those
7.5GB and 15GB model quantizations.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I had it describe the image it had just created:
</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-vlm mlx_vlm.generate \
  --model gg-hf-gm/gemma-3n-E4B-it \
  --max-tokens 1000 \
  --prompt "Describe image" \
  --image gemma3n-mlx-vlm.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s what I got back - it thought this was a chemical diagram!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The image is a cartoon-style illustration depicting a molecular
structure against a light blue background. The structure is composed of
several differently colored and shaped elements connected by curved
black lines.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a breakdown of the elements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Large Black Circles:</strong> There are two large, solid black
circles, likely representing larger molecules or components.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cream-Colored Oval:</strong> A prominent cream-colored oval
shape is centrally located and connected to other elements. It has a
smaller, darker cream-colored sphere attached to its left side.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Red Oval:</strong> A smaller, solid red oval is positioned near
one of the black circles and connected to the cream-colored oval.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Black Lines:</strong> These lines act as bonds, connecting the
various molecular components. They are curved and dynamic, suggesting
movement or interaction.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Triangular Shape:</strong> A small black triangle is attached to
the smaller cream-colored sphere.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Letter “I”:</strong> The letter “I” appears twice, likely
labeling specific parts of the molecule.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The overall impression is of a simplified representation of a biological
molecule, possibly a protein or a complex organic compound. The use of
different colors helps to distinguish the various components within the
structure.
</p>

<p>Krugman doesn’t understand what’s coming for NYC. And doesn’t
understand the leadership Cuomo uniquely provided at the height of
Covid. It’s pretty likely what’s coming for the city is probably going
to be worse than Covid or 9-11.</p>

<p>
Yesterday Anthropic got
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/ai-powered-apps-with-claude/">a
bunch of buzz</a> out of their new <code>window.claude.complete()</code>
API which allows Claude Artifacts to run their own API calls to execute
prompts.
</p>
<p>
It turns out Gemini had beaten them to that feature by over a month, but
the announcement was tucked away in a bullet point of their
<a href="https://gemini.google.com/updates">release notes</a> for the
20th of May:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Vibe coding apps in Canvas just got better too! With just a few prompts,
you can now build fully functional personalised apps in Canvas that can
use Gemini-powered features, save data between sessions and share data
between multiple users.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ethan Mollick
<a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1938091740121935929">has been
building</a> some neat demos on top of Gemini Canvas, including this
<a href="https://gemini.google.com/share/42dfb2004b7e">text adventure
starship bridge simulator</a>.
</p>
<p>
Similar to Claude Artifacts, Gemini Canvas detects if the application
uses APIs that require authentication (to run prompts, for example) and
requests the user sign in with their Google account:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Futuristic sci-fi interface screenshot showing &quot;Helm Control&quot; at top with navigation buttons for Helm, Comms, Science, Tactical, Engineering, and Operations, displaying red error message &quot;[SYSTEM_ERROR] Connection to AI core failed: API error: 403.

<h2 id="build-and-share-ai-powered-apps-with-claude">Build and share
AI-powered apps with Claude</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, updated: 2025-06-25, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-powered-artifacts">Build
and share AI-powered apps with Claude</a></strong>
</p>
Anthropic have added one of the most important missing features to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">Claude
Artifacts</a>: apps built as artifacts now have the ability to run their
own prompts against Claude via a new API.
</p>
<p>
Claude Artifacts are web apps that run in a strictly controlled browser
sandbox: their access to features like localStorage or the ability to
access external APIs via <code>fetch()</code> calls is restricted by CSP
headers and the <code>&lt;iframe sandbox=“…”</code> mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The new <code>window.claude.complete()</code> method opens a hole that
allows prompts composed by the JavaScript artifact application to be run
against Claude.
</p>
<p>
As before, you can publish apps built using artifacts such that anyone
can see them. The moment your app tries to execute a prompt the current
user will be required to sign into their own Anthropic account so that
the prompt can be billed against them, and not against you.
</p>
<p>
I’m amused that Anthropic turned “we added a window.claude.complete()
function to Artifacts” into what looks like a major new product launch,
but I can’t say it’s bad marketing for them to do that!
</p>
<p>
As always, the crucial details about how this all works are tucked away
in tool descriptions in the system prompt. Thankfully this one was
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/42b70567-8534-4080-9227-b834e8c13d6e">easy
to leak</a>. Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/31957633864d1b7dd60012b2205fd747">the
full set of instructions</a>, which start like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When using artifacts and the analysis tool, you have access to
window.claude.complete. This lets you send completion requests to a
Claude API. This is a powerful capability that lets you orchestrate
Claude completion requests via code. You can use this capability to do
sub-Claude orchestration via the analysis tool, and to build
Claude-powered applications via artifacts.
</p>
<p>
This capability may be referred to by the user as “Claude in Claude” or
“Claudeception”.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
The API accepts a single parameter – the prompt you would like to
complete. You can call it like so: <code>const response = await
window.claude.complete(‘prompt you would like to complete’)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I haven’t seen “Claudeception” in any of their official documentation
yet!
</p>
<p>
That <code>window.claude.complete(prompt)</code> method is also
available to the Claude analysis tool. It takes a string and returns a
string.
</p>
<p>
The new function only handles strings. The tool instructions provide
tips to Claude about prompt engineering a JSON response that will look
frustratingly familiar:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>
Use strict language: Emphasize that the response must be in JSON format
only. For example: “Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON
object. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure, including
backticks
<code>.”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be emphatic about the importance of having only JSON. If you really want Claude to care, you can put things in all caps – e.g., saying “DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN VALID JSON. DON’T INCLUDE LEADING BACKTICKS LIKE</code>json.”.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Talk about Claudeception… now even Claude itself knows that you have to
YELL AT CLAUDE to get it to output JSON sometimes.
</p>
<p>
The API doesn’t provide a mechanism for handling previous conversations,
but Anthropic works round that by telling the artifact builder how to
represent a prior conversation as a JSON encoded array:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Structure your prompt like this:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">conversationHistory</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-kos">[</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">{</span> <span class="pl-c1">role</span>: <span class="pl-s">"user"</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-c1">content</span>: <span class="pl-s">"Hello, Claude!"</span> <span class="pl-kos">}</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span>

<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">prompt</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">`</span>
<span class="pl-s">The following is the COMPLETE conversation history. You MUST consider ALL of these messages when formulating your response:</span>

<span class="pl-s"></span>

<span class="pl-s">  "sentiment": "brief description of the conversation's current sentiment"</span>
<span class="pl-s">}</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.</span>
<span class="pl-s">`</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>

</blockquote>
<p>
There’s another example in there showing how the state of play for a
role playing game should be serialized as JSON and sent with every
prompt as well.
</p>
<p>
The tool instructions acknowledge another limitation of the current
Claude Artifacts environment: code that executes there is effectively
invisible to the main LLM - error messages are not automatically
round-tripped to the model. As a result it makes the following
recommendation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Using <code>window.claude.complete</code> may involve complex
orchestration across many different completion requests. Once you create
an Artifact, you are not able to see whether or not your completion
requests are orchestrated correctly. Therefore, you SHOULD ALWAYS test
your completion requests first in the analysis tool before building an
artifact.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve already seen it do this in my own experiments: it will fire up the
“analysis” tool (which allows it to run JavaScript directly and see the
results) to perform a quick prototype before it builds the full
artifact.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my first attempt at an AI-enabled artifact: a translation app. I
built it using the following single prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Let’s build an AI app that uses Claude to translate from one
language to another</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/e26be9a8-739c-45de-8aee-86dafed4aa87">the
transcript</a>. You can
<a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/1aeb7042-2004-4549-a97d-ca740d0f1bf0">try
out the resulting app here</a> - the app it built me looks like this:
</p>

</p>
<p>
<p>If you want to use this feature yourself you’ll need to turn on
“Create AI-powered artifacts” in the “Feature preview” section at the
bottom of your “Settings -&gt; Profile” section. I had to do that in the
Claude web app as I couldn’t find the feature toggle in the Claude iOS
application. This
<a href="https://claude.ai/settings/profile">claude.ai/settings/profile</a>
page should have it for your account.</p>

<h2 id="gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, updated: 2025-06-25, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/">Gemini
CLI</a></strong>
</p>
First there was
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/24/claude-37-sonnet-and-claude-code/">Claude
Code</a> in February, then
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/16/">OpenAI Codex (CLI)</a>
in April, and now Gemini CLI in June. All three of the largest AI labs
now have their own version of what I am calling a “terminal agent” - a
CLI tool that can read and write files and execute commands on your
behalf in the terminal.
</p>
<p>
I’m honestly a little surprised at how significant this category has
become: I had assumed that terminal tools like this would always be
something of a niche interest, but given the number of people I’ve heard
from spending hundreds of dollars a month on Claude Code this niche is
clearly larger and more important than I had thought!
</p>
<p>
I had a few days of early access to the Gemini one. It’s very good - it
takes advantage of Gemini’s million token context and has good taste in
things like when to read a file and when to run a command.
</p>
<p>
Like OpenAI Codex and unlike Claude Code it’s open source (Apache 2) -
the full source code can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">google-gemini/gemini-cli</a>
on GitHub. The core system prompt
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/0915bf7d677504c28b079693a0fe1c853adc456e/packages/core/src/core/prompts.ts#L40-L109">lives
in core/src/core/prompts.ts</a> - I’ve extracted that out as
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9e5f13665b3112cea00035df7da696c6">a
rendered Markdown Gist</a>.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the system prompt doubles as extremely accurate and concise
documentation of what the tool can do! Here’s what it has to say about
comments, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Comments:</strong> Add code comments sparingly. Focus on
<em>why</em> something is done, especially for complex logic, rather
than <em>what</em> is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary
for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are
seperate from the code you are changing. <em>NEVER</em> talk to the user
or describe your changes through comments.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The list of preferred technologies is interesting too:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When key technologies aren’t specified prefer the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Websites (Frontend):</strong> React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with
Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Back-End APIs:</strong> Node.js with Express.js
(JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Full-stack:</strong> Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS
and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python
(Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with
Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.
</li>
<li>
<strong>CLIs:</strong> Python or Go.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile App:</strong> Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin
Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and
principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose
(Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for
native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.

As far as I can tell Gemini CLI only defines a small selection of tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>edit</code>: To modify files programmatically.
</li>
<li>
<code>glob</code>: To find files by pattern.
</li>
<li>
<code>grep</code>: To search for content within files.
</li>
<li>
<code>ls</code>: To list directory contents.
</li>
<li>
<code>shell</code>: To execute a command in the shell
</li>
<li>
<code>memoryTool</code>: To remember user-specific facts.
</li>
<li>
<code>read-file</code>: To read a single file
</li>
<li>
<code>write-file</code>: To write a single file
</li>
<li>
<code>read-many-files</code>: To read multiple files at once.
</li>
<li>
<code>web-fetch</code>: To get content from URLs.
</li>
<li>
<code>web-search</code>: To perform a web search (using
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search">Grounding
with Google Search</a> via the Gemini API).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I found most of those by having Gemini CLI inspect its own code for me!
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/12c7b072e8e21ef1e040fb3b69c1da28">that
full transcript</a>, which used just over 300,000 tokens total.
</p>
<p>
How much does it cost? The announcement describes a generous free tier:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To use Gemini CLI free-of-charge, simply login with a personal Google
account to get a free Gemini Code Assist license. That free license gets
you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and its massive 1 million token context
window. To ensure you rarely, if ever, hit a limit during this preview,
we offer the industry’s largest allowance: 60 model requests per minute
and 1,000 requests per day at no charge.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not yet clear to me if your inputs can be used to improve Google’s
models if you are using the free tier - that’s been the situation with
free prompt inference they have offered in the past.
</p>
<p>
<p>You can also drop in your own paid API key, at which point your data
will not be used for model improvements and you’ll be billed based on
your token usage.</p>

wins a major fair use victory for AI — but it’s still in trouble for
stealing books</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-24, updated: 2025-06-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692015/anthropic-wins-a-major-fair-use-victory-for-ai-but-its-still-in-trouble-for-stealing-books">Anthropic
wins a major fair use victory for AI — but it’s still in trouble for
stealing books</a></strong>
</p>
Major USA legal news for the AI industry today. Judge William Alsup
released a “summary judgement” (a legal decision that results in some
parts of a case skipping a trial) in a lawsuit between five authors and
Anthropic concerning the use of their books in training data.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25982181-authors-v-anthropic-ruling/">judgement
itself</a> is a very readable 32 page PDF, and contains all sorts of
interesting behind-the-scenes details about how Anthropic trained their
models.
</p>
<p>
The facts of the complaint go back to the very beginning of the company.
Anthropic was founded by a group of ex-OpenAI researchers in February
2021. According to the judgement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So, in January or February 2021, another Anthropic cofounder, Ben Mann,
downloaded Books3, an online library of 196,640 books that he knew had
been assembled from unauthorized copies of copyrighted books — that is,
pirated. Anthropic’s next pirated acquisitions involved downloading
distributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries. In June 2021,
Mann downloaded in this way at least five million copies of books from
Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had been pirated. And, in July
2022, Anthropic likewise downloaded at least two million copies of books
from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLiMi, which Anthropic knew had been
pirated.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Books3 was also listed as
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/27/wordcamp-llms/#how-they-are-trained">part
of the training data</a> for Meta’s first LLaMA model!
</p>
<p>
Anthropic apparently used these sources of data to help build an
internal “research library” of content that they then filtered and
annotated and used in training runs.
</p>
<p>
Books turned out to be a very valuable component of the “data mix” to
train strong models. By 2024 Anthropic had a new approach to collecting
them: purchase and scan millions of print books!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To find a new way to get books, in February 2024, Anthropic hired the
former head of partnerships for Google’s book-scanning project, Tom
Turvey. He was tasked with obtaining “all the books in the world” while
still avoiding as much “legal/practice/business slog” as possible (Opp.
Exhs. 21, 27). […] Turvey and his team emailed major book distributors
and retailers about bulk-purchasing their print copies for the AI firm’s
“research library” (Opp. Exh. 22 at 145; Opp. Exh. 31 at -035589).
Anthropic spent many millions of dollars to purchase millions of print
books, often in used condition. Then, its service providers stripped the
books from their bindings, cut their pages to size, and scanned the
books into digital form — discarding the paper originals. Each print
book resulted in a PDF copy containing images of the scanned pages with
machine-readable text (including front and back cover scans for
softcover books).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The summary judgement found that these scanned books <em>did</em> fall
under fair use, since they were transformative versions of the works and
were not shared outside of the company. The downloaded ebooks did
<em>not</em> count as fair use, and it looks like those will be the
subject of a forthcoming jury trial.
</p>
<p>
Here’s that section of the decision:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before buying books for its central library, Anthropic downloaded over
seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these
pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them
to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should
have paid for these pirated library copies (e.g, Tr. 24–25, 65; Opp. 7,
12–13). This order agrees.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The most important aspect of this case is the question of whether
training an LLM on unlicensed data counts as “fair use”. The judge found
that it did. The argument for why takes up several pages of the document
but this seems like a key point:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts. They may need to pay
for getting their hands on a text in the first instance. But to make
anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each time they read it,
each time they recall it from memory, each time they later draw upon it
when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable. For centuries,
we have read and re-read books. We have admired, memorized, and
internalized their sweeping themes, their substantive points, and their
stylistic solutions to recurring writing problems.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>The judge who signed this summary judgement is an interesting
character: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alsup">William
Haskell Alsup</a> (yes, his middle name really is Haskell) presided over
jury trials for Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc in 2012 and 2016
where he famously used his hobbyist BASIC programming experience to
challenge claims made by lawyers in the case.</p>

id="phoenix.new-is-flys-entry-into-the-prompt-driven-app-development-space">Phoenix.new
is Fly’s entry into the prompt-driven app development space</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Here’s a fascinating new entrant into the AI-assisted-programming /
coding-agents space by <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, introduced
on their blog in
<a href="https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/">Phoenix.new
– The Remote AI Runtime for Phoenix</a>: describe an app in a prompt,
get a full Phoenix application, backed by SQLite and running on Fly’s
hosting platform. The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du7GmWGUM5Y">official
Phoenix.new YouTube launch video</a> is a good way to get a sense for
what this does.
</p>
<h4 id="background-on-phoenix-and-elixir-and-fly">
Background on Phoenix and Elixir and Fly
</h4>
<p>
First, some background.
<a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is an open
source web framework for Elixir, the Ruby-like language that compiles to
Erlang’s BEAM bytecode and runs on top of the highly concurrent Erlang
runtime. The signature feature of the framework is
<a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/main/README.md#feature-highlights">Phoenix
LiveView</a>, a toolkit for building realtime interfaces through
streaming diffs to server-side HTML over a WebSocket connection.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix was created by Chris McCord 11 years ago, and Chris joined Fly
nearly four years ago. <a href="http://phoenix.new/">Phoenix.new</a> is
his latest project.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix LiveView is a really great fit for Fly’s geographically
distributed application serving infrastructure. Fly co-founder Kurt
Mackey <a href="https://fly.io/blog/low-latency-liveview/">wrote about
that</a> in April 2021, before they had hired Chris, describing how
LiveView benefits from low latency by “moving app processes close to
users” - something Fly has been designed to help with from the start.
</p>
<p>
There’s one major challenge though: Elixir is still a niche programming
language, which means the number of people out there who are ready to
spin up a new Phoenix app has always been artificially limited.
</p>
<p>
Fly’s solution? Get LLMs to shave that learning curve down to <em>almost
nothing</em>.
</p>
<h4 id="prompt-driven-application-development-with-phoenix-new">
Prompt-driven application development with Phoenix.new
</h4>
<p>
Phoenix.new is a prompt-driven application development platform. You
describe what you want to build, then watch as an LLM-powered coding
agent writes, tests and iterates on code to help achieve that goal. It’s
in the same broad category as
<a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a>,
<a href="https://v0.dev/">v0.dev</a> and and
<a href="https://townie.val.run/">Val Town’s Townie</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important problems to solve with coding agents is to
give them a robust sandbox where they can run code without breaking
things outside of that space. Fly, at their heart, are a sandboxing
company - their <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines</a>
product makes it trivial to spin up a new sandboxed VM in just a few
seconds. I’m building <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette
Cloud</a> on Fly for exactly that reason.
</p>
<p>
I tried out Phoenix.new with the following starter prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>A notebook application. Notes are rich text, using a nice visual
markdown editors. The first line of a note becomes the title. Notes have
a URL that is a 6 character random text string - thise can be used to
link notes to each other by dropping in an @ sign and that text string.
A hash and then text becomes a tag, clicking a tag goes to a page with
that tag on. Notes are all in SQLite FTS so they can be searched with a
search tool.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Watching it work was <em>fascinating</em>. It provides a full IDE-style
environment in the browser, running a dedicated container and with a
forwarded port to allow you to interact with the running application
<em>while it is being built</em>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/phoenix-new.jpg" alt="Browser IDE interface showing a notebook app development project with a left sidebar containing a chat session that starts &quot;What would you like to build?&quot; with options like &quot;todo list&quot;, &quot;chat app&quot;, &quot;product landing page&quot;, then a main editor displaying plan.md file with detailed development steps including &quot;Generate a Phoenix LiveView project called 'notebook'&quot; and &quot;Start the server so you can view the app as we build it&quot;. The bottom has a terminal showing &quot;All dependencies are up to date&quot;, &quot;Generated notebook app&quot;, &quot;Done in 241ms&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
It spun up a <code>plan.md</code>, planned out the approach and started
working through the code. Most interestingly, it constantly tested the
application it was building using a testing tool that looked similar to
my own <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a>.
Here’s an example of the output from that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can see the issue! The page is still showing the “Welcome to your
Notebook” message instead of the form. Let me wait a moment for the
JavaScript to execute and then check if the form appeared.
</p>
<p>
<code>$ web http://localhost:4000 –js “setTimeout(() =&gt; {
document.querySelector(‘button[phx-click="start_creating"]’).click(); },
500); setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log(‘Form visible?’,
!!document.querySelector(‘textarea’)); console.log(‘Creating note
state:’, document.body.innerHTML.includes(‘Create New Note’)); },
2000);”</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m used to coding agents that write and execute their own tests, but
this is the most impressive example I’ve seen of a coding agent that
actively interacts with and tests the live application while it is
iterating on the code.
</p>
<p>
Most interestingly of all, since LiveView is a realtime framework, I
could interact directly with the application at the same time as the
machine was writing and testing it, seeing any changes it made instantly
in my browser!
</p>
<p>
How did it do? It got there in the end, but with hindsight my initial
prompt was a little too complex: I had to rescue it after it got stuck
in an error loop trying to implement SQLite full-text search. Just like
a project you build yourself it turns out to work much better if you
start with the simplest possible version of the application and then
iterate on it to add additional features.
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite details is how Git integration works. Phoenix.new
commits constantly as it works, and a menu option for “Clone X to your
local computer” then gives you a command that looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>git clone
“https://phoenix.new/git/WENQLj…big-random-string…VHFW/$RANDOM/notebook”</code>
</p>
<p>
Run that locally to get a full copy of the repo! I ran the following to
push it to a new repository in my GitHub account:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>git remote add github https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook.git
git push -u github main</pre>
</div>
<p>

<h4 id="how-much-did-i-learn-">
How much did I learn?
</h4>
<p>
My initial experiments with Phoenix.new were very much
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe
coding</a> - I interacted with the resulting application but didn’t pay
a great deal of attention to the code that was being written, despite it
being presented to me in an IDE that made it very easy to review what
was going on.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I didn’t learn much about the low-level syntax details of
how Phoenix and Elixir work. I did however get a strong feel for the
<em>shape</em> of Elixir and Phoenix at a high level as the code danced
past my eye.
</p>
<p>
It turns out having an LLM write an application in front of you is a
great way to start building understanding of what a framework can do.
</p>
<p>
It’s almost like watching a YouTube livestream of an experienced
developer speed running building an application, except that app is
exactly what you asked them to build and you can interject and send them
in a new direction at any moment.

<h4 id="expanding-beyond-elixir-and-phoenix">
Expanding beyond Elixir and Phoenix
</h4>
<p>
Chris’s announcement included this note:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At this point you might be wondering – can I just ask it to build a
Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can.
</p>
<p>
Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care
about are already installed. We’re still figuring out where to take
this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in
my plans.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The browser-based IDE includes a terminal, and I checked and
<code>python3</code> and <code>python3 -m pip install datasette</code>
work there already.
</p>
<p>
If Fly do evolve this into a framework-agnostic tool for building web
apps they’ll probably need to rebrand it from Phoenix.new to something a
bit more generic!
</p>
<p>
Phoenix.new is currently priced as a $20/month subscription. Val Town
recently switched the pricing for their similar Townie assistant from a
subscription to to <a href="https://blog.val.town/townie-credits">pay
per use</a>, presumably because for many users this kind of tool is
something they would only use intermittently, although given the
capabilities of Phoenix.new it’s possible it could become a monthly
driver for people, especially as it expands out to cover more
frameworks.

<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSXaxOdVtAQ&amp;t=12m30s">
<p>
So you can think really big thoughts and the leverage of having those
big thoughts has just suddenly expanded enormously. I had
<a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1648413998025707520">this
tweet</a> two years ago where I said “90% of my skills just went to zero
dollars and 10% of my skills just went up 1000x”. And this is exactly
what I’m talking about - having a vision, being able to set milestones
towards that vision, keeping track of a design to maintain or control
the levels of complexity as you go forward. Those are hugely leveraged
skills now compared to knowing where to put the ampersands and the stars
and the brackets in Rust.
