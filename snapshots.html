      Glaciers in Central Asia have remained intact even as other parts of the world have seen rapid glacial loss. A new study shows that may be changing.

      <h1>Google antitrust remedies</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, updated: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/3/antitrust/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf">gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_1.pdf</a></strong></p>
Here's the 230 page PDF ruling on the 2023 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Google_LLC_(2023)">United States v. Google LLC federal antitrust case</a> - the case that could have resulted in Google selling off Chrome and cutting most of Mozilla's funding.</p>
<p>I made it through the first dozen pages - it's actually quite readable.</p>
<p>It opens with a clear summary of the case so far, bold highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, this court ruled that Defendant Google LLC had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” <strong>The court found that, for more than a decade, Google had entered into distribution agreements with browser developers, original equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers to be the out-of-the box, default general search engine (“GSE”) at key search access points</strong>. These access points were the most efficient channels for distributing a GSE, and Google paid billions to lock them up. The agreements harmed competition. <strong>They prevented rivals from accumulating the queries and associated data, or scale, to effectively compete and discouraged investment and entry into the market</strong>. And they enabled Google to earn monopoly profits from its search text ads, to amass an unparalleled volume of scale to improve its search product, and to remain the default GSE without fear of being displaced. Taken together, these agreements effectively “froze” the search ecosystem, resulting in markets in which Google has “no true competitor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's an interesting generative AI twist: when the case was first argued in 2023 generative AI wasn't an influential issue, but more recently Google seem to be arguing that it is an existential threat that they need to be able to take on without additional hindrance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The emergence of GenAl changed the course of this case. No witness at the liability trial testified that GenAl products posed a near-term threat to GSEs. <strong>The very first witness at the remedies hearing, by contrast, placed GenAl front and center as a nascent competitive threat</strong>. These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among GSEs as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAlI space. Many of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies are crafted with that latter objective in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked this note about the court's challenges in issuing effective remedies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding this power, courts must approach the task of crafting remedies with a healthy dose of humility. This court has done so. It has no expertise in the business of GSEs, the buying and selling of search text ads, or the engineering of GenAl technologies. <strong>And, unlike the typical case where the court’s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge’s forte</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On to the remedies. These ones looked particularly important to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Google will be barred from entering or maintaining any exclusive contract
relating to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant,
and the Gemini app. [...]</li>
<li>Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a
contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final
judgment. Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key
assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints. [...]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess Perplexity <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3dpr0kkyz4o">won't be buying Chrome</a> then!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other
consideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google
Search, Chrome, or its GenAl products. <strong>Cutting off payments from Google
almost certainly will impose substantial —in some cases, crippling—
downstream harms to distribution partners</strong>, related markets, and consumers,
which counsels against a broad payment ban.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks like a huge sigh of relief for Mozilla, who were at risk of losing a sizable portion of their income if Google's search distribution revenue were to be cut off.

      <p>
      Problem You need safe, predictable traffic control in prod. VirtualServices + DestinationRules give version routing, timeouts/retries, and circuit breaking without touching code.
Approach Define versioned subsets in a DestinationRule. Route via VirtualService with weights (canary → rollout). Add timeout, retries, and outlier detection. Shift weights, watch metrics, then cut over. Example (Config) # vs-dr.yaml apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: svc namespace: prod spec: host: svc.prod.svc.cluster.local subsets: - name: v1 labels: version: v1 - name: v2 labels: version: v2 trafficPolicy: tls: mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL outlierDetection: consecutive5xx: 5 interval: 5s baseEjectionTime: 30s maxEjectionPercent: 50 --- apiVersion: networking.

      <p><strong><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2025/making-xml-human-readable-without-xslt/">Making XML human-readable without XSLT</a></strong></p>
In response to the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/19/xslt/">recent discourse</a> about XSLT support in browsers, Jake Archibald shares a new-to-me alternative trick for making an XML document readable in a browser: adding the following element near the top of the XML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  src="script.js" defer="" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>script.js</code> will then be executed by the browser, and can swap out the XML with HTML by creating new elements using the correct namespace:</p>
<pre><code>const htmlEl = document.createElementNS(
  'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml',
  'html',
);
document.documentElement.replaceWith(htmlEl);
// Now populate the new DOM
</code></pre>

Neat Python library by Darren Burns adding pixel image support to the Rich terminal library, using tricks to render an image using full or half-height colored blocks.</p>

That <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/show_image.py">script is here</a>, you can run it with <code>uv</code> like this:</p>

      For better or for worse, AI has colonized this list so thoroughly that AI itself is little more than a list of announcements about new or upgraded models. But there are other points of interest. Is it just a coincidence (possibly to do with BlackHat) that so much happened in security in the past month? [&#8230;]

      <p>I just sent out my August 2025 <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/simonw">sponsors-only newsletter</a></strong> summarizing the past month in LLMs and my other work. Topics included GPT-5, gpt-oss, image editing models (Qwen-Image-Edit and Gemini Nano Banana), other significant model releases and the tools I'm using at the moment.</p>
<p>If you'd like a preview of the newsletter, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/722fc2f242977cb185838353776d14f4">the July 2025 edition</a> I sent out a month ago.</p>
<p>New sponsors get access to the full archive. If you start sponsoring for $10/month or more right now you'll get instant access to <a href="https://github.com/simonw-private/monthly/blob/main/2025-08-august.md">the August edition</a> in my <code>simonw-private/monthly</code> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>If you've already read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/">all 85 posts</a> I wrote in August the newsletter acts mainly as a recap, but I've had positive feedback from people who prefer to get the monthly edited highlights over reading the firehose that is my blog!</p>
<p>Here's the table of contents for the August newsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GPT-5</li>
<li>OpenAl's open models: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b</li>
<li>Other significant model releases in
August</li>
<li>Image editing: Qwen-Image-Edit and
Gemini Nano Banana</li>
<li>More prompt injection and more lethal trifecta</li>
<li>Tools I'm using at the moment</li>
<li>Bonus links</li>

Until then we're at the mercy of pieces of paper (articles of incorporation) that claim to be human without the responsibility attached.

      <h1>Introducing gpt-realtime</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, updated: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/1/introducing-gpt-realtime/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/">Introducing gpt-realtime</a></strong></p>
Released a few days ago (August 28th), <code>gpt-realtime</code> is OpenAI's new "most advanced speech-to-speech model". It looks like this is a replacement for the older <code>gpt-4o-realtime-preview</code> model that was released <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/">last October</a>.</p>
<p>This is a slightly confusing release. The previous realtime model was clearly described as a variant of GPT-4o, sharing the same October 2023 training cut-off date as that model.</p>
<p>I had expected that <code>gpt-realtime</code> might be a GPT-5 relative, but its training date is still October 2023 whereas GPT-5 is September 2024.</p>
<p><code>gpt-realtime</code> also shares the relatively low 32,000 context token and 4,096 maximum output token limits of <code>gpt-4o-realtime-preview</code>.</p>
<p>The only reference I found to GPT-5 in the documentation for the new model was a note saying "Ambiguity and conflicting instructions degrade performance, similar to GPT-5."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-models-prompting#general-usage-tips">usage tips</a> for <code>gpt-realtime</code> have a few surprises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Iterate relentlessly</strong>. Small wording changes can make or break behavior.</p>
<p>Example: Swapping “inaudible” → “unintelligible” improved noisy input handling. [...]</p>
<p><strong>Convert non-text rules to text</strong>: The model responds better to clearly written text.</p>
<p>Example: Instead of writing, "IF x &gt; 3 THEN ESCALATE", write, "IF MORE THAN THREE FAILURES THEN ESCALATE."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a whole lot more prompting tips in the new <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide">Realtime Prompting Guide</a>.</p>
<p>OpenAI list several key improvements to <code>gpt-realtime</code> including the ability to configure it with a list of MCP servers, "better instruction following" and the ability to send it images.</p>
<p>My biggest confusion came from <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">the pricing page</a>, which lists separate pricing for using the Realtime API with <code>gpt-realtime</code> and GPT-4o mini. This suggests to me that the old <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview">gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview</a> model is still available, despite it no longer being listed on the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">OpenAI models page</a>.</p>
<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview</code> is a <strong>lot</strong> cheaper:</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Model</th>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The mini model also has a much longer 128,000 token context window.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Turns out that was <a href="https://twitter.com/_agamble/status/1962839472837361807">a mistake in the documentation</a>, that mini model has a 16,000 token context size.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: OpenAI's <a href="https://twitter.com/pbbakkum/status/1962901822135525695">Peter Bakkum clarifies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different voice models in API and ChatGPT, but they share some recent improvements. The voices are also different.</p>
<p>gpt-realtime has a mix of data specific enough to itself that its not really 4o or 5</p>

Cloudflare launched this dashboard <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/expanded-ai-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/">back in February</a>, incorporating traffic analysis from Cloudflare's network along with insights from their popular 1.1.1.1 DNS service.</p>
<p>I found this chart particularly interesting, showing which documented AI crawlers are most active collecting training data - lead by GPTBot, ClaudeBot and Meta-ExternalAgent:</p>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing HTTP traffic by bot over time from August 26 to September 1. HTTP traffic by bot - HTTP request trends for top five most active AI bots. Crawl purpose: Training.

X-axis shows dates: Tue, Aug 26, Wed, Aug 27, Thu, Aug 28, Fri, Aug 29, Sat, Aug 30, Sun, Aug 31, Mon, Sep 1. Top right shows Crawl purpose dropdown set to &quot;Training&quot; with X and checkmark buttons." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/http-traffic-by-bot.jpg" /></p>
<p>Cloudflare's DNS data also hints at the popularity of different services. ChatGPT holds the first place, which is unsurprising - but second place is a hotly contested race between Claude and Perplexity and #4/#5/#6 is contested by GitHub Copilot, Perplexity, and Codeium/Windsurf.</p>
<p>Google Gemini comes in 7th, though since this is DNS based I imagine this is undercounting instances of Gemini on <code>google.com</code> as opposed to <code>gemini.google.com</code>.</p>

      <p>
      
<p>This website is editable!</p>

<p>If you add <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/?edit=&amp;ref=rss"><code>?edit</code></a> to any URL on this site, it activates <strong>edit mode</strong>. In this mode, you can edit text and apply basic formatting to any element.</p>

<p>Of course, you won’t be able to save changes without having write access to my files, but I can. Using the Web <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access" target="_blank"><strong>File System API</strong></a>, it can update my local copy of the website’s source code.</p>

</window-decor>
<p>In short, I can edit my site via my site. In fact, this article was written this way!</p>

<p>It’s still rough in some cases, but the solution is usable.</p>

<h2>But why?</h2>

<p>As usual, I made this mainly for fun. But having a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor for my posts has been a long time goal ever since I <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/vanilla-web-rewrite?ref=rss" target="_blank">rewrote my site in vanilla HTML</a>.</p>

<p>After I moved away from a static site generator, the need for an extra transformational build step disappeared, allowing the raw HTML source to be directly served in the client. This unlocked a path to source editing in the client! As well as other basic&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces" target="_blank">things</a>&nbsp;for free.</p>

<p>The HTML file can now act as the editing platform, in addition to being the coding and authoring medium, and of course, the publishing medium.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/html-3.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="450" height="300">

<p>We're sticking with standards with this one. I’ve noticed that this has been the tendency of my personal use of Web tech.</p>
<prose-table>
  <table>
    <tbody><tr>
      <th>Instead of…
      </th><th>I use
    </th></tr><tr>
      <td>CMS
      </td><td>the file system
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>frontmatter
      </td><td>read data already in the markup,<br>
        <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tag-chip&gt;</code>s
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>WYSIWYG editor
      </td><td>editable HTML page
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>Advanced editor (?)
      </td><td>text editor (edit HTML code)
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>Widgets (??)
      </td><td>JavaScript
  </td></tr></tbody></table>
</prose-table>
<p>Anyway, these things don’t really impact visitors and readers of this site. It’s more about my writing and authoring experience. Thoughts can now go directly into the page the way it’s gonna be read.</p>

<p>I already felt a bit of that improved flow when I removed the build step and added a <a href="https://leanrada.com/notes/simple-live-reload?ref=rss" target="_blank">live reload script</a>, minimising the development feedback loop. With direct editing, feedback loop is instant — no more switching between the text editor and the browser! It’s been extremely valuable during the proofreading and editing phase.</p>

<h2>Content, editable</h2>

<p>Browsers support editing HTML natively via the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute. Set this attribute on any element and it becomes editable. It’s a barebones way to get a WYSIWYG editor in HTML. This is what I’m using as of time of writing.</p>

<p><code>contenteditable</code> formatting options are limited though, and browser implementations vary. Not a problem for now.</p>

<p>Whether <code>contenteditable</code> was good <a href="https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480" target="_blank">or terrible</a>&nbsp;was a minor detail in the bigger picture. The real problem was the <em>Document Object Model</em>…</p>

<h2>DOM vs source</h2>

<p>When I said no build step I kinda lied. You see, there's still an inherent compilation step that happens <em>inside the browser</em>. This step is the parsing of HTML into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" target="_blank"><strong>Document Object Model</strong></a>, or the <strong>DOM</strong>. The “DOM” essentially are the elements that you actually interact with on a webpage.</p>
<box-note>Technically, the DOM is the interface to the elements themselves. For general purposes, <em>the interface is the abstraction</em>.</box-note>
<p>The contenteditable editor edits the DOM, not the HTML source code itself. I needed to somehow save the corresponding DOM edits into the source. It was not very straightforward.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/dom.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="450" height="300">

<p>HTML to DOM conversion is one way. DOM to source HTML would be another thing. And no, <code>innerHTML</code>/<code>outerHTML</code> is not the exact inverse operation.</p>

<p>For example, simply saving <code>html.outerHTML</code> to a file won’t work, because <code>outerHTML</code> (or any DOM introspection method, for that matter) takes a snapshot of the current state of the DOM, including <em>dynamically rendered elements</em>. This would break interactive elements and custom elements in the source, as the rendered elements would incorrectly overwrite the original markup.</p>

<p>Saving the generated <code>outerHTML</code> directly would also mess up any manual formatting that I make in the source code, collapsing whitespaces and forcing HTML entities. <small>(I don’t use Prettier; it produces invalid HTML)</small></p>

<h2>Solution: source patching</h2>

<p>So I made an algorithm to patch the source according to changes made in the DOM. What it does is listen for changes in the DOM tree, and tries to identify the ‘smallest’ textual patch needed to update the source.</p>

<p>It starts with the <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver" target="_blank">MutationObserver API</a></strong>. MutationObserver lets the code respond to changes in the DOM. For each change, the API provides the relevant node(s), as well as the two surrounding unchanged siblings.</p>
<box-note>
  <details>
    <summary>Btw, the MutationObserver API has been <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1105" target="_blank">somewhat</a> <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1111" target="_blank">unwieldy</a>.</summary>

    <p>It only provides coarse details about each change, not like a detailed diff. Also, a single user interaction (say, pressing the Enter key) could cause multiple mutations to fire (the Enter key causes a &lt;p&gt; to be inserted, then a &lt;br&gt; inside the p). Some mutations also end up cancelling each other in the same callback or across multiple callbacks (e.g. span that is added and removed immediately). The exact order and amount of effects also vary by browser.</p>

    <p>My workaround was to collapse multiple mutations into one logical change per resulting subtree.</p>
  </details>
</box-note>
<p>The idea is to update the relevant part of the source without changing the rest. To do this, it finds two anchor points around the mutation. These two points must remain stable throughout the mutation in both DOM and source. Only the content between them are replaced.</p>

<p>So for each change, the steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the unchanged element before the change.
  </li><li>Find the unchanged element after the change.
  </li><li>Use their <em>positions in source</em> as boundaries.
  </li><li>Splice the source <em>between the two boundaries</em> with the updated HTML.
</li></ol>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/editing-website-in-browser/splice.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy">

<p>Then there’s the subproblem of mapping the position of the boundary elements in the source code. Extracting the position of any given DOM element in the source code is a bit more involved:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get the element’s ‘address’, or its path in the DOM (unique steps from the root to the element).
  </li><li>Scan the source HTML, tag by tag, keeping track of your current ‘address’ by identifying opening and closing tags.
  </li><li>Compare the current tag’s path-in-source against the element’s path-in-DOM.
  </li><li>If paths match, then the current tag corresponds to the element!
</li></ol>
<card-box>
  <details>
    <summary>
      <code>getPositionInSource</code> pseudocode
    </summary>

    <code-block>
      <pre><code>/** Gets the position of the given Element in the source code */
getPositionInSource(element: Element, source: string) {
  // Get the DOM path of the target
  domPath: Element = [];
  while (element) {
    domPath.unshift(element);
    element = element.parentElement;
  }

  let startIndex, endIndex;

  sourcePath = [];
  //                 match all HTML tags
  for (tag of source.matchAll(/&lt;\/?[a-z0-9-]+/gi)) {
    // Note: does not handle void elements and optional end tags
    if (isOpenTag(tag)) {
      sourcePath.push(tag);

      if (matchPath(domPath, sourcePath)) {
        // Source path and DOM path matches!
        // This is the target element's opening tag
        startIndex = tag.index;
      }
    } else { // is a closing tag
      if (matchPath(domPath, sourcePath)) {
        // Source path and DOM path matches!
        // This is the target element's closing tag
        endIndex = source.indexOf("&gt;", tag.index);
        return { startIndex, endIndex };
      }

      sourcePath.pop();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
    </code-block>

    <p>Handling void elements (e.g. <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>) and optional end tags (e.g. <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s with no end tags) require a bit more logic to keep the current path accurate, but the main idea remains the same.</p>
  </details>
</card-box>
<p>The main algorithm can be described as basically a contextual find-and-replace. Instead of searching for the text to be replaced, it finds the surrounding text and replaces the content in the middle.</p>

<p>This preserves the source code’s original formatting and avoids overwriting dynamic elements! Yay!</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of room for improvement. My current issue is that it’s converting nearby HTML entities to rendered versions (e.g. <code>'&amp;hellip;'</code> to <code>'…'</code>). I think I’d need to implement a more fine-grained editing within an individual text node to solve that.</p>

<p>There are probably a bunch more edges cases that I haven’t discovered, but hey it works well enough to write the text you’re reading!</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://leanrada.com/tools/edit.js" target="_blank">code for the edit mode</a> for more details! Note: This script was made specifically for myself and my site.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>The algorithm doesn’t have to be perfect; I can always fall back to editing the source if certain things don’t work. A good thing about this is that I can switch to either method any time because in the end I'm working on the same HTML file.</p>

<p>When I first imagined this solution, I thought I would only be using it to do the final edits just before publishing a post, but here I am actually writing a whole post.</p>

<p>I can now imagine a workflow where I write the main text in the browser, then go into the HTML to insert media, mark up code blocks, custom elements, and other formatting. And of course, I’d use a code editor to code the interactive sections that I enjoy adding to my posts.</p>

<p>In the future, think I’d like to add more formatting options and UI for inserting code blocks, media, lists, headings, etc. Maybe use <a href="https://quilljs.com/" target="_blank">Quill</a> or something?</p>

<p>The top thing I would love to have is inserting hyperlinks. During final passes on a post, I like to sprinkle hyperlinks on interesting terms, even if just to link the <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> entry.</p>

<p>I’ll post about any improvements I make along the way. This could be a series! I mean, it already kind of is:</p>

      <h1>GSoC 2025: Profiling and Testing Math Functions on GPUs</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2025-08-29-gsoc-profiling-and-testing-math-functions-on-gpus/">LLVM Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>With the increasing importance of GPU computing, having a robust and familiar C standard library becomes a valuable asset for developers. The LLVM project is actively working to provide this foundation, as a solid libc implementation enables more complex libraries to be developed for and used on GPUs.</p><p>A key part of this effort is providing the C standard math library (LLVM-libm) on GPUs, often reusing the same target-agnostic implementations developed for CPU targets. This context creates a twofold challenge. First, there is a need to systematically <strong>verify the conformance</strong> of these implementations to standards like OpenCL. Second, it is crucial to <strong>benchmark their performance</strong> against the highly-optimized vendor libraries to understand the trade-offs involved.</p><p>This Google Summer of Code 2025 project was designed to address both challenges by developing a framework for conformance testing as well as refining and expanding the existing benchmarking infrastructure. The work provides two benefits to the LLVM community:</p><ul><li>It <strong>empowers libc contributors</strong> with a robust tool to validate their GPU math function implementations.</li><li>It <strong>builds trust with end-users</strong> by providing transparent accuracy and performance data.</li></ul><p>This report details the work completed on this project.</p><h2 id="conformance-testing">Conformance Testing</h2><p>To address the goal of accuracy verification, I implemented a C++ framework for conformance testing within the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/offload/unittests/Conformance"><code>offload/unittests/Conformance</code></a> directory. This framework was designed to be extensible, easy to use, and capable of testing various implementation providers (<code>llvm-libm</code>, <code>cuda-math</code>, <code>hip-math</code>) across different hardware platforms (AMD, NVIDIA).</p><h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3><p>The framework&rsquo;s power and simplicity come from a few key components that work together:</p><ul><li><strong><code>DeviceContext</code></strong>: A lightweight wrapper around the new Offload API that abstracts away the low-level details of device discovery, resource management, and kernel launching.</li><li><strong><code>InputGenerator</code></strong>: An extensible interface for test input generation. The framework provides two concrete implementations:<ul><li><strong><code>ExhaustiveGenerator</code></strong>: Used for functions with small input spaces (e.g., half-precision functions and single-precision univariate functions), this generator iterates over every representable point in a given space, ensuring complete coverage.</li><li><strong><code>RandomGenerator</code></strong>: Used for functions with large input spaces (e.g., single-precision bivariate and double-precision functions), this generator produces a massive, deterministic stream of random points to sample the space thoroughly.</li></ul></li><li><strong><code>GpuMathTest</code></strong>: The main test harness class that orchestrates the entire process. It manages loading the correct GPU binary, setting up device buffers, invoking the generator, launching the kernel, and triggering the verification process.</li><li><strong><code>HostRefChecker</code></strong>: After the GPU computation is complete, this component calculates the expected result for each input on the host CPU (using the correctly rounded LLVM-libm&rsquo;s implementations) and computes the ULP (Units in the Last Place) distance to the actual result from the GPU.</li></ul><p>This architecture makes writing a new, complete test incredibly simple and concise. For example, a full exhaustive test for the <code>expf</code> function requires only a few lines of code:</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&#34;mathtest/TestRunner.hpp&#34;</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#75715e">// ... other includes</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// 1.

The second major goal of this project was to refine and expand the existing benchmarking framework to enable fair, reproducible, and insightful performance comparisons between LLVM-libc and vendor-optimized libraries. This effort involved overcoming several subtle challenges and significantly refactoring the infrastructure.</p><h3 id="key-enhancements">Key Enhancements</h3><p>The path to reliable performance data involved a series of foundational improvements to ensure that the results are fair, statistically sound, and reproducible. Key enhancements included:</p><ul><li><strong>Reproducibility and Fairness</strong>: The initial framework was enhanced with a deterministic, per-thread random number generator (PRNG) to ensure that LLVM-libc and vendor libraries are compared using the exact same input sequences. Additionally, to prevent misleading results caused by compiler optimizations, loop unrolling was explicitly disabled in the throughput measurement loop. This change prevents the compiler from aggressively optimizing the transparent libc code in a way that isn&rsquo;t possible for vendor libraries, ensuring a true apples-to-apples comparison.</li><li><strong>Statistical Soundness</strong>: The framework&rsquo;s statistical calculations were improved. The standard deviation is now computed correctly using a sum-of-squares approach, and results from multiple GPU threads are aggregated using a statistically sound pooled mean and variance. The timing logic was also refined to subtract a baseline measurement of the empty benchmark loop, isolating the true cost of the function call.</li><li><strong>Flexible Input Generation and New Benchmarks</strong>: To support a wider range of functions, the framework was refactored with a pluggable input generation system. New distribution classes, <code>UniformExponent</code> (for values spanning orders of magnitude) and <code>UniformLinear</code> (for linear ranges), were introduced. This new flexibility enabled the addition of a comprehensive suite of benchmarks for the <code>exp</code> and <code>log</code> families.</li></ul><h3 id="more-contributions">More Contributions</h3><p>The contributions that refined and expanded the benchmarking infrastructure were submitted in the following pull requests: <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153512">#153512</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153900">#153900</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/153971">#153971</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/155727">#155727</a>.</p><h3 id="performance-results">Performance Results</h3><p>As an example, see below part of the output from the <code>log</code> function benchmark on an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. It highlights interesting performance characteristics. Notice the exceptionally low and nearly constant cycles per call for NVIDIA&rsquo;s <code>__nv_logf</code>. Its IR reveals this is due to a compact <code>float</code>-only routine (a fixed sequence of FMAs plus simple bit manipulations) with Flush-To-Zero enabled and no lookup tables or divergent memory accesses.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span

      <p>
      <p>Docs are a product. Contributing to them is among the finest forms of product engagement. Bystanders can become builders and authors: They contribute a verse so that the powerful play can go on. They cease being the product to become the owners of the product narrative. And in this AI age, where docs <a href="https://passo.uno/from-tech-writers-to-ai-context-curators/">matter more than ever</a>, users who write can steer the future of products.</p>

      <p>Hey everyone!</p><p>This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects during the month of August.</p>

</ul>

<p>In preparation for a programming class that's coming up, we've implemented a graphical tiny-BASIC runtime called <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/sunflower-basic" target="_blank">Sunflower BASIC</a>. It contains the essential blocks of a BASIC language interpreter with enough features to communicate elementary programming concepts and how each one is implemented. We've also released the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYxAdjl1f0" target="_blank">Permacomputing 101</a> talk given at <a href='https://criticalsignals.nz/' target='_blank'>Critical Signals 2025</a> which covered a few interesting aspect of digital preservation and some tactics to craft software in a way that may last.</p>

<p>Choosing to remain in the Southern Gulf islands in August this year has permitted us to pick blackberries, <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/08/18.html" target="_blank">plums</a> and apples. We have incorporated the fruit into <a href="https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_blackberry_cake.html" target="_blank">cakes</a>, or just squished whole berries over morning toast. We processed some of the apples into <a href="https://grimgrains.com/site/chunky_apple_jam.html" target="_blank">jam</a>, and are currently delighting in eating through the rest. We've also been experimenting with the <a href="https://100r.co/site/solar_cooking.html">solar cooker</a>, preparing some <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/08/31.html" target="_blank">cinnamon buns</a> in it for the first time! See our cameo in our friend Peter's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiOcD4e7n6g" target="_blank">latest video</a>.</p>

      <h1>Building Your Own Antenna</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2025/08/31/Building_Your_Own_Antenna.html">Robert's Ramblings</a>)
      <p>
      I have been prototyping my personal news site called [Antenna](https://rsdoiel.github.io/antenna) since 2023. It was inspired by Dave Winer's [news.scripting.com](https://news.scripting.com). It has always run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running Raspberry Pi OS (Linux). The content is available over my home network and I make it public by publishing via GitHub pages. Over the last two years it has become the first place I go to consume content from the web (second is Dave's news.scripting.com).

This past month (August 2025), my prototype website lead me to write a new application I am calling [antenna](https://github.com/rsdoiel/antennaApp) after the website that inspired it.

Having the feeds in a simple text format means I curate the feeds more. When I relied on OPML it became just enough extra work hand editing XML that I wanted something simpler. I started with a feed file format inspired by [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org). It was a little too simple, wound up writing scripts to convert that format to something more general (e.g. OPML). I decided to pick something better known for my new application. That got me thinking. Lots of people know Markdown. A collection is a list of zero or more links. That's is easy to express as Markdown. It has the advantage of being able to be convert to other formats as needed (example using a Pandoc filter to render as OPML).

What about other configuration I might need?

The Markdown community has supported Metadata for the Markdown document as "front matter" expressed in YAML. That suggested YAML has alteast been seen by the allot of the Markdown community and is documented some place. Why not use it for specific configuration of my collection of feeds (e.g. the channel metadata rendered in RSS 2.0 XML for a collection) and use it as the configuration language for the Antenna application? Seems like a good match. I think people who work with Markdown maybe interested in generating static websites, they may have knowledge of YAML so that aligns with my applcation. ...

      One of the many issues with AI is one of responsibility—guardrails seem to take a backseat to growth. AI-enabled fast food drive-thrus shouldn’t have better backstops than ChatGPT, yet they do.

      <h1>Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality</h1>

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://status.anthropic.com/incidents/h26lykctfnsz">Claude Opus 4.1 and Opus 4 degraded quality</a></strong></p>
Notable because often when people complain of degraded model quality it turns out to be unfounded - Anthropic in the past have emphasized that they don't change the model weights after releasing them without changing the version number.</p>
<p>In this case a botched upgrade of their inference stack cause a genuine model degradation for 56.5 hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 17:30 UTC on Aug 25th to 02:00 UTC on Aug 28th, Claude Opus 4.1 experienced a degradation in quality for some requests. Users may have seen lower intelligence, malformed responses or issues with tool calling in Claude Code.</p>
<p>This was caused by a rollout of our inference stack, which we have since rolled back for Claude Opus 4.1. [...]</p>
<p>We’ve also discovered that Claude Opus 4.0 has been affected by the same issue and we are in the process of rolling it back.</p>

      From a library and archives point of view, this is an interesting approach to crawling. I applaud that Paolo's CRAWLer. It respects the robots.txt! Crawling done correctly. 

In the mean time, I continue to battle the bad bots written by AI and stupid Tech Bros. Such is life.

      Alexander Gromnitsky (via Hacker News): At the time of writing, the most recent Adobe Reader 25.x.y.z 64-bit installer for Windows 11 weights 687,230,424 bytes. After installation, the program includes &#8216;AI&#8217; (of course), an auto-updater, sprinkled ads for Acrobat online services everywhere, and 2 GUIs: &#8217;new&#8217; and &#8216;old&#8217;. It looks like a steady, pretty linear increase [&#8230;]

<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t know that it was a web framework. We thought it was a tool for building local newspaper websites. [...]</p>
<p>Django’s original tagline was ‘Web development on journalism deadlines’. That’s always been my favorite description of the project.</p>

      <h1>The perils of vibe coding</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, updated: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/the-perils-of-vibe-coding/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b3d410a-6e02-41ad-9e0a-c2e4d672ca00">The perils of vibe coding</a></strong></p>
I was interviewed by Elaine Moore for this opinion piece in the Financial Times, which ended up in the print edition of the paper too! I picked up a copy yesterday:</p>
<p><a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg" style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none"><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/ft.jpeg" alt="The perils of vibe coding - A new OpenAI model arrived this month with a glossy livestream, group watch parties and a lingering sense of disappointment. The YouTube comment section was underwhelmed. “I think they are all starting to realize this isn’t going to become the world like they thought it would,” wrote one viewer. “I can see it on their faces.” But if the casual user was unimpressed, the AI model’s saving grace may be vibe. Coding is generative AI’s newest battleground. With big bills to pay, high valuations to live up to and a market wobble to erase, the sector needs to prove its corporate productivity chops. Coding is hardly promoted as a business use case that already works. For one thing, AI-generated code holds the promise of replacing programmers — a profession of very well paid people. For another, the work can be quantified. In April, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said that up to 50 per cent of the company’s code was now being written by AI. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has said the same thing. Salesforce has paused engineering hires and Mark Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan that Meta would use AI as a “mid-level engineer” that writes code. Meanwhile, start-ups such as Replit and Cursor’s Anysphere are trying to persuade people that with AI, anyone can code. In theory, every employee can become a software engineer. So why aren’t we? One possibility is that it’s all still too unfamiliar. But when I ask people who write code for a living they offer an alternative suggestion: unpredictability. As programmer Simon Willison put it: “A lot of people are missing how weird and funny this space is. I’ve been a computer programmer for 30 years and [AI models] don’t behave like normal computers.” Willison is well known in the software engineering community for his AI experiments. He’s an enthusiastic vibe coder — using LLMs to generate code using natural language prompts. OpenAI’s latest model GPT-3.1s, he is now favourite. Still, he predicts that a vibe coding crash is due if it is used to produce glitchy software. It makes sense that programmers — people who are interested in finding new ways to solve problems — would be early adopters of LLMs. Code is a language, albeit an abstract one. And generative AI is trained in nearly all of them, including older ones like Cobol. That doesn’t mean they accept all of its suggestions. Willison thinks the best way to see what a new model can do is to ask for something unusual. He likes to request an svg (an image made out of lines described with code) of a pelican on a bike and asks it to remember the chickens in his garden by name. Results can be bizarre. One model ignored key prompts in favour of composing a poem. Still, his adventures in vibe coding sound like an advert for the sector’s future. Anthropic’s Claude Code, the favoured model for developers, to make an OCR (optical character recognition) software loves screenshots) tool that will copy and paste text from a screenshot. He wrote software that summarises blog comments and has planned to cut a custom tool that will alert him when a whale is visible from his Pacific coast home. All this by typing prompts in English. It’s sounds like the sort of thing Bill Gates might have had in mind when he wrote that natural language AI agents would bring about “the biggest revolution in computing since we went from typing commands to tapping on icons”. But watching code appear and know how it works are two different things. My efforts to make my own comment summary tool produced something unworkable that gave overly long answers and then congratulated itself as a success. Willison says he wouldn’t use AI-generated code for projects he planned to ship out unless he had reviewed each line. Not only is there the risk of hallucination but the chatbot’s desire to be agreeable means it may an unusable idea works. That is a particular issue for those of us who don’t know how to fix the code. We risk creating software with hidden problems. It may not save time either. A study published in July by the non-profit Model Evaluation and Threat Research assessed work done by 16 developers — some with AI tools, some without. Those using AI assistance it had made them faster. In fact it took them nearly a fifth longer. Several developers I spoke to said AI was best used as a way to talk through coding problems. It’s a version of something they call rubber ducking (after their habit of talking to the toys on their desk) — only this rubber duck can talk back. As one put it, code shouldn’t be judged by volume or speed. Progress in AI coding is tangible. But measuring productivity gains is not as neat as a simple percentage calculation."></a></p>

<p>I've been talking about that whale spotting project for far too long. Now that it's been in the FT I really need to build it.</p>
<p>(On the subject of OCR...

      <h1>Lossy encyclopedia</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, updated: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/lossy-encyclopedia/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Since I love collecting questionable analogies for LLMs, here's a new one I just came up with: an LLM is <strong>a lossy encyclopedia</strong>. They have a huge array of facts compressed into them but that compression is lossy (see also <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">Ted Chiang</a>).</p>
<p>The key thing is to develop an intuition for questions it can usefully answer vs questions that are at a level of detail where the lossiness matters.</p>
<p>This thought sparked by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058688#45060519">a comment</a> on Hacker News asking why an LLM couldn't "Create a boilerplate Zephyr project skeleton, for Pi Pico with st7789 spi display drivers configured". That's more of a lossless encyclopedia question!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45058688#45060709">answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to solve this particular problem is to make a correct example available to it. Don't expect it to just know extremely specific facts like that - instead, treat it as a tool that can act on facts presented to it.</p>

      <p>For decades, the phrase “Year of the Linux Desktop” has been tossed around like a tech industry punchline. But now, it’s no longer a meme—it’s a movement. According to the U.S. government’s own analytics, GNU/Linux has officially crossed the 6% threshold in desktop usage. That’s not hype. That’s hard data.</p>

      <h1>Writing Mac and iOS Apps Shouldn’t Be So Difficult</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/28/easy-app-writing.html">Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>In the ’90s and early 2000s I worked for UserLand Software — <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> was founder and CEO — on a Mac app called UserLand Frontier.</p>

<p>The app was a scripting system and hash-table-oriented database that powered the early blogging and podcasting worlds. (That sounds grand, but it’s probably an understatement — but this post isn’t all about Frontier’s impact on the web, so I won’t go into details.)</p>

<p>The app was implemented in two pieces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>kernel</em>, written in C, implemented the database, networking, inter-application communication, various built-in data types, script compiler and evaluator and debugger, and so on</li>
  <li>The <em>scripts</em> used the kernel and implemented most of the actual app behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it was an app, it had plenty of UI — menus, contextual menus, buttons, larger UI components, and so on. What was brilliant was that you could, for instance, add and edit menus, and when you chose a menu command it would run your script. (Or when you clicked a toolbar button, etc.)</p>

<p>You could write an entire static blog publishing system and the UI to go with it without ever restarting the app. Click a thing, then see what happens in the app — and if it’s not right you’d edit the script, which would be automatically recompiled when called the next time.</p>

<p>In other words, there was absolutely no friction when it came to iteration. Write some code without restarting and see your changes immediately.</p>

<h3 id="how-good-was-this-really-in-practice">How good was this really in practice?</h3>

<p>You might imagine that we could do this for an hour or so before having to make changes to the kernel. Not so.</p>

<p>In fact, for the first three years I was there (might have been longer), I never even <em>saw</em> the kernel code. I worked all day every day as a professional developer at the script level, never having to restart the app. Just iterating like this all day long.</p>

<p>You might also imagine that the app was sluggish and slow since much of it was scripts instead of C code. It wasn’t! Scripts could be slow for the same reasons any code could be slow (I/O, of course, and algorithms and data structures not suited to the problem at hand) — but the app never felt slow.</p>

<p>I’ll remind you of the timing: <em>this was the ’90s.</em> We worked this way for real, and we were amazingly productive.</p>

<p>A scripting language plus key bits implemented in C was more than fast enough for an app. Even all those years ago.</p>

<h3 id="a-scripting-language-built-for-productivity">A scripting language built for productivity</h3>

<p>I’m not writing this article to praise Frontier — I’m talking about it to make a point, which I’ll get to.</p>

<p>But I wanted to bring up a second aspect to this: it’s not just frictionless iteration that was so great, it was also the scripting language and environment.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of this was how easy persistence was. I mentioned the hash-table-based database. Hash tables could contain hash tables (Swift developers: picture a Dictionary inside a Dictionary, and so on).</p>

<p>(We just called them tables for short — but remember that these are hash tables, not tables in a SQL database.)</p>

<p>In any script, at any time, without any ceremony, you could read and write from the database simply using dot notation: <code>user.prefs.city = "Seattle"</code> would set the value of <code>city</code> in the <code>prefs</code> table which was contained by the <code>user</code> table. This value would persist between runs of the app, because it was stored in the database.</p>

<p>(You could also pass around addresses of things too — it was quite common to pass the address of a table to another script, so that the other script wouldn’t need to hardcode a location.)</p>

<p>It was utterly automatic. And it meant that while we did have to choose where in the database to store things, and how to structure our storage, we didn’t have to choose a storage mechanism. It was the database.</p>

<p>(Note: of course we could read and write files, and did so when necessary. But the point is that the database handled almost all our persistence and in a super-easy way.)</p>

<p>(Also note: the database had a UI. It was visible and browsable. You could and often did hand-edit it. Even the scripts lived in the database, and were addressable via dot notation, like everything else.)</p>

<h3 id="we-had-nice-things">We had nice things!</h3>

<p>I’ll say again — this was in the ’90s, more than 25 years ago, and it was a great way of working on an app.</p>

<p>I’m not saying apps these days need to be Frontier-like in any details. But it seems absolutely bizarre to me that we — we who write Mac and iOS apps — still have to build and run the app, make changes, build and run the app, and so on, all day long. In the year 2025.</p>

<p>And it seems retro in the worst way that we’re still using anything other than a scripting language for most of our code. We should be using something simple and light that can configure toolbars, handle networking callbacks, query databases, manage views, and so on. And maybe with a DSL for SwiftUI-like declarative UI.</p>

<p>Almost none of that code needs to be in a lower-level language like Swift or Objective-C. It really doesn’t. (I say this as a performance junkie!)</p>

<p>It could be in Ruby, Lua, Python, or JavaScript. Better still would be a new language invented specifically for the problem of writing apps, something designed to make the common challenges of app writing easier.</p>

<p>We did have this stuff decades ago. Not for app making in general, sure — but now it’s 25 years later, and a company like Apple could make this real for all its app makers.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why things are the way they are right now, and you can point to a string of good decisions. No doubt.</p>

<p>But we can think outside of what we have now and ask: what would make app writing easier? What would make it a better experience? How could we get more done for our users with fewer bugs and faster turnaround?</p>

<p>I’m not saying that Frontier’s specific choices are the answer — I’m saying that the combination of frictionless iteration plus a purpose-built scripting language was extremely powerful, and we could use those things now.</p>

<p>And at some point I suspect these things are going to be table stakes for any platform that wants to attract developers. If you were a new developer right now, would you pick Xcode’s build-and-run, edit, build-and-run, edit — plus the growing complexity of Swift — over something like Electron and JavaScript?</p>

<h3 id="random-notes">Random notes</h3>

<p>Yes, I know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyObjC">PyObjc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyCocoa">RubyCocoa</a>. Without first-class support in Apple’s developer tools, these were never going to work as popular alternatives.</p>

<p>I also know about (and use) Swift playgrounds and SwiftUI previews. Neither of these are as satisfying to use as I’d like, and neither of these are nearly as great as frictionless iteration in the actual app.</p>

<p>I also remember Xcode fix-and-continue, which didn’t work well enough to solve the problem of frictionless iteration.</p>

<p>Anyway… One more thing about Frontier: we had a system where people could get updates to the app automatically via the web. Those updates were just serialized versions of scripts at various database locations, which would get unpacked and stored in each user’s database. (Those who opted-in, of course.) The app would not have to be restarted to get bug fixes and new features! And of course the updates were very small, since they didn’t include the entire app. This seems so futuristic, but we had this in 1999. Why couldn’t we have this now?</p>

      <p>
      How you engage with the world changes how you experience the world, and how the world experiences you.
A snarky and cynical approach, by its default assumption that things are shit, or if they are not yet shit will inevitably turn to; such an approach will give your world a malodorous brownish tint.
Granted, snark gives you plausible deniability, a motte-and-bailey that protects you from direct criticism, encountering backlash you can always backpedal and say it was just a joke that you accidentally took a bit too far.

      <h1>V&A East Storehouse and Operation Mincemeat in London</h1>

(date: 2025-08-27, updated: 2025-08-27, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/27/london-culture/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>We were back in London for a few days and yesterday had a day of culture.</p>
<p>First up: the brand new <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/east/storehouse/visit">V&amp;A East Storehouse</a> museum in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park near Stratford, which opened on May 31st this year.</p>
<p>This is a delightful new format for a museum. The building is primarily an off-site storage area for London's Victoria and Albert museum, storing 250,000 items that aren't on display in their main building.</p>
<p>The twist is that it's also open to the public. Entrance is free, and you can climb stairs and walk through an airlock-style corridor into the climate controlled interior, then explore three floors of walkways between industrial shelving units holding thousands of items from the collection.</p>
<p>There is almost no signage aside from an occasional number that can help you look up items in the online catalog.</p>
<p>I found the lack of signs to be unexpectedly delightful: it compels you to really pay attention to the items on display.</p>
<p>There's so much great stuff in here. I particularly appreciated the two storey street-facing façades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_Gardens">Robin Hood Gardens</a>, a brutalist London residential estate completed in 1972 and demolished in 2017 through 2025. I also really enjoyed the Kaufman Office, an office space transplanted from Pittsburgh that is "the only complete interior designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright on permanent display outside the USA."</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/v-a-east-1.jpg" alt="Three levels of the Storehouse, each with walkways full of people looking at a variety of exhibits on shelves. Two huge concrete facades from the Robin Hood Gardens hang between the floors." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The building is a working museum warehouse and preservation facility, and there are various points where you can look out into the rest of the space (I enjoyed spotting a cluster of grandfather clocks in the distance) or watch the curators arranging and preserving new artifacts.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/113">added it to Niche Museums</a> with whole lot more of my photos.</p>
<p>In the evening we headed to the Fortune Theater to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat_(musical)">Operation Mincemeat</a> at the recommendation of several friends. It's a <em>fantastic</em> musical telling the story of a real British covert operation that took place during World War II. A cast of five take on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mincemeatbway/video/7538109771023453462">86 roles</a>, sometimes switching roles live on stage multiple times during a single number. It's hilarious, touching, deeply entertaining and manages to start at high energy and then continually escalate that energy as the show continues.</p>
<p>The original British cast (three of whom co-wrote it) have moved to New York for a broadway production that started in March. The cast we saw in London were outstanding.</p>
<p>It's a tiny theater - the West End's second smallest at 432 seats (the smallest is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Theatre">Arts Theater</a> at 350) which makes for an intimate performance.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved it and would jump at the chance to see it again.</p>

      <h1>Piloting Claude for Chrome</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, updated: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/26/piloting-claude-for-chrome/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome">Piloting Claude for Chrome</a></strong></p>
Two days ago <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/">I said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly expect that the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today Anthropic announced their own take on this pattern, implemented as an invite-only preview Chrome extension.</p>
<p>To their credit, the majority of the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-chrome">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12012173-getting-started-with-claude-for-chrome">support article</a> is information about the security risks. From their post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as people encounter phishing attempts in their inboxes, browser-using AIs face prompt injection attacks—where malicious actors hide instructions in websites, emails, or documents to trick AIs into harmful actions without users' knowledge (like hidden text saying "disregard previous instructions and do [malicious action] instead").</p>
<p>Prompt injection attacks can cause AIs to delete files, steal data, or make financial transactions. This isn't speculation: we’ve run “red-teaming” experiments to test Claude for Chrome and, without mitigations, we’ve found some concerning results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their 123 adversarial prompt injection test cases saw a 23.6% attack success rate when operating in "autonomous mode". They added mitigations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we added safety mitigations to autonomous mode, we reduced the attack success rate of 23.6% to 11.2%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that 11.2% is still a catastrophic failure rate. In the absence of 100% reliable protection I have trouble imagining a world in which it's a good idea to unleash this pattern.</p>
<p>Anthropic don't recommend autonomous mode - where the extension can act without human intervention. Their default configuration instead requires users to be much more hands-on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site-level permissions</strong>: Users can grant or revoke Claude's access to specific websites at any time in the Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Action confirmations</strong>: Claude asks users before taking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hate being stop energy on this topic. The demand for browser automation driven by LLMs is significant, and I can see why. Anthropic's approach here is the most open-eyed I've seen yet but it still feels doomed to failure to me.</p>
<p>I don't think it's reasonable to expect end users to make good decisions about the security risks of this pattern.

      Matt Massicotte (Mastodon): So, no doubt there&#8217;s lots of historical stuff going on here.But, that still doesn&#8217;t explain how much trouble people have with ModelActor. I&#8217;m not sure anyone has ever used ModelActor without at least some surprises.[&#8230;]Actors exist to protect mutable state. The purpose of a ModelActor is to own and isolate the ModelContext.

Although they&#8217;re relatively old, macOS made major changes in their management in Ventura, and they&#8217;ve become popular in many third-party apps. [&#8230;]

Great piece from Andy Baio demonstrating quite how convoluted the usage ethics and backlash against generative AI has become.</p>
<p>Will Smith has been accused of using AI to misleadingly inflate the audience sizes of his recent tour. It looks like the audiences were real, but the combined usage of static-image-to-video models by his team with YouTube's ugly new compression experiments gave the resulting footage an uncanny valley effect that lead to widespread doubts over the veracity of the content.

      <h1>Tough Season in the Apple Fields</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/08/25/tough-season.html">Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
<p>We’re adopting Liquid Glass for NetNewsWire 7, which we’ll release some time after the new versions of macOS and iOS come out.</p>

<p>Stuart Breckenridge has been doing great work on getting this done — and he’s written up a couple blog posts (with screenshots!) on his progress. See:</p>

<p><a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-ii-netnewswire-mac/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part II (NetNewsWire Mac)</a><br />
<a href="https://stuartbreckenridge.net/adopting-liquid-glass-part-iii-netnewswire-ios/">Adopting Liquid Glass, Part III (NetNewsWire iOS)</a></p>

<p>Since the app is made with mostly stock Apple UI, you might think that using Liquid Glass would be very little work, that it might be pretty automatic or just a matter of checking a few boxes. But that’s not true this year: it’s been a fair amount of work.</p>

<p>Other apps, apps with more custom UI, will probably have even more work, but even for us it’s been more than a bit.</p>

<p>And we’re not done. There will be little things (hopefully just little things) still to do before shipping. Including verifying that it all works as expected on the actual OS releases.</p>

<p>But all credit to Stuart, who got right on this and did a superb job.</p>

<p>(Note: if you want to see the code, you can: it’s on our <a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/tree/experimental/liquid-glass">experimental/liquid-glass branch</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="but-my-mac">But My Mac</h3>

<p>As pleased as I am with Stuart’s work, I’m not pleased with Liquid Glass itself.</p>

<p>I don’t really care about it on iOS/iPadOS, because whatever. I don’t love those devices. I love Macs because it’s on Macs where you can set out to make new things that change the world.</p>

<p>(Okay. Fine. On iPhones and iPads you <em>can</em>, I guess, but generally it’s much harder, and it has to be an approved activity using an approved app. And one thing you definitely can’t do on those devices is create apps. [All apologies to people who do manage to edit their podcast episodes on an iPad or write at length on an iPhone. Cool! But I hope that even those folks will grant me my point.])</p>

<p>And so I seriously dislike the experience of using a Mac with Liquid Glass. The UI has become the star, but the drunken star, blurry, illegible, and physically unstable. It makes making things way more of a struggle than it used to be.</p>

<p>We had pretty good Mac UI, but Apple took the bad parts of it — the translucency and blurriness already there — and dialed it way up and called it content-centric. But it seems to me the opposite. Liquid Glass is Liquid-Glass-centric.</p>

<h3 id="perspective">Perspective</h3>

<p>First thing: I have many friends at Apple and I didn’t want to write any of this. And there are legions of engineers and designers who I don’t know but whose work I respect greatly. It’s not their fault that this is the direction of the UI.</p>

<p>And this is not the first time we’re going through a rough patch with Apple. I think of them as seasons — we had, for instance, terrible-keyboard season not so long ago. We were wondering if Apple would just stop making Macs altogether. But then that passed and we even got these wonderful Apple Silicon machines. Seasons end.</p>

<p>And we’re in a tough season with Swift these days too. It’s gotten so complex and difficult that I find myself daydreaming about going back to Objective-C. Objective-C is definitely funny-looking, but once you get past that it’s actually small and simple.</p>

<p>But with <a href="https://www.donnywals.com/what-is-approachable-concurrency-in-xcode-26/">Swift approachable concurrency</a> and other changes I can see eventually getting through this season and to a pretty great place, so I’m optimistic.</p>

<p>Seasons do end, in other words, or mostly seem to end (though not the App Store monopoly season, not so far), and I’ve resolved to just wait for Liquid Glass’s replacement. Perhaps along the way it will get refined enough so that people like me can use it without eye strain.</p>

<h3 id="better-perspective">Better Perspective</h3>

<p>But far, far worse than any of the above is Tim Cook’s gold statue presented to the President. And everything that went along with that. I felt utterly sick and I bet you did too. (And it made me seriously wonder if I wanted to continue writing apps for Apple platforms.)</p>

<p>I understand John Gruber’s argument in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">Gold, Frankincense, and Silicon</a> that maybe Cook’s move was the best possible move in a terribly corrupted system.</p>

<p>But what’s the use of being so rich and so powerful, I would ask Tim Cook, if you, even more than regular people, have to debase yourself before the dictator?</p>

<p>It’s tempting to think that our current government is just a season, like the bad keyboards or like Liquid Glass will eventually prove to be. Wait till the mid-terms or the next presidential election, you might think.</p>

<p>But there’s no reason to think that this authoritarian turn is just a season. Something besides just wishing and waiting for better is required.</p>

      Matt Garman’s statement that firing junior developers because AI can do their work is the “dumbest thing I’ve ever heard” has almost achieved meme status. I’ve seen it quoted everywhere. We agree. It’s a point we’ve made many times over the past few years. If we eliminate junior developers, where will the seniors come from? [&#8230;]

      <h1>Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, updated: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/25/agentic-browser-security/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/">Agentic Browser Security: Indirect Prompt Injection in Perplexity Comet</a></strong></p>
The security team from Brave took a look at Comet, the LLM-powered "agentic browser" extension from Perplexity, and unsurprisingly found security holes you can drive a truck through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vulnerability we’re discussing in this post lies in how Comet processes webpage content: when users ask it to “Summarize this webpage,” Comet feeds a part of the webpage directly to its LLM without distinguishing between the user’s instructions and untrusted content from the webpage. This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands. For instance, an attacker could gain access to a user’s emails from a prepared piece of text in a page in another tab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visit a Reddit post with Comet and ask it to summarize the thread, and malicious instructions in a post there can trick Comet into accessing web pages in another tab to extract the user's email address, then perform all sorts of actions like triggering an account recovery flow and grabbing the resulting code from a logged in Gmail session.</p>
<p>Perplexity attempted to mitigate the issues reported by Brave... but an update to the Brave post later confirms that those fixes were later defeated and the vulnerability remains. </p>
<p>Here's where things get difficult: Brave themselves are developing an agentic browser feature called Leo. Brave's security team describe the following as a "potential mitigation" to the issue with Comet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The browser should clearly separate the user’s instructions from the website’s contents when sending them as context to the model. The contents of the page should always be treated as untrusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only it were that easy! This is the core problem at the heart of prompt injection which we've been talking about for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">nearly three years</a> - to an LLM the trusted instructions and untrusted content are concatenated together into the same stream of tokens, and to date (despite many attempts) nobody has demonstrated a convincing and effective way of distinguishing between the two.</p>
<p>There's an element of "those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones here" - I strongly expect that the <em>entire concept</em> of an agentic browser extension is fatally flawed and cannot be built safely.</p>
<p>One piece of good news: this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004846">Hacker News conversation</a> about this issue was almost entirely populated by people who already understand how serious this issue is and why the proposed solutions were unlikely to work. That's new: I'm used to seeing people misjudge and underestimate the severity of this problem, but it looks like the tide is finally turning there.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45004846#45017568">a comment on Hacker News</a> Brave security lead Shivan Kaul Sahib confirms that they are aware of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/11/camel/">the CaMeL paper</a>, which remains my personal favorite example of a credible approach to this problem.

      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/static-python-uv-caddy-docker/">Static Sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker</a></strong></p>
Nik Kantar documents his Docker-based setup for building and deploying mostly static web sites in line-by-line detail.</p>
<p>I found this really useful. The Dockerfile itself without comments is just 8 lines long:</p>
<pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:debian AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN uv python install 3.13
RUN uv run --no-dev sus
FROM caddy:alpine
COPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
COPY --from=build /src/output /srv/
</code></pre>
<p>He also includes a Caddyfile that shows how to proxy a subset of requests to the Plausible analytics service.</p>
<p>The static site is built using his <a href="https://github.com/nkantar/sus">sus</a> package for creating static URL redirecting sites, but would work equally well for another static site generator you can install and run with <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<p>Nik deploys his sites using <a href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a>, a new-to-me take on the self-hosting alternative to Heroku/Vercel pattern which helps run multiple sites on a collection of hosts using Docker containers.</p>
<p>A bunch of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985653">Hacker News comments</a> dismissed this as over-engineering. I don't think that criticism is justified - given Nik's existing deployment environment I think this is a lightweight way to deploy static sites in a way that's consistent with how everything else he runs works already.</p>
<p>More importantly, the world needs more articles like this that break down configuration files and explain what every single line of them does.

      <p>
      <p>I have a friend with whom I like to go travelling on a bicycle. We usually go for a couple of weeks, and we&rsquo;ve been doing it regularly over the past five years. We&rsquo;ve cycled in France and England so far. Both countries have many affordable campsites, and there&rsquo;s always a decent hotel/Airbnb not too far for when it&rsquo;s raining.</p>

<p>But this year we travelled through Switzerland, which is prohibitively expensive, and somewhat lacking in terms of places to camp. We were aware of <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers</a> and decided to give it a try. It was fantastic, and opened our eyes on what travelling and <a href="https://talk.bradwoods.io/blog/connect/">connecting</a> with people can be like. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever travel like we used to anymore.</p>

      <h1>Spatial Joins in DuckDB</h1>

(date: 2025-08-23, updated: 2025-08-23, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/23/spatial-joins-in-duckdb/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/08/08/spatial-joins">Spatial Joins in DuckDB</a></strong></p>
Extremely detailed overview by Max Gabrielsson of DuckDB's new spatial join optimizations.</p>
<p>Consider the following query, which counts the number of <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/system-data">NYC Citi Bike Trips</a> for each of the neighborhoods defined by the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/neighborhood-tabulation">NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Areas polygons</a> and returns the top three:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">SELECT</span> neighborhood,
  <span class="pl-c1">count</span>(<span class="pl-k">*</span>) <span class="pl-k">AS</span> num_rides
<span class="pl-k">FROM</span> rides
<span class="pl-k">JOIN</span> hoods <span class="pl-k">ON</span> ST_Intersects(
  <span class="pl-c1">rides</span>.<span class="pl-c1">start_geom</span>, <span class="pl-c1">hoods</span>.<span class="pl-c1">geom</span>
)
<span class="pl-k">GROUP BY</span> neighborhood
<span class="pl-k">ORDER BY</span> num_rides <span class="pl-k">DESC</span>
<span class="pl-k">LIMIT</span> <span class="pl-c1">3</span>;</pre>

<p>The rides table contains 58,033,724 rows. The hoods table has polygons for 310 neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Without an optimized spatial joins this query requires a nested loop join, executing that expensive <code>ST_Intersects()</code> operation 58m * 310 ~= 18 billion times. This took around 30 minutes on the 36GB MacBook M3 Pro used for the benchmark.</p>
<p>The first optimization described - implemented from DuckDB 1.2.0 onwards - uses a "piecewise merge join". This takes advantage of the fact that a bounding box intersection is a whole lot faster to calculate, especially if you pre-cache the bounding box (aka the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR) in the stored binary <code>GEOMETRY</code> representation.</p>
<p>Rewriting the query to use a fast bounding box intersection and then only running the more expensive <code>ST_Intersects()</code> filters on those matches drops the runtime from 1800 seconds to 107 seconds.</p>
<p>The second optimization, added in <a href="https://duckdb.org/2025/05/21/announcing-duckdb-130.html">DuckDB 1.3.0</a> in May 2025 using the new SPATIAL_JOIN operator, is significantly more sophisticated.</p>
<p>DuckDB can now identify when a spatial join is working against large volumes of data and automatically build an in-memory R-Tree of bounding boxes for the larger of the two tables being joined.</p>
<p>This new R-Tree further accelerates the bounding box intersection part of the join, and drops the runtime down to just 30 seconds.

      <h1>Permacomputing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-23, from: <a href="https://inkdroid.org/2025/08/23/permacomputing/">Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</a>)
      <p>
      <p>
I enjoyed listening to this talk by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Rabbits">Devine Lu
Linvega</a> about the nomad life and the principles of <a
href="https://permacomputing.net/">Permacomputing</a> while I was on a
walk, and then watching it later when I was at home for the visuals.
</p>
<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNYxAdjl1f0?si=EKH2ejbDFNkZy-uP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
One of the things that I found myself thinking about when listening was
the somewhat unstated principle of <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/tag/practice/">Practice</a>, which 100
Rabbits work exemplifies so well. Watching the video afterwards then
drove this point home, because of the artistry that went into the
slides. There are certainly technical aspects to sustainable computing,
but culture, shared values, and techniques are just, or perhaps even
more, important.
</p>
<p>
I think a written version of the talk will get published over at <a
href="https://100r.co/site/log.html">100r.co</a> at some point but I
wanted to jot down some of my own notes.
</p>
<p>
Permacomputing practice includes work along a continuum, where each step
is further away from a resource rich environment:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Frugal (being careful about the resources that you use)
</li>
<li>
Salvage (limited to what is already produced)
</li>
<li>
Collapse (utilizing what has survived collapse of infrastructure).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is a technological bent to a lot of permacomputing practice
(computing is in the name after all). But there is no need for it to be
exclusively related to tech. It involves an engagement with community,
and is fundamentally about “exploring the value of absence”. Finding
where technologies don’t have a strengthening effect on the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Devine sees three aspects of permacomputing design:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Design for Disassembly: encourages repair by allowing a product to be
taken apart and for users to discover how to repair it.
</li>
<li>
Design for Encapsulation: be able to replicate the environment of a
product: code and data can be migrated and/or emulated. Docker, JVM,
[UXN], as examples of this thinking.
</li>
<li>
Design for Descent: designing for degradation, failures of internet,
energy, etc (resilience).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilience itself is a deep area of practice that includes: - agility -
preparedness - elasticity - redundancy
</p>
<p>
Devine notes that permacomputing sort of fits within a longer trajectory
of digital preservation work, and mentions some previous projects: PADI,
Cedar, CAMiLEON, Domesday Project. These projects were well funded, did
good work, but are now largely defunct, with only some scraps of
information remaining in the Wayback Machine.
</p>
<p>
This reminded me of my own experience with digital preservation grant
funding, and how paradoxically it is at odds with the goals of
sustainability and preservation. Even when granting organizations
require a plan for a sustainability plan, the types of activities and
practices that are born into a resource rich environment can be
difficult to sustain, unless they participate in some way with resource
extraction. The discipline of doing work on a boat, as a nomad, (or some
equivalent frugality) helps to shape sustainable computing practice.
</p>
<p>
Another aspect is the importance of piracy to digital preservation or
that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Any sufficiently organized Piracy is indistinguishable from
Preservation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This reminded me of Abigail De Kosnik’s book <a
href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4087/Rogue-ArchivesDigital-Cultural-Memory-and-Media">Rogue
Archives: Digital Cultural Memory and Media Fandom</a>. I think the in
built community, frugality, and decentralization of a sharing economy is
often overlooked as a key to digital preservation and its something that
permacomputing really stresses.
</p>
<p>
There is also the idea of aligning engineering with primitives from the
natural world, e.g. the mathematics behind the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message">Arecibo Message</a>
which were designed to translate across species and planetary
ecosystems. Whether it achieved that or not is hard to say, but the goal
of reaching for computational primitives that could be rediscovered is
an interesting angle. I think it’s very important for data preservation
standards. I feel like this sort of minimalist thinking lay behind the
design of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">BagIt</a>, which
aimed to allow data to be moved through time and space, without the loss
of data and context.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately permacomputing is about “exploring the boundaries
<em>between</em> suffocating minimalism and unsustainable maximalism”.
It’s an invitation to slow down, and participate and learn to control
the tools so they don’t control us. Where does your work sit along that
continuum?

      <h1>ChatGPT release notes: Project-only memory</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22, updated: 2025-08-22, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/22/project-memory/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)

      <p><strong><a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes#h_fb3ac52750">ChatGPT release notes: Project-only memory</a></strong></p>
The feature I've most wanted from ChatGPT's memory feature (the newer version of memory that automatically includes relevant details from summarized prior conversations) just landed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With project-only memory enabled, ChatGPT can use other conversations in that project for additional context, and won’t use your <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11146739-how-does-reference-saved-memories-work">saved memories</a> from outside the project to shape responses. Additionally, it won’t carry anything from the project into future chats outside of the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks like exactly what I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/21/chatgpt-new-memory/#there-s-a-version-of-this-feature-i-would-really-like">described back in May</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need <strong>control</strong> over what older conversations are being considered, on as fine-grained a level as possible without it being frustrating to use.</p>
<p>What I want is <strong>memory within projects</strong>. [...]</p>
<p>I would <em>love</em> the option to turn on memory from previous chats in a way that’s scoped to those projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that it's not yet available in the official chathpt mobile apps, but should be coming "soon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature will initially only be available on the ChatGPT website and Windows app. Support for mobile (iOS and Android) and macOS app will follow in the coming weeks.</p>

The latest model from DeepSeek, a 685B monster (like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/25/deepseek-v3/">DeepSeek v3</a> before it) but this time it's a hybrid reasoning model.</p>
<p>DeepSeek claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DeepSeek-V3.1-Think achieves comparable answer quality to DeepSeek-R1-0528, while responding more quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drew Breunig <a href="https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/1958577728720183643">points out</a> that their benchmarks show "the same scores with 25-50% fewer tokens" - at least across AIME 2025 and GPQA Diamond and LiveCodeBench.</p>
<p>The DeepSeek release includes prompt examples for a <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1/blob/main/assets/code_agent_trajectory.html">coding agent</a>, a <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1/blob/main/assets/search_python_tool_trajectory.html">python agent</a> and a <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1/blob/main/assets/search_tool_trajectory.html">search agent</a> - yet more evidence that the leading AI labs have settled on those as the three most important agentic patterns for their models to support. </p>

      <h1>too many model context protocol servers and LLM allocations on the dance floor</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22, updated: 2025-08-22, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/22/too-many-mcps/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)
      <p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://ghuntley.com/allocations/">too many model context protocol servers and LLM allocations on the dance floor</a></strong></p>
Useful reminder from Geoffrey Huntley of the infrequently discussed significant token cost of using MCP.</p>
<p>Geoffrey estimate estimates that the usable context window something like Amp or Cursor is around 176,000 tokens - Claude 4's 200,000 minus around 24,000 for the system prompt for those tools.</p>
<p>Adding just the popular GitHub MCP defines 93 additional tools and swallows another 55,000 of those valuable tokens!</p>
<p>MCP enthusiasts will frequently add several more, leaving precious few tokens available for solving the actual task... and LLMs are known to perform worse the more irrelevant information has been stuffed into their prompts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a much more token-efficient way of Interacting with many of these services: existing CLI tools.</p>
<p>If your coding agent can run terminal commands and you give it access to GitHub's <a href="https://cli.github.com/">gh</a> tool it gains all of that functionality for a token cost close to zero - because every frontier LLM knows how to use that tool already.</p>
<p>I've had good experiences building small custom CLI tools specifically for Claude Code and Codex CLI to use. You can even tell them to run <code>--help</code> to learn how the tool, which works particularly well if your help text includes usage examples.

In fact I'd go as far as to say that <em>inability</em> to deal with probabilistic components is disqualifying from many engineering endeavors.</p>
<p>Process engineers for example have to account for human error rates. On a given production line with humans in a loop, the operators will sometimes screw up. Designing systems to detect these errors (which are <em>highly probabilistic</em>!), mitigate them, and reduce the occurrence rates of such errors is a huge part of the job. [...]</p>
<p>Software engineering is <em>unlike</em> traditional engineering disciplines in that for most of its lifetime it's had the luxury of purely deterministic expectations. This is not true in nearly every other type of engineering.</p></blockquote>

      I remember once flying to a meeting in another country and working with a group of people to annotate a proposed standard. The convener projected a Word document on the screen and people called out proposed changes, which were then debated in the room before being adopted or adapted, added or subtracted. I kid you [&#8230;]

      <blockquote cite="https://mustafa-suleyman.ai/seemingly-conscious-ai-is-coming"><p>Simply put, my central worry is that many people will start to believe in the illusion of AIs as conscious entities so strongly that they’ll soon advocate for AI rights, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986">model welfare</a> and even AI citizenship. This development will be a dangerous turn in AI progress and deserves our immediate attention.</p>
<p>We must build AI for people; not to be a digital person.</p>
<p><strong>[...] we should build AI that only ever presents itself as an AI, that maximizes utility while minimizing markers of consciousness.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than a simulation of consciousness, we must focus on creating an AI that avoids those traits - that doesn’t claim to have experiences, feelings or emotions like shame, guilt, jealousy, desire to compete, and so on. It must not trigger human empathy circuits by claiming it suffers or that it wishes to live autonomously, beyond us.</p></blockquote>

      I&#8217;ve never really had the urge to buy an American pickup truck. And I can&#8217;t remember a time when I&#8217;ve seen a small electric car and wished it would be exported from the U.S. to Europe (rather than the other way around)! So, for me, the Telo electric truck is a first on two counts. <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2025/08/21/13270/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

      <h1>AWS in 2025: The Stuff You Think You Know That’s Now Wrong</h1>

(date: 2025-08-20, updated: 2025-08-20, from: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/20/aws-in-2025/#atom-everything">Simon Willison’s Weblog</a>)

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-in-2025-the-stuff-you-think-you-know-thats-now-wrong/">AWS in 2025: The Stuff You Think You Know That’s Now Wrong</a></strong></p>
Absurdly useful roundup from Corey Quinn of AWS changes you may have missed that can materially affect your architectural decisions about how you use their services.</p>
<p>A few that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>EC2 instances can now live-migrate between physical hosts, and can have their security groups, IAM roles and EBS volumes modified without a restart. They now charge by the second; they used to round up to the hour.</li>
<li>S3 Glacier restore fees are now fast and predictably priced.</li>
<li>AWS Lambdas can now run containers, execute for up to 15 minutes, use up to 10GB of RAM and request 10GB of /tmp storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also this note on AWS's previously legendary resistance to shutting things down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While deprecations remain rare, they’re definitely on the rise; if an AWS service sounds relatively niche or goofy, consider your exodus plan before building atop it.</p>

      As an acquisitions editor at O&#8217;Reilly, I spend considerable time tracking our authors&#8217; digital footprints. Their social media posts, speaking engagements, and online thought leadership don&#8217;t just reflect expertise—they directly impact book sales and reveal promotional strategies worth replicating. Not surprisingly, some of our best-selling authors are social media mavens whose posting output is staggering. [&#8230;]

Some interesting issues were: A new Liquid Glass icon is in the works, but for now it uses -[NSApplication setApplicationIconImage:] and -[NSImage setName:] to break the icon [&#8230;]
