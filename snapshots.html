<h2 id="gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-25, updated: 2025-06-25, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/">Gemini
CLI</a></strong>
</p>
First there was
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/24/claude-37-sonnet-and-claude-code/">Claude
Code</a> in February, then
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/16/">OpenAI Codex (CLI)</a>
in April, and now Gemini CLI in June. All three of the largest AI labs
now have their own version of what I am calling a “terminal agent” - a
CLI tool that can read and write files and execute commands on your
behalf in the terminal.
</p>
<p>
I’m honestly a little surprised at how significant this category has
become: I had assumed that terminal tools like this would always be
something of a niche interest, but given the number of people I’ve heard
from spending hundreds of dollars a month on Claude Code this niche is
clearly larger and more important than I had thought!
</p>
<p>
I had a few days of early access to the Gemini one. It’s very good - it
takes advantage of Gemini’s million token context and has good taste in
things like when to read a file and when to run a command.
</p>
<p>
Like OpenAI Codex and unlike Claude Code it’s open source (Apache 2) -
the full source code can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">google-gemini/gemini-cli</a>
on GitHub. The core system prompt
<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/0915bf7d677504c28b079693a0fe1c853adc456e/packages/core/src/core/prompts.ts#L40-L109">lives
in core/src/core/prompts.ts</a> - I’ve extracted that out as
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9e5f13665b3112cea00035df7da696c6">a
rendered Markdown Gist</a>.
</p>
<p>
As usual, the system prompt doubles as extremely accurate and concise
documentation of what the tool can do! Here’s what it has to say about
comments, for example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Comments:</strong> Add code comments sparingly. Focus on
<em>why</em> something is done, especially for complex logic, rather
than <em>what</em> is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary
for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are
seperate from the code you are changing. <em>NEVER</em> talk to the user
or describe your changes through comments.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
The list of preferred technologies is interesting too:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When key technologies aren’t specified prefer the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Websites (Frontend):</strong> React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with
Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Back-End APIs:</strong> Node.js with Express.js
(JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Full-stack:</strong> Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS
and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python
(Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with
Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.
</li>
<li>
<strong>CLIs:</strong> Python or Go.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile App:</strong> Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin
Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and
principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose
(Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for
native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.
</li>
<li>
<strong>3d Games:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.
</li>
<li>
<strong>2d Games:</strong> HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
As far as I can tell Gemini CLI only defines a small selection of tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>edit</code>: To modify files programmatically.
</li>
<li>
<code>glob</code>: To find files by pattern.
</li>
<li>
<code>grep</code>: To search for content within files.
</li>
<li>
<code>ls</code>: To list directory contents.
</li>
<li>
<code>shell</code>: To execute a command in the shell
</li>
<li>
<code>memoryTool</code>: To remember user-specific facts.
</li>
<li>
<code>read-file</code>: To read a single file
</li>
<li>
<code>write-file</code>: To write a single file
</li>
<li>
<code>read-many-files</code>: To read multiple files at once.
</li>
<li>
<code>web-fetch</code>: To get content from URLs.
</li>
<li>
<code>web-search</code>: To perform a web search (using
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/google-search">Grounding
with Google Search</a> via the Gemini API).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I found most of those by having Gemini CLI inspect its own code for me!
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/12c7b072e8e21ef1e040fb3b69c1da28">that
full transcript</a>, which used just over 300,000 tokens total.
</p>
<p>
How much does it cost? The announcement describes a generous free tier:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To use Gemini CLI free-of-charge, simply login with a personal Google
account to get a free Gemini Code Assist license. That free license gets
you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and its massive 1 million token context
window. To ensure you rarely, if ever, hit a limit during this preview,
we offer the industry’s largest allowance: 60 model requests per minute
and 1,000 requests per day at no charge.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not yet clear to me if your inputs can be used to improve Google’s
models if you are using the free tier - that’s been the situation with
free prompt inference they have offered in the past.
</p>
<p>
<p>You can also drop in your own paid API key, at which point your data
will not be used for model improvements and you’ll be billed based on
your token usage.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-24, updated: 2025-06-24, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692015/anthropic-wins-a-major-fair-use-victory-for-ai-but-its-still-in-trouble-for-stealing-books">Anthropic
wins a major fair use victory for AI — but it’s still in trouble for
stealing books</a></strong>
</p>
Major USA legal news for the AI industry today. Judge William Alsup
released a “summary judgement” (a legal decision that results in some
parts of a case skipping a trial) in a lawsuit between five authors and
Anthropic concerning the use of their books in training data.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25982181-authors-v-anthropic-ruling/">judgement
itself</a> is a very readable 32 page PDF, and contains all sorts of
interesting behind-the-scenes details about how Anthropic trained their
models.
</p>
<p>
The facts of the complaint go back to the very beginning of the company.
Anthropic was founded by a group of ex-OpenAI researchers in February
2021. According to the judgement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So, in January or February 2021, another Anthropic cofounder, Ben Mann,
downloaded Books3, an online library of 196,640 books that he knew had
been assembled from unauthorized copies of copyrighted books — that is,
pirated. Anthropic’s next pirated acquisitions involved downloading
distributed, reshared copies of other pirate libraries. In June 2021,
Mann downloaded in this way at least five million copies of books from
Library Genesis, or LibGen, which he knew had been pirated. And, in July
2022, Anthropic likewise downloaded at least two million copies of books
from the Pirate Library Mirror, or PiLiMi, which Anthropic knew had been
pirated.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Books3 was also listed as
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/27/wordcamp-llms/#how-they-are-trained">part
of the training data</a> for Meta’s first LLaMA model!
</p>
<p>
Anthropic apparently used these sources of data to help build an
internal “research library” of content that they then filtered and
annotated and used in training runs.
</p>
<p>
Books turned out to be a very valuable component of the “data mix” to
train strong models. By 2024 Anthropic had a new approach to collecting
them: purchase and scan millions of print books!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To find a new way to get books, in February 2024, Anthropic hired the
former head of partnerships for Google’s book-scanning project, Tom
Turvey. He was tasked with obtaining “all the books in the world” while
still avoiding as much “legal/practice/business slog” as possible (Opp.
Exhs. 21, 27). […] Turvey and his team emailed major book distributors
and retailers about bulk-purchasing their print copies for the AI firm’s
“research library” (Opp. Exh. 22 at 145; Opp. Exh. 31 at -035589).
Anthropic spent many millions of dollars to purchase millions of print
books, often in used condition. Then, its service providers stripped the
books from their bindings, cut their pages to size, and scanned the
books into digital form — discarding the paper originals. Each print
book resulted in a PDF copy containing images of the scanned pages with
machine-readable text (including front and back cover scans for
softcover books).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The summary judgement found that these scanned books <em>did</em> fall
under fair use, since they were transformative versions of the works and
were not shared outside of the company. The downloaded ebooks did
<em>not</em> count as fair use, and it looks like those will be the
subject of a forthcoming jury trial.
</p>
<p>
Here’s that section of the decision:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before buying books for its central library, Anthropic downloaded over
seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these
pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them
to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should
have paid for these pirated library copies (e.g, Tr. 24–25, 65; Opp. 7,
12–13). This order agrees.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The most important aspect of this case is the question of whether
training an LLM on unlicensed data counts as “fair use”. The judge found
that it did. The argument for why takes up several pages of the document
but this seems like a key point:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts. They may need to pay
for getting their hands on a text in the first instance. But to make
anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each time they read it,
each time they recall it from memory, each time they later draw upon it
when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable. For centuries,
we have read and re-read books. We have admired, memorized, and
internalized their sweeping themes, their substantive points, and their
stylistic solutions to recurring writing problems.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>The judge who signed this summary judgement is an interesting
character: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alsup">William
Haskell Alsup</a> (yes, his middle name really is Haskell) presided over
jury trials for Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc in 2012 and 2016
where he famously used his hobbyist BASIC programming experience to
challenge claims made by lawyers in the case.</p>

is Fly’s entry into the prompt-driven app development space</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, updated: 2025-06-23, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Here’s a fascinating new entrant into the AI-assisted-programming /
coding-agents space by <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, introduced
on their blog in
<a href="https://fly.io/blog/phoenix-new-the-remote-ai-runtime/">Phoenix.new
– The Remote AI Runtime for Phoenix</a>: describe an app in a prompt,
get a full Phoenix application, backed by SQLite and running on Fly’s
hosting platform. The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du7GmWGUM5Y">official
Phoenix.new YouTube launch video</a> is a good way to get a sense for
what this does.
</p>
<h4 id="background-on-phoenix-and-elixir-and-fly">
Background on Phoenix and Elixir and Fly
</h4>
<p>
First, some background.
<a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is an open
source web framework for Elixir, the Ruby-like language that compiles to
Erlang’s BEAM bytecode and runs on top of the highly concurrent Erlang
runtime. The signature feature of the framework is
<a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view/blob/main/README.md#feature-highlights">Phoenix
LiveView</a>, a toolkit for building realtime interfaces through
streaming diffs to server-side HTML over a WebSocket connection.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix was created by Chris McCord 11 years ago, and Chris joined Fly
nearly four years ago. <a href="http://phoenix.new/">Phoenix.new</a> is
his latest project.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix LiveView is a really great fit for Fly’s geographically
distributed application serving infrastructure. Fly co-founder Kurt
Mackey <a href="https://fly.io/blog/low-latency-liveview/">wrote about
that</a> in April 2021, before they had hired Chris, describing how
LiveView benefits from low latency by “moving app processes close to
users” - something Fly has been designed to help with from the start.
</p>
<p>
There’s one major challenge though: Elixir is still a niche programming
language, which means the number of people out there who are ready to
spin up a new Phoenix app has always been artificially limited.
</p>
<p>
Fly’s solution? Get LLMs to shave that learning curve down to <em>almost
nothing</em>.
</p>
<h4 id="prompt-driven-application-development-with-phoenix-new">
Prompt-driven application development with Phoenix.new
</h4>
<p>
Phoenix.new is a prompt-driven application development platform. You
describe what you want to build, then watch as an LLM-powered coding
agent writes, tests and iterates on code to help achieve that goal. It’s
in the same broad category as
<a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a>,
<a href="https://v0.dev/">v0.dev</a> and and
<a href="https://townie.val.run/">Val Town’s Townie</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important problems to solve with coding agents is to
give them a robust sandbox where they can run code without breaking
things outside of that space. Fly, at their heart, are a sandboxing
company - their <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines</a>
product makes it trivial to spin up a new sandboxed VM in just a few
seconds. I’m building <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette
Cloud</a> on Fly for exactly that reason.
</p>
<p>
I tried out Phoenix.new with the following starter prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>A notebook application. Notes are rich text, using a nice visual
markdown editors. The first line of a note becomes the title. Notes have
a URL that is a 6 character random text string - thise can be used to
link notes to each other by dropping in an @ sign and that text string.
A hash and then text becomes a tag, clicking a tag goes to a page with
that tag on. Notes are all in SQLite FTS so they can be searched with a
search tool.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Watching it work was <em>fascinating</em>. It provides a full IDE-style
environment in the browser, running a dedicated container and with a
forwarded port to allow you to interact with the running application
<em>while it is being built</em>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/phoenix-new.jpg" alt="Browser IDE interface showing a notebook app development project with a left sidebar containing a chat session that starts &quot;What would you like to build?&quot; with options like &quot;todo list&quot;, &quot;chat app&quot;, &quot;product landing page&quot;, then a main editor displaying plan.md file with detailed development steps including &quot;Generate a Phoenix LiveView project called 'notebook'&quot; and &quot;Start the server so you can view the app as we build it&quot;. The bottom has a terminal showing &quot;All dependencies are up to date&quot;, &quot;Generated notebook app&quot;, &quot;Done in 241ms&quot;." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
It spun up a <code>plan.md</code>, planned out the approach and started
working through the code. Most interestingly, it constantly tested the
application it was building using a testing tool that looked similar to
my own <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a>.
Here’s an example of the output from that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can see the issue! The page is still showing the “Welcome to your
Notebook” message instead of the form. Let me wait a moment for the
JavaScript to execute and then check if the form appeared.
</p>
<p>
<code>$ web http://localhost:4000 –js “setTimeout(() =&gt; {
document.querySelector(‘button[phx-click="start_creating"]’).click(); },
500); setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log(‘Form visible?’,
!!document.querySelector(‘textarea’)); console.log(‘Creating note
state:’, document.body.innerHTML.includes(‘Create New Note’)); },
2000);”</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m used to coding agents that write and execute their own tests, but
this is the most impressive example I’ve seen of a coding agent that
actively interacts with and tests the live application while it is
iterating on the code.
</p>
<p>
Most interestingly of all, since LiveView is a realtime framework, I
could interact directly with the application at the same time as the
machine was writing and testing it, seeing any changes it made instantly
in my browser!
</p>
<p>
How did it do? It got there in the end, but with hindsight my initial
prompt was a little too complex: I had to rescue it after it got stuck
in an error loop trying to implement SQLite full-text search. Just like
a project you build yourself it turns out to work much better if you
start with the simplest possible version of the application and then
iterate on it to add additional features.
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite details is how Git integration works. Phoenix.new
commits constantly as it works, and a menu option for “Clone X to your
local computer” then gives you a command that looks like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>git clone
“https://phoenix.new/git/WENQLj…big-random-string…VHFW/$RANDOM/notebook”</code>
</p>
<p>
Run that locally to get a full copy of the repo! I ran the following to
push it to a new repository in my GitHub account:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>git remote add github https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook.git
git push -u github main</pre>
</div>
<p>
You can see the code (and the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook/commits">commit
history</a>) in my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/phoenix-new-notebook">simonw/phoenix-new-notebook</a>
repo.
</p>
<h4 id="how-much-did-i-learn-">
How much did I learn?
</h4>
<p>
My initial experiments with Phoenix.new were very much
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe
coding</a> - I interacted with the resulting application but didn’t pay
a great deal of attention to the code that was being written, despite it
being presented to me in an IDE that made it very easy to review what
was going on.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I didn’t learn much about the low-level syntax details of
how Phoenix and Elixir work. I did however get a strong feel for the
<em>shape</em> of Elixir and Phoenix at a high level as the code danced
past my eye.
</p>
<p>
It turns out having an LLM write an application in front of you is a
great way to start building understanding of what a framework can do.
</p>
<p>
It’s almost like watching a YouTube livestream of an experienced
developer speed running building an application, except that app is
exactly what you asked them to build and you can interject and send them
in a new direction at any moment.
</p>
<h4 id="expanding-beyond-elixir-and-phoenix">
Expanding beyond Elixir and Phoenix
</h4>
<p>
Chris’s announcement included this note:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At this point you might be wondering – can I just ask it to build a
Rails app? Or an Expo React Native app? Or Svelte? Or Go?
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can.
</p>
<p>
Our system prompt is tuned for Phoenix today, but all languages you care
about are already installed. We’re still figuring out where to take
this, but adding new languages and frameworks definitely ranks highly in
my plans.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The browser-based IDE includes a terminal, and I checked and
<code>python3</code> and <code>python3 -m pip install datasette</code>
work there already.
</p>
<p>
If Fly do evolve this into a framework-agnostic tool for building web
apps they’ll probably need to rebrand it from Phoenix.new to something a
bit more generic!
</p>
<p>
Phoenix.new is currently priced as a $20/month subscription. Val Town
recently switched the pricing for their similar Townie assistant from a
subscription to to <a href="https://blog.val.town/townie-credits">pay
per use</a>, presumably because for many users this kind of tool is
something they would only use intermittently, although given the
capabilities of Phoenix.new it’s possible it could become a monthly
driver for people, especially as it expands out to cover more
frameworks.

Strategy, Michael Porter
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Creating-Shared-Michael-Porter/dp/1633699161">wrote</a>,
is choosing what <em>not</em> to do. Now, the problem with knowledge
work such as the one tech writers carry out is that it’s full of things
that <em>seem</em> to require equally important, time-consuming
decisions. While engaging in lengthy disquisitions might be alluring,
endlessly combing the Zen garden of theory doesn’t solve the basic
problem of the <a href="https://passo.uno/docs-hierarchy-of-needs/">docs
hierarchy of needs</a>, which is <em>writing the damn docs</em> and
making sure they’re accurate and useful.

<p>Structured Asset doesn’t make music nor aim to enrich our cultural

like Ed Sheeran, and turns a system meant to protect creativity into a
mere vehicle for chasing profit.</p>

Report: Purism is the Only Known U.S. Phone Manufacturer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Purism News and Events</p>
<p>
In a recent CNN report, skepticism surrounds the Trump Organization’s
claim that its new “T1” smartphone is “Made in the USA.” Experts,
including Todd Weaver, CEO of Purism, challenged the claim, citing
striking similarities between the T1 and a low-cost Chinese phone, the
Revvl 7 Pro 5G, made by Wingtech, a Chinese manufacturer.

So you can think really big thoughts and the leverage of having those

<a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1648413998025707520">this
tweet</a> two years ago where I said “90% of my skills just went to zero
dollars and 10% of my skills just went up 1000x”. And this is exactly
what I’m talking about - having a vision, being able to set milestones
towards that vision, keeping track of a design to maintain or control
the levels of complexity as you go forward. Those are hugely leveraged
skills now compared to knowing where to put the ampersands and the stars
and the brackets in Rust.
