<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama/releases/tag/0.9.0">llm-ollama
0.9.0</a></strong>
</p>
This release of the <code>llm-ollama</code> plugin adds support for
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/">schemas</a>,
thanks to a <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama/pull/36">PR
by Adam Compton</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ollama provides very robust support for this pattern thanks to their
<a href="https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs">structured
outputs</a> feature, which works across all of the models that they
support by intercepting the logic that outputs the next token and
restricting it to only tokens that would be valid in the context of the
provided schema.
</p>
<p>
With Ollama and <code>llm-ollama</code> installed you can run even run
structured schemas against vision prompts for local models. Here’s one
against Ollama’s
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2-vision">llama3.2-vision</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m llama3.2-vision:latest \
  'describe images' \
  --schema 'species,description,count int' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>
I got back this:
</p>
<pre><code>{
    "species": "Pelicans",
    "description": "The image features a striking brown pelican with its distinctive orange beak, characterized by its large size and impressive wingspan.",
    "count": 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>
<p>(Actually a bit disappointing, as there are
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg">two
pelicans</a> and their beaks are brown.)</p>

<h2 id="i-built-an-automaton-called-squadron">I built an automaton
called Squadron</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, updated: 2025-03-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
I believe that the price you have to pay for taking on a project is
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/#projects">writing
about it afterwards</a>. On that basis, I feel compelled to write up my
decidedly non-software project from this weekend: Squadron, an
automaton.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been obsessed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton">automata</a> for
decades, ever since I first encountered the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_Mechanical_Theatre">Cabaret
Mechanical Theater</a> in Covent Garden in London (there from 1984-2003
- today it’s a roaming collection). If you’re not familiar with them,
they are animated mechanical sculptures. I consider them to be the
highest form of art.
</p>
<p>
For my birthday this year Natalie signed me up for a two day, 16 hour
hour weekend class to make one at
<a href="https://www.thecrucible.org/">The Crucible</a> in Oakland. If
you live in the SF Bay Area and are not yet aware of the Crucible I’m
delighted to introduce you - it’s a phenomenal non-profit art school
with an enormous warehouse that teaches blacksmithing, glass blowing,
welding, ceramics, woodwork and dozens of other crafts. Here’s
<a href="https://www.thecrucible.org/course-search/">their course
catalog</a>. Go enrich your soul!
</p>
<p>
I took their class in “Mechanical Sculpture”, which turned out to be
<em>exactly</em> a class in how to make automata. I guess the term
“automota” isn’t widely enough known to use in the course description!
</p>
<p>
The class was small - two students and one instructor - which meant that
we got an extremely personalized experience.
</p>
<h4 id="what-i-built">
What I built
</h4>
<p>
On day one we worked together on a class project. I suggested a pelican,
and we built exactly that - a single glorious pelican that flapped its
wings and swooped from side to side.
</p>
<p>
Day two was when we got to build our own things. We’d already built a
pelican, but I wanted one of my own… so I figured the only thing better
than a pelican is a full squadron of them!
</p>
<p>
Hence, Squadron. Here’s a video of my finished piece in action:
</p>
<div style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.4em">
<pre><code>&lt;video 
    controls=&quot;controls&quot;
    preload=&quot;none&quot;
    aria-label=&quot;Three wooden pelicans gently and jerkly flap their wings, suspended on brass wires above a wooden contraption containing a motor, a drive shaft and two cams driving rods that move the bodies up and down.&quot;
    poster=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/squadron.jpg&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot;
    style=&quot;width: 100%; height: auto;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/squadron.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
I think it captures their pelican charisma pretty well!
</p>
<h4 id="how-i-built-it">
How I built it
</h4>
<p>
I was delighted to learn from the class that the tools needed to build
simple automata are actually quite accessible:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A power drill
</li>
<li>
A saw - we used a Japanese pull saw
</li>
<li>
Wood glue
</li>
<li>
Screws
</li>
<li>
Wood - we mainly worked with basswood, plus I used some poplar wood for
the wings
</li>
<li>
Brass wires and rods
</li>
<li>
Pliers for working with the wire
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most sophisticated tool we used was a reciprocating
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll_saw">scroll saw</a>, for
cutting shapes out of the wood. We also had access to a bench sander and
a drill press, but those really just sped up processes that can be
achieved using sand paper and a regular hand drill.
</p>
<p>
I’ve taken a lot of photos of pelicans over the years. I found this
side-on photograph that I liked of two pelicans in flight:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg" alt="Two glorious pelicans in flight, viewed sideways on" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
Then I used the iOS Photos app feature where you can extract an object
from a photo as a “sticker” and pasted the result into iOS Notes.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/notes-pelican.jpg" alt="Screenshot of iOS notes - just the first pelican is in the note, with a white background instead of the sky" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
I printed the image from there, which gave me a pelican shape on paper.
I cut out just the body and used it to trace the shape onto the wood,
then ran the wood through the scroll saw. I made three of these, not
paying too much attention to accuracy as it’s better for them to have
slight differences to each other.
</p>
<p>
For the wings I started with rectangles of poplar wood, cut using the
Japanese saw and attached to the pelican’s body using bent brass wire
through small drilled holes. I later sketched out a more interesting
wing shape on some foam board as a prototype (loosely inspired by photos
I had taken), then traced that shape onto the wood and shaped them with
the scroll saw and sander.
</p>
<p>
Most automata are driven using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_(mechanism)">cams</a>, and
that was the pattern we stuck to in our class as well. Cams are
incredibly simple: you have a rotating rod (here driven by a 12V 10RPM
motor) and you attach an offset disc to it. That disc can then drive all
manner of useful mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
For my pelicans the cams lift rods up and down via a “foot” that sits on
the cam. The feet turned out to be essential - we made one from copper
and another from wood. Without feet the mechanism was liable to jam.
</p>
<p>
I made both cams by tracing out shapes with a pencil and then cutting
the wood with the scroll saw, then using the drill press to add the hole
for the rod.
</p>
<p>
The front pelican’s body sits on a brass rod that lifts up and down,
with the wings fixed to wires.
</p>
<p>
The back two share a single wooden dowel, sitting on brass wires
attached to two small holes drilled into the end.
</p>
<p>
To attach the cams to the drive shaft I drilled a small hole through the
cam and the brass drive shaft, then hammered in a brass pin to hold the
cam in place. Without that there’s a risk of the cam slipping around the
driving rod rather than rotating firmly in place.
</p>
<p>
After adding the pelicans with their fixed wings I ran into a problem:
the tension from the wing wiring caused friction between the rod and the
base, resulting in the up-and-down motion getting stuck. We were running
low on time so our instructor stepped in to help rescue my project with
the additional brass tubes shown in the final piece.
</p>
<h4 id="what-i-learned">
What I learned
</h4>
<p>
The main thing I learned from the weekend is that automata building is a
much more accessible craft than I had initially expected. The tools and
techniques are surprisingly inexpensive, and a weekend (really a single
day for my solo project) was enough time to build something that I’m
really happy with.
</p>
<p>
The hardest part turns out to be the fiddling at the very end to get all
of the motions just right. I’m still iterating on this now (hence the
elastic hair tie and visible pieces of tape) - it’s difficult to find
the right balance between position, motion and composition. I guess I
need to get comfortable with the idea that art is
<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/03/01/abandon/">never
finished, merely abandoned</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been looking out for a good analog hobby for a while now. Maybe
this is the one!

<p>I’ve only ever used Python’s <code>help()</code> feature by passing
references to modules, classes functions and objects to it. Trey Hunner
just taught me that it accepts strings too -
<code>help(“<strong>”)</code> tells you about the <code></strong></code>
operator, <code>help(”if”)</code> describes the <code>if</code>
statement and <code>help(“topics”)</code> reveals even more options,
including things like <code>help(“SPECIALATTRIBUTES”)</code> to learn
about specific advanced topics.</p>

LLMs for drafting alt text
</h4>
<p>
I use LLMs for the first draft of my alt text
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=22m10s">22:10</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I actually use Large Language Models for most of my alt text these days.
Whenever I tweet an image or whatever, I’ve got a Claude project called
Alt text writer. It’s got a prompt and an example. I dump an image in
and it gives me the alt text.
</p>
<p>
I very rarely just use it because that’s rude, right? You should never
dump text onto people that you haven’t reviewed yourself. But it’s
always a good starting point.
</p>
<p>
Normally I’ll edit a tiny little bit. I’ll delete an unimportant detail
or I’ll bulk something up. And then I’ve got alt text that works.
</p>
<p>
Often it’s actually got really good taste. A great example is if you’ve
got a screenshot of an interface, there’s a lot of words in that
screenshot and most of them don’t matter.
</p>
<p>
The message you’re trying to give in the alt text is that it’s two
panels on the left, there’s a conversation on the right, there’s a
preview of the SVG file or something. My alt text writer normally gets
that right.
</p>
<p>
It’s even good at summarizing tables of data where it will notice that
actually what really matters is that Gemini got a score of 57 and Nova
got a score of 53 - so it will pull those details out and ignore
[irrelevant columns] like the release dates and so forth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s the current custom instructions prompt I’m using for that Claude
Project:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You write alt text for any image pasted in by the user. Alt text
is always presented in a fenced code block to make it easy to copy and
paste out. It is always presented on a single line so it can be used
easily in Markdown images. All text on the image (for screenshots etc)
must be exactly included. A short note describing the nature of the
image itself should go first.</code>

Is it ethical to build unreliable accessibility tools?
</h4>
<p>
On the ethics of building accessibility tools on top of inherently
unreliable technology
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=5m35s">5:33</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people I’ve talked to have been skeptical about the accessibility
benefits because their argument is that if you give somebody unreliable
technology that might hallucinate and make things up, surely that’s
harming them.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think that’s true. I feel like people who use screen readers are
used to unreliable technology.
</p>
<p>
You know, if you use a guide dog - it’s a wonderful thing and a
<em>very</em> unreliable piece of technology.
</p>
<p>
When you consider that people with accessibility needs have agency, they
can understand the limitations of the technology they’re using. I feel
like giving them a tool where they can point their phone at something
and it can describe it to them is a world away from accessibility
technology just three or four years ago.

<h4 id="not-a-threat">
Why I don’t feel threatened as a software engineer
</h4>
<p>
This is probably my most coherent explanation yet of why I don’t see
generative AI as a threat to my career as a software engineer
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=33m51s">33:49</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My perspective on this as a developer who’s been using these systems on
a daily basis for a couple of years now is that I find that they enhance
my value. I am so much more competent and capable as a developer because
I’ve got these tools assisting me. I can write code in dozens of new
programming languages that I never learned before.
</p>
<p>
But I still get to benefit from my 20 years of experience.
</p>
<p>
Take somebody off the street who’s never written any code before and ask
them to build an iPhone app with ChatGPT. They are going to run into so
many pitfalls, because programming isn’t just about can you write code -
it’s about thinking through the problems, understanding what’s possible
and what’s not, understanding how to QA, what good code is, having good
taste.
</p>
<p>
There’s so much depth to what we do as software engineers.
</p>
<p>
I’ve said before that generative AI probably gives me like two to five
times productivity boost on the part of my job that involves typing code
into a laptop. But that’s only 10 percent of what I do. As a software
engineer, most of my time isn’t actually spent with the typing of the
code. It’s all of those other activities.
</p>
<p>
The AI systems help with those other activities, too. They can help me
think through architectural decisions and research library options and
so on. But I still have to have that agency to understand what I’m
doing.
</p>
<p>
So as a software engineer, I don’t feel threatened. My most optimistic
view of this is that the cost of developing software goes down because
an engineer like myself can be more ambitious, can take on more things.
As a result, demand for software goes up - because if you’re a company
that previously would never have dreamed of building a custom CRM for
your industry because it would have taken 20 engineers a year before you
got any results… If it now takes four engineers three months to get
results, maybe you’re in the market for software engineers now that you
weren’t before.

<p>
<strong><a href="https://18f.org/">18f.org</a></strong>
</p>
New site by members of 18F, the team within the US government that were
doing some of the most effective work at improving government
efficiency.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For over 11 years, 18F has been proudly serving you to make government
technology work better. We are non-partisan civil servants. 18F has
worked on hundreds of projects, all designed to make government
technology not just efficient but effective, and to save money for
American taxpayers.
</p>
<p>
However, all employees at 18F – a group that the Trump Administration
GSA Technology Transformation Services Director called “the gold
standard” of civic tech – were terminated today at midnight ET.
</p>
<p>
<strong>18F was doing exactly the type of work that DOGE claims to want
– yet we were eliminated.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire team is now on “administrative leave” and locked out of their
computers.
</p>
<p>
But these are not the kind of civil servants to abandon their mission
without a fight:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>We’re not done yet.</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re still absorbing what has happened. We’re wrestling with what it
will mean for ourselves and our families, as well as the impact on our
partners and the American people.
</p>
<p>
But we came to the government to fix things. And we’re not done with
this work yet.
</p>
<p>
More to come.

<h2
id="hallucinations-in-code-are-the-least-dangerous-form-of-llm-mistakes">Hallucinations
in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-02, updated: 2025-03-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
A surprisingly common complaint I see from developers who have tried
using LLMs for code is that they encountered a hallucination - usually
the LLM inventing a method or even a full software library that doesn’t
exist - and it crashed their confidence in LLMs as a tool for writing
code. How could anyone productively use these things if they invent
methods that don’t exist?
</p>
<p>
Hallucinations in code <strong>are the least harmful hallucinations you
can encounter from a model</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The real risk from using LLMs for code is that they’ll make mistakes
that <em>aren’t</em> instantly caught by the language compiler or
interpreter. And these happen <em>all the time</em>!
</p>
<p>
The moment you run LLM generated code, any hallucinated methods will be
instantly obvious: you’ll get an error. You can fix that yourself or you
can feed the error back into the LLM and watch it correct itself.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to hallucinations in regular prose, where you need a
critical eye, strong intuitions and well developed fact checking skills
to avoid sharing information that’s incorrect and directly harmful to
your reputation.
</p>
<p>
With code you get a powerful form of fact checking for free. Run the
code, see if it works.
</p>
<p>
In some setups -
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code
Interpreter</a>,
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude
Code</a>, any of the growing number of “agentic” code systems that write
and then execute code in a loop - the LLM system itself will spot the
error and automatically correct itself.
</p>
<p>
If you’re using an LLM to write code without even running it yourself,
<em>what are you doing?</em>
</p>
<p>
Hallucinated methods are such a tiny roadblock that when people complain
about them I assume they’ve spent minimal time learning how to
effectively use these systems - they dropped them at the first hurdle.
</p>
<p>
My cynical side suspects they may have been looking for a reason to
dismiss the technology and jumped at the first one they found.
</p>
<p>
My less cynical side assumes that nobody ever warned them that you have
to put a lot of work in to learn how to get good results out of these
systems. I’ve been exploring
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">their
applications for writing code</a> for over two years now and I’m still
learning new tricks (and new strengths and weaknesses) almost every day.
</p>
<h4 id="qa">
Manually testing code is essential
</h4>
<p>
Just because code looks good and runs without errors doesn’t mean it’s
actually doing the right thing. No amount of meticulous code review - or
even comprehensive automated tests - will demonstrably prove that code
actually does the right thing. You have to run it yourself!
</p>
<p>
Proving to yourself that the code works is your job. This is one of the
many reasons I don’t think LLMs are going to put software professionals
out of work.
</p>
<p>
LLM code will usually look fantastic: good variable names, convincing
comments, clear type annotations and a logical structure. This can lull
you into a false sense of security, in the same way that a gramatically
correct and confident answer from ChatGPT might tempt you to skip fact
checking or applying a skeptical eye.
</p>
<p>
The way to avoid <em>those</em> problems is the same as how you avoid
problems in code by other humans that you are reviewing, or code that
you’ve written yourself: you need to actively exercise that code. You
need to have great manual QA skills.
</p>
<p>
A general rule for programming is that you should <em>never</em> trust
any piece of code until you’ve seen it work with your own eye - or, even
better, seen it fail and then fixed it.
</p>
<p>
Across my entire career, almost every time I’ve assumed some code works
without actively executing it - some branch condition that rarely gets
hit, or an error message that I don’t expect to occur - I’ve later come
to regret that assumption.
</p>
<h4 id="tips">
Tips for reducing hallucinations
</h4>
<p>
If you really are seeing a deluge of hallucinated details in the code
LLMs are producing for you, there are a bunch of things you can do about
it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Try different models. It might be that another model has better training
data for your chosen platform. As a Python and JavaScript programmer my
favorite models right now are Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking turned on,
OpenAI’s o3-mini-high and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (for Python).
</li>
<li>
Learn how to use the context. If an LLM doesn’t know a particular
library you can often fix this by dumping in a few dozen lines of
example code. LLMs are incredibly good at imitating things, and at
rapidly picking up patterns from very limited examples. Modern model’s
have increasingly large context windows - I’ve recently started using
Claude’s new
<a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">GitHub
integration</a> to dump entire repositories into the context and it’s
been working extremely well for me.
</li>
<li>
Chose <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>. I
genuinely find myself picking libraries that have been around for a
while partly because that way it’s much more likely that LLMs will be
able to use them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ll finish this rant with a related observation: I keep seeing people
say “if I have to review every line of code an LLM writes, it would have
been faster to write it myself!”
</p>
<p>
Those people are loudly declaring that they have under-invested in the
crucial skills of reading, understanding and reviewing code written by
other people. I suggest getting some more practice in. Reviewing code
written for you by LLMs is a great way to do that.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<em>Bonus section</em>: I asked Claude 3.7 Sonnet “extended thinking
mode” to review an earlier draft of this post - “<code>Review my rant of
a blog entry. I want to know if the argument is convincing, small
changes I can make to improve it, if there are things I’ve
missed.</code>”. It was quite helpful, especially in providing tips to
make that first draft a little less confrontational! Since you can share
Claude chats now
