        Yes, Mr Pibb (technically mr P!BB, though Coca-Cola is <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/mr--pibb-returns-with-bold-flavor-and-more-caffeine">inconsistent on their own brand name</a>) is back and Pibb Xtra, the face of Pibb since 2001, is relegated to the dust heap with Peppo. This explains why I had been unable to buy any more Pibb Xtra for the past month or so &mdash; Coke was probably depleting their stocks for the switchback. Since Old VCR's northern HQ is relatively close to a Coke bottling plant, I was able to pick up two fridge packs at Safeway today, though not exactly what I was expecting!

        Besides the new can, the additional caffeine (30% more, though 54mg/can vs 40mg/can is probably not physiologically relevant for most people) and the additional ten calories, the other change is the taste. Now, Coke's marketdroids play the usual crap here and describe it in almost contradictory terms as "a comeback" yet possessing "a bold, spicy cherry taste with hints of caramel." But actually ...

        ... this tastes mostly like the original. Although I'm disappointed it's HFCS and not cane sugar, it tastes like I remember classic Pibb tasting when McDonald's had it on fountain back in the day. Yes, this is also what my dad would water down with Coke to make a "Poke" because he found it too sweet, but even my wife, who is not a fan of any Pepper-style beverage generally, prefers this flavour to Xtra. The only other mark against it is a mildly spicy aftertaste that lingers a touch longer than it should, though Xtra does that a little bit too.
        <p>
        Overall I like them both, but clearly Xtra is on the way out. It's kind of funny given that Coke not too long ago released those limited edition Stranger Things New Coke cans:
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MVbR-c0k0i0T2rdsXgB5yhE-4QW06fMDl_HH6lm7bmC75ahe0ArvHaOZ9oOFstYG6n19wPStEO6I9zPr-ncTfNqQz6K2sPS2WrS0xfVCVwPu1Bxwy380tOCHxrj29nj5T2AQWXQ53jxb/s2048/IMG_20190622_105621.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px;"><img alt="Even New Coke is better than New Blogger!" border="0" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1536" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MVbR-c0k0i0T2rdsXgB5yhE-4QW06fMDl_HH6lm7bmC75ahe0ArvHaOZ9oOFstYG6n19wPStEO6I9zPr-ncTfNqQz6K2sPS2WrS0xfVCVwPu1Bxwy380tOCHxrj29nj5T2AQWXQ53jxb/w240-h320/IMG_20190622_105621.jpg" title="Even New Coke is better than New Blogger!" width="240" /></a></div>
        
        I actually didn't mind New Coke and the Stranger Things reformulation tasted approximately correct to my fuzzy memories of the original New Coke despite being good to have Classic (this is also true of early versions of Mac OS X). Still, both drinks are retro throwbacks in their own ways, one to the new and busted and the other to the old hotness, though this move implies Coca-Cola has more confidence in reviving old Pibb than New Coke &mdash; or at least is more willing to sink Pibb than Coke if they end up guessing wrong. I'll be putting a can of Pibb Xtra in my collection for posterity along with my last bottle of Dublin Dr Pepper, the finest Dr Pepper variant ever made.
        <p>
        For the sake of my day job, I should also officially state you should consume Mr Pibb/Pibb Xtra or any other sugar-sweetened beverage in moderation. After all, as Steve Jobs famously said to John Sculley, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me [from Pepsi] and change the world?" If you don't have a Coke bottling plant in your vicinity, which is probably where the "select markets" are, Coke says you'll get it in the "national rollout" sometime <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/mr--pibb-returns-with-bold-flavor-and-more-caffeine">in 2026</a> &mdash; and it may also be coming to <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/coca-cola-mr-pibb-revival-11840005">a soda fountain near you</a>.]]>

New hotness:

Yes, Mr Pibb (technically mr P!BB, though Coca-Cola is [inconsistent on their own brand name](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/mr--pibb-returns-with-bold-flavor-and-more-caffeine)) is back and Pibb Xtra, the face of Pibb since 2001, is relegated to the dust heap with Peppo. This explains why I had been unable to buy any more Pibb Xtra for the past month or so — Coke was probably depleting their stocks for the switchback. Since Old VCR&#39;s northern HQ is relatively close to a Coke bottling plant, I was able to pick up two fridge packs at Safeway today, though not exactly what I was expecting!

Besides the new can, the additional caffeine (30% more, though 54mg/can vs 40mg/can is probably not physiologically relevant for most people) and the additional ten calories, the other change is the taste. Now, Coke&#39;s marketdroids play the usual crap here and describe it in almost contradictory terms as &#34;a comeback&#34; yet possessing &#34;a bold, spicy cherry taste with hints of caramel.&#34; But actually ...

... this tastes mostly like the original. Although I&#39;m disappointed it&#39;s HFCS and not cane sugar, it tastes like I remember classic Pibb tasting when McDonald&#39;s had it on fountain back in the day. Yes, this is also what my dad would water down with Coke to make a &#34;Poke&#34; because he found it too sweet, but even my wife, who is not a fan of any Pepper-style beverage generally, prefers this flavour to Xtra. The only other mark against it is a mildly spicy aftertaste that lingers a touch longer than it should, though Xtra does that a little bit too.

Overall I like them both, but clearly Xtra is on the way out. It&#39;s kind of funny given that Coke not too long ago released those limited edition Stranger Things New Coke cans:

[![Even New Coke is better than New Blogger!](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MVbR-c0k0i0T2rdsXgB5yhE-4QW06fMDl_HH6lm7bmC75ahe0ArvHaOZ9oOFstYG6n19wPStEO6I9zPr-ncTfNqQz6K2sPS2WrS0xfVCVwPu1Bxwy380tOCHxrj29nj5T2AQWXQ53jxb/w240-h320/IMG_20190622_105621.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9MVbR-c0k0i0T2rdsXgB5yhE-4QW06fMDl_HH6lm7bmC75ahe0ArvHaOZ9oOFstYG6n19wPStEO6I9zPr-ncTfNqQz6K2sPS2WrS0xfVCVwPu1Bxwy380tOCHxrj29nj5T2AQWXQ53jxb/s2048/IMG_20190622_105621.jpg)

I actually didn&#39;t mind New Coke and the Stranger Things reformulation tasted approximately correct to my fuzzy memories of the original New Coke despite being good to have Classic (this is also true of early versions of Mac OS X). Still, both drinks are retro throwbacks in their own ways, one to the new and busted and the other to the old hotness, though this move implies Coca-Cola has more confidence in reviving old Pibb than New Coke — or at least is more willing to sink Pibb than Coke if they end up guessing wrong. I&#39;ll be putting a can of Pibb Xtra in my collection for posterity along with my last bottle of Dublin Dr Pepper, the finest Dr Pepper variant ever made.

For the sake of my day job, I should also officially state you should consume Mr Pibb/Pibb Xtra or any other sugar-sweetened beverage in moderation. After all, as Steve Jobs famously said to John Sculley, &#34;Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me \[from Pepsi\] and change the world?&#34; If you don&#39;t have a Coke bottling plant in your vicinity, which is probably where the &#34;select markets&#34; are, Coke says you&#39;ll get it in the &#34;national rollout&#34; sometime [in 2026](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/mr--pibb-returns-with-bold-flavor-and-more-caffeine) — and it may also be coming to [a soda fountain near you](https://www.foodandwine.com/coca-cola-mr-pibb-revival-11840005).</source:markdown>

        The 1996 Apple Network Server was Apple's first true Unix-through-and-through server (the Apple Workgroup Server 95, actually a Quadra 950 with a special PDS card limited to A/UX, doesn't really count) and <a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">through a complex history</a> came to run <a href="/2025/05/harpoom-of-course-apple-network-server.html">IBM's AIX</a> as its native operating system. I actually had an ANS 500 when it was almost new, in 1998, and it ran Floodgap until 2012. It is still in my collection and still runs, along with an ANS 700 I later acquired and a (sadly battery bombed) <a href="/2021/10/shiner-esb-apple-network-server.html">"Shiner ESB" prototype that used to be at Netscape</a>. AIX was your only choice &mdash; no other operating system was supported.
        <p>
        Still, it was a relatively open secret that the ANS was heavily derived from existing Power Macintosh hardware, most closely the Power Macintosh 9500, and early "Shiner" prototype systems were even demonstrated with MacOS. This was apparently the underpinning of <a href="/2023/12/when-power-macintosh-ran-netware.html">Apple's brief flirtation with NetWare as a server OS</a>, variously codenamed Wormhole, Deep Space Nine and most famously Cyberpunk. Then-CEO Michael Spindler made public statements supporting NetWare on Apple hardware; Wormhole was reportedly demonstrated on an early prototype likely of <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ans/9150/">the Workgroup Server 9150</a> and Cyberpunk was explicitly meant for Shiner. Cyberpunk will no longer run on an ANS with production ROMs, but reportedly did run on ANSes with pre-production ROMs that could still boot MacOS, and <em>does</em> run on early NuBus Power Macs like the Power Macintosh 6100, which is <a href="/2023/12/when-power-macintosh-ran-netware.html">how we demonstrated it</a>. However, potential customers strongly preferred a Unix option and Apple had an arrangement with IBM around AIX, and so as the last operating system still standing that's what <a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">the ANS ended up running</a>. Production ANSes as sold with the standard Open Firmware 1.1.22 ROMs lock MacOS out entirely and you get a message like this:

        Although an old nerds' tale circulated at the time saying you could pull 9500 ROMs, put in a video card and boot from an external hard disk (because the video chip and internal SCSI controller are unique to the ANS and weren't supported by the 9500 or MacOS), this couldn't possibly have worked because among other things the Bandits in the ANS are mapped differently. Lots of people, including yours truly, had certainly tried. Still, I was used to AIX as an AIX administrator since the 3.2.5 days on real RS/6000 hardware and the ANS ran it splendidly, so today mine still runs it (4.1.5 is the last AIX release supported).

        But to me the best thing about the ANS was that I got a big beefy RISC server for a summer's work, so I didn't have to plump down a credit card. For everyone else, the ANS was expensive (starting at $10,000+ in 1996, a cool $20 grand in 2025 dollars) and Apple wasn't moving many. CEO Gil Amelio had lured Ellen Hancock away from National Semiconductor as Apple's new CTO and tasked her with finding a new path for the MacOS, though in the meantime Apple had this big hulking midrange server that wasn't selling. So, as an attempt to juice sales, Hancock announced at Comdex 1996 that the ANS would be able to run other operating system choices, not just AIX. MacOS was an obvious one because it already had before, but Hancock also proposed Windows NT to the great surprise of attendees. While Windows NT was built to be system-agnostic and versions already ran on PowerPC hardware, and people have since <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/maciNTosh">hacked it to run on Power Macs</a>, this would have been the first time it could officially ever run on an Apple machine.
        <p>
        Hancock's assertion was a simple ROM change would do it, and as it happens the ROMs on the ANS are conveniently on a small daughtercard that can be replaced. However, it seems that the market was sceptical this could work &mdash; heck, <em>I</em> was sceptical while doing the story research, since I knew no such ROMs were ever publicly sold &mdash; and the recently-returned Steve Jobs talked Amelio into cancelling the ANS line <a href="/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">and OpenDoc</a> both on the same day in 1997. Nothing more ever turned up about either option.

        Recently a former employee who was on the business development team for Apple's server products <a href="https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/erics-apple-network-server-700-tinker-log.3987/#post-37621">posted on the Tinker Different boards</a>: not only did he have the mythical MacOS ROM, he had it installed in a Deep Dish booting the MacOS. Deep Dish was the code name for the planned but unreleased ANS 300, a small rackmountable version (as opposed to the rackmount plates Apple sold for the 500 and 700 which take up a whopping 19U), so here was a prototype machine running development ROMs booting an operating system it was never actually sold with. More to the point, he confirmed the Windows NT ROMs actually did exist and worked as well.
        <p>
        Though he didn't have the NT ROMs, he did dump the two development ROMs he had (a third is in progress) which included the MacOS ROM &mdash; and now we have them for analysis. What's interesting is that both the explicit MacOS ROM and the Open Firmware 2.26b6 ROM he dumped seem capable of booting MacOS, though the 2.2 ROM has strings saying <tt>MacOS is unsupported, use at your own risk.</tt> and <tt>MacOS requires PCI video card and external SCSI boot disk.</tt> (which may lend credence to that old nerds' tale, assuming you had the right ROMs, not the 9500's). However, the full MacOS ROM reportedly "just works," all the way to Mac OS 9; one wonders if with XPostFacto you could drag it into OS X that way, giving it another Unix option besides AIX, Linux and NetBSD, the driver issue notwithstanding. Though the MacOS ROM does not use the ANS's front-mounted LCD, which is one of its best features, it wouldn't seem difficult to come up with an INIT extension for it. A particularly tantalizing thought is this might also get Cyberpunk running on a Shiner for the first time since 1996, the very machine it was intended for.
        <p>
        To make all that happen, of course, we next need to get the MacOS ROM on an actual ROM card. The ROMs this individual had were flashable and I need to do some looking at mine, and the connectors aren't common. Nevertheless, the first step is to actually <em>have</em> the ROM and now we do. I'm hopeful that this breakthrough might encourage further exploration of my favourite Apple server and that someone out there has the NT ROMs and steps forward. The Apple Network Server was always a cult favourite as one of Apple's more notorious white elephants and now almost 30 years after its introduction there may be even more fun things to do on it. If you know where to find them, post in the comments or drop me a line at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com (happy to keep you anonymous if you prefer which I have done for other former Apple engineers in the past).]]>

      <source:markdown>This year’s [London show](https://www.riscoslondonshow.co.uk/) organised by [ROUGOL](https://rougol.jellybaby.net/) is this Saturday the 25th October from 11am. Shows are the perfect opportunity to meet and talk to fellow RISC OS users and developers about what they’re doing with our favourite operating system.

![Show banner](/images/risc_os_open/shows/rougol2025.png)

### Venue details

A short distance by public transport, around ten miles from Heathrow airport, less than four miles from the M1 motorway, the Harrow District Masonic Centre is closer than you think; see this Google [map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vqigUNhWUqDjfXEH6) for directions.

Please note: engineering work means **the Bakerloo tube line is closed** this weekend.

### See BASIC in action

See the alpha version of BBCBASIC rewritten in C, running natively on both RISC OS 5 and Windows x64, and find out what’s required to get it all finished. It’s a considerable technical effort, and will pave the way for all kinds of language extensions in future.

Want to know why nightly builds of BASIC gained a new [SYS-as-a-function keyword](https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/Programmer/BASIC/-/merge_requests/16) recently? It’s all part of the [mission to the moon](/content/documents/risc-os-moonshots).</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.c64os.resources/weblog/petsciiasciiconversion/icon-petsciiascii.jpg'> Let's talk about PETSCII and ASCII, what they are and how to convert between them properly and losslessly. There are some examples on the internet that are not right, and there are some nuances that make it more complicated than it seems at first glance. ASCII was developed to standardize the codes used by different types of early computers and teletype (and teletype-like) machines. At this time, computers generated output by printing to paper. Although it is an "American" standard code of information interchange, several of the characters were designed for internationalization, by combinations that can only be done on paper. For example, the "Back Space", which became ubiquitous on PCs for "delete," on paper truly is a back "space." It causes the print head to move back one space so that it's positioned above where the previous character was printed. Symbols like, caret (^), tilde (~), and backtick (`), which we use today to mean or perform certain technical functions, are actually me. . .]]>
