        <![CDATA[Back in October 2015, there was a surprise announcement something visitors to that year&#8217;s London Show could expect to see &#8211; a new motherboard, designed by Rob Sprowson, with RISC OS in mind; the Titanium. The board itself became available through Rob&#8217;s company Elesar Ltd in December of that year, allowing people to build DIY machines around it, and it wasn&#8217;t long before there were complete Titanium-based computer systems available from both R-Comp and CJE Micro&#8217;s.

      <title>FlagQuiz 1.02 released</title>
      <link>https://www.riscository.com/2026/flagquiz-1-02/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kevin Wells has released another new version of FlagQuiz, his application that allows users to test their knowledge and recognition of national flags. Version 1.02 addresses a fairly basic issue in the program, whereby the sprites file containing the various flags used by the program were loaded into the WIMP sprite pool. Unless a program specifically needs its sprites held there, this is bad practice because it risks an application&#8217;s sprites being used in place of ones used by the system. Kevin has therefore updated FlagQuiz to store its sprites&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[Very sorry to hear about <a href="https://obits.goldsteinsfuneral.com/stewart-cheifet">the death of Stewart Cheifet</a> at 87, long-time host of Computer Chronicles, which for a long time was the undisputed best show on computers on American public broadcasting. I watched it on PBS TV as a kid, and candidly I didn't understand much of what was going on at the time, but I learned a lot and rewatching the episodes now really demonstrates what a treasure trove of pithy information and industry commentary they were. Gary Kildall, of Digital Research fame, was his co-host in many 1980s episodes and the most notable of an august crew that also included George Morrow and Paul Schindler, but Cheifet was the linchpin and carried the show on his formidable shoulders from its 1984 start until the final episode in 2002. The most amazing part of his work, however, is what happened after: the vast majority of the program is <a href="https://archive.org/details/Computer_Chronicles">preserved for posterity at the Internet Archive</a>, not just with his blessing, but with his active participation. For any computer historian and student of the early industry, the show is not to be missed. Rest in peace.]]>
