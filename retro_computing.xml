        <![CDATA[The opportunity has once again come around for people involved or interested in software development on, for, or even of RISC OS to gather together and discuss matters relevant to the topic.

The board itself became available through Rob&#8217;s company Elesar Ltd in December of that year, allowing people to build DIY machines around it, and it wasn&#8217;t long before there were complete Titanium-based computer systems available from both R-Comp and CJE Micro&#8217;s.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kevin Wells has released another new version of FlagQuiz, his application that allows users to test their knowledge and recognition of national flags. Version 1.02 addresses a fairly basic issue in the program, whereby the sprites file containing the various flags used by the program were loaded into the WIMP sprite pool. Unless a program specifically needs its sprites held there, this is bad practice because it risks an application&#8217;s sprites being used in place of ones used by the system. Kevin has therefore updated FlagQuiz to store its sprites&#8230;]]>
