      <title>A Christmas 2007 video present from Old VCR with Jack Tramiel et al</title>

        <![CDATA[A very happy holiday season and Merry Christmas to those of you who celebrate it (timezone may vary). Also, I don't think I nearly say thanks enough to my regular patrons through Ko-fi, and I want to also thank them on behalf of the geriatric systems their generosity &mdash; and all of you who have chipped in at one time or another &mdash; helps keep running. I've got more projects to finish in 2026 and I hope you enjoy them.
        <p>
        Anyway, here's a gift for <em>you</em> which I forgot I still had kicking around. This is a raw cut from the 2007 Computer History Museum 25th anniversary symposium of the Commodore 64, with Jack Tramiel himself, plus Steve Wozniak, William Lowe and others (like Lee Felsenstein and Al Alcorn from the audience). I was fortunate enough to get into what was a sell-out standing-room only crowd with my trusty JVC DV camera and tape the whole thing, then dash back to So Cal and quickly dump and title it on the Power Mac Quad G5. Any camera glitches, plus a couple dropouts where I had to quickly change DV tapes, and bad titles are of course totally my fault. (In fact, there are indeed at least two errors. Can you find them?) This video is so old that it was actually originally uploaded to Google Video &mdash; some of you may remember it &mdash; and had been quietly transferred automatically to YouTube, which I had forgotten even happened. So here it is in its original strictly standard definition format. If you want to use clips from it in your own video, please give me a holler first in the comments. Enjoy.

        <![CDATA[I've mentioned on the blog several times <a href="/2024/02/cap-x-and-comp-x-how-tandy-pocket.html">the continuum that exists between handheld computers and pocket computers</a>, battery powered devices in rather small form factors that are nevertheless fully-fledged general purpose computers &mdash; arguably more so than the modern locked-down smartphone has become. Some of these diminutive systems are best considered "handhelds," with larger size, larger keyboards, more power and (often) less battery life, and some are definitely "pocket computers," with smaller size, smaller keys, less power and (usually) better battery life. For example, systems like the Tandy PC-4/Casio PB-100 or Tandy PC-3/Sharp PC-1250 would be considered "definitely a pocket computer," while the Epson HX-20 or Kyotronic 85 systems like the NEC PC-8201A or TRS-80 Model 100 would be considered "definitely a handheld computer," and you can probably think up some examples in between.
        <p>
        Well, here's a notable example of one single architecture that birthed <em>both</em> types of machine, and it came from a company not really noted for either one: Texas Instruments.
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhffsjaSLnq-WtNVXtv3lfxAhY3Y9TRcQABe2pXaAIH_oxWELtF6Q48ExDCRmzRS2XVniW1iRlOrDsAXKNcBbQFG6HvPbHVPvu29qUkxckW16kbXwfuii9Q-14vZSaB8AvkTJcZzkNO_zOwUv0cmQLoWKM2uQ-aePTI5K79LruAHMil51-PuRgn4l1zI_w/s4080/PXL_20251023_043145317.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhffsjaSLnq-WtNVXtv3lfxAhY3Y9TRcQABe2pXaAIH_oxWELtF6Q48ExDCRmzRS2XVniW1iRlOrDsAXKNcBbQFG6HvPbHVPvu29qUkxckW16kbXwfuii9Q-14vZSaB8AvkTJcZzkNO_zOwUv0cmQLoWKM2uQ-aePTI5K79LruAHMil51-PuRgn4l1zI_w/s320/PXL_20251023_043145317.jpg"/></a></div>
        
        TI certainly made calculators and many of those were programmable by some means, but neither handheld computers nor pocket computers had categorically been in their repertoire to date. Nevertheless, here we have the 1983 Compact Computer 40 &mdash; using the AA battery for scale, at that size <em>definitely</em> a handheld &mdash; and above it the 1985 TI-74 BASICALC, notionally a "BASIC programmable calculator," but actually an evolved version of nearly the same hardware in less than half the size. Thanks to the ingenuity of the Hexbus interface, which due to TI's shortsightedness was never effectively exploited during that era, we can get a serial port running on both of these with hobbyist hardware. If we have a serial port, that means we can bring up a terminal program &mdash; which we'll write from scratch in assembly language for shell and Gopherspace access.
        <p>
        But how would a Unix shell work on a single line screen, or for that matter, a Gopher menu? We'll explore some concepts, but before we do that, for context and understanding of their capabilities we'll start with the history of these machines &mdash; and because their development is unavoidably tangled with TI's other consumer products and their home computer family, we'll necessarily rehash some of those highlights and nadirs as well.
        <p>
        <a name='more'></a>
        <p>
        <h3>The Compact Computer family and the CC-40</h3>
        <p>
        The obvious progenitors of the pocket-handheld computer family were the programmable calculators emerging from various manufacturers in the mid-1970s. In this genre TI was a notable vendor despite being just one of several. Arguably the first of these was the <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp65.htm">Hewlett-Packard HP-65</a>, released in 1974. Although not a computer in the conventional sense (despite HP's marketing), it could accept up to 100 lines of "program text" (key presses) and read and write them using magnetic stripe cards, and was robust enough to go into space with the Apollo mission in 1975. TI fired back in 1975 with the SR-52, also programmable with mag stripe, and supporting 224 lines.

        HP, TI and Casio became probably the most active in this submarket, culminating in the 1977 TI-58 and TI-59 supporting up to 5000 lines of program text stored in "solid state" ROM modules that acted like library cartridges (the ad here is from a 1979 promotion). These modules became very popular for vertical markets, with bespoke program functions stored ready-to-go for industries like insurance and finance and engineering not unlike <a href="/2024/10/the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4s-secret.html">the later Panasonic HHC</a>. Having knocked other smaller companies like Commodore out of contention, TI understood HP to be their most direct competitor at that time, and launched what was called <a href="http://www.datamath.org/Story/Project-X.htm">Project X</a> in 1977 to leapfrog them in the programmable calculator segment: wider screens up to 16 characters wide, expandable memory and an "Equation Operating System" implementing a scrolling display for formula entry and editing, facilitated using a new system architecture tentatively named "LCD III."
        <p>
        As competing calculators added power and new capabilities, a higher end model dubbed the Advanced Language Calculator (or ALC for short, codenamed "Lonestar") sought to introduce more computer-like features to the handheld range with its own scrolling LCD and cartridge-based software and programming languages. The idea turned out to be an atypically forward-thinking move on TI's part because the market dramatically changed in 1980 when Sharp introduced the PC-1210 and PC-1211, the first true pocket computers with full alphanumerics and programmability in BASIC (the PC-1211 was rebadged by Tandy Radio Shack <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tpm/138.html">as the PC-1</a>). In quick succession followed <a href="/2024/10/the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4s-secret.html">the Panasonic HHC family</a>, even based on a more conventional architecture, the 6502, and shortly afterwards Casio introduced their own pocket line.
        <p>
        This new offshoot of the calculator market caused TI management to reexamine how Project X and the ALC should be positioned. Commissioning a user survey in July 1981, TI's marketing team broadened both concepts into three potential niches (RM 1000, RM 2000 and RM 3000), reworking the original programmable calculator product into the lowest price point (1000) while adding a BASIC-based single-line LCD pocket computer (2000) and a full multi-line LCD portable as higher tiers (3000). The obvious inheritor of Project X, the RM 1000 eventually morphed into the still-born TI-88 calculator, produced and prototyped but unexpectedly cancelled pre-launch in 1982 due to fears it was already obsolete.
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ8fzGPJ21QXrcUgZPO7hGRSlRjqQu0TJSgJPX2hmpliTb3hXYrS0EbgbZZ82m0kRVRP5XnqhQhwMryTK7dp2I9BcL6rPvi-wab-zvqFvrqRa44Vfw__6_J_r69sjcSuvdtc9PhNcaapldjqWw04gjq8aKDFTkHuNVLYSyr2o_IIdPLjIV59WHU4G_ERI/s2926/alc-fixed.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="1878" data-original-width="2926" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ8fzGPJ21QXrcUgZPO7hGRSlRjqQu0TJSgJPX2hmpliTb3hXYrS0EbgbZZ82m0kRVRP5XnqhQhwMryTK7dp2I9BcL6rPvi-wab-zvqFvrqRa44Vfw__6_J_r69sjcSuvdtc9PhNcaapldjqWw04gjq8aKDFTkHuNVLYSyr2o_IIdPLjIV59WHU4G_ERI/s320/alc-fixed.png"/></a></div>  
          
        The RM 2000, on the other hand, wasn't an exact physical match for the ALC/Lonestar, which by then was a larger handheld with a 31-character LCD and "Chiclet" style keyboard, but Lonestar was sufficiently far along in development that its present form factor won out. (The scan above of an undated ALC mockup came from a bad photocopy tucked in with one of my CC-40s which I have tried to airbrush and clean up for legibility. I don't know anything about its provenance otherwise.) Additional market separation was achieved by using a new 8-bit processor design, admittedly with less capability than their flagship 16-bit 9900/9995 CPUs and microcontroller variants, but also without their legacy baggage. Implementing an internal architecture not unlike the Intel 8051, with which it was intended to be comparable, the TMS7000 series was also positioned as a follow-on to their very successful <a href="https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/here-be-four-bits-of-dragons-mattel.html">4-bit TMS1000 family</a> in that custom microcode was fully supported like the earlier product. Like most microcontrollers, it could be shipped with built-in mask ROM directly from manufacture. TI started selling NMOS variants of the chip family in 1981, but the then-current version of the chip required two nine-volt batteries in the Lonestar prototype to power it and engineers proceeded converting the chip family to low-power CMOS for the ALC.

        In parallel, the Texas Instruments consumer products division was determined to maximize sales volume, initially through discounts, reductions in production cost and heavily courting retailers, and in September 1982 newly promoted division head William Turner openly ignited a home computer price war with Jack Tramiel's resurgent Commodore. Turner aimed to push Commodore out of the market again by competing on price, now Tramiel's home turf, and use the installed base to move their vendor-locked software and peripherals. While TI sales duly increased, Commodore persistently hung on in the low end market as in retrospect the VIC-20 was a much cheaper system against which the expensive and arguably overengineered TI 99/4A could not indefinitely compete. Nevertheless, through the rest of 1982 the 99/4A outsold the VIC-20 and for some period of time was the number one home computer in the United States, and management rapidly plotted how to diversify the line. Alongside wilder ideas like the 99/7 terminal and a direct successor alternately referred to as the 99/4B or 99/5, at least two concepts got as far as actual hardware. The 99/8 (codenamed "Armadillo") was intended to attack the high side of the market, a substantial expansion of the 99/4A with more RAM and built-in Extended BASIC, while the 99/2 was meant to hit the ultra-low end as a direct response to systems like the UK Sinclair ZX81 (subsequently introduced States-side in slightly modified form as the Timex Sinclair 1000). Although also a full 16-bit member of the 9900 family &mdash; with a TMS9995 CPU, the same as the <a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">Tomy Tutor</a> &mdash; the diminutive 99/2 used a Chiclet style keyboard similar to Lonestar and a very limited black-and-white video chip, less capable than the 9918A but also less expensive. It supported cassette tape and cartridges, and as a stepping stone to the larger systems, BASIC programs written on a 99/2 were designed to be upwardly compatible with the 99/4A and 99/8.
        <p>
        For expansion options, TI created a new and simpler peripheral interface called Hexbus (also variously seen as Hex-Bus, HEXBUS and HexBus in period literature and user notes, though here I'll render it Hexbus for the remainder of the article). TI positioned Hexbus as a universal means to service all but the highest-bandwidth devices, from modems and serial communications to printers and mass storage. As such, they replaced Lonestar's original 9-pin I/O port with Hexbus and additionally fitted it to the 99/2 and the 99/8. The protocol is straightforward to understand and implement, and I'll talk a bit about the technical aspects a little later since the devices we'll use all connect that way. TI planned to extend Hexbus support to the 99/4A and RM 3000 (in whatever form it ended up taking) so that as many of their comsumer computers as possible could use the same peripherals.
        <p>
        Meanwhile, as Tramiel began driving price cuts faster and deeper and TI was repeatedly forced to match them (as the old Klingon proverb says, revenge is a dish best served cold), management began considering the ALC/Lonestar as a potential anchor in the portables market where competition was not nearly so fierce. The ALC prototype (now the ALC-A, for Product A) was extended into a family of machines: a low-end ALC-LC ("Low Cost") with a 16-character LCD, limited BASIC, Hexbus but no cartridge port, and 1K of RAM; a high-end ALC-C to succeed the RM 3000 with a 40x6 character LCD, larger keyboard, cartridge port, Hexbus, cassette port and 8K of RAM (a terminal variant ALC-T added a 300bps modem); and then the ALC-A itself expanded into the ALC-A2, with the same 31-character LCD and original Chiclet keyboard, plus 2K of RAM, cartridge port and Hexbus. The cartridge port could accommodate programming languages like BASIC, Fortran and Pascal as well as application software, and Turner insisted it also allow RAM expansion.

        TI paused the ALC-LC and ALC-C to get the ALC-A2 to market first, reasoning the design could easily be reworked for the others if it was successful. Renaming it as the Compact Computer 40, BASIC was made internal and the original drop-in cartridge port design (shown here on a late prototype) was reworked to a more typical card edge. Additionally, as 2K RAM was increasingly becoming inadequate even for portable systems, TI pumped the base RAM up to 6K &mdash; we'll talk about how TI arrived at that number presently. Now that everything was CMOS internally, it could run sufficiently well on just four AA batteries, which was a significant improvement in convenience, runtime and weight; an optional AC adapter could be connected for desktop use.

        The 99/2 and the revised 6K CC-40 made their debut at Winter CES 1983. The "40" came from TI's specious then-custom of counting ROM and RAM together as total "memory," so according to their vaguely disingenuous marketdroids at the show the CC-40 had 40K of "memory" from its 6K of RAM and 34K of ROM (an unusual but truthful number that again I will explain when we get to the internals). This then carried over to the magazine copy in <i>Creative Computing</i> April 1983, above, where an overly credulous David Ahl (et al) completely swallowed the TI baloney and said it was "expandable to 128K thanks to the 16-bit processor."

        In reality both parts of that statement were false: it still ran an 8-bit TMS7000-series CPU, though at the time TI was careful not to say exactly what the CPU <em>was</em>, and TI's memory claim was <em>more</em> ridiculous than Ahl reported as they actually alleged a ceiling of <em>168K</em> of "memory" &mdash; because it accepted cartridges of up to 128K of <em>ROM</em> (i.e., 6 + 34 + 128). A 16K <em>RAM</em> expansion was also planned and TI estimated a runtime of 200 hours on four alkaline AA batteries.
        <p>
        TI was justifiably very proud of Hexbus and demonstrated at least three peripherals at the show: an RS-232 serial interface for $100 [around $325 in 2025 dollars], a four-colour printer-plotter which many of you have already guessed the mechanism of and selling for $200 [$650], and a licensed version of the Exatron Stringy Floppy that TI reworked into what they called "wafertape." Its sole mass storage option, the wafertape drive was priced at $139 [$460] plus media cost, which wasn't disclosed. A modem, full-size printer, wand input device and a video interface were announced for later in the year.
        <p>
        Despite being arguably more powerful, the 99/2 was clearly positioned as the junior product &mdash; TI priced it at just $100 [$325] while the CC-40 retailed for $249.95 [$810]. Software support likewise reflected the CC-40's higher priority. TI announced eight cartridges at the show, but only two of them were for the 99/2 at $19.95 [$65] each, and about twenty more promised titles were to be released on cassette tape at $9.95 [$32] a pop. On the other hand, the CC-40 got at least six cartridges (seven listed here) and at least thirteen additional software packages on wafertape, with a promised <em>seventy-five</em> more; the most expensive of these retailed for almost $150 [$485]. TI informed attendees both computers would be available by summer.

        Unfortunately, what should have been a triumphant return for TI at Summer CES 1983 turned into disaster. Commodore, fresh off the introduction of the Commodore 64 in 1982 at $595, had slashed the VIC-20 to a new low of $125 in January 1983 and once again forced TI to follow suit. By the time the June convention rolled around, Commodore had managed to gobble up over 50 percent of the home computer market and largely at TI's expense: the Commodore 64 was flying off shelves at under $300 &mdash; half its introductory price, even lower at discounters &mdash; and the VIC-20 continued selling briskly for $100 or less. In contrast to the 99/4A, Tramiel's high degree of vertical integration and low production costs ensured Commodore could still turn a profit. Nevertheless, TI doggedly matched the VIC-20's new price (with a rebate) and started taking a significant loss on every unit, which also put them in the distinctly unpalatable position of introducing the notionally low-end 99/2 at or above what the 99/4A was now selling for. The 99/2 was quietly cancelled the day before the show and TI later liquidated the small amount of stock that had already been manufactured.
        <p>
        In fairness, TI was not the only one in trouble and both Atari and Mattel took massive losses as well. 1983 was also the year of the crap home computer with many other underwhelming systems being introduced at or near that magic $100 price point &mdash; and I know if I mention any by name, <em>someone</em> out there will howl because there will always be at least one person who loved theirs. Unlike TI's hardware, however, such systems were made cheap to sell cheap: while most customers correctly perceived them as technologically inferior, they at least covered their cost per unit, even though most of these fly-by-night also-rans flamed out within months.
        <p>  
        Seeing all this upon arrival in Chicago, TI management abruptly decided not to exhibit the 99/8 either<!-- NYT 1983-10-29 --> and hastily put the display model behind a locked door for the show's duration. (Ironically, the <a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">Tomy Tutor</a> &mdash; nothing less than a modified clone of the 99/8 &mdash; made its American debut at the very same convention.) Although a public relations debacle of its own (some mischievous press coverage even reportedly printed pictures of the door), TI's most enduring announcement from that Summer CES was a threat to completely lock out third-party software for the 99/4A, a deeply unpopular and thinly veiled attempt to maximize its failing razor-and-blades model, and one they mostly made good on by enforcing their patents on GROM chips. The company's stock cratered after announcing a $119 million loss in July &mdash; both due to production costs and a critical overestimation of demand &mdash; and Bill Turner was forced out of the company. Incredibly, Turner's replacement Peter Field decided to double down on the strategy by slashing the price of peripherals as well as the computer.

        On the other hand, the CC-40 largely sailed above this fray because it was positioned as a <em>business</em> product. Although ostensibly developed and sold by the same consumer products division &mdash; unlike the TI Professional PC from the data systems group which had also come out around this time &mdash; marketing took great pains to distance it from the ailing home computer line and emphasize its utility for serious business rather than general purpose entertainment. Bill Cosby, celebrity endorser of both TI since 1982 and Jell-O, which closely resembled the spines of certain TI executives, was there to remind you there was always room for a CC-40 (and prison time).

        In the official marketing pamphlets TI provided at Winter CES 1983, you can see the difference in tone between the CC-40's and the contemporary 99/4A's: Cosby is more casually dressed for the 99/4A and it appears prominently billed as a home computer in two places just on the cover alone, yet for the CC-40 he presents the computer and a wafertape while wearing business attire, using executive buzzwords like "solutions" and making no mention of home applications at all. (This particular pamphlet is the source of some of the scans I showed you previously.) Based on early hands-on reviews around August 1983<!-- Creative Computing 8/83 --> and estimating about a two to three month publishing delay, it appears the CC-40 made it to retailers at the promised price point between May and June of that year.

        The released CC-40 is very similar to the ALC concept; the CC-40 retains Lonestar's general form factor and its 31-character non-dot-addressible LCD with various mode indicators. These indicators not only include things like the state of the SHIFT key and the current trigonometric unit of angle, but also unique user-addressible arrow-like markers along the bottom of the LCD panel which can be programmatically toggled to signal the user. Limited custom graphics were possible by redefining one of six screen characters dedicated to the purpose.
        <p>
        The keyboard, however, was one thing that did change. While the ALC and the CC-40 use the same "Chiclet" keyboard in the same overall layout, including a small numeric keypad, some of the keys were moved around and certain others removed. The undated ALC image I have above likely came from the same source as <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/313064-cb-wilson-ti-99-related-documents/page/8/">these documents from a former TI engineer</a>, one of which shows the MODE key crossed out, the LBL key replaced with CTRL and the equals key at the bottom left of the numeric keypad replaced with a generic "FN" function key. It looks like the ALC was also proposed to support some sort of Japanese language entry, most likely katakana (the display was not sufficient for most hiragana, let alone full-blown kanji), but this feature was also subsequently eliminated. On the image here I can't distinguish what the shifted characters were meant to be, but <a href="http://www.datamath.org/Graphing/JPEG_CC-40P.htm">this photograph</a> appears to be of the same or similar ALC mockup, showing some typographical characters also moved around as well as a line of deep blue secondary functions possibly for debugging purposes.

        If you have big hands, then you probably have big thumbs, and you know what they say about guys with big thumbs: they can type better on handheld computers. (What? This is a family blog.) In my clodhopper not-quite-varsity basketball mitts the CC-40 is almost a handheld but it wasn't for most people, and even more so than its single-line LCD the roughly 80% keycaps &mdash; although considered better than the 99/2's mushy Chiclets &mdash; provoked polarized opinions. Joe Devlin in <i>Creative Computing</i> said the keyboard was "not all it might be," but found it "well-built" with "no hint of keybounce that is a frequent plague," while <i>Microcomputing</i> asserted it was "basically a calculator keypad with letters on it" and <i>Byte</i>'s David Ramsey bluntly called it "vile." On the other hand, it was certainly no worse than, say, an HP-75. A small recessed divot next to the space bar acts as a soft reset button; the machine also comes with a translucent keyboard overlay with quick combinations to type BASIC keywords, though this falls off easily and I don't much use it myself.

        The underside of the unit contains the battery door (four AA batteries) and a sturdy flip-up stand for using it on a desk. There are supposed to be four rubber feet but the glue kind of sucks and two of them came off at some point. The CC-40's official model number, shown here, is the "CC 40." This unit is serial #A001818 with date code ATA3583, indicating it was assembled at TI's plant in Abilene, TX in the 35th week of 1983 (i.e., end of August).

        The CC-40 has just three external ports. On the left side of the computer (right in this image) are the AC power jack and the Hexbus connector, and on the right is the single cartridge port. The power jack, officially TI's model AC 9201 wallwart, is a standard barrel connector providing 6V DC but atypically negative tip. However, kudos do have to be given to TI for its power implementation: people have reported accidentally connecting a positive tip AC adapter will not let out the magic smoke (it just won't work, though always try to avoid it), and you can use the AC adapter to bridge changing the batteries while it's running. The CC-40 will seamlessly switch to AC power when it's available and batteries when it isn't, including the situation where the barrel jack is plugged in but the wallwart is not. If all else fails, I have read various reports that the system will maintain memory contents for about a minute if you can swap the batteries quickly, which matches my personal experience. That said, I use lithium AAs in mine and I have yet to replace them.

        Unlike the drop-in cartridges of the prototype, released cartridges have a more typical card edge protected by a sliding cap which guides the edge into the slot. The ROM software cartridges and the RAM expanders have the same form factor, but there is only one slot, so it is not possible to have a RAM expansion and a ROM cartridge plugged in together. (Although modern homebrew combo cartridges exist with both ROM and RAM, they don't support accessing both at the same time.)

        As you saw in the extract from the marketing pamphlet, TI called their ROM cartridges "Solid State Software." However, not all the promised cartridges were ever released. TI only officially sold the Statistics, Finance, Pascal, Memo Processor, Games I, Electronics ("Advanced Electrical Engineering") and Mathematics cartridges, though the Editor/Assembler cartridge was subsequently found and dumped, and nowadays appears on most multicarts. On the other hand, despite being officially planned, Business Graphics and Games II have yet to be discovered. These cartridges appear to the computer as programs which can be run by name; some cartridges like Games I have multiple programs (Hunt the Wumpus, Hammurabi, Stocks and Bonds, Spacecraft Landing Simulation and Backgammon; Games II would have had Codebreaker, Interchange, Nim, Sea Battle, Number Gallery and Word Scramble). Some cartridges can also add functionality to BASIC programs. We'll look at one of these cartridges in particular a little later on.
        <p>
        TI produced two RAM cartridges for the CC-40, though because of the CC-40's unusual BASIC memory map, not all of their RAM was useable under all circumstances. The most common, and arguably the most useful for a particular reason I'll mention shortly, was the 8K Constant Memory cartridge. This cartridge contained battery-backed RAM which could either be added to the system as expansion memory for BASIC (but resets the system when taken out), or be used as a removable storage medium with a small machine language program. In this second mode the entire memory of the standard 6K system could be copied to the cartridge and back, and since it carried a small lithium battery, its contents &mdash; including the machine language subroutine necessary to load from it &mdash; would persist when unplugged. TI estimated this battery would last about three to five years using a mechanism that would connect the battery only on first use. Naturally, unless you find an unused NOS unit, current examples are dead as doornails but despite not being user-serviceable the batteries can be replaced with some effort.
        <p>
        The second option was the 16K RAM cartridge that TI had originally promised. This unit lacked a battery and was completely volatile. Although technically capable of serving as a storage medium, it could only do so while the cartridge remained connected and the computer's batteries were good, so it was most useful simply as expanded memory. Unfortunately, while the original 2K iteration could take advantage of all 8K and 16K (to yield 10K and 18K respectively), BASIC's memory map in the released 6K CC-40 couldn't access 4K of either device &mdash; which is to say the 8K cartridge could only add 4K of memory to BASIC to yield 10K (though all 8K was addressable), and the 16K only 12K to yield 18K. Although TI did mention a 2K expander in documentation, no such cartridge was sold. Despite this deficiency, the CC-40's memory map can support up to 32K of external memory and modern homebrew RAM cartridges typically provide all 32K with battery backup a la the original 8K Constant Memory.

        That brings us to the eight-pin Hexbus port, though the manual calls it the "peripheral port." Hexbus is a four-bit parallel interface over an extended bus capable of addressing up to 255 intelligent devices (device 0 is "all devices"), and the "hex" part likely reflects that it can send an entire hexadecimal digit at once with the remainder for ground, handshaking and future expansion. It is hot-pluggable and largely device-agnostic, and like the analogous Atari SIO system can be considered a spiritual ancestor of modern USB. Hexbus hosts are generally the centre of the bus (unless this role has been reassigned) and as such order downstream devices to act or report using command and data packets. It is possible to interrupt the host when a device requires service, though this requires the host to subsequently poll each enabled device to determined who interrupted it. (Foreshadowing.) Power is not distributed over Hexbus <i>sensu stricto</i> but we'll get to a later variation that can.
        <p>
        TI intended Hexbus to service all kinds of peripherals and assigned fixed device number ranges to various classes. In practice this was not always strictly observed, nor were all assigned device classes actually used or all possible numerical ranges actually assigned. Among others, officially 1-2 were for cassette tape but 3-8 for tape mass storage, 10-19 for various sorts of printers (with subclasses beneath them) but 50-53 for Centronics-style parallel interfaces, 20-23 for RS-232 serial and 70-73 for modems, 30-33 and 40-43 for colour and black and white video interfaces, 100-109 for 5.25" floppy disk drives, 110-117 for 3.5", and 90-95 for barcode readers and scanners. 118-239 was explicitly dedicated to third-party use but most homebrew Hexbus devices, including the ones we'll use in this article, emulate the standard device IDs. Thirty-one different commands are defined; devices are only required to implement those which are relevant to their operation.
        <p>
        Hexbus mandated the host be capable of no less than 3000 bytes/second for "peripherals that require a minimum I/O transfer rate" and the CC-40's user's guide rates the CC-40 as capable of up to 6000 bytes/second. Theoretically a nybble could be transmitted about every 16 microseconds, yielding a maximum throughput of around 31,250 bytes/second, though rarely was anything close to this top speed realized. Part of the problem was the protocol's overhead as well as the computers themselves, which for reasons of power consumption did not drive the bus particularly efficiently under ordinary circumstances. The other wart on Hexbus are the cables, which have poor strain relief and rely on a sometimes mushy friction fit in the ports, which themselves aren't well-reinforced either.

        As mentioned, the launch portfolio for Hexbus was a printer/plotter, RS-232 serial interface and the wafertape drive, and this three-pack was what appeared in the 1983 CC-40 pamphlet. For the 99/4A's 1983 pamphlet, however, notice that not only were Hexbus devices explicitly advertised with the new beige 4A (along with a beige PEB which I've never actually seen and was probably a mockup), but there were now <em>four</em> of them.

        Those four are shown here: the small printer/plotter (HX-1000 Printer/Plotter), the RS-232 box (HX-3000 RS-232), the wafertape (HX-2000, though this one is unmarked) and additionally a modem (HX-3100 Modem). They were intentionally stackable into an attractive cube configuration, though I note the printer/plotter has a different front bezel colour that doesn't match the other devices or what appeared in the pamphlets. Although the modem and wafertape can accept regular batteries, the printer/plotter is powered by a NiCad pack with all the attendant disadvantages and uses its own charger (AC 9203, nominally 9V center-tip but my multimeter reads about 12.5V), and the RS-232 box must be connected to wall power (using another AC 9201 adapter, same as the CC-40 itself).

        Anyone who knows anything about plotters of this era will recognize the mechanism in the printer/plotter: it's another Alps DPG-1302, <a href="http://tandy.wiki/CGP-115">the same as</a> the Tandy CGP-115, Commodore 1520, Atari 1020, Oric MCP-40 and <a href="/2024/09/programming-convergent-workslates.html">the Convergent Microprinter WP-100</a>, among many others. However, that also means that refurbishing it is fortunately quite practical once you replace that hideous internal battery pack.

        Later on a full-size 80-column dot matrix printer (HX-1010 Printer 80) became available, though unlike the plotter this one can take regular D batteries (four). This printer is based on a Brother printer mechanism also found in their EP-20 electronic typewriter and uses the same ribbons, or if you have no ribbons, you can use it as a thermal printer with fax paper such as that for <a href="/2022/02/refurb-weekend-texas-instruments-silent.html">the Silent 700 series</a>. I don't have the AC 9401 supply the Printer 80 uses, but based on the EP-20 (which also could run on four D batteries) it is likely also 6V tip negative at 1.0A, unlike the 300mA AC 9201.

        More so than the others, however, the wafertape drive was intended to be the star of the show. It is in fact a portable version of the Exatron Stringy Floppy (from Exatron in Sunnyvale, later Entrepo, Inc.), a high-speed (for the era) continuous-loop tape system first introduced in 1978 for which Texas Instruments had negotiated an exclusive license in 1982. Like other forms of tape storage the Stringy Floppy is inherently sequential, and has no true provision for random access &mdash; files must be scanned through in order until the desired one is encountered. But, because it's looped and streams fast, it can nevertheless achieve speeds comparable to a conventional floppy disk system. The wafertapes ("microwafers") fit easily in one's hand, or at least they do in <em>my</em> hand.

        The length of the tape naturally determines its capacity, although longer tapes are also unavoidably slower to search. In my collection I have 5 foot, 10 foot, 25 foot and 50 foot wafers, apparently the only sizes TI offered, which in a somewhat non-linear fashion respectively correspond to maximum capacities of 4K, 12K, 32K and 64K. The wafertape drive is typically device 1, the same range as cassette tapes, though a selector in the back can pick a device ID anywhere from 1 to 8 if you were crazy enough to have a stack of them.
        <p>
        In retrospect TI's choice of the Stringy Floppy was peculiar because the device already had a somewhat chequered reputation on other platforms. Although reasonably fast, its storage capacities were unimpressive compared to floppies and the media wasn't cheap. Worse still, the tape media was well-known for being prone to tangling and even sometimes outright fracturing, a problem that only got worse as tapes got older and more fragile, and tended to happen more with expensive higher-capacity cartridges because the tape in them was thinner. Repairing a mangled or broken tape could be an exceptionally fiddly business which I've experienced enough firsthand to the point where I rarely use the wafertape drive anymore except for demonstrations. 
        <p>
        Yet all that was not sufficient to deter TI, who wanted to avoid the association of ordinary cassette storage with home computers, and believed the wafertape drive would be seen as handy, speedy and state of the art. However, two more flaws subsequently became apparent. The first was that tape handling became even more unreliable on battery power, especially as the batteries got low, and virtually necessitated the device be connected to the wall. But the second, discovered in October 1983, was a rare but critical fault in its internal microcontroller where under specific circumstances it could unexpectedly fail to wake on an interrupt and thus go out of synchronization.

        By the time this fault was discovered, CC-40 owners were already howling because of the backlog on peripherals &mdash; <em>any</em> peripherals. These didn't start hitting retail channels until the fall and sometimes even later: my modem has an ATA3483 date code while my RS-232 box has an LTA4983 date code, well into December, and my NOS printer/plotter has a date code of 014 indicating January of 1984. The delays were significant enough that as early as July TI had already announced expected declines in CC-40 sales, at the same time Bill Turner got cashiered, and ended up taking writeoffs. Although the wafertape drives were being manufactured on the same timetable (mine has an ATA3383 date), at that point the CC-40 was clearly in decline and TI management didn't want an expensive recall or lawsuit incited by the drives' flaws on a product entering twilight. The wafertape drive was cancelled before it was ever sold and stickers saying so went out on every CC-40's box thereafter. (Note the box copy: the copyright says 1982, and the modem wasn't ready by then, so it doesn't appear.)

        But since there were stacks of other boxes and documentation already printed referencing the wafertape, TI wasn't content to mark just the CC-40's box alone with its discontinuation; they also jammed slips in manuals and slapped stickers on the boxes of the other peripherals so that they didn't need to be reprinted (and no one could claim TI didn't warn them). This ended up making the 8K Constant Memory cartridge practically essential because without it you had no chance of saving anything.
        <p>
        One other mass storage device was created by TI for Hexbus, a 5.25" floppy drive, but while it may have been able to work with the CC-40 this device was actually intended for the home computer line and went unreleased. There was also a prototype <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/380304-hexbus-video-controller-thread/">Hexbus colour video interface</a>, in practice more like a serial terminal that accepts commands from the CC-40 and draws a screen with its own internal 9918 (actually a 9118, which is functionally equivalent). The also-unreleased Editor/Assembler cartridge can control this interface for full-screen editing. Without a viable mass storage option, however, there didn't seem much point in releasing either one.

        Meanwhile, TI had always intended to produce the CC-40 in different configurations, sort of a further expansion of the ALC family. In memory configurations alone TI envisioned five buckets at 2K, 4K, 6K, 10K and 18K (and these even appear in the user's guide), but eventually only publicly produced the 6K and top-spec 18K models. The 18K's arrival was tardy and it received little fanfare and even less mention in the press.

        It surely didn't help that the only indication it had <em>three times</em> the base model's memory were two grotty fluorescent green "18K" stickers, like you'd find on a cheapo semi-gold earring stud, and which have peeled off most units since. This is my NOS 18K showing everything that came in the box with every CC-40, including a keyboard overlay (installed), READ THIS FIRST! card, quick reference card, user's guide (with wafertape warning), and a set of AA batteries. Nowhere else is its expanded capacity mentioned.

        You couldn't even tell from the bottom of the unit; the model numbers (both "CC 40") are exactly the same, and the serial number and date code on this 18K (lower left) are #A000685 and ATA3483, manufactured nearly simultaneously with my usual 6K. On the one hand, the 18K variant was definitely worth getting if you needed the memory: not only did it have more at baseline, but unlike the 6K unit its BASIC could also use the entirety of the 8K and 16K cartridges for up to 34K RAM total. On the other hand, it was obviously impossible to store all 18K in an 8K Constant Memory cartridge, it was never available in large numbers, and most people at the time didn't even seem to know it existed. Despite being brought in at the same $249.95 price point or less to flog sales, it made little impact.

        The reason TI figured they could churn out a whole bunch of configurations is because internally the CC-40 is very simple, just a handful of chips and through-hole discrete components on two PCBs. Here I'm showing the main CPU board so I don't have to play 69-key pickup with the keyboard/LCD board beneath it. That board is even simpler with just a bog-standard Hitachi HD44780 LCD driver/controller supplemented by an HD44100 LCD driver to handle the additional display segments. The character segments are divided roughly into quarters with the HD44780 handling the common lines and first and third quarters and the HD44100 handling the second and fourth, plus the display indicators.

        Orienting the battery compartment to the bottom, the topmost three chips here are the RAM. In the base model these are three 2K 6116 static RAM chips, yielding an unusual total of 6K. However, notice that the two at the top of this picture sit on pads bigger than they are and the one below them does not, plus wire jumpers just above the 5.000MHz crystal oscillator. We'll come back to those items in a moment. The power and reset circuitry is on the left side set off by a weird little plastic sleeve containing a bridging resistor.

        Zooming in a little, we see the two primary chips, the CPU (the DIP on the lower right) and the control ASIC (the QFP). The ASIC was fabbed by American Microsystems (AMI, later AMI Semiconductor, and subsequently acquired by onsemi in 2008) and acts as a "Grand Central" address decoder for the LCD, piezo beeper, internal ROM, cartridge ROM and RAM. It also handles the Hexbus lines and uses the crystal for its own clock source which it additionally passes through to the CPU.
        <p>
        The CPU is a TMS70C20 and indeed a CMOS version of the 8-bit TMS7000 microcontroller we discussed earlier, with the "2" indicating a built-in 2K of mask ROM (the version of the mask ROM is C11002, "C" meaning standard microcode), and a date code of 10th week 1983. The full model designation of "TMX70C20N2L" is interesting for several reasons: "TMX" indicates the earliest stage of production device where the die may not be fully developed (versus the TMP "prototype" where it is, and the TMS "sale" version designation is fully qualified for production), and the "N2" is a 70mil (0.07" or 1.78mm)-spaced DIP as opposed to the more typical "N" which is a 100mil (0.1" or 2.54mm)-spaced DIP, both rated for operation in typical temperature ranges ("L"). It divides down the 5MHz signal from the ASIC to yield its nominal clock speed of 2.5MHz, and has a 16-bit address bus for a maximum 64K addressing space.

        TI fabbed the TMS7000 family using what it called "Strip Chip Architecture Topology." Setting out explicitly to make an easily reconfigurable design, TI stepped away from more parsimonious layouts like the 6502's and platted out its logic in quadrilateral functional blocks it termed "strips." Unlike those earlier designs, and unlike later multi-chip modules using multiple dies, these blocks could be connected with a minimum of additional logic and then promptly unified on a single die for fabrication. One strip included the timer, I/O control, interrupts, on-chip registers and ALU; another held the microcode and PLA for instruction decoding; another held the onboard ROM; another the onboard RAM, and so forth.

        You can see one result in the die picture on the front of TI's product circular. The large strips for the microcode and onboard ROM are easily distinguished (the "darker" strips along the left and centre) as is the on-board RAM (the patterned strip along the right). The ALU/registers/etc. strip is between the two ROMs, and the remainder is smaller functional blocks and glue circuitry. Like the TMS1000 it was intended to succeed, TMS7000s shipped from the factory with optional mask ROM (2K in the TMS702x/C2x, 4K in the TMS704x/C4x and 12K in the TMS70120) and optional custom instruction microcode ("L" series mask ROM designators). To make a different chip, say, with more ROM or a different instruction decoder, a different strip was loaded to replace it &mdash; potentially even a different <em>sized</em> strip &mdash; while the others could remain the same. (TI's brochure even brags that the 7040 was created from the 7020 without redesigning the chip: the "design was separated at the memory border and the additional 2K of memory simply inserted alongside the original 2K of memory by the design computer.") The baseline TMS7000 had no ROM, but the development SE70P16x chips carried a socket on top for piggybacking an EPROM (or you could use the TMS7742 which had an EPROM of its own inside), configurations also offered by other microcontroller manufacturers of the period. TI reserved the first six bytes of the ROM for internal purposes. It is possible to <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/345057-tms7000-onboard-rom-dumping-project/">dump and save the contents of the internal ROM</a>.
        <p>
        Like the Intel 8051 and Motorola 6801, with which it was intended to directly compete, the TMS7000 family included onboard RAM and I/O standard. The 70x0 and 70Cx0 chips accepted up to a 5MHz clock source (divided by two or four) and provided 128 bytes of onboard RAM, a single 13-bit timer and 16, 8 and 8 (respectively) bidirectional, input and output I/O lines. In the CC-40, those I/O lines are mostly dedicated to the keyboard and memory addressing. The higher grade 70x2 and 70Cx2 chips accepted up to an 8MHz clock source and provided 256 bytes of onboard RAM, two 13-bit and one 10-bit timers, an on-chip serial port and 22, 2 and 8 bidrectional, input and output I/O lines. On the other hand, the TMS7000 was more like the 6801 in that it was a Von Neumann architecture and incorporated the on-chip features as memory-mapped I/O. 10MHz crystals were later supported, though these were still divided down for the internal clock.
        <p>
        The TMS7000 turned out to be a very bright spot for TI; it was substantially faster than the 8051 at most operations and quicker than even an equivalently clocked 6801 or Zilog Z8. I'll have more to say about the CPU when we get to actually writing assembly code for it.

        Here is the ROM (apart from what's in the 70C20) and the other two RAM chips. This external 32K 61256 ROM stores BASIC and higher level portions of the operating system, while the lowest level portions are within the CPU's mask ROM strip. Since 32K would consume half the CPU's addressing space, it is instead banked in using 8K segments (more on that later). Either way that gets you your 34K total of ROM, and in the mildly mendacious world of TI six plus thirty-four equals forty, so that's the CC-40.
        <p>
        The lower of the two RAM chips has no extra pads. This is in fact the original 2K configuration and what would have been present on any CC-40 variant. This lowest 2K is reserved by the system and not available for BASIC programs in any CC-40 configuration, but can be used by machine language programs and is legitimately addressable RAM.

        For the other configurations we crack open the 18K version. The jumper wires I pointed out have moved, and the two upper 2K 6116 RAM chips have been replaced with 8K 6264s (2 + 8 + 8 = 18) which use the extra pads for their additional addressing lines. With this basic template in mind, the other configurations would probably have been no additional chips (2K), two 1K chips (4K), and two 4K chips (10K). It wasn't long before existing CC-40 owners discovered they could do such an upgrade themselves, to TI's great chagrin, even though this would clearly void the warranty.

        One other notable landmark on the board is this bundle of resistors sprouting from a blob of solder connected to the ground plane. These are pull-downs for the Hexbus lines.
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJ1Jdab29r1L3LtdrcWghTbWyPExHMNd6EfH3tO2KYvAK9EyovtLZ4h3cIM2pJcYu1DhNnhh9duRciKgUtNPvD12l0kndMuQS8eYTfEq6dcyoLfWUq4IBxCYclT8dlgKFxPLmCeq2TqPs8ugw1WduzUv9dUENNU06uCESS_Nm7IQ1yozc9_0nJoQYSgsk/s4080/PXL_20251106_060000545.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJ1Jdab29r1L3LtdrcWghTbWyPExHMNd6EfH3tO2KYvAK9EyovtLZ4h3cIM2pJcYu1DhNnhh9duRciKgUtNPvD12l0kndMuQS8eYTfEq6dcyoLfWUq4IBxCYclT8dlgKFxPLmCeq2TqPs8ugw1WduzUv9dUENNU06uCESS_Nm7IQ1yozc9_0nJoQYSgsk/s320/PXL_20251106_060000545.jpg"/></a></div>
        
        The peripherals necessarily also have their own CPUs, mostly TMS70C20s as well, such as the RS-232 box's board shown here. This is also a 70C20N2L with the narrower pin spacing and has a ROM code of C14018 with a date code of 10th week 1983. It runs slightly slower at 2MHz from a 4MHz crystal, but instead of bitbanging the serial port it has a real 6551 ACIA made by Synertek with a date code of 19th week 1983. The ACIA has its own 1.8432MHz crystal. A set of headers above the CPU allows the installation of an optional parallel port.
        <p>
        The other notable chip on this board is directly above the SY6551, a 22-pin TI 1052911 manufactured 18th week 1983. This is the Intelligent Peripheral Bus Controller (IBC for short), managing the Hexbus lines for the CPU instead of requiring additional bitbanging, and generating an interrupt when data is available. In later devices it is superseded by the 28-pin TP0370. Everything else is off-the-shelf. We'll have more to say about the RS-232 box when we get to discussing Hexbus communication options in detail.
        <p>
        The lack of a viable mass-storage option severely damaged TI's attempts to portray the CC-40 as a useful portable computer. Consequently (and ironically), many owners tended to treat it as an overgrown programmable calculator instead, a task at which it nevertheless excelled in part due to its higher-precision base 100 BCD floating point and polynomial transcendentals, as well as the software on the limited selection of Solid State Cartridges which (although expensive and few in number) were generally high quality. On top of that, it was also substantially faster than TI's other programmable calculators and was of course capable of more sophisticated algorithms. Some users were able to source remaindered wafertape drives through unofficial channels but a third-party Hexbus storage device, the Mechatronics QD-01 Quickdisk using an unusual 2.8" medium, did not become widely available until 1986. Meanwhile, the consumer products division, now under half a billion dollars in cumulative debt from their ruinous price war with Commodore Business Machines, threw in the towel and announced on October 28, 1983 that they were abandoning the home computer market. The 99/8, all but cut from life support already, was officially canned earlier in October<!-- NYT 1983-10-29 --> after about 150 had been made;<!-- https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/was-the-hex-bus-interface-vaporware.70933/ plus NYT 1983-10-29 --> production also immediately ceased for the 99/4A, after which it was heavily discounted<!-- Employee price list for 2/84 shows 99/4A as discontinued --> and the remaining stock liquidated in March 1984.

        Once again, however, the CC-40 temporarily avoided this fate because TI continued to sell and market it as a business product, just like the TI Professional PC, which TI claimed was still doing well. By early 1984 the 6K CC-40 had dropped below $200 at retail, although the 18K version was all but nonexistent in sales channels.<!-- Computers and Electronics 2/84 p88 --> TI's later CC-40 marketing materials, such as the 1984 flyer here that oddly still used a photograph of the drop-in-cartridge prototype, further emphasized its suitability for custom business environments while adding they could convert your software into cartridges for "instant plug-in customization." Some companies actually sold <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/320064-cc-40-derivatives-third-party/">rebadged CC-40s</a> with such custom cartridges installed, though none of these variants were ever very numerous, and all were OEMed by TI. The modem finally appeared on this flyer as an option but naturally not the wafertape, which was by then a distant memory.
        <p>
        <h3>The TI-74 BASICALC</h3>
        <p>
        In the meantime TI nevertheless worked on two direct follow-ons to the CC-40. One was the final embodiment of the RM 3000/ALC-C concept, incorporating a larger 40-character by 6-line LCD with a proper full size-and-travel keyboard intended to compete with the TRS-80 Model 100. Since the CC-40 now shipped in an 18K configuration, the so-called Compact Computer 70 ("CC-70") would likely have shipped with even more memory than the 8K of the original ALC-C. We'll never know, unfortunately, because the only known example is <a href="http://www.datamath.org/Graphing/CC-70P.htm">an empty mockup shell</a>, reportedly because the first batch of gate array chips for the prototype were defective.
        <p>
        The other was an expanded CC-40 based generally on the same hardware called the <a href="https://oldcomputers.net/cc-40.html">CC-40 Plus</a> ("CC-40+"), internally model "CC40001". Externally similar, and still nominally a 6K unit (though an 18K version was planned), its biggest upgrade was a new built-in 9-pin port to finally support loading and saving to cassette tape. Although implemented as an internal peripheral with its own notional Hexbus device number (device 1, replacing the wafertape drive, though properly in the range designated for cassette devices), there is specific support and prompts in the CC-40+ ROM for driving it and the cable cannot be retrofitted to an original CC-40. To accommodate these and other possible changes the on-chip system ROM was expanded to 4K and thus was introduced the TMS70C40 to the CC-40 family.
        <p>
        The CC-40 Plus got as far as prototyping and a small number of test machines were produced before it, what then existed of the CC-70, and the CC-40 itself were all quietly cancelled in November 1984.<!-- TIPPC Notes 1983 1984.pdf --> No explanation could be publicly ascertained &mdash; until late in 1985, when a new device emerged from a different branch of the consumer products division.

        Amidst the turmoil on the computer side of the business, TI's chip business was still doing well, and so were its calculators, still a solid product line since the 1970s. Why continue to fight in the business portables segment, reasoned management, when we can rework the already existing, already working CC-40 Plus into something appropriate for its size <em>that we already know how to sell</em>? And that was the TI-74 BASICALC, a new higher-end programmable calculator that was nothing less than the CC-40 Plus in a sleeker, smaller package, hitting markets in the summer of 1986<!-- TIPPC 1986 p5--> at an MSRP of $135 [about $400 in 2025 dollars].

        The TI-74's marketing strongly emphasized its BASIC programmability, using this feature to set it apart from other calculators which were still largely programmed with some form of keystroke system. But all that came from the CC-40+, as did the 31-character screen (slightly smaller) and most of the same basic functions. Although the debugger in the CC-40 and CC-40 Plus was liquidated in the TI-74 to fit in its Algebraic Operating System (AOS) calculator mode, and the memory map was slightly altered and some BASIC functions removed, it was otherwise pretty much the same machine with 2K extra RAM in a more consumer friendly &mdash; and pocketable &mdash; form. This is one of my two units with its box and the printer accessory.
        <p>
        Although the TI-74 was introduced shortly before the high-end $200 TI-95 PROCALC in 1986, the PROCALC is nearly the same hardware, just with the 31-character display divided into two lines (one 16-character general line and five three-character function key descriptions on the second). It can accept the same peripherals and much of what I'll talk about in this history section applies to it, but it is not programmable in BASIC and is closer in feel and operation to the earlier TI-59 which it was positioned to succeed. While it is legitimately a member of the CC-40 family, I won't talk a great deal more about it in this specific article.

        Unlike the CC-40, the TI-74 comes with its own clamshell hard case, and it uses 4 AAAs instead of AAs to make it even lighter. This one is serial #0001989 with a manufacture date of May 1987 (I-0587).

        The TI-74 has only two ports. Like the CC-40 there is a cartridge slot, and like the CC-40 it can take ROM programs on cartridge as well as RAM expanders, though CC-40 ROMs don't work as is on the TI-74. Instead of the sliding top to expose the CC-40 cartridge's card edge, however, the male card edge is hidden in the cartridge slot and the cartridge actually has a female connector. Cartridges can be inserted and removed while the TI-74 is in the hard case (with the lid open).

        The other port is a 10-pin (instead of 8-pin) I/O connector that the manual calls "Dockbus." Once the TI-74's provenance was discovered, however, word quickly got around the CC-40/TI-74 community that Dockbus ... is just Hexbus with some extra pins, meaning existing Hexbus devices can be connected to the TI-74 with a simple passive converter. 
        <p>
        The trick here is that two of the Dockbus lines are for power, both for the TI-74 to power connected peripherals and for a common supply <em>from</em> a peripheral to power the TI-74. Like <a href="/2024/09/programming-convergent-workslates.html">the Convergent WorkSlate</a>, which had a similar feature, these pins allow peripherals to share power with the computer. They obviously should not be connected to a CC-40 Hexbus device, nor the Dockbus-specific reset line. TI wisely keyed this connector to avoid letting out any magic smoke.
        <p>
        Dockbus also has a little known "user mode" where, with two control lines placed in a recognized unusual configuration, an application can drive the four data lines directly to a device that knows how to communicate in this mode. As a consequence of the specification, compliant legacy Hexbus devices on the bus will ignore bus traffic when this mode is active. Dockbus user mode avoids nearly all of the Hexbus packet overhead and allows real-time signaling, but necessarily completely monopolizes the bus, and isn't supported by any of the classic Hexbus peripherals.

        As an example, the PC-324 Dockbus thermal printer shown here (device 12) has a port for an AC adapter &mdash; which is just our old friend the AC 9201. When AC adapter is connected to the printer, and the printer is connected to the TI-74, then the adapter can power the printer and the printer can power the computer as well (so TI eliminated the AC adapter port on the TI-74). The printer is also capable of running on its own set of AA batteries.

        A reduced family of peripherals were offered for the TI-74. The PC-324 printer was now the star of the show, to which the CI-7 cassette interface could also connect for power (or directly to the TI-74), and both devices would also work with the TI-95. The CI-7 actually relies on the non-standard Dockbus "user mode" and thus won't work with the CC-40.
        <p>
        In the initial rollout the PC-324 and CI-7 were the only two peripherals; there was never an RS-232 option. The TI-74 also had its own improved version of the 8K Constant Memory battery-backed RAM cartridge (there was likewise no 16K version, and a 32K version was never released). The ROM usefully added support directly to BASIC for saving but also <em>swapping</em> RAM with the cartridge, and although it still carried its own backup lithium cell, as long as it was plugged in this cartridge could also draw power from the TI-74's batteries to avoid draining the lithium battery &mdash; even if the calculator was turned off. Finally, some of the CC-40's software packages were upgraded and ported to the TI-74, here initially the Statistics, Mathematics and Pascal cartridges, and later Finance and a BASICALC-specific Chemical Engineering cartridge. Some of these packages were also ported to the TI-95.
        <p>
        In 1989 TI introduced a new Dockbus peripheral for the TI-74 and TI-95, the PC-IF PC Interface. This device could connect to a DOS-based server on a standard PC via the PC's parallel port and exchange files with it for much faster performance than tape. It could also use the PC as a display terminal through the same server program, eliminating the need for the Hexbus video box. The PC-IF became a very popular accessory and the general concept has been expanded, <a href="http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiif">culminating in today's TIIF2</a>, though sadly the software is not open-source.

        Finally, we'll crack it open to find the internals have become even more consolidated. The keyboard/LCD board is beneath this CPU board as before, but the CPU is now a 70C46 (ROM code C70009, here with a date code indicating 14th week 1986) and the functions of the CC-40's ASIC were built-in to the 70C46 except for the piezo beeper, which was removed. The CPU is slightly downclocked from the CC-40's 70C20, using a 4MHz crystal divided down for a clock speed of 2.0MHz, likely to save battery power given the smaller-capacity AAAs. Otherwise, there is a single HM6264 static RAM to provide 8K, and the 32K HN61256 system ROM. Apart from the usual HD44780/44100 combo driving the LCD, the custom CPU handles everything else, even the Dockbus.

        The TI-74 (and TI-95) turned out to be very long-lived members of TI's calculator line and at least two updated versions of the TI-74 exist, confusingly named the TI-74S and the TI-74 S (note space between 74 and S). The S variants are application-specific TI-74s intended to be used with custom cartridges which can be field-programmed with an adapter and some even UV-erased. The original TI-74 is limited to a total of 16K between the on-board memory and cartridge memory, even if the RAM cartridge is larger than 8K; TI updated the TI-74S firmware to autorun an attached cartridge and to support up to 16K additional memory to BASIC (for 24K).<!--https://forums.atariage.com/topic/354313-ti-74-74s-custom-rom-development-and-deployment/--> In 1988<!-- https://forums.atariage.com/topic/364366-ti-74-ram-cartridges/page/4/--> TI updated the TI-74S ROMs to support 32K RAM cartridges for a maximum total in BASIC of 40K, yielding the TI-74 S with a space. These later units can also be distinguished by their manufacturing dates, and since the change to maximum RAM is in software, it is possible to patch earlier units with a small assembly routine or replace their ROMs to do the same.
        <p>
        The TI-74 family remained available well into the early 1990s until it was discontinued around 1992, marking the end of the CC-40 and its descendants, and the end of our history. All that was to get you the context to understand the similarities and the differences between these machines, which will become very important a little later on. Let's get our CC-40 and TI-74 communicating with the outside world, and to do that we should start with the peripherals &mdash; old and new.

        During the CC-40's days on the market, officially there were exactly two Hexbus peripheral options to allow it access to the outside world: the HX-3000 RS-232 box and the HX-3100 300bps modem. The RS-232 box could of course be connected to a separate external modem, but the Hexbus modem itself did not require the RS-232 box to function.

        The RS-232 box, on top, has a female DB-25 port, AC adapter port (again using the AC 9201) and twin Hexbus ports for daisy-chaining. As I mentioned earlier when we looked at its innards, the deluxe HX-3000/P version has a ribbon cable sticking out the back with a DB-25 parallel port. This passive cable goes to a set of pin headers inside and can be secondarily added. While hardly any modern computers come with real serial ports anymore, let alone DB-25s, a "DB-9" (DE-9) female to DB-25 male converter cable like the StarTech AT925FM will give you a port that most USB serial adapters will directly connect to.
        <p>
        The modem, on the bottom, has a telephone connection switch, RJ-11 phone jacks (one for your line, one for your handset, since the modem can't dial), and also a set of Hexbus ports. The connection switch is not for answer/originate, as is typical with many non-Hayes 300bps modems where <a href="/2025/01/the-35-cent-commodore-64-softmodem.html">the right modulation</a> had to be manually selected; rather, this switch is for whether the modem is listening to the line. To make a call, a user would set the switch to OFF, manually dial the remote system with their telephone handset, wait for the answer tone, and then flip the switch to ON.

        Despite this, however, the modem is still an intelligent device &mdash; just not with AT commands. My unit here appears to be an early production device and has what looks like a pre-production CPU marked "11006." This is in fact a TMS70C20A2NL, a revised but functionally equivalent version of the TMS70C20, downclocked to a slower 1.536MHz speed from a 3.072MHz crystal. Settings like answer/originate are controlled in software, which the CPU uses to configure the TMS99532 next to it, basically a 300bps Bell 103 modem on a chip. This chip uses a 4.032MHz crystal. The only other major IC is of course another 1052911 handling Hexbus traffic.

        In fact, this particular HX-3100 modem is early enough that it lacks a bottom label, having only a serial number (#0000319) and manufacturing date (34th week 1983). But the biggest difference from the RS-232 box (serial #0001962, produced 49th week 1983) is that the modem can run on AC <em>or</em> batteries: the TMS99532 pulls less juice than the 6551 ACIA and the modem's CPU runs at a slower clock speed, so unlike the RS-232 unit the modem can be truly portable. On the other hand, the RS-232 box would have most likely been connected to devices that weren't battery-powered either, so this isn't really a major flaw.
        <p>
        We won't talk further about the modem here, though it's certainly better than nothing, and since it doesn't require a dial tone you can have it manually answer any other compatible 300bps modem to exchange data using just an RJ-11 phone cord (<a href="/2025/01/the-35-cent-commodore-64-softmodem.html">your Commodore 64 can send data to it</a>, for example). However, the RS-232 unit is capable of running up to 19.2kbps thanks to its onboard ACIA, a very impressive speed for the time particularly with this class of computer, and far faster than the modem. We will be treating it as our gold standard device for comparison purposes.
        <p>
        Unfortunately, both the modem and the RS-232 box have the same problem: ain't nobody making them.

        Fortunately, the hobbyist community has since filled the gap and nowadays we have two main choices for Hexbus serial. While neither is perfect, both will work for the specific purposes in this article, though each has strengths over the other in various respects. Both connect to a host over USB using common serial drivers and can be bus-powered.
        <p>
        On the left is the original, <a href="https://github.com/go4retro/HEXTIr">Jim Brain's HEXTIr</a>. This is an Arduino-based device implementing a serial printer port (device 10), RS-232 port (device 20), SD card reader for loads and saves (device 100) and a battery-backed real-time clock (device 230). It is open-source hardware and firmware and yours truly has contributed improvements in the past which are now part of the current firmware package. Because it is an open-source unit, it is occasionally offered for sale in small quantities by various third parties and this was one of those that I bought some years ago; it came with a separate 3-D printed enclosure.
        <p>
        On the right is a newer entry, the <a href="https://www.soigeneris.com/ti-hexbus-serial-usb-adapter">the TI Hexbus Serial USB Adapter</a> by StarDust and sold by Jeff Birt/Soigeneris, which I'll refer to as the "StarDust adapter." It offers two serial ports, one with an on-board DB-25 and the other via USB (devices 27 and 26, respectively), and has multiple Hexbus connectors and a Dockbus connector. It is not an open-source design (I've asked), but is sold and supported as a commercial product, and comes to you fully assembled with an enclosure of its own and ready to use. This device is particularly unique in that it has a basic configuration interface accessible as device 200, plus a simple console shell on either serial port. However, although it can also load and save files, this functionality requires a additional BackPack drive be connected to the DB-25 (as device 100) which is sold separately and requires its own battery.

        Externally, the biggest difference is the connectors. Besides the USB-B jack, barrel power jack and SD card slot, the HEXTIr has a real male Hexbus port that you connect standard female-female Hexbus cables to. Depending on who made it (you?), this port may be unkeyed, so I wrote the orientation on the bottom in silver Sharpie ink. If you don't have Hexbus cables (whereas I have several, including a nice generous long one perfect for this purpose), you could probably just use a bundle of jumper wires, though this might be inconvenient on the CC-40's end.
        <p>
        The StarDust adapter goes a different way, besides using a micro-B USB jack: it uses 8-pin IDC connectors which are much more widely available, and it provides two of them allowing multiple devices to be connected. Soigeneris sells you cables to connect to these along with the necessary adapters. You'll need some to connect it to a CC-40, but the StarDust adapter is best paired with the TI-74 because it has built-in Dockbus and plugs directly into the port &mdash; it can even draw power from the Dockbus (switchable) if not connected to a USB source. If you don't need to connect to anything else, it can go right into a TI-74 and offer basic functionality straight from the shipping envelope.

        Internally this particular HEXTIr is based on a clone Arduino Uno R3, though the firmware can run on anything Arduino-like with an ATmega328 or 328P. Here the SD card, Hexbus port and RTC are provided by a modified Arduino Logging Shield with some extra wires and pin-headers soldered on; no additional parts are required. If you simply want to use it as an SD card drive, the barrel jack can provide power, or you can connect the USB to a regular USB charger. You can also <a href="https://github.com/go4retro/HEXTIr/tree/master/pcb">fabricate your own PCB</a>.

        Interestingly, the StarDust adapter is also AVR-based, in this case a Microchip AVR64DD32. It comes on a custom PCB with various jumpers, the micro USB-B port, the two 8-pin IDC ports and the female DB-25, with the Dockbus connector on the reverse. In both the HEXTIr and the StarDust adapter the Hexbus-serial link is bitbanged by the AVR, which has some consequences we'll run into when it comes to throughput.

        Since I of course have plenty of real Hexbus cables, the HEXTIr is the most convenient to attach to the CC-40, though I'll come back to the StarDust adapter when we get to messing with the TI-74. Here I connect it to my M1 MacBook Air with a USB-A to USB-C converter for the serial link and power. The CC-40 is being run on a power adapter.
        <p>
        When bringing up the CC-40 (or TI-74), if you have the Hexbus connected but the device on the other end isn't powered on, the computer will show its I/O indicator on screen and then stall out. Instead, both the HEXTIr and StarDust adapter will immediately power up when connected to USB, and then the computer can be turned on after that.

        Now that we've met the hardware options, let's meet (one of) the software options. The CC-40 has a terminal program available on cartridge in combination with a simple word processor called Memo Processor. In my opinion this is one of the CC-40's truly essential cartridges and it (or a multicart) is usually plugged into mine. Document text is stored in the BASIC program space, so make sure you've saved any program you were working on &mdash; say, to the HEXTIr's SD card &mdash; before starting the cartridge.
        <p>
        The key combinations for the Memo Processor are a bit arcane, but fortunately it comes with a nice spiral-bound manual (with the inevitable "The Wafertape&trade; Digital Tape Drive is not available" insert) and two keyboard overlays we can place over the main keyboard and numeric keypad to help us. This overlay also tells us what the LCD indicator marks are meant to designate. The cartridge has a single program on it called <tt>MP</tt>, so we enter (as the overlay hints us) <tt>RUN"MP"</tt> to start it up.

        Memo Processor ("MP") was written by a third-party, Telos Software Products, and sold by Texas Instruments under license. Telos Corporation was founded in Santa Monica, California in 1968<!-- SEC 10-K 1996, incorporated Maryland 1971 SOS D00383075 --> initially as a federal systems integrator that did contract development for military and space applications; perhaps their most famous work during this time was as part of the NASA Voyager 1 team, working on the real-time telemetry and image processing systems used in the space probe's 1979 Jupiter and Saturn fly-bys. Voyager 1 is now the most distant man-made object from Earth, over 15.8 billion miles from home as of November 2025, and as of this writing valiantly continues its extended interstellar mission.
        <p>
        With the advent of the microcomputer, even though a substantial percentage of its business remained government customers, Telos management started to steer the product line  towards personal computing in the early 1980s as a means of diversification. These initiatives were consolidated under two 1983 subsidiaries, Telos Computing and Telos Software Products,<!-- Maryland SOS F01559376, CA SOS --> with the latter developing Memo Processor for TI. However, Telos Software Products became much better known for Filevision, a 1984 product for the then-new Apple Macintosh that presented a graphical means of designing databases by linking on-screen graphic objects with data stores. It sold briskly to rave reviews and in 1985 users were creating applications for it as diverse as airport layouts and airline routes, rabbit farm management, and the state of bills in the Florida legislature &mdash; all real entries in that year's contest. Filevision subsequently evolved into a larger version in 1986 called Business Filevision, but HyperCard became seen as a superior means for constructing such interfaces after it emerged in 1987 and gradually displaced it. Although the Software Products subsidiary was ultimately dissolved in 2002, its parent Telos Corporation remains in business today (presently in Ashburn, Virginia) and still primarily as a vendor to government entities, but now with an <a href="https://www.telos.com/company/history/">emphasis on cybersecurity</a>.

        ... by default into the Word Processor mode, which is a line-oriented text editor. Many CC-40 owners used it for writing documents of non-trivial size and sending it to a larger computer via the serial port, though <a href="https://ftp.whtech.com/hexbus_cc40_ti74/cc40%20ti74%20hexbus.txt">a subtle bug</a> can cause data loss for documents with unusual total lengths when the machine is powered off, even if batteries or an AC adapter are used. It supports lines up to 80 characters and could print directly. The manual gives you a very precise formula for computing available space, indicating the 6K CC-40 could contain 3,071 bytes for a document and the 18K could have 15,359 (though note that TAB characters take up three bytes and everything else just one). This is still a substantial available portion of the internal RAM, so maybe TI was onto something counting ROM as "memory" even though I hate it. A document can be sent over the serial port, and activity from the serial port can be recorded into a new document.

        The MP has many key combinations. Key combinations can be entered either by holding down the modifier and pressing the key(s), or pressing the modifier once (the appropriate indicator will appear) and then pressing the key. The obvious ones are with SHIFT (highlighted in blue) and "CTL" (highlighted in maroon), but all the mode shifts are done with the FN key (highlighted in dark grey). Here we'll press FN-O (not zero) for the communication options page to make sure we are configured correctly. The settings page is only available while a connection is <em>not</em> in progress, or otherwise you must "hang up" with FN-/ (forward slash).

        The communication options page lets you set the Hexbus device (supported 20-27 or 70-77 for the RS-232 and modem ranges), baud rate (officially 110 or 300), data bits (7 or 8), parity (N/S/M/O/E), check parity, duplex and stop bits (1 or 2). Despite allowing the modem range, however, the MP actually predates the HX-3100 modem and it appears nowhere in the manual (only modems attached to the RS-232 box).
        <p>
        From the keyboard overlay you'd get the idea that these are the only settings allowed, but in fact there is a hidden advanced settings page only mentioned parenthetically in the manual. When asked for the device number (i.e., at this prompt in the communications settings), press FN-Q instead, and you get a different prompt.

        On this somewhat super s3kr1t screen you can enter an entire device configuration string, the same as you'd use with a BASIC <tt>OPEN</tt> statement. You could set, for example, the HX-3100's answer/originate switch this way (which isn't part of the options page), but more relevantly to us you can set other bitrates. This is how we can hook up an HX-3000 RS-232 box and run it at its full 19200bps &mdash; such as, in this picture, over a USB-serial adapter to the M1 MacBook Air. FN-Q also works for printer settings and is in fact required for early versions of the printer/plotter (change <tt>R=N</tt> to <tt>C=N</tt>).
        <p>
        I mentioned that the two modern devices both have throughput considerations. If you have a StarDust adapter, you may occasionally drop characters unless you move its console to the serial port you're not using (e.g., if you're connected over USB, <tt>set console serial</tt>), and all but the most recent firmware doesn't work right with the default 300bps. However, once the console is redirected it seems to run fine at 19200bps with the same settings as the HX-3000, using either device 26 or 27. (This is not true for the TI-74, but I'll get to that later.)
        <p>
        The HEXTIr's firmware, on the other hand, has a very small receive buffer and to date I have not had success fixing this. While it might be better with a later CPU, this Uno R3 can only reliably work asynchronously at 300bps, and in that case the MP's default settings are best.

        And here we are, connected to the world (the other end is <tt>picocom</tt> on the M1 MBA). In the manual, this mode is specifically advertised for contemporary time-sharing systems such as CompuServe and in particular TCA's <a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">The Source</a>, running on Dialcom Prime minicomputers and accessed via the Telenet nationwide packet-switched network. Both of these services provided typical features such as stock quotes, headline news, a reference library, shopping and E-mail. The manual also advertises Texas Instruments' own TEXNET (not to be confused with the current State of Texas electronic payment system) operated as an overlay on The Source, providing "1200 services and programs" such as an electronic newsletter, a nationwide listing of TI user groups and service centres, a listing of available software (but for the 99/4A, not the CC-40), and the TI Submit service which "enables TEXNET users to submit software programs electronically to any of TI's software exchanges, including the International 99/4 Users-Group, Inc." TI planned to offer client software that would take advantage of the 99/4A speech synthesizer and its sound and graphics hardware, but this was never realized before the demise of the home computer line. Nevertheless, TI kept TEXNET in operation for several years even through the Reader's Digest buyout of The Source, revamping it in 1984 before decommissioning the service around 1987 due to the dwindling 99/4A user base. CompuServe subsequently bought out and shut down The Source completely in 1989.
        <p>
        In terminal mode the MP presents a 31x1 window on an 80x24 virtual screen, though it implements no particular kind of terminal emulation, and even things like backspace and delete require control-key combinations (CTL-H and CTL-down respectively). XON/XOFF (CTL-S and CTL-Q) pause the display so that you can use the arrow keys to scroll, or FN-up/FN-down to jump to the top or bottom, or page the display with FN-S (FN-A to do so automatically).
        <p>
        The MP behaves very curiously with Hexbus. In TI's original conception of how Hexbus-based systems would communicate over RS-232, everything was synchronous and done in record-based transactions, which fit the Hexbus packet model well. This is typically the way you would drive such devices from BASIC, and all known Hexbus RS-232 devices including the HEXTIr and StarDust support this and (except for the modem) at high speed. However, this type of operation doesn't work effectively at all for <em>asynchronous</em> communications like a dummy terminal, which was exactly the type of service link the MP was intended to support. Although the HX-3000 RS-232 box, and later the HX-3100 modem, are capable of interrupting the main computer when data has arrived &mdash; which should have made connections very fast and seamless &mdash; the problem is that when this happens, the computer only knows that an interrupt has occurred and not what caused it, and as we mentioned earlier is thus obliged to poll any and all enabled devices on the bus to find out. Depending on the configuration, this could be a rather slow process and as a result end up losing data.
        <p>
        So the MP's solution is brute-force: it polls the bus incessantly, asking the selected device over and over if data has arrived and grabbing the response immediately if so. This shows up as the I/O indicator flickering non-stop on the LCD and the amber LED on the modem or RS-232 box remaining lit while on-line. This behaviour solves the data problem, which is the most critical, but at the price of reduced battery life and a lot more inefficient Hexbus traffic. It's also really rough on the HEXTIr and StarDust adapters which must bitbang Hexbus and serial in software at the same time (unlike the HX-3000 with its own dedicated ACIA and bus transceiver). Still, this method is the least unreliable way to run a terminal program the way Hexbus is implemented, at least for the CC-40 family.
        <p>
        Memo Processor suffices for the CC-40 itself, but the TI-74 doesn't have a terminal program of any sort that I know of. TI likely intended the PC-IF to handle this role. That seems unnecessary.
        <p>
        <h3>The first? terminal program for the TI-74 BASICALC</h3>
        <p>
        I'm going to stake a claim to being the author of the first terminal program for the BASICALC, but TI doesn't make it easy. It's just not possible to drive Hexbus at high speeds from BASIC on the CC-40 and this goes double for the TI-74 where the CPU is downclocked, so now we need to turn to assembly language. Let's talk more about the TMS7000 series of processors.

        Typical of early 8-bit architectures, the TMS7000 family has very few canonical registers, although it also notably lacks a typical accumulator. Instead, it uses its internal RAM like a mashup of the 9900/9995 and the Intel 8051: its RAM maps to the lowest page in memory (either $00-$7f or $00-$ff depending on the specific variant) with most instructions referencing them as 128 or 256 individual 8-bit registers (R0-R255) or 64 or 128 16-bit pairs. This is analogous to IRAM in the 8051 or zero page in the 680x/6502, though registers 0 and 1 are also specially aliased to "accumulators" A and B in certain addressing modes, and the instruction set is not highly orthogonal. The internal RAM is also used for the stack, referenced by an 8-bit stack pointer; apart from that, an eight-bit status register and 16-bit program counter are the only other true registers. Unlike the Harvard architecture of the 8051, the 7000 family is von Neumann, so the internal ROM occupies the same address space. In the CC-40 the TMS70C20's internal ROM is 2K, while in the TI-74/95 the TMS70C46's internal ROM is 4K. The TMS7000 family is fundamentally, even aggressively, big-endian and this has consequences we'll discuss shortly.
        <p>
        As with any microcontroller, the chips have substantial built-in I/O facilities realized as timers and ports. These onboard peripherals are handled as memory-mapped I/O from $0100-$01ff as the "peripheral file" and referenced as P0-P255 by specific instructions. Both the CC-40 and TI-74/95 CPUs have a single timer controlled in this range, but the CC-40 TMS70C20 has 32 I/O lines (eight inputs, eight outputs, 16 bidirectional) while the TI-74/95 TMS70C46 has eight more bidirectional lines explicitly dedicated to servicing Dockbus/Hexbus. Because the I/O lines overlap with the address and data lines, some number of them are lost when accessing off-chip resources. In these machines both microcontrollers run in what the data sheet refers to as "full expansion" mode, where external resources (RAM in this case) are available between $0200 and the bottom of internal ROM at the top of the addressing space. Twenty I/O pins are reserved for the multiplexed address and data busses in this mode, leaving eight inputs and four outputs (and the TMS70C46's eight additional bidirectional lines) uncontended, plus the single timer. Four levels, six in certain members, of interrupt priority are available. This range is where the CPU controls the bus, beeper (CC-40 only), battery sense, keyboard and LCD.

        The precedessor TMS1000 family had landed many design wins as an ultra-low-cost microcontroller (<a href="/2023/01/here-be-four-bits-of-dragons-mattel.html">such as in games</a>), shipping close to 100 million units over its lifetime,<!-- 1983 TMS7000 says 80m --> and TI wanted to preserve what it perceived had made it popular. Like the TMS1000, the TMS7000 family is heavily microcoded, and TI specifically advertised (again like the TMS1000) that developers could alter the microcode to best suit their purposes. A manufacturer could submit both their desired microcode and mask ROM contents and get back a big bunch of cheap, capable chips ready to send to the factory. However, also like the TMS1000, few users of the TMS7000 developed their own microcode &mdash; instead, what ended up winning over developers was its price-performance ratio, which turned out to be excellent. Besides efficient bit-test instructions, it also directly supported BCD math (making it useful for calculators and cash registers) and had an extremely fast 8x8 hardware integer multiplier, and its code density allowed ROM usage to be anywhere from 30-45% less. Although its instruction cycle count was no match for non-microcoded processors like the MOS 6502, the TMS7000 made up for this with its flexibility and much faster clock speeds, and most of its putative competition (e.g., the Motorola 6801, Zilog Z8, Intel MCS-51) had the same drawbacks. Combine that with its ready availability in large quantities, and TI had a winner.
        <p>
        As a result, the TMS7000 family was a competitive microcontroller option during the 1980s and even early 1990s, appearing in many diverse applications such as point of sale terminals, handheld games (MAME emulates the Tiger Punch Your Lights Out), peripheral controllers (like the keyboard in the Olivetti M24), pinball machines (the audio controller in <a href="https://www.ipdb.org/search.pl?searchtype=advanced&amp;mfgid=313">68K-based Technoplay pins</a>) and one-armed bandits, or pokies as my wife would call them. In fact, my parents' first burglar alarm was a TMS7000-based system because I remember looking at the circuit board while Dad was installing it and noticing it had a TMS7-something as the CPU (I think a TMS70C20 but that was many years ago and it was ripped out since). This stuck in my memory because as a kid I had recently cracked open my Tomy Tutor and wondered if its TMS9995 was related (they're not).
        <p>
        Indeed, one place the TMS7000 was <em>not</em> found much was in standalone microcomputers. Its instruction set was incompatible with everything else, even TI's other CPU lines, and its advantages in embedded systems didn't really translate to general purpose machines. A rare exception was the French Exelvision EXL 100 and EXELTEL home computers, another competitor for the French <i>Plan Informatique pour Tous</i> ("Computing for All Plan") &mdash; compare with <a href="/2025/06/see-jane-128-by-arktronics-run.html">the Thomson MO5</a> &mdash; that saw limited use in French schools. The use of TI chips in the Exelvision family was largely because Exelvision consisted primarily of former TI employees, and their CPUs are one of the uncommon ones with custom microcode to accelerate their custom VDP. Otherwise, aside from TI's own development SBCs, the closest thing most of us will get to a TMS7000-powered computer are our twin friends here.

        TI provided many development resources for creating TMS7000 systems, including full-blown <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/components/ti/TMS7000/evm/electrickery.nl/">evaluation systems</a> with in-circuit emulation, and much software for writing programs. Since those development systems are rare and the CC-40 Editor/Assembler cartridge was stillborne, many of the tools modern homebrewers use come from TI's own TI-74 SDK (which can be adapted for the CC-40), some of which is proprietary and difficult to find, and others from the TI-74 PC-IF package, which are closed source and must run in MS-DOS but are easier to track down. For expediency I have elected to use one of those tools, though with a little help we won't need to dig out an old PC or shoehorn it into DOSBox.
        <p>
        Due to various implementational choices and the TMS7000's own strong big-endian orientation, one feels like you're coding in a mirror when working with these two machines. The stack is at the bottom of memory and grows up (compare with, say, the Motorola 6800 which is also big-endian but has a 16-bit stack pointer growing down), and instructions referencing a register pair X operate on addresses X-1 (MSB) and X (LSB), not X (MSB) and X+1 (LSB). To save space on loops that must frequently test for equality, the operating system tends to put everything at high addresses working down to low (so testing the end condition just means a decrement and looking at the processor's zero flag). This idiom was specifically catered to in the instruction set and obligatory for achieving the highest code density, so buffers and strings are usually stored in reverse order in memory, and programs are often loaded at the top of a given range.

        For reasons which will become very clear, I found it most straightforward to create the terminal program for the TI-74 on the CC-40 first, and this also gives CC-40 users without the Memo Processor cartridge an alternative as well. In this picture you can see the nest of wires and bus lines on my work table with the HEXTIr and StarDust adapters daisy-chained over Hexbus. Yes, they coexist together just fine since their device numbers largely do not conflict (the HEXTIr's SD card slot is the sole device #100 as there is no BackPack drive connected to the StarDust) and both appear as different serial ports to the MacBook Air.
        <p>
        The CC-40, and subsequently the TI-74 and TI-95, has a very modular operating system. The 2K internal mask ROM in the TMS70C20, which maps to $f800-$ffff, contains the lowest level reset code and system control drivers. However, the 32K BASIC ROM, which contains BASIC and the rest of the OS' higher level calls, is only banked in with 8K blocks (at $d000-$efff). This allows sufficient space for any installed cartridge's ROM or RAM ($5000-$cfff), portions of which can also be banked in and out if needed. The low 2K system RAM appears at $0800, and then BASIC text starts at $1000 up to $1fff (6K) or $4fff (18K); the address range $0200-$07ff is otherwise unpopulated. One of the very important routines in the CC-40's 2K ROM is <tt>CALPAG</tt>, a routine that takes a page number (0-3) in A and routine number in B, banks in the appropriate page, and makes the call. The vast majority of system calls on the CC-40 and TI-74/95 must be called through this routine; even in the 4K mask ROM of the TI-74/95 only a minimum number of system routines are always accessible. Another major routine in high ROM would be <tt>IOS</tt>, used for commanding devices through the I/O subsystem. In our case, this will be our Hexbus serial ports.
        <p>
        Because the TI-74 descends from the CC-40 Plus, substantial portions of the two systems' firmware are not only compatible but practically identical, even down to their usage of internal RAM registers. Most of the same calls also exist on both systems, but the calling <em>convention</em> is where the most critical difference lies. To incorporate cassette support, and later the extra calculator math routines, not even the extra 2K of RAM in the TMS70C40 (on which the TMS70C46 is based, not the TMS70C42) turned out to be enough to accommodate it. TI solved this problem in two ways. The first was to gut the system ROM, tossing out features not deemed germane to its primary purpose as a calculator such as the internal debugger and direct memory access. This, plus convenience, is the main reason we're writing the proof-of-concept on the CC-40 first.
        <p>
        The second way TI squeezed everything in was to change the way routines are called. A <tt>CALPAG</tt>-assisted call on the CC-40 looks something like this (using canonical TI assembler syntax):
        <p>
        <div class="tx"><pre>
            movd %>0036,b
            call >f836
        </pre></div>
        <p>
        or, as I prefer to write it since this is slightly faster and takes up the same number of bytes (seven),
        <p>
        <div class="tx"><pre>
            mov %>00,a
            mov %>36,b
            call >f836
        </pre></div>
        <p>
        both of which will call the <tt>DSPCHR</tt> routine in the BASIC ROM. This routine expects a character in $5c and writes it to the screen in character position $53. (Notice that the 16-bit <tt>movd</tt> is to B, not A, because 16-bit operations work with X-1 as the MSB and X as the LSB.) On the TI-74, the register usage is the same, but the call stanza is markedly shorter:
        <p>
        <div class="tx"><pre>
            trap 20
            byte 18
        </pre></div>
        <p>
        This is just <em>two</em> bytes to make the same call, a savings of 71% (!). The <tt>trap</tt> instruction pushes the program counter like any other subroutine call and pulls the destination address from vectors at $ffd0 (stored, you guessed it, backwards), all in a single byte and in the same cycle count as <tt>call</tt>. Although the <tt>trap</tt> instruction is legal and exists on the TMS70C20 also, TI made the heaviest use of it here, though not all system calls were converted to traps. It is therefore feasible in our cross-assembled source to have assemble-time defines to select either the CC-40 or TI-74 calling convention (such as different macros), yet have most of the core assembler source be otherwise the same. This can be used to build both versions off a single source file and that's exactly what we've done.
        <p>
        To actually run our program, we'll need to get into memory, and we'd prefer not to have to deal with creating a cartridge ROM (perhaps in <a href="/search/label/cc40">a future article</a>) &mdash; ideally it should be something we can type in or load from an SD card or a BackPack drive. Happily, this task is greatly facilitated by the various memory management subprograms in CC-40 BASIC, meaning we can just create a BASIC loader and have it store everything in RAM. TI BASIC in its various forms is unusual for its heavy reliance on subprograms, which are separate modules (usually in a low-level language like assembly or 99/4 GPL, but also supported in CC-40 BASIC with the <tt>SUB</tt> keyword) activated with the <tt>CALL</tt> keyword, like <tt>CALL CHAR</tt> to redefine the shape of a character. (Even Tomy Tutor BASIC has subprograms internally, being descended from TI Extended BASIC, though you can't create more and Tomy wisely eliminated the need for the <tt>CALL</tt> keyword.) CC-40 cartridges can even provide subprograms of their own for immediate use with BASIC.
        <p>
        The relevant subprograms for our task here are <tt>CALL GETMEM</tt>, <tt>POKE</tt> (and if needed <tt>PEEK</tt>), <tt>EXEC</tt> and <tt>RELMEM</tt>. <tt>CALL GETMEM</tt> is basically <tt>malloc()</tt>, accepting a request to reserve a certain amount of bytes of memory and returning the address where it was allocated; <tt>CALL RELMEM</tt> is, analogously, <tt>free()</tt>. Once the memory is reserved, we can <tt>CALL POKE</tt> to populate it, taking advantage of the fact it allows storing multiple values in one statement, and then run the program with <tt>CALL EXEC</tt>. Here's the finished product for the CC-40. It is indeed short enough that you can just key it in, if you want, or you can get <tt>CCATRM.PGM</tt> from <a href="https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm">the Github project</a> and run it from the HEXTIr or BackPack (e.g., <tt>RUN"100.CCATRM.PGM"</tt>).

        This code is generated from the assembled binary with a Perl preprocessor and then tokenized using Texas Instruments' <tt>TIC74.EXE</tt> utility (works for both CC-40 and TI-74), which is available under <tt>Utils/</tt> in the <a href="http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiif">TIIF/TIIF2 archive</a>. Naturally, that's an MS-DOS executable, so to run it as part of the build process we use David Lee's <a href="https://github.com/davidly/ntvdm">NT Virtual DOS Machine</a> as the emulator. To keep it short I've eliminated niceties like the cursor, which isn't strictly needed for navigation on a single-line display, and which also makes it a bit quicker.
        <p>  
        By default the terminal program opens an 300bps, 8N1 connection using device 20, which will work for the HX-3000 and the HEXTIr. If you want to use a different device, change the <tt>20</tt> in line 99 and line 110; if you want to change the baud rate, change the <tt>300</tt> in line 99. This is the same string you would use in, for example, Memo Processor with FN-Q. Here's the StarDust connecting at 19.2kbps:

        This terminal program scrolls horizontally like the MP does, except it keeps no history in memory. For convenience, CLR is mapped to BACKSPACE (^H), ENTER to LF (^J), SHIFT-ENTER to CR (^M) and DEL (SHIFT-back arrow) to DEL (^?), and it will accept either BS or DEL as backspace from the remote system. If you press OFF or BREAK, it exits to BASIC (OFF is a soft-key; it isn't attached to the power circuit). If it beeps at you when you try to send characters, there was an I/O error and you should press OFF and <tt>RUN</tt> the program again to recover (the error message may or may not be displayed by BASIC).
        <p>
        There are a few important things to <a href="https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm/blob/main/asmtrm/asmtrm.a7k">note about our code</a>. Because we have no idea where we will get loaded to, our assembler source must exclusively use relative branches internally (dealing with limited displacements with jump islands), with the only absolute addresses being outside our program to specific registers and ROM calls. This limitation is not necessary with a cartridge. We also reuse some briefly idle portions of BASIC's memory for our own temporary storage, such as keeping both the buffer for Hexbus data and our scrolling screen line in the BASIC input buffer. These are stored (yet again) reversed because TI. To talk to the external device, we create a temporary Peripheral Access Block in the section of internal RAM BASIC itself uses for this purpose. This structure contains addresses for buffers and the Hexbus command bytes, and is passed to <tt>IOS</tt> to send out on the bus and gather a reply. We don't need to do this to initially configure the device, however, because the <tt>OPEN</tt> statement in our BASIC loader will do that for us (channel #1 is otherwise unused). We use the same brute-force method as MP because that's the least bad way to accomplish what we need reliably, though we have slightly less overhead, so we can maintain better data rates.
        <p>
        TI provided their own assembler, but here we use the well-known multi-architecture <a href="http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/">Macroassembler AS</a> which is what I use for most architectures that aren't the 6502 or PowerPC. AS does not accept canonical TI syntax, so specify hex and immediates as you see them in the source file, and be cautious about modification as it will attempt to emit instructions for mnemonics the 70C20 may not support. One glitch, possibly to be fixed in the future, is that <tt>movd #...,b</tt> assembles incorrectly: you need to specify the register by number. (Not much of a loss because <tt>mov #..,a</tt> and <tt>mov #..,b</tt> <em>do</em> work, and together they generate code that is the same size yet slightly faster.)
        <p>
        That's the CC-40 done. Unfortunately, to get this running on the TI-74 requires a bit more work because <tt>CALL GETMEM</tt>, <tt>RELMEM</tt>, <tt>POKE</tt> and <tt>EXEC</tt> are part of the multiple subprograms TI liquidated to get everything to fit. But there's nothing that says you can't store a subprogram in <em>RAM</em>.

        These subprograms would naturally be needed for on-device development purposes, so TI quietly made them available, and nowadays they are also part of <a href="http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiif">the TIIF/TIIF2 package</a>. You can load these files into the TI-74 using TIIF if you have a PC-IF and a Windows PC, but I don't, so I'm going to use the HEXTIr to do so (the BackPack drive will also work). Unzip <tt>TIIF.ZIP</tt> and from <tt>TIIF/Utils/UTIL74/</tt>, copy <tt>EXEC.SUB</tt>, <tt>GETMEM.SUB</tt>, <tt>LOAD.PGM</tt>, <tt>POKE.SUB</tt> and <tt>RELMEM.SUB</tt> to the SD card, then load and run <tt>LOAD.PGM</tt> (e.g., <tt>RUN"100.LOAD.PGM"</tt>).

        Don't bother trying to list <tt>LOAD.PGM</tt> because you can't &mdash; it's not actually a BASIC program. Rather, it's a machine language subroutine that will bootstrap loading new subprograms into memory.

        For each of the four subprograms we need (<tt>EXEC</tt>, <tt>GETMEM</tt>, <tt>POKE</tt> and <tt>RELMEM</tt>), select "L"oad and enter the relevant filename (e.g., <tt>100.EXEC.SUB</tt>). When you're done, select "Q"uit and you will be returned to BASIC.
        <p>
        Next, load the TI-74 version of the terminal program, either by putting <tt>74ATRM.PGM</tt> from <a href="https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm">the Github project</a> on your HEXTIr or BackPack, or keying in the following:

        This version defaults to device 26 (i.e., the StarDust USB port) at 300bps, which with the current firmware is a generally reliable speed. Like with the CC-40 version, you can use a different device number by changing the <tt>26</tt> in lines 99 and 110, and different device settings and bitrates by changing the string in line 99. The slower CPU in the TI-74 is not able to maintain reliable communications at 19.2kbps (since we're brute-forcing the Hexbus link, it's understandable that the maximum data rate would depend on the CPU's clock speed); the TI-74 will throw frequent I/O errors at this speed, sometimes severe enough that it will lock up the StarDust and the machine will need to be powercycled. Doing so won't erase anything in memory, but it's inconvenient. 9600bps is a decent compromise, though even that will still throw an error now and then, so 4800bps or 2400bps might be better and 4800bps is what I use personally.
        <p>
        Once you have things the way you want them, you could consider putting it on a Constant Memory cartridge with a <tt>CALL PUT(1)</tt> so you don't have to keep doing so (and either a <tt>CALL GET(1)</tt> to retrieve it, or <tt>CALL GET(-1)</tt> to swap memory contents). This helpfully stores not only the terminal program but also all the subprograms you have loaded into memory. If you do this, I advise unplugging the cartridge if you won't be using the TI-74 for awhile or if you remove its batteries, because once the main AAAs run down the computer may draw on the lithium cell in the cartridge to keep its own memory contents alive and kill it quicker. Don't ask me how I know this.
        <p>
        There are some minor differences in the TI-74 version. As it has no beeper, if there is an I/O error the terminal program will instead turn on some of the LCD's on-screen indicators in an obviously impossible configuration. Press OFF to exit (as with the CC-40 version), after which more information may be displayed. The key shortcuts are still supported (such as CLR for BS/^H), though note that DEL on the TI-74 is SHIFT-7, and because SHIFT-ENTER is the equals sign the TI-74 version moves CR/^M to the RUN key.
        <p>
        Okay, we now have both the CC-40 and the TI-74 talking to a serial port. What can we do with that? Well, as our last stop, I did promise you Gopherspace, didn't I?
        <p>
        <h3>Finally, of one-line shells and Gopher clients</h3>
        <p>
        And I don't mean a shell or a Gopher client that's a one-liner &mdash; we need to think about how to meaningfully present information formatted for a full-size screen on a single-row, 31-column display. Since we're not running the client on the actual computer itself, this gives us some options for what's effectively server-side rendering, but we're still constrained by the limited amount of text we can display at any one time.
        <p>
        Paging is unavoidable, but because Gopher menus and text documents are line-oriented we can do so line-by-line. Also, since both Memo Processor and our hacky miniterm can scroll the screen, we can use this mechanic for communicating longer continuous lines to the user (the visual effect is even heightened at slower bit rates, which is a helpful side effect). So that we can more efficiently move through a document, we can also allow the user to quickly jump to the next line instead of having to scroll the entirety of a line they might not want to page through. For those sorts of navigational commands we'll just use single keypresses, accepting a text string from the user as necessary.
        <p>
        To hook up our software clients to the serial port, we'll dust off the old <tt>usb2ppp</tt> tool we originally wrote for the <a href="/2023/06/o-brother-geobook-lets-get-thou-back-on.html">Brother GeoBook</a>, but which can actually run any program over a serial port without having to mess with things like <tt>getty</tt> as long as you have appropriate permissions to the device. (Linux people, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udev">check your <tt>udev</tt> rules</a>.) For convenience I have included it in <a href="https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm">the Github project</a> for this article, and it can be compiled on most Un*x-like systems with something approximating <tt>cc -O3 -o usb2ppp usb2ppp.c</tt> (only <tt>termios.h</tt> and the basic standard library are required). Both clients are in the Github project.
        <p>
        I've dubbed the gopher client <a href="https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm/blob/main/golm.pl">the "GOLM" (Gopher One Line Mangler)</a>. It's written in Perl 5 (so there), so you can easily modify it, and it runs under <tt>usb2ppp</tt> with something like (on my MacBook Air) <tt>./usb2ppp /dev/cu.usbserial-110 300 perl golm.pl</tt> which runs it over <tt>/dev/cu.usbserial-110</tt> at 300bps. Since this is the kind of thing you'd really want to see live and in action, here's a short video (YouTube link) with the CC-40 running the HEXTIr at 300bps.
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe class="BLOG_video_class" allowfullscreen="" youtube-src-id="DyJpjf4ux7I" width="320" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyJpjf4ux7I"></iframe></div>
        
        The client has a very basic built-in quick menu when you start it (basically the Floodgap gopher and Veronica-2). You can scroll through lines with the ENTER key, or immediately jump to the next line with the SPACE bar, or move backwards with the CLR [backspace] key. The G key goes to a menu link, the L key opens a new location, the B key goes back in your history (resuming at the same line you left) and the Q key quits. Here, we browse the Floodgap menu, then search Veronica-2 for some hot hot Texas Instruments action (using the CLR [backspace] key to move back up to the menu item we want), and read about it in text. This is all live, on real Gopher servers. There you are &mdash; Gopherspace on a Texas Instruments Compact Computer 40.
        <p>
        I'm pretty patient with my geriatric machines but even considering that I found the interface quite useable even at 300bps. Naturally, when I got it working, I had to see if the idea could work for other things. Is this sort of interface generalizeable? Like, what if we could run a shell prompt this way?
        <p>  
        Well! No need to imagine because <em>of course</em> I decided to write up a proof of concept, just to see. It's in Perl too, named <a href="https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm/blob/main/slosh.pl">the SLOSH ("Single Line Onscreen SHell")</a>, and you can start it with something like <tt>./usb2ppp /dev/cu.usbserial-D3B19P0Y 4800 perl slosh.pl</tt>. Here it is, this time on the TI-74 with the StarDust adapter at 4800bps (also YouTube due to size):
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe class="BLOG_video_class" allowfullscreen="" youtube-src-id="ERTvuwFblhg" width="320" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERTvuwFblhg"></iframe></div>
        
        With a long USB cable (or <a href="/2025/05/what-went-wrong-with-wireless-usb.html">a wireless link</a>, I guess), you could do this kind of thing right from your couch. In this example, I listed out my development directory, tried a few real commands, attempted to vainly browse Google's home page with <tt>curl</tt> (worked sort of), and read a <tt>man</tt> page (<tt>man</tt>'s <tt>man</tt> page, the <tt>man</tt>liest <tt>man</tt> page there is). There is a very simple prompt which uses your <tt>PATH</tt> to find utilities (it will print an <tt>X</tt> if it can't find it so that at 300bps you don't have to get annoyed scrolling <tt>Command not found you idjit</tt> in longhand all the time). When you're done, type <tt>exit</tt>.
        <p>
        The main advancement you may have noticed here is that spaces were compressed in the output so you could see more on the screen and blank lines were dropped. I have this implemented in the gopher client, too, but Gopher menus are usually written for fixed width fonts and spaces and blank lines are often salient, so shrink-wrapping of this sort is off there by default. The <tt>$WIDTH</tt> and <tt>$SHRINK</tt> environment variables (use <tt>set KEY=value</tt> to change) control the width of the scrolling display and whether spaces should be squished together (tabs are handled properly). If you want to play with this in the Gopher client, set the environment variable(s) before starting <tt>golm.pl</tt>.
        <p>
        It should go without saying you shouldn't use this as your real shell, or at least not yet, because there are a lot of edge cases to iron out. Necessarily this must connect a pipe to the command so we can paginate it, which some commands aren't going to tolerate well (I also don't hoover up the entire output into memory since we have no idea how big that might be, so you can't back up to a prior line presently), and this may not work properly with some sorts of pipe chains. There is at least code to check for some shell metacharacters so you can still redirect output to a file if you want, but I'm sure it can be fooled, and I'm sure some of you will attempt to.
        <p>
        I wrote both of these clients in a generic fashion such that any pocket or handheld computer with a single line display could use one of these clients: they are not in any way specific to the CC-40 or TI-74. If someone came up with a serial port option for my beloved Tandy PC-4 (there's an idea), you could set <tt>$WIDTH</tt> to 11 characters (!!) and see how far you get. I'd be interested to hear how this works on other handheld systems if someone gets the idea to try.
        <p>

      <source:markdown>I&#39;ve mentioned on the blog several times [the continuum that exists between handheld computers and pocket computers](/2024/02/cap-x-and-comp-x-how-tandy-pocket.html), battery powered devices in rather small form factors that are nevertheless fully-fledged general purpose computers — arguably more so than the modern locked-down smartphone has become. Some of these diminutive systems are best considered &#34;handhelds,&#34; with larger size, larger keyboards, more power and (often) less battery life, and some are definitely &#34;pocket computers,&#34; with smaller size, smaller keys, less power and (usually) better battery life. For example, systems like the Tandy PC-4/Casio PB-100 or Tandy PC-3/Sharp PC-1250 would be considered &#34;definitely a pocket computer,&#34; while the Epson HX-20 or Kyotronic 85 systems like the NEC PC-8201A or TRS-80 Model 100 would be considered &#34;definitely a handheld computer,&#34; and you can probably think up some examples in between.

Well, here&#39;s a notable example of one single architecture that birthed _both_ types of machine, and it came from a company not really noted for either one: Texas Instruments.

TI certainly made calculators and many of those were programmable by some means, but neither handheld computers nor pocket computers had categorically been in their repertoire to date. Nevertheless, here we have the 1983 Compact Computer 40 — using the AA battery for scale, at that size _definitely_ a handheld — and above it the 1985 TI-74 BASICALC, notionally a &#34;BASIC programmable calculator,&#34; but actually an evolved version of nearly the same hardware in less than half the size. Thanks to the ingenuity of the Hexbus interface, which due to TI&#39;s shortsightedness was never effectively exploited during that era, we can get a serial port running on both of these with hobbyist hardware. If we have a serial port, that means we can bring up a terminal program — which we&#39;ll write from scratch in assembly language for shell and Gopherspace access.

But how would a Unix shell work on a single line screen, or for that matter, a Gopher menu? We&#39;ll explore some concepts, but before we do that, for context and understanding of their capabilities we&#39;ll start with the history of these machines — and because their development is unavoidably tangled with TI&#39;s other consumer products and their home computer family, we&#39;ll necessarily rehash some of those highlights and nadirs as well.

### The Compact Computer family and the CC-40

The obvious progenitors of the pocket-handheld computer family were the programmable calculators emerging from various manufacturers in the mid-1970s. In this genre TI was a notable vendor despite being just one of several. Arguably the first of these was the [Hewlett-Packard HP-65](https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp65.htm), released in 1974. Although not a computer in the conventional sense (despite HP&#39;s marketing), it could accept up to 100 lines of &#34;program text&#34; (key presses) and read and write them using magnetic stripe cards, and was robust enough to go into space with the Apollo mission in 1975. TI fired back in 1975 with the SR-52, also programmable with mag stripe, and supporting 224 lines.

HP, TI and Casio became probably the most active in this submarket, culminating in the 1977 TI-58 and TI-59 supporting up to 5000 lines of program text stored in &#34;solid state&#34; ROM modules that acted like library cartridges (the ad here is from a 1979 promotion). These modules became very popular for vertical markets, with bespoke program functions stored ready-to-go for industries like insurance and finance and engineering not unlike [the later Panasonic HHC](/2024/10/the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4s-secret.html). Having knocked other smaller companies like Commodore out of contention, TI understood HP to be their most direct competitor at that time, and launched what was called [Project X](http://www.datamath.org/Story/Project-X.htm) in 1977 to leapfrog them in the programmable calculator segment: wider screens up to 16 characters wide, expandable memory and an &#34;Equation Operating System&#34; implementing a scrolling display for formula entry and editing, facilitated using a new system architecture tentatively named &#34;LCD III.&#34;

As competing calculators added power and new capabilities, a higher end model dubbed the Advanced Language Calculator (or ALC for short, codenamed &#34;Lonestar&#34;) sought to introduce more computer-like features to the handheld range with its own scrolling LCD and cartridge-based software and programming languages. The idea turned out to be an atypically forward-thinking move on TI&#39;s part because the market dramatically changed in 1980 when Sharp introduced the PC-1210 and PC-1211, the first true pocket computers with full alphanumerics and programmability in BASIC (the PC-1211 was rebadged by Tandy Radio Shack [as the PC-1](http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tpm/138.html)). In quick succession followed [the Panasonic HHC family](/2024/10/the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4s-secret.html), even based on a more conventional architecture, the 6502, and shortly afterwards Casio introduced their own pocket line.

This new offshoot of the calculator market caused TI management to reexamine how Project X and the ALC should be positioned. Commissioning a user survey in July 1981, TI&#39;s marketing team broadened both concepts into three potential niches (RM 1000, RM 2000 and RM 3000), reworking the original programmable calculator product into the lowest price point (1000) while adding a BASIC-based single-line LCD pocket computer (2000) and a full multi-line LCD portable as higher tiers (3000). The obvious inheritor of Project X, the RM 1000 eventually morphed into the still-born TI-88 calculator, produced and prototyped but unexpectedly cancelled pre-launch in 1982 due to fears it was already obsolete.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ8fzGPJ21QXrcUgZPO7hGRSlRjqQu0TJSgJPX2hmpliTb3hXYrS0EbgbZZ82m0kRVRP5XnqhQhwMryTK7dp2I9BcL6rPvi-wab-zvqFvrqRa44Vfw__6_J_r69sjcSuvdtc9PhNcaapldjqWw04gjq8aKDFTkHuNVLYSyr2o_IIdPLjIV59WHU4G_ERI/s320/alc-fixed.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ8fzGPJ21QXrcUgZPO7hGRSlRjqQu0TJSgJPX2hmpliTb3hXYrS0EbgbZZ82m0kRVRP5XnqhQhwMryTK7dp2I9BcL6rPvi-wab-zvqFvrqRa44Vfw__6_J_r69sjcSuvdtc9PhNcaapldjqWw04gjq8aKDFTkHuNVLYSyr2o_IIdPLjIV59WHU4G_ERI/s2926/alc-fixed.png)



The RM 2000, on the other hand, wasn&#39;t an exact physical match for the ALC/Lonestar, which by then was a larger handheld with a 31-character LCD and &#34;Chiclet&#34; style keyboard, but Lonestar was sufficiently far along in development that its present form factor won out. (The scan above of an undated ALC mockup came from a bad photocopy tucked in with one of my CC-40s which I have tried to airbrush and clean up for legibility. I don&#39;t know anything about its provenance otherwise.) Additional market separation was achieved by using a new 8-bit processor design, admittedly with less capability than their flagship 16-bit 9900/9995 CPUs and microcontroller variants, but also without their legacy baggage. Implementing an internal architecture not unlike the Intel 8051, with which it was intended to be comparable, the TMS7000 series was also positioned as a follow-on to their very successful [4-bit TMS1000 family](https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/here-be-four-bits-of-dragons-mattel.html) in that custom microcode was fully supported like the earlier product. Like most microcontrollers, it could be shipped with built-in mask ROM directly from manufacture. TI started selling NMOS variants of the chip family in 1981, but the then-current version of the chip required two nine-volt batteries in the Lonestar prototype to power it and engineers proceeded converting the chip family to low-power CMOS for the ALC.

In parallel, the Texas Instruments consumer products division was determined to maximize sales volume, initially through discounts, reductions in production cost and heavily courting retailers, and in September 1982 newly promoted division head William Turner openly ignited a home computer price war with Jack Tramiel&#39;s resurgent Commodore. Turner aimed to push Commodore out of the market again by competing on price, now Tramiel&#39;s home turf, and use the installed base to move their vendor-locked software and peripherals. While TI sales duly increased, Commodore persistently hung on in the low end market as in retrospect the VIC-20 was a much cheaper system against which the expensive and arguably overengineered TI 99/4A could not indefinitely compete. Nevertheless, through the rest of 1982 the 99/4A outsold the VIC-20 and for some period of time was the number one home computer in the United States, and management rapidly plotted how to diversify the line. Alongside wilder ideas like the 99/7 terminal and a direct successor alternately referred to as the 99/4B or 99/5, at least two concepts got as far as actual hardware. The 99/8 (codenamed &#34;Armadillo&#34;) was intended to attack the high side of the market, a substantial expansion of the 99/4A with more RAM and built-in Extended BASIC, while the 99/2 was meant to hit the ultra-low end as a direct response to systems like the UK Sinclair ZX81 (subsequently introduced States-side in slightly modified form as the Timex Sinclair 1000). Although also a full 16-bit member of the 9900 family — with a TMS9995 CPU, the same as the [Tomy Tutor](/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html) — the diminutive 99/2 used a Chiclet style keyboard similar to Lonestar and a very limited black-and-white video chip, less capable than the 9918A but also less expensive. It supported cassette tape and cartridges, and as a stepping stone to the larger systems, BASIC programs written on a 99/2 were designed to be upwardly compatible with the 99/4A and 99/8.

For expansion options, TI created a new and simpler peripheral interface called Hexbus (also variously seen as Hex-Bus, HEXBUS and HexBus in period literature and user notes, though here I&#39;ll render it Hexbus for the remainder of the article). TI positioned Hexbus as a universal means to service all but the highest-bandwidth devices, from modems and serial communications to printers and mass storage. As such, they replaced Lonestar&#39;s original 9-pin I/O port with Hexbus and additionally fitted it to the 99/2 and the 99/8. The protocol is straightforward to understand and implement, and I&#39;ll talk a bit about the technical aspects a little later since the devices we&#39;ll use all connect that way. TI planned to extend Hexbus support to the 99/4A and RM 3000 (in whatever form it ended up taking) so that as many of their comsumer computers as possible could use the same peripherals.

Meanwhile, as Tramiel began driving price cuts faster and deeper and TI was repeatedly forced to match them (as the old Klingon proverb says, revenge is a dish best served cold), management began considering the ALC/Lonestar as a potential anchor in the portables market where competition was not nearly so fierce. The ALC prototype (now the ALC-A, for Product A) was extended into a family of machines: a low-end ALC-LC (&#34;Low Cost&#34;) with a 16-character LCD, limited BASIC, Hexbus but no cartridge port, and 1K of RAM; a high-end ALC-C to succeed the RM 3000 with a 40x6 character LCD, larger keyboard, cartridge port, Hexbus, cassette port and 8K of RAM (a terminal variant ALC-T added a 300bps modem); and then the ALC-A itself expanded into the ALC-A2, with the same 31-character LCD and original Chiclet keyboard, plus 2K of RAM, cartridge port and Hexbus. The cartridge port could accommodate programming languages like BASIC, Fortran and Pascal as well as application software, and Turner insisted it also allow RAM expansion.

TI paused the ALC-LC and ALC-C to get the ALC-A2 to market first, reasoning the design could easily be reworked for the others if it was successful. Renaming it as the Compact Computer 40, BASIC was made internal and the original drop-in cartridge port design (shown here on a late prototype) was reworked to a more typical card edge. Additionally, as 2K RAM was increasingly becoming inadequate even for portable systems, TI pumped the base RAM up to 6K — we&#39;ll talk about how TI arrived at that number presently. Now that everything was CMOS internally, it could run sufficiently well on just four AA batteries, which was a significant improvement in convenience, runtime and weight; an optional AC adapter could be connected for desktop use.

The 99/2 and the revised 6K CC-40 made their debut at Winter CES 1983. The &#34;40&#34; came from TI&#39;s specious then-custom of counting ROM and RAM together as total &#34;memory,&#34; so according to their vaguely disingenuous marketdroids at the show the CC-40 had 40K of &#34;memory&#34; from its 6K of RAM and 34K of ROM (an unusual but truthful number that again I will explain when we get to the internals). This then carried over to the magazine copy in _Creative Computing_ April 1983, above, where an overly credulous David Ahl (et al) completely swallowed the TI baloney and said it was &#34;expandable to 128K thanks to the 16-bit processor.&#34;

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwglXaBLfY94kykL4x5seNmw5sw1yMjhDIKYDJ5jJp5kstHFMCln-qJZNChIc1dgl4aY0UB22lOQ-0aqLfWbwAEIjJ3RmlF8dACpa1cTUcQ1QHbjf8sQDtL-7-muk-oHy5GNdUMO4mwg7wzmc3JVjGSevOkW2pTyO-3L-Zxjw-QSoOeL5tAdY1DQAUCw8/s320/cc40-1.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwglXaBLfY94kykL4x5seNmw5sw1yMjhDIKYDJ5jJp5kstHFMCln-qJZNChIc1dgl4aY0UB22lOQ-0aqLfWbwAEIjJ3RmlF8dACpa1cTUcQ1QHbjf8sQDtL-7-muk-oHy5GNdUMO4mwg7wzmc3JVjGSevOkW2pTyO-3L-Zxjw-QSoOeL5tAdY1DQAUCw8/s2588/cc40-1.jpg)

In reality both parts of that statement were false: it still ran an 8-bit TMS7000-series CPU, though at the time TI was careful not to say exactly what the CPU _was_, and TI&#39;s memory claim was _more_ ridiculous than Ahl reported as they actually alleged a ceiling of _168K_ of &#34;memory&#34; — because it accepted cartridges of up to 128K of _ROM_ (i.e., 6 + 34 + 128). A 16K _RAM_ expansion was also planned and TI estimated a runtime of 200 hours on four alkaline AA batteries.

TI was justifiably very proud of Hexbus and demonstrated at least three peripherals at the show: an RS-232 serial interface for $100 \[around $325 in 2025 dollars\], a four-colour printer-plotter which many of you have already guessed the mechanism of and selling for $200 \[$650\], and a licensed version of the Exatron Stringy Floppy that TI reworked into what they called &#34;wafertape.&#34; Its sole mass storage option, the wafertape drive was priced at $139 \[$460\] plus media cost, which wasn&#39;t disclosed. A modem, full-size printer, wand input device and a video interface were announced for later in the year.

Despite being arguably more powerful, the 99/2 was clearly positioned as the junior product — TI priced it at just $100 \[$325\] while the CC-40 retailed for $249.95 \[$810\]. Software support likewise reflected the CC-40&#39;s higher priority. TI announced eight cartridges at the show, but only two of them were for the 99/2 at $19.95 \[$65\] each, and about twenty more promised titles were to be released on cassette tape at $9.95 \[$32\] a pop. On the other hand, the CC-40 got at least six cartridges (seven listed here) and at least thirteen additional software packages on wafertape, with a promised _seventy-five_ more; the most expensive of these retailed for almost $150 \[$485\]. TI informed attendees both computers would be available by summer.

Unfortunately, what should have been a triumphant return for TI at Summer CES 1983 turned into disaster. Commodore, fresh off the introduction of the Commodore 64 in 1982 at $595, had slashed the VIC-20 to a new low of $125 in January 1983 and once again forced TI to follow suit. By the time the June convention rolled around, Commodore had managed to gobble up over 50 percent of the home computer market and largely at TI&#39;s expense: the Commodore 64 was flying off shelves at under $300 — half its introductory price, even lower at discounters — and the VIC-20 continued selling briskly for $100 or less. In contrast to the 99/4A, Tramiel&#39;s high degree of vertical integration and low production costs ensured Commodore could still turn a profit. Nevertheless, TI doggedly matched the VIC-20&#39;s new price (with a rebate) and started taking a significant loss on every unit, which also put them in the distinctly unpalatable position of introducing the notionally low-end 99/2 at or above what the 99/4A was now selling for. The 99/2 was quietly cancelled the day before the show and TI later liquidated the small amount of stock that had already been manufactured.

In fairness, TI was not the only one in trouble and both Atari and Mattel took massive losses as well. 1983 was also the year of the crap home computer with many other underwhelming systems being introduced at or near that magic $100 price point — and I know if I mention any by name, _someone_ out there will howl because there will always be at least one person who loved theirs. Unlike TI&#39;s hardware, however, such systems were made cheap to sell cheap: while most customers correctly perceived them as technologically inferior, they at least covered their cost per unit, even though most of these fly-by-night also-rans flamed out within months.


Seeing all this upon arrival in Chicago, TI management abruptly decided not to exhibit the 99/8 either and hastily put the display model behind a locked door for the show&#39;s duration. (Ironically, the [Tomy Tutor](/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html) — nothing less than a modified clone of the 99/8 — made its American debut at the very same convention.) Although a public relations debacle of its own (some mischievous press coverage even reportedly printed pictures of the door), TI&#39;s most enduring announcement from that Summer CES was a threat to completely lock out third-party software for the 99/4A, a deeply unpopular and thinly veiled attempt to maximize its failing razor-and-blades model, and one they mostly made good on by enforcing their patents on GROM chips. The company&#39;s stock cratered after announcing a $119 million loss in July — both due to production costs and a critical overestimation of demand — and Bill Turner was forced out of the company. Incredibly, Turner&#39;s replacement Peter Field decided to double down on the strategy by slashing the price of peripherals as well as the computer.

On the other hand, the CC-40 largely sailed above this fray because it was positioned as a _business_ product. Although ostensibly developed and sold by the same consumer products division — unlike the TI Professional PC from the data systems group which had also come out around this time — marketing took great pains to distance it from the ailing home computer line and emphasize its utility for serious business rather than general purpose entertainment. Bill Cosby, celebrity endorser of both TI since 1982 and Jell-O, which closely resembled the spines of certain TI executives, was there to remind you there was always room for a CC-40 (and prison time).

In the official marketing pamphlets TI provided at Winter CES 1983, you can see the difference in tone between the CC-40&#39;s and the contemporary 99/4A&#39;s: Cosby is more casually dressed for the 99/4A and it appears prominently billed as a home computer in two places just on the cover alone, yet for the CC-40 he presents the computer and a wafertape while wearing business attire, using executive buzzwords like &#34;solutions&#34; and making no mention of home applications at all. (This particular pamphlet is the source of some of the scans I showed you previously.) Based on early hands-on reviews around August 1983 and estimating about a two to three month publishing delay, it appears the CC-40 made it to retailers at the promised price point between May and June of that year.

The released CC-40 is very similar to the ALC concept; the CC-40 retains Lonestar&#39;s general form factor and its 31-character non-dot-addressible LCD with various mode indicators. These indicators not only include things like the state of the SHIFT key and the current trigonometric unit of angle, but also unique user-addressible arrow-like markers along the bottom of the LCD panel which can be programmatically toggled to signal the user. Limited custom graphics were possible by redefining one of six screen characters dedicated to the purpose.

The keyboard, however, was one thing that did change. While the ALC and the CC-40 use the same &#34;Chiclet&#34; keyboard in the same overall layout, including a small numeric keypad, some of the keys were moved around and certain others removed. The undated ALC image I have above likely came from the same source as [these documents from a former TI engineer](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/313064-cb-wilson-ti-99-related-documents/page/8/), one of which shows the MODE key crossed out, the LBL key replaced with CTRL and the equals key at the bottom left of the numeric keypad replaced with a generic &#34;FN&#34; function key. It looks like the ALC was also proposed to support some sort of Japanese language entry, most likely katakana (the display was not sufficient for most hiragana, let alone full-blown kanji), but this feature was also subsequently eliminated. On the image here I can&#39;t distinguish what the shifted characters were meant to be, but [this photograph](http://www.datamath.org/Graphing/JPEG_CC-40P.htm) appears to be of the same or similar ALC mockup, showing some typographical characters also moved around as well as a line of deep blue secondary functions possibly for debugging purposes.

If you have big hands, then you probably have big thumbs, and you know what they say about guys with big thumbs: they can type better on handheld computers. (What? This is a family blog.) In my clodhopper not-quite-varsity basketball mitts the CC-40 is almost a handheld but it wasn&#39;t for most people, and even more so than its single-line LCD the roughly 80% keycaps — although considered better than the 99/2&#39;s mushy Chiclets — provoked polarized opinions. Joe Devlin in _Creative Computing_ said the keyboard was &#34;not all it might be,&#34; but found it &#34;well-built&#34; with &#34;no hint of keybounce that is a frequent plague,&#34; while _Microcomputing_ asserted it was &#34;basically a calculator keypad with letters on it&#34; and _Byte_&#39;s David Ramsey bluntly called it &#34;vile.&#34; On the other hand, it was certainly no worse than, say, an HP-75. A small recessed divot next to the space bar acts as a soft reset button; the machine also comes with a translucent keyboard overlay with quick combinations to type BASIC keywords, though this falls off easily and I don&#39;t much use it myself.

The underside of the unit contains the battery door (four AA batteries) and a sturdy flip-up stand for using it on a desk. There are supposed to be four rubber feet but the glue kind of sucks and two of them came off at some point. The CC-40&#39;s official model number, shown here, is the &#34;CC 40.&#34; This unit is serial #A001818 with date code ATA3583, indicating it was assembled at TI&#39;s plant in Abilene, TX in the 35th week of 1983 (i.e., end of August).

The CC-40 has just three external ports. On the left side of the computer (right in this image) are the AC power jack and the Hexbus connector, and on the right is the single cartridge port. The power jack, officially TI&#39;s model AC 9201 wallwart, is a standard barrel connector providing 6V DC but atypically negative tip. However, kudos do have to be given to TI for its power implementation: people have reported accidentally connecting a positive tip AC adapter will not let out the magic smoke (it just won&#39;t work, though always try to avoid it), and you can use the AC adapter to bridge changing the batteries while it&#39;s running. The CC-40 will seamlessly switch to AC power when it&#39;s available and batteries when it isn&#39;t, including the situation where the barrel jack is plugged in but the wallwart is not. If all else fails, I have read various reports that the system will maintain memory contents for about a minute if you can swap the batteries quickly, which matches my personal experience. That said, I use lithium AAs in mine and I have yet to replace them.

Unlike the drop-in cartridges of the prototype, released cartridges have a more typical card edge protected by a sliding cap which guides the edge into the slot. The ROM software cartridges and the RAM expanders have the same form factor, but there is only one slot, so it is not possible to have a RAM expansion and a ROM cartridge plugged in together. (Although modern homebrew combo cartridges exist with both ROM and RAM, they don&#39;t support accessing both at the same time.)

As you saw in the extract from the marketing pamphlet, TI called their ROM cartridges &#34;Solid State Software.&#34; However, not all the promised cartridges were ever released. TI only officially sold the Statistics, Finance, Pascal, Memo Processor, Games I, Electronics (&#34;Advanced Electrical Engineering&#34;) and Mathematics cartridges, though the Editor/Assembler cartridge was subsequently found and dumped, and nowadays appears on most multicarts. On the other hand, despite being officially planned, Business Graphics and Games II have yet to be discovered. These cartridges appear to the computer as programs which can be run by name; some cartridges like Games I have multiple programs (Hunt the Wumpus, Hammurabi, Stocks and Bonds, Spacecraft Landing Simulation and Backgammon; Games II would have had Codebreaker, Interchange, Nim, Sea Battle, Number Gallery and Word Scramble). Some cartridges can also add functionality to BASIC programs. We&#39;ll look at one of these cartridges in particular a little later on.

TI produced two RAM cartridges for the CC-40, though because of the CC-40&#39;s unusual BASIC memory map, not all of their RAM was useable under all circumstances. The most common, and arguably the most useful for a particular reason I&#39;ll mention shortly, was the 8K Constant Memory cartridge. This cartridge contained battery-backed RAM which could either be added to the system as expansion memory for BASIC (but resets the system when taken out), or be used as a removable storage medium with a small machine language program. In this second mode the entire memory of the standard 6K system could be copied to the cartridge and back, and since it carried a small lithium battery, its contents — including the machine language subroutine necessary to load from it — would persist when unplugged. TI estimated this battery would last about three to five years using a mechanism that would connect the battery only on first use. Naturally, unless you find an unused NOS unit, current examples are dead as doornails but despite not being user-serviceable the batteries can be replaced with some effort.

The second option was the 16K RAM cartridge that TI had originally promised. This unit lacked a battery and was completely volatile. Although technically capable of serving as a storage medium, it could only do so while the cartridge remained connected and the computer&#39;s batteries were good, so it was most useful simply as expanded memory. Unfortunately, while the original 2K iteration could take advantage of all 8K and 16K (to yield 10K and 18K respectively), BASIC&#39;s memory map in the released 6K CC-40 couldn&#39;t access 4K of either device — which is to say the 8K cartridge could only add 4K of memory to BASIC to yield 10K (though all 8K was addressable), and the 16K only 12K to yield 18K. Although TI did mention a 2K expander in documentation, no such cartridge was sold. Despite this deficiency, the CC-40&#39;s memory map can support up to 32K of external memory and modern homebrew RAM cartridges typically provide all 32K with battery backup a la the original 8K Constant Memory.

That brings us to the eight-pin Hexbus port, though the manual calls it the &#34;peripheral port.&#34; Hexbus is a four-bit parallel interface over an extended bus capable of addressing up to 255 intelligent devices (device 0 is &#34;all devices&#34;), and the &#34;hex&#34; part likely reflects that it can send an entire hexadecimal digit at once with the remainder for ground, handshaking and future expansion. It is hot-pluggable and largely device-agnostic, and like the analogous Atari SIO system can be considered a spiritual ancestor of modern USB. Hexbus hosts are generally the centre of the bus (unless this role has been reassigned) and as such order downstream devices to act or report using command and data packets. It is possible to interrupt the host when a device requires service, though this requires the host to subsequently poll each enabled device to determined who interrupted it. (Foreshadowing.) Power is not distributed over Hexbus _sensu stricto_ but we&#39;ll get to a later variation that can.

TI intended Hexbus to service all kinds of peripherals and assigned fixed device number ranges to various classes. In practice this was not always strictly observed, nor were all assigned device classes actually used or all possible numerical ranges actually assigned. Among others, officially 1-2 were for cassette tape but 3-8 for tape mass storage, 10-19 for various sorts of printers (with subclasses beneath them) but 50-53 for Centronics-style parallel interfaces, 20-23 for RS-232 serial and 70-73 for modems, 30-33 and 40-43 for colour and black and white video interfaces, 100-109 for 5.25&#34; floppy disk drives, 110-117 for 3.5&#34;, and 90-95 for barcode readers and scanners. 118-239 was explicitly dedicated to third-party use but most homebrew Hexbus devices, including the ones we&#39;ll use in this article, emulate the standard device IDs. Thirty-one different commands are defined; devices are only required to implement those which are relevant to their operation.

Hexbus mandated the host be capable of no less than 3000 bytes/second for &#34;peripherals that require a minimum I/O transfer rate&#34; and the CC-40&#39;s user&#39;s guide rates the CC-40 as capable of up to 6000 bytes/second. Theoretically a nybble could be transmitted about every 16 microseconds, yielding a maximum throughput of around 31,250 bytes/second, though rarely was anything close to this top speed realized. Part of the problem was the protocol&#39;s overhead as well as the computers themselves, which for reasons of power consumption did not drive the bus particularly efficiently under ordinary circumstances. The other wart on Hexbus are the cables, which have poor strain relief and rely on a sometimes mushy friction fit in the ports, which themselves aren&#39;t well-reinforced either.

As mentioned, the launch portfolio for Hexbus was a printer/plotter, RS-232 serial interface and the wafertape drive, and this three-pack was what appeared in the 1983 CC-40 pamphlet. For the 99/4A&#39;s 1983 pamphlet, however, notice that not only were Hexbus devices explicitly advertised with the new beige 4A (along with a beige PEB which I&#39;ve never actually seen and was probably a mockup), but there were now _four_ of them.

Those four are shown here: the small printer/plotter (HX-1000 Printer/Plotter), the RS-232 box (HX-3000 RS-232), the wafertape (HX-2000, though this one is unmarked) and additionally a modem (HX-3100 Modem). They were intentionally stackable into an attractive cube configuration, though I note the printer/plotter has a different front bezel colour that doesn&#39;t match the other devices or what appeared in the pamphlets. Although the modem and wafertape can accept regular batteries, the printer/plotter is powered by a NiCad pack with all the attendant disadvantages and uses its own charger (AC 9203, nominally 9V center-tip but my multimeter reads about 12.5V), and the RS-232 box must be connected to wall power (using another AC 9201 adapter, same as the CC-40 itself).

Anyone who knows anything about plotters of this era will recognize the mechanism in the printer/plotter: it&#39;s another Alps DPG-1302, [the same as](http://tandy.wiki/CGP-115) the Tandy CGP-115, Commodore 1520, Atari 1020, Oric MCP-40 and [the Convergent Microprinter WP-100](/2024/09/programming-convergent-workslates.html), among many others. However, that also means that refurbishing it is fortunately quite practical once you replace that hideous internal battery pack.

Later on a full-size 80-column dot matrix printer (HX-1010 Printer 80) became available, though unlike the plotter this one can take regular D batteries (four). This printer is based on a Brother printer mechanism also found in their EP-20 electronic typewriter and uses the same ribbons, or if you have no ribbons, you can use it as a thermal printer with fax paper such as that for [the Silent 700 series](/2022/02/refurb-weekend-texas-instruments-silent.html). I don&#39;t have the AC 9401 supply the Printer 80 uses, but based on the EP-20 (which also could run on four D batteries) it is likely also 6V tip negative at 1.0A, unlike the 300mA AC 9201.

More so than the others, however, the wafertape drive was intended to be the star of the show. It is in fact a portable version of the Exatron Stringy Floppy (from Exatron in Sunnyvale, later Entrepo, Inc.), a high-speed (for the era) continuous-loop tape system first introduced in 1978 for which Texas Instruments had negotiated an exclusive license in 1982. Like other forms of tape storage the Stringy Floppy is inherently sequential, and has no true provision for random access — files must be scanned through in order until the desired one is encountered. But, because it&#39;s looped and streams fast, it can nevertheless achieve speeds comparable to a conventional floppy disk system. The wafertapes (&#34;microwafers&#34;) fit easily in one&#39;s hand, or at least they do in _my_ hand.

The length of the tape naturally determines its capacity, although longer tapes are also unavoidably slower to search. In my collection I have 5 foot, 10 foot, 25 foot and 50 foot wafers, apparently the only sizes TI offered, which in a somewhat non-linear fashion respectively correspond to maximum capacities of 4K, 12K, 32K and 64K. The wafertape drive is typically device 1, the same range as cassette tapes, though a selector in the back can pick a device ID anywhere from 1 to 8 if you were crazy enough to have a stack of them.

In retrospect TI&#39;s choice of the Stringy Floppy was peculiar because the device already had a somewhat chequered reputation on other platforms. Although reasonably fast, its storage capacities were unimpressive compared to floppies and the media wasn&#39;t cheap. Worse still, the tape media was well-known for being prone to tangling and even sometimes outright fracturing, a problem that only got worse as tapes got older and more fragile, and tended to happen more with expensive higher-capacity cartridges because the tape in them was thinner. Repairing a mangled or broken tape could be an exceptionally fiddly business which I&#39;ve experienced enough firsthand to the point where I rarely use the wafertape drive anymore except for demonstrations.

Yet all that was not sufficient to deter TI, who wanted to avoid the association of ordinary cassette storage with home computers, and believed the wafertape drive would be seen as handy, speedy and state of the art. However, two more flaws subsequently became apparent. The first was that tape handling became even more unreliable on battery power, especially as the batteries got low, and virtually necessitated the device be connected to the wall. But the second, discovered in October 1983, was a rare but critical fault in its internal microcontroller where under specific circumstances it could unexpectedly fail to wake on an interrupt and thus go out of synchronization.

By the time this fault was discovered, CC-40 owners were already howling because of the backlog on peripherals — _any_ peripherals. These didn&#39;t start hitting retail channels until the fall and sometimes even later: my modem has an ATA3483 date code while my RS-232 box has an LTA4983 date code, well into December, and my NOS printer/plotter has a date code of 014 indicating January of 1984. The delays were significant enough that as early as July TI had already announced expected declines in CC-40 sales, at the same time Bill Turner got cashiered, and ended up taking writeoffs. Although the wafertape drives were being manufactured on the same timetable (mine has an ATA3383 date), at that point the CC-40 was clearly in decline and TI management didn&#39;t want an expensive recall or lawsuit incited by the drives&#39; flaws on a product entering twilight. The wafertape drive was cancelled before it was ever sold and stickers saying so went out on every CC-40&#39;s box thereafter. (Note the box copy: the copyright says 1982, and the modem wasn&#39;t ready by then, so it doesn&#39;t appear.)

But since there were stacks of other boxes and documentation already printed referencing the wafertape, TI wasn&#39;t content to mark just the CC-40&#39;s box alone with its discontinuation; they also jammed slips in manuals and slapped stickers on the boxes of the other peripherals so that they didn&#39;t need to be reprinted (and no one could claim TI didn&#39;t warn them). This ended up making the 8K Constant Memory cartridge practically essential because without it you had no chance of saving anything.

One other mass storage device was created by TI for Hexbus, a 5.25&#34; floppy drive, but while it may have been able to work with the CC-40 this device was actually intended for the home computer line and went unreleased. There was also a prototype [Hexbus colour video interface](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/380304-hexbus-video-controller-thread/), in practice more like a serial terminal that accepts commands from the CC-40 and draws a screen with its own internal 9918 (actually a 9118, which is functionally equivalent). The also-unreleased Editor/Assembler cartridge can control this interface for full-screen editing. Without a viable mass storage option, however, there didn&#39;t seem much point in releasing either one.

Meanwhile, TI had always intended to produce the CC-40 in different configurations, sort of a further expansion of the ALC family. In memory configurations alone TI envisioned five buckets at 2K, 4K, 6K, 10K and 18K (and these even appear in the user&#39;s guide), but eventually only publicly produced the 6K and top-spec 18K models. The 18K&#39;s arrival was tardy and it received little fanfare and even less mention in the press.

It surely didn&#39;t help that the only indication it had _three times_ the base model&#39;s memory were two grotty fluorescent green &#34;18K&#34; stickers, like you&#39;d find on a cheapo semi-gold earring stud, and which have peeled off most units since. This is my NOS 18K showing everything that came in the box with every CC-40, including a keyboard overlay (installed), READ THIS FIRST! card, quick reference card, user&#39;s guide (with wafertape warning), and a set of AA batteries. Nowhere else is its expanded capacity mentioned.

You couldn&#39;t even tell from the bottom of the unit; the model numbers (both &#34;CC 40&#34;) are exactly the same, and the serial number and date code on this 18K (lower left) are #A000685 and ATA3483, manufactured nearly simultaneously with my usual 6K. On the one hand, the 18K variant was definitely worth getting if you needed the memory: not only did it have more at baseline, but unlike the 6K unit its BASIC could also use the entirety of the 8K and 16K cartridges for up to 34K RAM total. On the other hand, it was obviously impossible to store all 18K in an 8K Constant Memory cartridge, it was never available in large numbers, and most people at the time didn&#39;t even seem to know it existed. Despite being brought in at the same $249.95 price point or less to flog sales, it made little impact.

The reason TI figured they could churn out a whole bunch of configurations is because internally the CC-40 is very simple, just a handful of chips and through-hole discrete components on two PCBs. Here I&#39;m showing the main CPU board so I don&#39;t have to play 69-key pickup with the keyboard/LCD board beneath it. That board is even simpler with just a bog-standard Hitachi HD44780 LCD driver/controller supplemented by an HD44100 LCD driver to handle the additional display segments. The character segments are divided roughly into quarters with the HD44780 handling the common lines and first and third quarters and the HD44100 handling the second and fourth, plus the display indicators.

Orienting the battery compartment to the bottom, the topmost three chips here are the RAM. In the base model these are three 2K 6116 static RAM chips, yielding an unusual total of 6K. However, notice that the two at the top of this picture sit on pads bigger than they are and the one below them does not, plus wire jumpers just above the 5.000MHz crystal oscillator. We&#39;ll come back to those items in a moment. The power and reset circuitry is on the left side set off by a weird little plastic sleeve containing a bridging resistor.

Zooming in a little, we see the two primary chips, the CPU (the DIP on the lower right) and the control ASIC (the QFP). The ASIC was fabbed by American Microsystems (AMI, later AMI Semiconductor, and subsequently acquired by onsemi in 2008) and acts as a &#34;Grand Central&#34; address decoder for the LCD, piezo beeper, internal ROM, cartridge ROM and RAM. It also handles the Hexbus lines and uses the crystal for its own clock source which it additionally passes through to the CPU.

The CPU is a TMS70C20 and indeed a CMOS version of the 8-bit TMS7000 microcontroller we discussed earlier, with the &#34;2&#34; indicating a built-in 2K of mask ROM (the version of the mask ROM is C11002, &#34;C&#34; meaning standard microcode), and a date code of 10th week 1983. The full model designation of &#34;TMX70C20N2L&#34; is interesting for several reasons: &#34;TMX&#34; indicates the earliest stage of production device where the die may not be fully developed (versus the TMP &#34;prototype&#34; where it is, and the TMS &#34;sale&#34; version designation is fully qualified for production), and the &#34;N2&#34; is a 70mil (0.07&#34; or 1.78mm)-spaced DIP as opposed to the more typical &#34;N&#34; which is a 100mil (0.1&#34; or 2.54mm)-spaced DIP, both rated for operation in typical temperature ranges (&#34;L&#34;). It divides down the 5MHz signal from the ASIC to yield its nominal clock speed of 2.5MHz, and has a 16-bit address bus for a maximum 64K addressing space.

TI fabbed the TMS7000 family using what it called &#34;Strip Chip Architecture Topology.&#34; Setting out explicitly to make an easily reconfigurable design, TI stepped away from more parsimonious layouts like the 6502&#39;s and platted out its logic in quadrilateral functional blocks it termed &#34;strips.&#34; Unlike those earlier designs, and unlike later multi-chip modules using multiple dies, these blocks could be connected with a minimum of additional logic and then promptly unified on a single die for fabrication. One strip included the timer, I/O control, interrupts, on-chip registers and ALU; another held the microcode and PLA for instruction decoding; another held the onboard ROM; another the onboard RAM, and so forth.

You can see one result in the die picture on the front of TI&#39;s product circular. The large strips for the microcode and onboard ROM are easily distinguished (the &#34;darker&#34; strips along the left and centre) as is the on-board RAM (the patterned strip along the right). The ALU/registers/etc. strip is between the two ROMs, and the remainder is smaller functional blocks and glue circuitry. Like the TMS1000 it was intended to succeed, TMS7000s shipped from the factory with optional mask ROM (2K in the TMS702x/C2x, 4K in the TMS704x/C4x and 12K in the TMS70120) and optional custom instruction microcode (&#34;L&#34; series mask ROM designators). To make a different chip, say, with more ROM or a different instruction decoder, a different strip was loaded to replace it — potentially even a different _sized_ strip — while the others could remain the same. (TI&#39;s brochure even brags that the 7040 was created from the 7020 without redesigning the chip: the &#34;design was separated at the memory border and the additional 2K of memory simply inserted alongside the original 2K of memory by the design computer.&#34;) The baseline TMS7000 had no ROM, but the development SE70P16x chips carried a socket on top for piggybacking an EPROM (or you could use the TMS7742 which had an EPROM of its own inside), configurations also offered by other microcontroller manufacturers of the period. TI reserved the first six bytes of the ROM for internal purposes. It is possible to [dump and save the contents of the internal ROM](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/345057-tms7000-onboard-rom-dumping-project/).

Like the Intel 8051 and Motorola 6801, with which it was intended to directly compete, the TMS7000 family included onboard RAM and I/O standard. The 70x0 and 70Cx0 chips accepted up to a 5MHz clock source (divided by two or four) and provided 128 bytes of onboard RAM, a single 13-bit timer and 16, 8 and 8 (respectively) bidirectional, input and output I/O lines. In the CC-40, those I/O lines are mostly dedicated to the keyboard and memory addressing. The higher grade 70x2 and 70Cx2 chips accepted up to an 8MHz clock source and provided 256 bytes of onboard RAM, two 13-bit and one 10-bit timers, an on-chip serial port and 22, 2 and 8 bidrectional, input and output I/O lines. On the other hand, the TMS7000 was more like the 6801 in that it was a Von Neumann architecture and incorporated the on-chip features as memory-mapped I/O. 10MHz crystals were later supported, though these were still divided down for the internal clock.

The TMS7000 turned out to be a very bright spot for TI; it was substantially faster than the 8051 at most operations and quicker than even an equivalently clocked 6801 or Zilog Z8. I&#39;ll have more to say about the CPU when we get to actually writing assembly code for it.

Here is the ROM (apart from what&#39;s in the 70C20) and the other two RAM chips. This external 32K 61256 ROM stores BASIC and higher level portions of the operating system, while the lowest level portions are within the CPU&#39;s mask ROM strip. Since 32K would consume half the CPU&#39;s addressing space, it is instead banked in using 8K segments (more on that later). Either way that gets you your 34K total of ROM, and in the mildly mendacious world of TI six plus thirty-four equals forty, so that&#39;s the CC-40.

The lower of the two RAM chips has no extra pads. This is in fact the original 2K configuration and what would have been present on any CC-40 variant. This lowest 2K is reserved by the system and not available for BASIC programs in any CC-40 configuration, but can be used by machine language programs and is legitimately addressable RAM.

For the other configurations we crack open the 18K version. The jumper wires I pointed out have moved, and the two upper 2K 6116 RAM chips have been replaced with 8K 6264s (2 + 8 + 8 = 18) which use the extra pads for their additional addressing lines. With this basic template in mind, the other configurations would probably have been no additional chips (2K), two 1K chips (4K), and two 4K chips (10K). It wasn&#39;t long before existing CC-40 owners discovered they could do such an upgrade themselves, to TI&#39;s great chagrin, even though this would clearly void the warranty.

One other notable landmark on the board is this bundle of resistors sprouting from a blob of solder connected to the ground plane. These are pull-downs for the Hexbus lines.

The peripherals necessarily also have their own CPUs, mostly TMS70C20s as well, such as the RS-232 box&#39;s board shown here. This is also a 70C20N2L with the narrower pin spacing and has a ROM code of C14018 with a date code of 10th week 1983. It runs slightly slower at 2MHz from a 4MHz crystal, but instead of bitbanging the serial port it has a real 6551 ACIA made by Synertek with a date code of 19th week 1983. The ACIA has its own 1.8432MHz crystal. A set of headers above the CPU allows the installation of an optional parallel port.

The other notable chip on this board is directly above the SY6551, a 22-pin TI 1052911 manufactured 18th week 1983. This is the Intelligent Peripheral Bus Controller (IBC for short), managing the Hexbus lines for the CPU instead of requiring additional bitbanging, and generating an interrupt when data is available. In later devices it is superseded by the 28-pin TP0370. Everything else is off-the-shelf. We&#39;ll have more to say about the RS-232 box when we get to discussing Hexbus communication options in detail.

The lack of a viable mass-storage option severely damaged TI&#39;s attempts to portray the CC-40 as a useful portable computer. Consequently (and ironically), many owners tended to treat it as an overgrown programmable calculator instead, a task at which it nevertheless excelled in part due to its higher-precision base 100 BCD floating point and polynomial transcendentals, as well as the software on the limited selection of Solid State Cartridges which (although expensive and few in number) were generally high quality. On top of that, it was also substantially faster than TI&#39;s other programmable calculators and was of course capable of more sophisticated algorithms. Some users were able to source remaindered wafertape drives through unofficial channels but a third-party Hexbus storage device, the Mechatronics QD-01 Quickdisk using an unusual 2.8&#34; medium, did not become widely available until 1986. Meanwhile, the consumer products division, now under half a billion dollars in cumulative debt from their ruinous price war with Commodore Business Machines, threw in the towel and announced on October 28, 1983 that they were abandoning the home computer market. The 99/8, all but cut from life support already, was officially canned earlier in October after about 150 had been made; production also immediately ceased for the 99/4A, after which it was heavily discounted and the remaining stock liquidated in March 1984.

Once again, however, the CC-40 temporarily avoided this fate because TI continued to sell and market it as a business product, just like the TI Professional PC, which TI claimed was still doing well. By early 1984 the 6K CC-40 had dropped below $200 at retail, although the 18K version was all but nonexistent in sales channels. TI&#39;s later CC-40 marketing materials, such as the 1984 flyer here that oddly still used a photograph of the drop-in-cartridge prototype, further emphasized its suitability for custom business environments while adding they could convert your software into cartridges for &#34;instant plug-in customization.&#34; Some companies actually sold [rebadged CC-40s](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/320064-cc-40-derivatives-third-party/) with such custom cartridges installed, though none of these variants were ever very numerous, and all were OEMed by TI. The modem finally appeared on this flyer as an option but naturally not the wafertape, which was by then a distant memory.

### The TI-74 BASICALC

In the meantime TI nevertheless worked on two direct follow-ons to the CC-40. One was the final embodiment of the RM 3000/ALC-C concept, incorporating a larger 40-character by 6-line LCD with a proper full size-and-travel keyboard intended to compete with the TRS-80 Model 100. Since the CC-40 now shipped in an 18K configuration, the so-called Compact Computer 70 (&#34;CC-70&#34;) would likely have shipped with even more memory than the 8K of the original ALC-C. We&#39;ll never know, unfortunately, because the only known example is [an empty mockup shell](http://www.datamath.org/Graphing/CC-70P.htm), reportedly because the first batch of gate array chips for the prototype were defective.

The other was an expanded CC-40 based generally on the same hardware called the [CC-40 Plus](https://oldcomputers.net/cc-40.html) (&#34;CC-40+&#34;), internally model &#34;CC40001&#34;. Externally similar, and still nominally a 6K unit (though an 18K version was planned), its biggest upgrade was a new built-in 9-pin port to finally support loading and saving to cassette tape. Although implemented as an internal peripheral with its own notional Hexbus device number (device 1, replacing the wafertape drive, though properly in the range designated for cassette devices), there is specific support and prompts in the CC-40+ ROM for driving it and the cable cannot be retrofitted to an original CC-40. To accommodate these and other possible changes the on-chip system ROM was expanded to 4K and thus was introduced the TMS70C40 to the CC-40 family.

The CC-40 Plus got as far as prototyping and a small number of test machines were produced before it, what then existed of the CC-70, and the CC-40 itself were all quietly cancelled in November 1984. No explanation could be publicly ascertained — until late in 1985, when a new device emerged from a different branch of the consumer products division.

Amidst the turmoil on the computer side of the business, TI&#39;s chip business was still doing well, and so were its calculators, still a solid product line since the 1970s. Why continue to fight in the business portables segment, reasoned management, when we can rework the already existing, already working CC-40 Plus into something appropriate for its size _that we already know how to sell_? And that was the TI-74 BASICALC, a new higher-end programmable calculator that was nothing less than the CC-40 Plus in a sleeker, smaller package, hitting markets in the summer of 1986 at an MSRP of $135 \[about $400 in 2025 dollars\].

The TI-74&#39;s marketing strongly emphasized its BASIC programmability, using this feature to set it apart from other calculators which were still largely programmed with some form of keystroke system. But all that came from the CC-40+, as did the 31-character screen (slightly smaller) and most of the same basic functions. Although the debugger in the CC-40 and CC-40 Plus was liquidated in the TI-74 to fit in its Algebraic Operating System (AOS) calculator mode, and the memory map was slightly altered and some BASIC functions removed, it was otherwise pretty much the same machine with 2K extra RAM in a more consumer friendly — and pocketable — form. This is one of my two units with its box and the printer accessory.

Although the TI-74 was introduced shortly before the high-end $200 TI-95 PROCALC in 1986, the PROCALC is nearly the same hardware, just with the 31-character display divided into two lines (one 16-character general line and five three-character function key descriptions on the second). It can accept the same peripherals and much of what I&#39;ll talk about in this history section applies to it, but it is not programmable in BASIC and is closer in feel and operation to the earlier TI-59 which it was positioned to succeed. While it is legitimately a member of the CC-40 family, I won&#39;t talk a great deal more about it in this specific article.

Unlike the CC-40, the TI-74 comes with its own clamshell hard case, and it uses 4 AAAs instead of AAs to make it even lighter. This one is serial #0001989 with a manufacture date of May 1987 (I-0587).

The TI-74 has only two ports. Like the CC-40 there is a cartridge slot, and like the CC-40 it can take ROM programs on cartridge as well as RAM expanders, though CC-40 ROMs don&#39;t work as is on the TI-74. Instead of the sliding top to expose the CC-40 cartridge&#39;s card edge, however, the male card edge is hidden in the cartridge slot and the cartridge actually has a female connector. Cartridges can be inserted and removed while the TI-74 is in the hard case (with the lid open).

The other port is a 10-pin (instead of 8-pin) I/O connector that the manual calls &#34;Dockbus.&#34; Once the TI-74&#39;s provenance was discovered, however, word quickly got around the CC-40/TI-74 community that Dockbus ... is just Hexbus with some extra pins, meaning existing Hexbus devices can be connected to the TI-74 with a simple passive converter.

The trick here is that two of the Dockbus lines are for power, both for the TI-74 to power connected peripherals and for a common supply _from_ a peripheral to power the TI-74. Like [the Convergent WorkSlate](/2024/09/programming-convergent-workslates.html), which had a similar feature, these pins allow peripherals to share power with the computer. They obviously should not be connected to a CC-40 Hexbus device, nor the Dockbus-specific reset line. TI wisely keyed this connector to avoid letting out any magic smoke.

Dockbus also has a little known &#34;user mode&#34; where, with two control lines placed in a recognized unusual configuration, an application can drive the four data lines directly to a device that knows how to communicate in this mode. As a consequence of the specification, compliant legacy Hexbus devices on the bus will ignore bus traffic when this mode is active. Dockbus user mode avoids nearly all of the Hexbus packet overhead and allows real-time signaling, but necessarily completely monopolizes the bus, and isn&#39;t supported by any of the classic Hexbus peripherals.

As an example, the PC-324 Dockbus thermal printer shown here (device 12) has a port for an AC adapter — which is just our old friend the AC 9201. When AC adapter is connected to the printer, and the printer is connected to the TI-74, then the adapter can power the printer and the printer can power the computer as well (so TI eliminated the AC adapter port on the TI-74). The printer is also capable of running on its own set of AA batteries.

A reduced family of peripherals were offered for the TI-74. The PC-324 printer was now the star of the show, to which the CI-7 cassette interface could also connect for power (or directly to the TI-74), and both devices would also work with the TI-95. The CI-7 actually relies on the non-standard Dockbus &#34;user mode&#34; and thus won&#39;t work with the CC-40.

In the initial rollout the PC-324 and CI-7 were the only two peripherals; there was never an RS-232 option. The TI-74 also had its own improved version of the 8K Constant Memory battery-backed RAM cartridge (there was likewise no 16K version, and a 32K version was never released). The ROM usefully added support directly to BASIC for saving but also _swapping_ RAM with the cartridge, and although it still carried its own backup lithium cell, as long as it was plugged in this cartridge could also draw power from the TI-74&#39;s batteries to avoid draining the lithium battery — even if the calculator was turned off. Finally, some of the CC-40&#39;s software packages were upgraded and ported to the TI-74, here initially the Statistics, Mathematics and Pascal cartridges, and later Finance and a BASICALC-specific Chemical Engineering cartridge. Some of these packages were also ported to the TI-95.

In 1989 TI introduced a new Dockbus peripheral for the TI-74 and TI-95, the PC-IF PC Interface. This device could connect to a DOS-based server on a standard PC via the PC&#39;s parallel port and exchange files with it for much faster performance than tape. It could also use the PC as a display terminal through the same server program, eliminating the need for the Hexbus video box. The PC-IF became a very popular accessory and the general concept has been expanded, [culminating in today&#39;s TIIF2](http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiif), though sadly the software is not open-source.

Finally, we&#39;ll crack it open to find the internals have become even more consolidated. The keyboard/LCD board is beneath this CPU board as before, but the CPU is now a 70C46 (ROM code C70009, here with a date code indicating 14th week 1986) and the functions of the CC-40&#39;s ASIC were built-in to the 70C46 except for the piezo beeper, which was removed. The CPU is slightly downclocked from the CC-40&#39;s 70C20, using a 4MHz crystal divided down for a clock speed of 2.0MHz, likely to save battery power given the smaller-capacity AAAs. Otherwise, there is a single HM6264 static RAM to provide 8K, and the 32K HN61256 system ROM. Apart from the usual HD44780/44100 combo driving the LCD, the custom CPU handles everything else, even the Dockbus.

The TI-74 (and TI-95) turned out to be very long-lived members of TI&#39;s calculator line and at least two updated versions of the TI-74 exist, confusingly named the TI-74S and the TI-74 S (note space between 74 and S). The S variants are application-specific TI-74s intended to be used with custom cartridges which can be field-programmed with an adapter and some even UV-erased. The original TI-74 is limited to a total of 16K between the on-board memory and cartridge memory, even if the RAM cartridge is larger than 8K; TI updated the TI-74S firmware to autorun an attached cartridge and to support up to 16K additional memory to BASIC (for 24K). In 1988 TI updated the TI-74S ROMs to support 32K RAM cartridges for a maximum total in BASIC of 40K, yielding the TI-74 S with a space. These later units can also be distinguished by their manufacturing dates, and since the change to maximum RAM is in software, it is possible to patch earlier units with a small assembly routine or replace their ROMs to do the same.

The TI-74 family remained available well into the early 1990s until it was discontinued around 1992, marking the end of the CC-40 and its descendants, and the end of our history. All that was to get you the context to understand the similarities and the differences between these machines, which will become very important a little later on. Let&#39;s get our CC-40 and TI-74 communicating with the outside world, and to do that we should start with the peripherals — old and new.

### Communication options with Hexbus

During the CC-40&#39;s days on the market, officially there were exactly two Hexbus peripheral options to allow it access to the outside world: the HX-3000 RS-232 box and the HX-3100 300bps modem. The RS-232 box could of course be connected to a separate external modem, but the Hexbus modem itself did not require the RS-232 box to function.

The RS-232 box, on top, has a female DB-25 port, AC adapter port (again using the AC 9201) and twin Hexbus ports for daisy-chaining. As I mentioned earlier when we looked at its innards, the deluxe HX-3000/P version has a ribbon cable sticking out the back with a DB-25 parallel port. This passive cable goes to a set of pin headers inside and can be secondarily added. While hardly any modern computers come with real serial ports anymore, let alone DB-25s, a &#34;DB-9&#34; (DE-9) female to DB-25 male converter cable like the StarTech AT925FM will give you a port that most USB serial adapters will directly connect to.

The modem, on the bottom, has a telephone connection switch, RJ-11 phone jacks (one for your line, one for your handset, since the modem can&#39;t dial), and also a set of Hexbus ports. The connection switch is not for answer/originate, as is typical with many non-Hayes 300bps modems where [the right modulation](/2025/01/the-35-cent-commodore-64-softmodem.html) had to be manually selected; rather, this switch is for whether the modem is listening to the line. To make a call, a user would set the switch to OFF, manually dial the remote system with their telephone handset, wait for the answer tone, and then flip the switch to ON.

Despite this, however, the modem is still an intelligent device — just not with AT commands. My unit here appears to be an early production device and has what looks like a pre-production CPU marked &#34;11006.&#34; This is in fact a TMS70C20A2NL, a revised but functionally equivalent version of the TMS70C20, downclocked to a slower 1.536MHz speed from a 3.072MHz crystal. Settings like answer/originate are controlled in software, which the CPU uses to configure the TMS99532 next to it, basically a 300bps Bell 103 modem on a chip. This chip uses a 4.032MHz crystal. The only other major IC is of course another 1052911 handling Hexbus traffic.

In fact, this particular HX-3100 modem is early enough that it lacks a bottom label, having only a serial number (#0000319) and manufacturing date (34th week 1983). But the biggest difference from the RS-232 box (serial #0001962, produced 49th week 1983) is that the modem can run on AC _or_ batteries: the TMS99532 pulls less juice than the 6551 ACIA and the modem&#39;s CPU runs at a slower clock speed, so unlike the RS-232 unit the modem can be truly portable. On the other hand, the RS-232 box would have most likely been connected to devices that weren&#39;t battery-powered either, so this isn&#39;t really a major flaw.

We won&#39;t talk further about the modem here, though it&#39;s certainly better than nothing, and since it doesn&#39;t require a dial tone you can have it manually answer any other compatible 300bps modem to exchange data using just an RJ-11 phone cord ( [your Commodore 64 can send data to it](/2025/01/the-35-cent-commodore-64-softmodem.html), for example). However, the RS-232 unit is capable of running up to 19.2kbps thanks to its onboard ACIA, a very impressive speed for the time particularly with this class of computer, and far faster than the modem. We will be treating it as our gold standard device for comparison purposes.

Unfortunately, both the modem and the RS-232 box have the same problem: ain&#39;t nobody making them.

Fortunately, the hobbyist community has since filled the gap and nowadays we have two main choices for Hexbus serial. While neither is perfect, both will work for the specific purposes in this article, though each has strengths over the other in various respects. Both connect to a host over USB using common serial drivers and can be bus-powered.

On the left is the original, [Jim Brain&#39;s HEXTIr](https://github.com/go4retro/HEXTIr). This is an Arduino-based device implementing a serial printer port (device 10), RS-232 port (device 20), SD card reader for loads and saves (device 100) and a battery-backed real-time clock (device 230). It is open-source hardware and firmware and yours truly has contributed improvements in the past which are now part of the current firmware package. Because it is an open-source unit, it is occasionally offered for sale in small quantities by various third parties and this was one of those that I bought some years ago; it came with a separate 3-D printed enclosure.

On the right is a newer entry, the [the TI Hexbus Serial USB Adapter](https://www.soigeneris.com/ti-hexbus-serial-usb-adapter) by StarDust and sold by Jeff Birt/Soigeneris, which I&#39;ll refer to as the &#34;StarDust adapter.&#34; It offers two serial ports, one with an on-board DB-25 and the other via USB (devices 27 and 26, respectively), and has multiple Hexbus connectors and a Dockbus connector. It is not an open-source design (I&#39;ve asked), but is sold and supported as a commercial product, and comes to you fully assembled with an enclosure of its own and ready to use. This device is particularly unique in that it has a basic configuration interface accessible as device 200, plus a simple console shell on either serial port. However, although it can also load and save files, this functionality requires a additional BackPack drive be connected to the DB-25 (as device 100) which is sold separately and requires its own battery.

Externally, the biggest difference is the connectors. Besides the USB-B jack, barrel power jack and SD card slot, the HEXTIr has a real male Hexbus port that you connect standard female-female Hexbus cables to. Depending on who made it (you?), this port may be unkeyed, so I wrote the orientation on the bottom in silver Sharpie ink. If you don&#39;t have Hexbus cables (whereas I have several, including a nice generous long one perfect for this purpose), you could probably just use a bundle of jumper wires, though this might be inconvenient on the CC-40&#39;s end.

The StarDust adapter goes a different way, besides using a micro-B USB jack: it uses 8-pin IDC connectors which are much more widely available, and it provides two of them allowing multiple devices to be connected. Soigeneris sells you cables to connect to these along with the necessary adapters. You&#39;ll need some to connect it to a CC-40, but the StarDust adapter is best paired with the TI-74 because it has built-in Dockbus and plugs directly into the port — it can even draw power from the Dockbus (switchable) if not connected to a USB source. If you don&#39;t need to connect to anything else, it can go right into a TI-74 and offer basic functionality straight from the shipping envelope.

Internally this particular HEXTIr is based on a clone Arduino Uno R3, though the firmware can run on anything Arduino-like with an ATmega328 or 328P. Here the SD card, Hexbus port and RTC are provided by a modified Arduino Logging Shield with some extra wires and pin-headers soldered on; no additional parts are required. If you simply want to use it as an SD card drive, the barrel jack can provide power, or you can connect the USB to a regular USB charger. You can also [fabricate your own PCB](https://github.com/go4retro/HEXTIr/tree/master/pcb).

Interestingly, the StarDust adapter is also AVR-based, in this case a Microchip AVR64DD32. It comes on a custom PCB with various jumpers, the micro USB-B port, the two 8-pin IDC ports and the female DB-25, with the Dockbus connector on the reverse. In both the HEXTIr and the StarDust adapter the Hexbus-serial link is bitbanged by the AVR, which has some consequences we&#39;ll run into when it comes to throughput.

Since I of course have plenty of real Hexbus cables, the HEXTIr is the most convenient to attach to the CC-40, though I&#39;ll come back to the StarDust adapter when we get to messing with the TI-74. Here I connect it to my M1 MacBook Air with a USB-A to USB-C converter for the serial link and power. The CC-40 is being run on a power adapter.

When bringing up the CC-40 (or TI-74), if you have the Hexbus connected but the device on the other end isn&#39;t powered on, the computer will show its I/O indicator on screen and then stall out. Instead, both the HEXTIr and StarDust adapter will immediately power up when connected to USB, and then the computer can be turned on after that.

Now that we&#39;ve met the hardware options, let&#39;s meet (one of) the software options. The CC-40 has a terminal program available on cartridge in combination with a simple word processor called Memo Processor. In my opinion this is one of the CC-40&#39;s truly essential cartridges and it (or a multicart) is usually plugged into mine. Document text is stored in the BASIC program space, so make sure you&#39;ve saved any program you were working on — say, to the HEXTIr&#39;s SD card — before starting the cartridge.

The key combinations for the Memo Processor are a bit arcane, but fortunately it comes with a nice spiral-bound manual (with the inevitable &#34;The Wafertape™ Digital Tape Drive is not available&#34; insert) and two keyboard overlays we can place over the main keyboard and numeric keypad to help us. This overlay also tells us what the LCD indicator marks are meant to designate. The cartridge has a single program on it called `MP`, so we enter (as the overlay hints us) `RUN&#34;MP&#34;` to start it up.

Telos Corporation was founded in Santa Monica, California in 1968 initially as a federal systems integrator that did contract development for military and space applications; perhaps their most famous work during this time was as part of the NASA Voyager 1 team, working on the real-time telemetry and image processing systems used in the space probe&#39;s 1979 Jupiter and Saturn fly-bys. Voyager 1 is now the most distant man-made object from Earth, over 15.8 billion miles from home as of November 2025, and as of this writing valiantly continues its extended interstellar mission.

With the advent of the microcomputer, even though a substantial percentage of its business remained government customers, Telos management started to steer the product line towards personal computing in the early 1980s as a means of diversification. These initiatives were consolidated under two 1983 subsidiaries, Telos Computing and Telos Software Products, with the latter developing Memo Processor for TI. However, Telos Software Products became much better known for Filevision, a 1984 product for the then-new Apple Macintosh that presented a graphical means of designing databases by linking on-screen graphic objects with data stores. It sold briskly to rave reviews and in 1985 users were creating applications for it as diverse as airport layouts and airline routes, rabbit farm management, and the state of bills in the Florida legislature — all real entries in that year&#39;s contest. Filevision subsequently evolved into a larger version in 1986 called Business Filevision, but HyperCard became seen as a superior means for constructing such interfaces after it emerged in 1987 and gradually displaced it. Although the Software Products subsidiary was ultimately dissolved in 2002, its parent Telos Corporation remains in business today (presently in Ashburn, Virginia) and still primarily as a vendor to government entities, but now with an [emphasis on cybersecurity](https://www.telos.com/company/history/).

... by default into the Word Processor mode, which is a line-oriented text editor. Many CC-40 owners used it for writing documents of non-trivial size and sending it to a larger computer via the serial port, though [a subtle bug](https://ftp.whtech.com/hexbus_cc40_ti74/cc40%20ti74%20hexbus.txt) can cause data loss for documents with unusual total lengths when the machine is powered off, even if batteries or an AC adapter are used. It supports lines up to 80 characters and could print directly. The manual gives you a very precise formula for computing available space, indicating the 6K CC-40 could contain 3,071 bytes for a document and the 18K could have 15,359 (though note that TAB characters take up three bytes and everything else just one). This is still a substantial available portion of the internal RAM, so maybe TI was onto something counting ROM as &#34;memory&#34; even though I hate it. A document can be sent over the serial port, and activity from the serial port can be recorded into a new document.

The MP has many key combinations. Key combinations can be entered either by holding down the modifier and pressing the key(s), or pressing the modifier once (the appropriate indicator will appear) and then pressing the key. The obvious ones are with SHIFT (highlighted in blue) and &#34;CTL&#34; (highlighted in maroon), but all the mode shifts are done with the FN key (highlighted in dark grey). Here we&#39;ll press FN-O (not zero) for the communication options page to make sure we are configured correctly. The settings page is only available while a connection is _not_ in progress, or otherwise you must &#34;hang up&#34; with FN-/ (forward slash).

The communication options page lets you set the Hexbus device (supported 20-27 or 70-77 for the RS-232 and modem ranges), baud rate (officially 110 or 300), data bits (7 or 8), parity (N/S/M/O/E), check parity, duplex and stop bits (1 or 2). Despite allowing the modem range, however, the MP actually predates the HX-3100 modem and it appears nowhere in the manual (only modems attached to the RS-232 box).

From the keyboard overlay you&#39;d get the idea that these are the only settings allowed, but in fact there is a hidden advanced settings page only mentioned parenthetically in the manual. When asked for the device number (i.e., at this prompt in the communications settings), press FN-Q instead, and you get a different prompt.

On this somewhat super s3kr1t screen you can enter an entire device configuration string, the same as you&#39;d use with a BASIC `OPEN` statement. You could set, for example, the HX-3100&#39;s answer/originate switch this way (which isn&#39;t part of the options page), but more relevantly to us you can set other bitrates. This is how we can hook up an HX-3000 RS-232 box and run it at its full 19200bps — such as, in this picture, over a USB-serial adapter to the M1 MacBook Air. FN-Q also works for printer settings and is in fact required for early versions of the printer/plotter (change `R=N` to `C=N`).

I mentioned that the two modern devices both have throughput considerations. If you have a StarDust adapter, you may occasionally drop characters unless you move its console to the serial port you&#39;re not using (e.g., if you&#39;re connected over USB, `set console serial`), and all but the most recent firmware doesn&#39;t work right with the default 300bps. However, once the console is redirected it seems to run fine at 19200bps with the same settings as the HX-3000, using either device 26 or 27. (This is not true for the TI-74, but I&#39;ll get to that later.)

The HEXTIr&#39;s firmware, on the other hand, has a very small receive buffer and to date I have not had success fixing this. While it might be better with a later CPU, this Uno R3 can only reliably work asynchronously at 300bps, and in that case the MP&#39;s default settings are best.

Either way, at this point you can now press FN-, (comma) and go online with your device.

And here we are, connected to the world (the other end is `picocom` on the M1 MBA). In the manual, this mode is specifically advertised for contemporary time-sharing systems such as CompuServe and in particular TCA&#39;s [The Source](/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html), running on Dialcom Prime minicomputers and accessed via the Telenet nationwide packet-switched network. Both of these services provided typical features such as stock quotes, headline news, a reference library, shopping and E-mail. The manual also advertises Texas Instruments&#39; own TEXNET (not to be confused with the current State of Texas electronic payment system) operated as an overlay on The Source, providing &#34;1200 services and programs&#34; such as an electronic newsletter, a nationwide listing of TI user groups and service centres, a listing of available software (but for the 99/4A, not the CC-40), and the TI Submit service which &#34;enables TEXNET users to submit software programs electronically to any of TI&#39;s software exchanges, including the International 99/4 Users-Group, Inc.&#34; TI planned to offer client software that would take advantage of the 99/4A speech synthesizer and its sound and graphics hardware, but this was never realized before the demise of the home computer line. Nevertheless, TI kept TEXNET in operation for several years even through the Reader&#39;s Digest buyout of The Source, revamping it in 1984 before decommissioning the service around 1987 due to the dwindling 99/4A user base. CompuServe subsequently bought out and shut down The Source completely in 1989.

In terminal mode the MP presents a 31x1 window on an 80x24 virtual screen, though it implements no particular kind of terminal emulation, and even things like backspace and delete require control-key combinations (CTL-H and CTL-down respectively). XON/XOFF (CTL-S and CTL-Q) pause the display so that you can use the arrow keys to scroll, or FN-up/FN-down to jump to the top or bottom, or page the display with FN-S (FN-A to do so automatically).

The MP behaves very curiously with Hexbus. In TI&#39;s original conception of how Hexbus-based systems would communicate over RS-232, everything was synchronous and done in record-based transactions, which fit the Hexbus packet model well. This is typically the way you would drive such devices from BASIC, and all known Hexbus RS-232 devices including the HEXTIr and StarDust support this and (except for the modem) at high speed. However, this type of operation doesn&#39;t work effectively at all for _asynchronous_ communications like a dummy terminal, which was exactly the type of service link the MP was intended to support. Although the HX-3000 RS-232 box, and later the HX-3100 modem, are capable of interrupting the main computer when data has arrived — which should have made connections very fast and seamless — the problem is that when this happens, the computer only knows that an interrupt has occurred and not what caused it, and as we mentioned earlier is thus obliged to poll any and all enabled devices on the bus to find out. Depending on the configuration, this could be a rather slow process and as a result end up losing data.

So the MP&#39;s solution is brute-force: it polls the bus incessantly, asking the selected device over and over if data has arrived and grabbing the response immediately if so. This shows up as the I/O indicator flickering non-stop on the LCD and the amber LED on the modem or RS-232 box remaining lit while on-line. This behaviour solves the data problem, which is the most critical, but at the price of reduced battery life and a lot more inefficient Hexbus traffic. It&#39;s also really rough on the HEXTIr and StarDust adapters which must bitbang Hexbus and serial in software at the same time (unlike the HX-3000 with its own dedicated ACIA and bus transceiver). Still, this method is the least unreliable way to run a terminal program the way Hexbus is implemented, at least for the CC-40 family.

Memo Processor suffices for the CC-40 itself, but the TI-74 doesn&#39;t have a terminal program of any sort that I know of. TI likely intended the PC-IF to handle this role. That seems unnecessary.

### The first? terminal program for the TI-74 BASICALC

I&#39;m going to stake a claim to being the author of the first terminal program for the BASICALC, but TI doesn&#39;t make it easy. It&#39;s just not possible to drive Hexbus at high speeds from BASIC on the CC-40 and this goes double for the TI-74 where the CPU is downclocked, so now we need to turn to assembly language. Let&#39;s talk more about the TMS7000 series of processors.

Typical of early 8-bit architectures, the TMS7000 family has very few canonical registers, although it also notably lacks a typical accumulator. Instead, it uses its internal RAM like a mashup of the 9900/9995 and the Intel 8051: its RAM maps to the lowest page in memory (either $00-$7f or $00-$ff depending on the specific variant) with most instructions referencing them as 128 or 256 individual 8-bit registers (R0-R255) or 64 or 128 16-bit pairs. This is analogous to IRAM in the 8051 or zero page in the 680x/6502, though registers 0 and 1 are also specially aliased to &#34;accumulators&#34; A and B in certain addressing modes, and the instruction set is not highly orthogonal. The internal RAM is also used for the stack, referenced by an 8-bit stack pointer; apart from that, an eight-bit status register and 16-bit program counter are the only other true registers. Unlike the Harvard architecture of the 8051, the 7000 family is von Neumann, so the internal ROM occupies the same address space. In the CC-40 the TMS70C20&#39;s internal ROM is 2K, while in the TI-74/95 the TMS70C46&#39;s internal ROM is 4K. The TMS7000 family is fundamentally, even aggressively, big-endian and this has consequences we&#39;ll discuss shortly.

As with any microcontroller, the chips have substantial built-in I/O facilities realized as timers and ports. These onboard peripherals are handled as memory-mapped I/O from $0100-$01ff as the &#34;peripheral file&#34; and referenced as P0-P255 by specific instructions. Both the CC-40 and TI-74/95 CPUs have a single timer controlled in this range, but the CC-40 TMS70C20 has 32 I/O lines (eight inputs, eight outputs, 16 bidirectional) while the TI-74/95 TMS70C46 has eight more bidirectional lines explicitly dedicated to servicing Dockbus/Hexbus. Because the I/O lines overlap with the address and data lines, some number of them are lost when accessing off-chip resources. In these machines both microcontrollers run in what the data sheet refers to as &#34;full expansion&#34; mode, where external resources (RAM in this case) are available between $0200 and the bottom of internal ROM at the top of the addressing space. Twenty I/O pins are reserved for the multiplexed address and data busses in this mode, leaving eight inputs and four outputs (and the TMS70C46&#39;s eight additional bidirectional lines) uncontended, plus the single timer. Four levels, six in certain members, of interrupt priority are available. This range is where the CPU controls the bus, beeper (CC-40 only), battery sense, keyboard and LCD.

The precedessor TMS1000 family had landed many design wins as an ultra-low-cost microcontroller ( [such as in games](/2023/01/here-be-four-bits-of-dragons-mattel.html)), shipping close to 100 million units over its lifetime, and TI wanted to preserve what it perceived had made it popular. Like the TMS1000, the TMS7000 family is heavily microcoded, and TI specifically advertised (again like the TMS1000) that developers could alter the microcode to best suit their purposes. A manufacturer could submit both their desired microcode and mask ROM contents and get back a big bunch of cheap, capable chips ready to send to the factory. However, also like the TMS1000, few users of the TMS7000 developed their own microcode — instead, what ended up winning over developers was its price-performance ratio, which turned out to be excellent. Besides efficient bit-test instructions, it also directly supported BCD math (making it useful for calculators and cash registers) and had an extremely fast 8x8 hardware integer multiplier, and its code density allowed ROM usage to be anywhere from 30-45% less. Although its instruction cycle count was no match for non-microcoded processors like the MOS 6502, the TMS7000 made up for this with its flexibility and much faster clock speeds, and most of its putative competition (e.g., the Motorola 6801, Zilog Z8, Intel MCS-51) had the same drawbacks. Combine that with its ready availability in large quantities, and TI had a winner.

As a result, the TMS7000 family was a competitive microcontroller option during the 1980s and even early 1990s, appearing in many diverse applications such as point of sale terminals, handheld games (MAME emulates the Tiger Punch Your Lights Out), peripheral controllers (like the keyboard in the Olivetti M24), pinball machines (the audio controller in [68K-based Technoplay pins](https://www.ipdb.org/search.pl?searchtype=advanced&#38;mfgid=313)) and one-armed bandits, or pokies as my wife would call them. In fact, my parents&#39; first burglar alarm was a TMS7000-based system because I remember looking at the circuit board while Dad was installing it and noticing it had a TMS7-something as the CPU (I think a TMS70C20 but that was many years ago and it was ripped out since). This stuck in my memory because as a kid I had recently cracked open my Tomy Tutor and wondered if its TMS9995 was related (they&#39;re not).

Indeed, one place the TMS7000 was _not_ found much was in standalone microcomputers. Its instruction set was incompatible with everything else, even TI&#39;s other CPU lines, and its advantages in embedded systems didn&#39;t really translate to general purpose machines. A rare exception was the French Exelvision EXL 100 and EXELTEL home computers, another competitor for the French _Plan Informatique pour Tous_ (&#34;Computing for All Plan&#34;) — compare with [the Thomson MO5](/2025/06/see-jane-128-by-arktronics-run.html) — that saw limited use in French schools. The use of TI chips in the Exelvision family was largely because Exelvision consisted primarily of former TI employees, and their CPUs are one of the uncommon ones with custom microcode to accelerate their custom VDP. Otherwise, aside from TI&#39;s own development SBCs, the closest thing most of us will get to a TMS7000-powered computer are our twin friends here.

TI provided many development resources for creating TMS7000 systems, including full-blown [evaluation systems](http://www.bitsavers.org/components/ti/TMS7000/evm/electrickery.nl/) with in-circuit emulation, and much software for writing programs. Since those development systems are rare and the CC-40 Editor/Assembler cartridge was stillborne, many of the tools modern homebrewers use come from TI&#39;s own TI-74 SDK (which can be adapted for the CC-40), some of which is proprietary and difficult to find, and others from the TI-74 PC-IF package, which are closed source and must run in MS-DOS but are easier to track down. For expediency I have elected to use one of those tools, though with a little help we won&#39;t need to dig out an old PC or shoehorn it into DOSBox.

Due to various implementational choices and the TMS7000&#39;s own strong big-endian orientation, one feels like you&#39;re coding in a mirror when working with these two machines. The stack is at the bottom of memory and grows up (compare with, say, the Motorola 6800 which is also big-endian but has a 16-bit stack pointer growing down), and instructions referencing a register pair X operate on addresses X-1 (MSB) and X (LSB), not X (MSB) and X+1 (LSB). To save space on loops that must frequently test for equality, the operating system tends to put everything at high addresses working down to low (so testing the end condition just means a decrement and looking at the processor&#39;s zero flag). This idiom was specifically catered to in the instruction set and obligatory for achieving the highest code density, so buffers and strings are usually stored in reverse order in memory, and programs are often loaded at the top of a given range.

For reasons which will become very clear, I found it most straightforward to create the terminal program for the TI-74 on the CC-40 first, and this also gives CC-40 users without the Memo Processor cartridge an alternative as well. In this picture you can see the nest of wires and bus lines on my work table with the HEXTIr and StarDust adapters daisy-chained over Hexbus. Yes, they coexist together just fine since their device numbers largely do not conflict (the HEXTIr&#39;s SD card slot is the sole device #100 as there is no BackPack drive connected to the StarDust) and both appear as different serial ports to the MacBook Air.

The CC-40, and subsequently the TI-74 and TI-95, has a very modular operating system. The 2K internal mask ROM in the TMS70C20, which maps to $f800-$ffff, contains the lowest level reset code and system control drivers. However, the 32K BASIC ROM, which contains BASIC and the rest of the OS&#39; higher level calls, is only banked in with 8K blocks (at $d000-$efff). This allows sufficient space for any installed cartridge&#39;s ROM or RAM ($5000-$cfff), portions of which can also be banked in and out if needed. The low 2K system RAM appears at $0800, and then BASIC text starts at $1000 up to $1fff (6K) or $4fff (18K); the address range $0200-$07ff is otherwise unpopulated. One of the very important routines in the CC-40&#39;s 2K ROM is `CALPAG`, a routine that takes a page number (0-3) in A and routine number in B, banks in the appropriate page, and makes the call. The vast majority of system calls on the CC-40 and TI-74/95 must be called through this routine; even in the 4K mask ROM of the TI-74/95 only a minimum number of system routines are always accessible. Another major routine in high ROM would be `IOS`, used for commanding devices through the I/O subsystem. In our case, this will be our Hexbus serial ports.

Because the TI-74 descends from the CC-40 Plus, substantial portions of the two systems&#39; firmware are not only compatible but practically identical, even down to their usage of internal RAM registers. Most of the same calls also exist on both systems, but the calling _convention_ is where the most critical difference lies. To incorporate cassette support, and later the extra calculator math routines, not even the extra 2K of RAM in the TMS70C40 (on which the TMS70C46 is based, not the TMS70C42) turned out to be enough to accommodate it. TI solved this problem in two ways. The first was to gut the system ROM, tossing out features not deemed germane to its primary purpose as a calculator such as the internal debugger and direct memory access. This, plus convenience, is the main reason we&#39;re writing the proof-of-concept on the CC-40 first.

The second way TI squeezed everything in was to change the way routines are called. A `CALPAG`-assisted call on the CC-40 looks something like this (using canonical TI assembler syntax):

```
    movd %&#62;0036,b
    call &#62;f836

```

or, as I prefer to write it since this is slightly faster and takes up the same number of bytes (seven),

```
    mov %&#62;00,a
    mov %&#62;36,b
    call &#62;f836

```

both of which will call the `DSPCHR` routine in the BASIC ROM. This routine expects a character in $5c and writes it to the screen in character position $53. (Notice that the 16-bit `movd` is to B, not A, because 16-bit operations work with X-1 as the MSB and X as the LSB.) On the TI-74, the register usage is the same, but the call stanza is markedly shorter:

```
    trap 20
    byte 18

```

This is just _two_ bytes to make the same call, a savings of 71% (!). The `trap` instruction pushes the program counter like any other subroutine call and pulls the destination address from vectors at $ffd0 (stored, you guessed it, backwards), all in a single byte and in the same cycle count as `call`. Although the `trap` instruction is legal and exists on the TMS70C20 also, TI made the heaviest use of it here, though not all system calls were converted to traps. It is therefore feasible in our cross-assembled source to have assemble-time defines to select either the CC-40 or TI-74 calling convention (such as different macros), yet have most of the core assembler source be otherwise the same. This can be used to build both versions off a single source file and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;ve done.

To actually run our program, we&#39;ll need to get into memory, and we&#39;d prefer not to have to deal with creating a cartridge ROM (perhaps in [a future article](/search/label/cc40)) — ideally it should be something we can type in or load from an SD card or a BackPack drive. Happily, this task is greatly facilitated by the various memory management subprograms in CC-40 BASIC, meaning we can just create a BASIC loader and have it store everything in RAM. TI BASIC in its various forms is unusual for its heavy reliance on subprograms, which are separate modules (usually in a low-level language like assembly or 99/4 GPL, but also supported in CC-40 BASIC with the `SUB` keyword) activated with the `CALL` keyword, like `CALL CHAR` to redefine the shape of a character. (Even Tomy Tutor BASIC has subprograms internally, being descended from TI Extended BASIC, though you can&#39;t create more and Tomy wisely eliminated the need for the `CALL` keyword.) CC-40 cartridges can even provide subprograms of their own for immediate use with BASIC.

The relevant subprograms for our task here are `CALL GETMEM`, `POKE` (and if needed `PEEK`), `EXEC` and `RELMEM`. `CALL GETMEM` is basically `malloc()`, accepting a request to reserve a certain amount of bytes of memory and returning the address where it was allocated; `CALL RELMEM` is, analogously, `free()`. Once the memory is reserved, we can `CALL POKE` to populate it, taking advantage of the fact it allows storing multiple values in one statement, and then run the program with `CALL EXEC`. Here&#39;s the finished product for the CC-40. It is indeed short enough that you can just key it in, if you want, or you can get `CCATRM.PGM` from [the Github project](https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm) and run it from the HEXTIr or BackPack (e.g., `RUN&#34;100.CCATRM.PGM&#34;`).

This code is generated from the assembled binary with a Perl preprocessor and then tokenized using Texas Instruments&#39; `TIC74.EXE` utility (works for both CC-40 and TI-74), which is available under `Utils/` in the [TIIF/TIIF2 archive](http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiif). Naturally, that&#39;s an MS-DOS executable, so to run it as part of the build process we use David Lee&#39;s [NT Virtual DOS Machine](https://github.com/davidly/ntvdm) as the emulator. To keep it short I&#39;ve eliminated niceties like the cursor, which isn&#39;t strictly needed for navigation on a single-line display, and which also makes it a bit quicker.


By default the terminal program opens an 300bps, 8N1 connection using device 20, which will work for the HX-3000 and the HEXTIr. If you want to use a different device, change the `20` in line 99 and line 110; if you want to change the baud rate, change the `300` in line 99. This is the same string you would use in, for example, Memo Processor with FN-Q. Here&#39;s the StarDust connecting at 19.2kbps:

This terminal program scrolls horizontally like the MP does, except it keeps no history in memory. For convenience, CLR is mapped to BACKSPACE (^H), ENTER to LF (^J), SHIFT-ENTER to CR (^M) and DEL (SHIFT-back arrow) to DEL (^?), and it will accept either BS or DEL as backspace from the remote system. If you press OFF or BREAK, it exits to BASIC (OFF is a soft-key; it isn&#39;t attached to the power circuit). If it beeps at you when you try to send characters, there was an I/O error and you should press OFF and `RUN` the program again to recover (the error message may or may not be displayed by BASIC).

There are a few important things to [note about our code](https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm/blob/main/asmtrm/asmtrm.a7k). Because we have no idea where we will get loaded to, our assembler source must exclusively use relative branches internally (dealing with limited displacements with jump islands), with the only absolute addresses being outside our program to specific registers and ROM calls. This limitation is not necessary with a cartridge. We also reuse some briefly idle portions of BASIC&#39;s memory for our own temporary storage, such as keeping both the buffer for Hexbus data and our scrolling screen line in the BASIC input buffer. These are stored (yet again) reversed because TI. To talk to the external device, we create a temporary Peripheral Access Block in the section of internal RAM BASIC itself uses for this purpose. This structure contains addresses for buffers and the Hexbus command bytes, and is passed to `IOS` to send out on the bus and gather a reply. We don&#39;t need to do this to initially configure the device, however, because the `OPEN` statement in our BASIC loader will do that for us (channel #1 is otherwise unused). We use the same brute-force method as MP because that&#39;s the least bad way to accomplish what we need reliably, though we have slightly less overhead, so we can maintain better data rates.

TI provided their own assembler, but here we use the well-known multi-architecture [Macroassembler AS](http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/) which is what I use for most architectures that aren&#39;t the 6502 or PowerPC. AS does not accept canonical TI syntax, so specify hex and immediates as you see them in the source file, and be cautious about modification as it will attempt to emit instructions for mnemonics the 70C20 may not support. One glitch, possibly to be fixed in the future, is that `movd #...,b` assembles incorrectly: you need to specify the register by number. (Not much of a loss because `mov #..,a` and `mov #..,b` _do_ work, and together they generate code that is the same size yet slightly faster.)

That&#39;s the CC-40 done. Unfortunately, to get this running on the TI-74 requires a bit more work because `CALL GETMEM`, `RELMEM`, `POKE` and `EXEC` are part of the multiple subprograms TI liquidated to get everything to fit. But there&#39;s nothing that says you can&#39;t store a subprogram in _RAM_.

These subprograms would naturally be needed for on-device development purposes, so TI quietly made them available, and nowadays they are also part of [the TIIF/TIIF2 package](http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiif). You can load these files into the TI-74 using TIIF if you have a PC-IF and a Windows PC, but I don&#39;t, so I&#39;m going to use the HEXTIr to do so (the BackPack drive will also work). Unzip `TIIF.ZIP` and from `TIIF/Utils/UTIL74/`, copy `EXEC.SUB`, `GETMEM.SUB`, `LOAD.PGM`, `POKE.SUB` and `RELMEM.SUB` to the SD card, then load and run `LOAD.PGM` (e.g., `RUN&#34;100.LOAD.PGM&#34;`).

Don&#39;t bother trying to list `LOAD.PGM` because you can&#39;t — it&#39;s not actually a BASIC program. Rather, it&#39;s a machine language subroutine that will bootstrap loading new subprograms into memory.

As before, it runs as a BASIC program (either directly with `RUN` or from your storage media, e.g., `RUN&#34;100.74ATRM.PGM&#34;`). If you get an error when you run it, most likely you forgot to load the subprograms. Go back a couple steps and do that first.

This version defaults to device 26 (i.e., the StarDust USB port) at 300bps, which with the current firmware is a generally reliable speed. Like with the CC-40 version, you can use a different device number by changing the `26` in lines 99 and 110, and different device settings and bitrates by changing the string in line 99. The slower CPU in the TI-74 is not able to maintain reliable communications at 19.2kbps (since we&#39;re brute-forcing the Hexbus link, it&#39;s understandable that the maximum data rate would depend on the CPU&#39;s clock speed); the TI-74 will throw frequent I/O errors at this speed, sometimes severe enough that it will lock up the StarDust and the machine will need to be powercycled. Doing so won&#39;t erase anything in memory, but it&#39;s inconvenient. 9600bps is a decent compromise, though even that will still throw an error now and then, so 4800bps or 2400bps might be better and 4800bps is what I use personally.

Once you have things the way you want them, you could consider putting it on a Constant Memory cartridge with a `CALL PUT(1)` so you don&#39;t have to keep doing so (and either a `CALL GET(1)` to retrieve it, or `CALL GET(-1)` to swap memory contents). This helpfully stores not only the terminal program but also all the subprograms you have loaded into memory. If you do this, I advise unplugging the cartridge if you won&#39;t be using the TI-74 for awhile or if you remove its batteries, because once the main AAAs run down the computer may draw on the lithium cell in the cartridge to keep its own memory contents alive and kill it quicker. Don&#39;t ask me how I know this.

There are some minor differences in the TI-74 version. As it has no beeper, if there is an I/O error the terminal program will instead turn on some of the LCD&#39;s on-screen indicators in an obviously impossible configuration. Press OFF to exit (as with the CC-40 version), after which more information may be displayed. The key shortcuts are still supported (such as CLR for BS/^H), though note that DEL on the TI-74 is SHIFT-7, and because SHIFT-ENTER is the equals sign the TI-74 version moves CR/^M to the RUN key.

Okay, we now have both the CC-40 and the TI-74 talking to a serial port. What can we do with that? Well, as our last stop, I did promise you Gopherspace, didn&#39;t I?

### Finally, of one-line shells and Gopher clients

And I don&#39;t mean a shell or a Gopher client that&#39;s a one-liner — we need to think about how to meaningfully present information formatted for a full-size screen on a single-row, 31-column display. Since we&#39;re not running the client on the actual computer itself, this gives us some options for what&#39;s effectively server-side rendering, but we&#39;re still constrained by the limited amount of text we can display at any one time.

Paging is unavoidable, but because Gopher menus and text documents are line-oriented we can do so line-by-line. Also, since both Memo Processor and our hacky miniterm can scroll the screen, we can use this mechanic for communicating longer continuous lines to the user (the visual effect is even heightened at slower bit rates, which is a helpful side effect). So that we can more efficiently move through a document, we can also allow the user to quickly jump to the next line instead of having to scroll the entirety of a line they might not want to page through. For those sorts of navigational commands we&#39;ll just use single keypresses, accepting a text string from the user as necessary.

To hook up our software clients to the serial port, we&#39;ll dust off the old `usb2ppp` tool we originally wrote for the [Brother GeoBook](/2023/06/o-brother-geobook-lets-get-thou-back-on.html), but which can actually run any program over a serial port without having to mess with things like `getty` as long as you have appropriate permissions to the device. (Linux people, [check your `udev` rules](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udev).) For convenience I have included it in [the Github project](https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm) for this article, and it can be compiled on most Un\*x-like systems with something approximating `cc -O3 -o usb2ppp usb2ppp.c` (only `termios.h` and the basic standard library are required). Both clients are in the Github project.

I&#39;ve dubbed the gopher client [the &#34;GOLM&#34; (Gopher One Line Mangler)](https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm/blob/main/golm.pl). It&#39;s written in Perl 5 (so there), so you can easily modify it, and it runs under `usb2ppp` with something like (on my MacBook Air) `./usb2ppp /dev/cu.usbserial-110 300 perl golm.pl` which runs it over `/dev/cu.usbserial-110` at 300bps. Since this is the kind of thing you&#39;d really want to see live and in action, here&#39;s a short video (YouTube link) with the CC-40 running the HEXTIr at 300bps.

The client has a very basic built-in quick menu when you start it (basically the Floodgap gopher and Veronica-2). You can scroll through lines with the ENTER key, or immediately jump to the next line with the SPACE bar, or move backwards with the CLR \[backspace\] key. The G key goes to a menu link, the L key opens a new location, the B key goes back in your history (resuming at the same line you left) and the Q key quits. Here, we browse the Floodgap menu, then search Veronica-2 for some hot hot Texas Instruments action (using the CLR \[backspace\] key to move back up to the menu item we want), and read about it in text. This is all live, on real Gopher servers. There you are — Gopherspace on a Texas Instruments Compact Computer 40.

I&#39;m pretty patient with my geriatric machines but even considering that I found the interface quite useable even at 300bps. Naturally, when I got it working, I had to see if the idea could work for other things. Is this sort of interface generalizeable? Like, what if we could run a shell prompt this way?


Well! No need to imagine because _of course_ I decided to write up a proof of concept, just to see. It&#39;s in Perl too, named [the SLOSH (&#34;Single Line Onscreen SHell&#34;)](https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm/blob/main/slosh.pl), and you can start it with something like `./usb2ppp /dev/cu.usbserial-D3B19P0Y 4800 perl slosh.pl`. Here it is, this time on the TI-74 with the StarDust adapter at 4800bps (also YouTube due to size):

With a long USB cable (or [a wireless link](/2025/05/what-went-wrong-with-wireless-usb.html), I guess), you could do this kind of thing right from your couch. In this example, I listed out my development directory, tried a few real commands, attempted to vainly browse Google&#39;s home page with `curl` (worked sort of), and read a `man` page ( `man`&#39;s `man` page, the `man` liest `man` page there is). There is a very simple prompt which uses your `PATH` to find utilities (it will print an `X` if it can&#39;t find it so that at 300bps you don&#39;t have to get annoyed scrolling `Command not found you idjit` in longhand all the time). When you&#39;re done, type `exit`.

The main advancement you may have noticed here is that spaces were compressed in the output so you could see more on the screen and blank lines were dropped. I have this implemented in the gopher client, too, but Gopher menus are usually written for fixed width fonts and spaces and blank lines are often salient, so shrink-wrapping of this sort is off there by default. The `$WIDTH` and `$SHRINK` environment variables (use `set KEY=value` to change) control the width of the scrolling display and whether spaces should be squished together (tabs are handled properly). If you want to play with this in the Gopher client, set the environment variable(s) before starting `golm.pl`.

It should go without saying you shouldn&#39;t use this as your real shell, or at least not yet, because there are a lot of edge cases to iron out. Necessarily this must connect a pipe to the command so we can paginate it, which some commands aren&#39;t going to tolerate well (I also don&#39;t hoover up the entire output into memory since we have no idea how big that might be, so you can&#39;t back up to a prior line presently), and this may not work properly with some sorts of pipe chains. There is at least code to check for some shell metacharacters so you can still redirect output to a file if you want, but I&#39;m sure it can be fooled, and I&#39;m sure some of you will attempt to.

I wrote both of these clients in a generic fashion such that any pocket or handheld computer with a single line display could use one of these clients: they are not in any way specific to the CC-40 or TI-74. If someone came up with a serial port option for my beloved Tandy PC-4 (there&#39;s an idea), you could set `$WIDTH` to 11 characters (!!) and see how far you get. I&#39;d be interested to hear how this works on other handheld systems if someone gets the idea to try.

To build your own version of the `ASMTRM` terminal utility, you&#39;ll need `make`, Perl 5, the Macroassembler AS, `TIC74.EXE` (under `Utils/` in the TIFF/TIFF2 distribution), and [NTVDM](https://github.com/davidly/ntvdm); see the `README` for instructions. Both Perl clients, the C source for `usb2ppp` and the assembly source for the CC-40/TI-74 terminal program are in [this blog post&#39;s Github project](https://github.com/classilla/asmtrm). `ASMTRM`, SLOSH and GOLM are all released under the BSD 2-clause license.</source:markdown>

        Way back (well, six months ago, anyway), when I was <a href="/2025/06/refurb-weekend-gremlin-blasto-arcade.html">wiring up a Gremlin Blasto arcade board</a>, we talked at length about this 1978 arcade game's history and its sole official home computer port by Milton Bradley to the Texas Instruments 99/4A. In the single player mode you run around in a maze and try to blow up all the mines, which can set off sometimes impressive chain reactions, all the while making sure you yourself don't go up in flames in the process.
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEha4Uf6wofBVDiOiNW2Kt7CdhVqgrc5_7Zd3L_cNJHZi2NF9qX-QDBOgx0tlmDLvpJO9QrAJ5R-QATxV9luz1xuD9m56U-6ABPdvfR0Bi8JBOkyYekX2oYWvplXRonHBpve4hIgIkuWU1gvoIGLEHmGnE0d0l2EljcG0S5XNeKF8zxlMgM492ZRk5qPXCw/s1120/big-0011.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="864" data-original-width="1120" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEha4Uf6wofBVDiOiNW2Kt7CdhVqgrc5_7Zd3L_cNJHZi2NF9qX-QDBOgx0tlmDLvpJO9QrAJ5R-QATxV9luz1xuD9m56U-6ABPdvfR0Bi8JBOkyYekX2oYWvplXRonHBpve4hIgIkuWU1gvoIGLEHmGnE0d0l2EljcG0S5XNeKF8zxlMgM492ZRk5qPXCw/s320/big-0011.png"/></a></div>
        
        The TI-99/4A version was the Blasto I originally remember playing as I never did play Blasto in the arcades. (Also, for the record, we're not talking about Sony's unrelated Blasto for the PlayStation which, other than having the voice talents of the late and lamented Phil Hartman, was apparently a traumatic slog both for its developers and the few people who actually played it.) To the credit of its three composite authors, it is a competent and accurate conversion that also adds configurable options, colour graphics and music; in fact, TI's Blasto is probably my favourite game on the /4A, more so than any other cartridge. On the other hand, <em>because</em> it's an accurate conversion, it also inherits all of the original's weaknesses, which admittedly hail from the limited CPU and ROM capacity of the arcade hardware.
        <p>
        So, in that article, I mentioned two <a href="/search/label/blasto">future Blasto projects</a>. One is to save my pennies for a custom arcade cabinet to put the board in, though I just spent a cool grand plus on tires which used up a lot of those pennies and I've also got Christmas presents to buy. But the second was to write my own take on TI Blasto and soup it up. This project is the second one <a href="/search/label/bucketlist">from my bucket list</a> that I've completed. It took a couple years of work on it off and on, but it's finally done, with faster action and animation, a massive number of procedurally generated screens, and fully configurable gameplay.

        I've christened it Oblast, and it's free to play on your real Commodore 64 or emulator. Let's talk about what's the same and what's different.

        The antediluvian <a href="/2025/06/refurb-weekend-gremlin-blasto-arcade.html">1978 Blasto</a> ran on Hustle hardware, which was derived from Gremlin's original (and mercilessly copied) Blockade game as designed by Lane Hauck. Programmer Bill Blewitt managed to squeeze Blasto's entire game code, not counting character graphics, into just 2K of ROM. This code had to generate and draw the maze, handle one or two player inputs, handle their projectiles, check for collisions and trigger the audio and "boom" circuits, all while simultaneously setting off explosions that could trigger other explosions and other collisions. In the upright version it also had free game logic. Given its hardware and software size constraints the arcade game's gameplay limitations, which we'll discuss in a moment, were understandable.

        When Milton Bradley picked up the license (from Gremlin's new owner Sega) as a developer for the new TI 99/4, they kept the gameplay and basic rules in their home computer port almost identical.

        Instead, the programmers added music tracks, a colour display, and multiple configuration options. You could set not only the game's speed (I always played Full Tilt) ...

        ... but also how the maze was drawn, including whether trails existed (areas of the map pre-cleared for motion) and how dense the mines were.

        Likely as a way to emphasize the TMS9918(A)'s colour capabilities, the MB programmers changed the setting of the game to a green earth-bound landscape with blue (?) mines and reworked the spaceships into tanks. The density option probably had an even greater impact on gameplay than the speed setting because a maze with a lot of mines made for a zippier, more explosive game. You could rig some big bangs this way, though these were sadly were let down by the TMS9919/SN76489's relatively weak noise output. The program also vainly tried to play a simple tune during the game but this was inevitably interrupted and forced to start over by any sound effect (i.e., a tank shooting, mines exploding).
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilLTm84uzcnyfbdJOuUodPsQdwZMO69EvkwUUKWkCxhvb2RhwzHhW9BhFPQFvRaGSsuCehLqNd-GSxiKot0JOy2aLcpH9n0R-BXIErbKy1Day7C-1xQ24sJJ60NgoRKEKRdQIyd-tV67WZTyXbBNJ3L4jLtFK1tUmdF4-6DBD10coWkOlLEceZ8xtsMq0/s1120/big-0037a.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="864" data-original-width="1120" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilLTm84uzcnyfbdJOuUodPsQdwZMO69EvkwUUKWkCxhvb2RhwzHhW9BhFPQFvRaGSsuCehLqNd-GSxiKot0JOy2aLcpH9n0R-BXIErbKy1Day7C-1xQ24sJJ60NgoRKEKRdQIyd-tV67WZTyXbBNJ3L4jLtFK1tUmdF4-6DBD10coWkOlLEceZ8xtsMq0/s320/big-0037a.png"/></a></div>
        
        As with the original, you have infinite lives but finite time. If you trip on an explosion, or the other player shoots you in two-player mode, you lose valuable seconds until you respawn. However, you respawn at your original spawn point as if you were teleported there, a conceivable failure mode for a fanciful spaceship but an extremely unlikely one for a terrestrial tank, which makes a good segue into some of its other idiosyncrasies:
        <p><ul>
        <li>Each player can only have a single projectile in motion at any time. However, as soon as that projectile impacts, you can immediately fire another one. This is clearly motivated by the limited memory in the original game, but I don't know of any artillery shell in real life that works like that!</li>
        <li>As a related phenomenon, although you can <em>move</em> while an explosion or chain reaction is occurring (with a slight reduction in frame rate), you can't <em>shoot</em> &mdash; at least not until the explosions stop, at which point you can once again shoot immediately. This also seems to be a concession to limited available memory as the game can't track multiple chain reactions at once.</li>
        <li>Tanks absolutely can't go over mines or obstacles; they act as completely impassible barriers. I guess that might make sense with spaceships, but it seems like a rather wussy sort of tank.</li><p></ul>
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhY6stQI5ncdRw8NFTfSYwprPoatlvyTIQJnI9l1V3OS-pA9vnfJHCVzr9_4ZkYge6uv9NE34ZxAKrD3CWGAL4M03d6CDWQIHFvQZb1vTRuvanIHmuOxQrRwm1dPmQlFMzT83TqwEy0jRFste8NJOUuZ1z102eukx5GymK1fWa9-KEpCJaHWqtP7pUkGGQ/s1120/big-0039.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="864" data-original-width="1120" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhY6stQI5ncdRw8NFTfSYwprPoatlvyTIQJnI9l1V3OS-pA9vnfJHCVzr9_4ZkYge6uv9NE34ZxAKrD3CWGAL4M03d6CDWQIHFvQZb1vTRuvanIHmuOxQrRwm1dPmQlFMzT83TqwEy0jRFste8NJOUuZ1z102eukx5GymK1fWa9-KEpCJaHWqtP7pUkGGQ/s320/big-0039.png"/></a></div>
        
        Also, there's only one screen. If you shoot all the mines before time runs out, the arcade Blasto would give you a free game in the single player mode, if you were playing on the upright version and if you were in a jurisdiction where free games weren't considered illegal gambling, as they were at the time in some areas (pinball also suffered from this). But that was meaningless on the no-coins-needed TI port, where shooting all the mines would win you a free ... game over screen, the same prize you'd get for losing.

        Now, I want to point out that despite those things, I loved TI Blasto and played quite a bit of it. But we can improve on what is already an awful lot of fun.

        It took a while to get the fundamentals laid down, and it was immediately obvious that the most important mechanic in the game had to be the chain reaction since everybody likes to blow %@#$ up. Consequently, the code that handles the explosions was the first part of the game I wrote, as I reasoned the game wouldn't be worth completing if I couldn't get it fast or frantic enough. This very early draft was a simple proof of concept using PETSCII graphic characters to model the algorithm; character graphics were a must because doing this on the high-resolution screen would have played like molasses.
        <p>
        The game doesn't track explosions anywhere else but the screen itself: everything it needs to determine the next frame of animation is by looking at what's set on the characters present. It scans the entire playfield each time to do this which necessarily locks the animation to a constant frame rate &mdash; even if the whole screen were alive with multiple explosions, it would take nearly exactly as much time as if only one single bomb were being detonated, keeping gameplay speed consistent. I did a lot of code unrolling to make this work as quick as possible and the final draft of the original "screen test" is what's in Oblast now.
        <p>
        The black area is because I already knew I'd be using sprites for the tank and I didn't want to mess around with having to manage the high bit for X coordinates greater than 255, so I reserved the right-hand portion of the screen for an information pane. This also had the nice side effect of reducing how much of the screen must be scanned.

        For Oblast, I've concentrated exclusively on the single-player mode in which I played Blasto most, which also simultaneously solved some technical issues. (I may make a two-player version in the future if I figure out good solutions to them.) Although I've kept the spirit of TI Blasto's configurability, I made it extend not just to maze generation but even to the game's core rule set. The configuration portion is largely written as a BASIC stub with some 6502 assembly language helpers for speed, with the bulk of the remainder and the entirety of the main game loop also in assembly language.
        <p>
        There are four preset games, the parameters for which I selected after tweaking them during repeated playtesting. The first is the one I consider "typical" for most players to start with (and the one you'll see the computer attempt to play during Oblast's attract mode), the second has an increased number of bombs, the third adds trails and more Blasto-like rules for more classic gameplay, and the fourth is a completely gonzo game mode which has become my personal favourite after a rough day at work.
        
        <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1500uXUGufWVwNEJkbc_5xqJqqrOupTIxna1zh-dCyVtUDyK-O-fjmRyUreVH9WpJdBwdruuI30MSGpYsBlkznSvy-OylTng7DIlzuBkbLcqQ9vdcUOCs6oCcii1j89oyXGsGZyLUwwUpBgJEVVDByFTgP6gg5gjIRnHb0hNrmVC2aNUcaBTXdujHB1k/s1152/big-vice-screen-2025112521231508.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="988" data-original-width="1152" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1500uXUGufWVwNEJkbc_5xqJqqrOupTIxna1zh-dCyVtUDyK-O-fjmRyUreVH9WpJdBwdruuI30MSGpYsBlkznSvy-OylTng7DIlzuBkbLcqQ9vdcUOCs6oCcii1j89oyXGsGZyLUwwUpBgJEVVDByFTgP6gg5gjIRnHb0hNrmVC2aNUcaBTXdujHB1k/s320/big-vice-screen-2025112521231508.png"/></a></div>
        
        If you don't like those presets, or want to tweak them further, there is a full game configuration screen letting you set game modes and the starting level/screen. The game supports up to 384 procedurally generated screens and you can start on any of them from 0 to 255. The screens are generated from constant seed data (in this case the 64's BASIC ROM) and thus designed to generate the same screen with the same parameters, facilitating muscle memory for longer play if you get good.
        <p>
        Like the two versions of Blasto, Oblast has mines (bombs) and obstacles (trees). You can very precisely control the densities of both. You can also have the game generate Blasto-style trails horizontally, vertically or both, you can set how quickly your tank's fuel is exhausted (i.e., your time limit, the only option which cannot be zero), and you can indicate if your tank is invulnerable to explosions and how quickly to cycle your shells. I'll talk about how that works in a moment. If you press one of the preset function keys in the configuration screen, then its settings are loaded as a starting point for you to modify.

        For the presets, where a new player wouldn't know exactly the game conditions they trigger, I pondered various in-game ways of informing them and hit on an easy-to-implement "dot matrix printout" motif where the BASIC stub scrolls a "briefing" before starting play, making asynchronous "printer" noises based on the bit pattern of each line's ASCII codes. This same motif is used for the basic built-in help since I had some extra space available.
        <p>
        Once you've got the settings the way you want, or you just want to keep playing the same preset, after a game ends you can bypass the presets and game configuration screens and jump right into a new game with the same settings by pressing the fire button.

        Here's two examples of the procedural screen generation at work, both level 0. The top screen is what you'd start at if you chose the "Regular Duty" (F1) preset; the second is "More Like Classic Blasto" (F5). Both have the same seed pointer, and you can see some commonalities in bomb and tree positions, but the second screen has a slightly lower bomb density and a slightly higher tree density plus trails going both horizontally and vertically. Each collection of settings will always generate the same screens on your machine. The game code manually counts the number of bombs and trees at the end of map generation since they may be taken away by trails or in the process of ensuring the tank has a cleared starting position.
        <p>
        Although we're using a custom character set for speed, I still wanted the colour flexibility of high resolution where you can have different text and background colours. To do so Oblast is something of a love letter to one of the VIC-II's more underutilized display modes, extended background colour mode (ECM). ECM supports up to four background colours on the same screen and the main game uses two additional colours besides the green background, the most obvious being the black background of the information pane, but also a yellow background as part of animating explosions. The price you pay for this flexibility is that only 64 characters of the standard 256-entry character set can be used; the two high bits instead become a bit pair to select the background colour.

        That meant making a lot of careful decisions about what I was going to actually display and getting those shapes into the first 64 character glyphs, shown here <a href="/2024/11/one-parting-some-commodore-64-utilities.html">in Ultrafont+</a>. You'll notice that I've replaced some of the letters and typographic characters with graphic shapes because I knew I would never actually need to display those letters or symbols. Everything you see on the screen except for the tank and the shells is a character in this custom font. On the bright side, this character limit also means we can reduce the memory needed by the game font by 75 percent.

        By looking for the bit set for the black background of the (impervious) information pane, as well as the wall character that also has this bit set, the game knows not to propagate explosions into that area. The yellow background comes in for knowing what needs to detonate <em>next</em> frame: the routine uses that bit as a deferred marker so that as it sweeps sequentially through the screen it doesn't update the same bomb twice in the same frame and prematurely snuff it out. Since setting that bit will also cause a different background colour to be used, we use yellow to make the explosion visually interesting as another side effect.
        <p>
        Parenthetically, the TMS9918 and TMS9918A also have a feature like this which TI Blasto itself appears to use: each 32 character block of its 256-character fonts can have its own colours. Unlike the VIC-II's ECM which must be specially enabled, this is a standard feature of the 32x24 text mode (which TI calls "Graphic I"), but the character shapes remain unchanged in each block which may require making duplicates (whereas with ECM they are always drawn from the first 64 glyphs).

        If there are a lot of bombs on screen, as is the case in the fourth preset and my favourite gameplay mode, nearly the entire screen will be consumed with the explosion which animates around you as you shoot other things. This wasn't possible in either of the original Blastos. Also, instead of trying to play music during game play, all three SID voices are used for noise generation (with a low-pass filter and some resonance smeared on for a woofer-like effect). Voice 1 is triggered when you fire your gun and voice 2 is always running as the tank's engine, with its frequency varying with motion and tank rotation. Voice 3 is used specifically for explosions because it's the only SID voice where you can directly sample both the oscillator waveform output and the current amplitude of the audio envelope. We take these samples, scale them to the activity on screen, and feed the result into the VIC-II's screen fine X scroll. Lots of explosions cause lots of shaking, yet the shaking is always in sync with the audio.
        <p>
        Besides the character graphics, the other major screen component are the sprites. The tank is a composite of three sprites: an animated set for the tank tread, the main tank body, and an accent layer. This is sharper than using multicolour sprites where your horizontal resolution is halved. These three sprites move together and the build system automatically precalculates frames to rotate them off a template, which are played back on screen when you turn. Unlike both versions of Blasto where the tank is limited to integral character positions, the tank in Oblast is larger than the bombs and trees and can move in single pixels, though I still limited movement to 90 degree angles so I didn't have to do expensive trig computations to figure out a shell's trajectory.
        <p>
        One sprite being used as the fuel gauge needle left four sprites for the shells. I had earlier considered using character graphics for them too, but animating shells that way would be slower and less smooth than moving sprites. On the other hand, then, <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/nine/index.php">without resorting to tricks</a> there can only be four shells onscreen at once which also didn't seem very tank-like. After some thought I came up with a game mechanic to explain it. In the information pane in these two shots, you see the level number, the fuel gauge which acts as your timer, and then four blue shell indicators. Three of these indicators are dark blue, indicating they are reloading (the fourth is a bright cyan, indicating ready). We'll simply define the reloading time for any shell chamber as the maximum length of time it takes a shell to get across the screen in any direction. Thus, no matter how much you fire, you can only ever have four on-screen because the reloading time will lock you out. (Blasto-style fire control where shells recycle immediately as they hit something is preserved for that game mode, or if you turn on "fast cycl[ing] shells" from the configuration screen.)
        <p>
        While propagating explosions is approximately constant-time, other operations in the game may not be, and there's no reason to walk the screen if nothing's marked as needing it. That means we need a timebase to keep frame rates stable. For this purpose I used the Kernal jiffy clock, which on both PAL and NTSC systems is triggered by the Timer A interrupt to tick about every 1/60 second. The game loop locks to this and uses it to know when to move game objects and trigger screen updates. Still, even this isn't fast enough for moving very speedy things like the shells you fire and the game felt too slow. So ... we make the Timer A interrupt even faster, flogging it at 240Hz instead of 60Hz (the game has prescaler values for both PAL and NTSC), making jiffies 1/240 of a second instead and moving objects at that rate.
        <p>
        This does have interesting interactions when the VIC-II is still drawing your screen at either 50 or 60Hz even as you update it four times as quickly, and most of these interactions have to do with collisions because you can move objects faster than the VIC-II can detect they intersect. The bombs are as big as they are because that gives lots of opportunities to detect a shell striking one, but tank collisions remained unreliable with smaller graphics like trees. Fortunately, however, we've already declared we didn't like the fact that trees and bombs (i.e., obstacles and mines) were impassible objects, so we can make this deficiency into a virtue. The game keeps running track of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZe5J8SVCYQ">where the tank last was</a> and if a collision is detected immediately moves it back to that position. However, because collisions are detected inconsistently at this rate of motion and the game updates the tank's coordinates faster than the VIC will draw them, it ends up manifesting onscreen as the tank simply slowing down when it has to cross an obstacle. I like that better than just coming to a dead halt.

        Explosions, however, are nice big targets and we have no problem detecting when the tank gets nailed by one of those. In the game modes where your tank is vulnerable, we throw your tank into a temporary tailspin, start flashing the border and the information pane (which is just a matter of setting its colour register), turn on voice 1 and voice 3 at the same time for an even bigger boom, and take the envelope and waveform from voice 3 and put it into the fine Y scroll register as well as the X to really throw the screen around. My favourite game mode allows you to blow up the entire playfield with impunity, of course.

        I also decided to overhaul the scoring with special bonuses silently awarded after completing a screen and detailed cumulatively at the end when your score is added up (total bombs exploded plus total bonuses earned). Don't cheat and look at the source code, but the descriptions of the bonuses should give you a clue as to how you win them. Note that some bonuses are mutually exclusive, and some are explicitly disabled ("n/a") in certain game configurations that make them impossible or unavoidable.
        <p>
        Should you beat the default high score, you'll see another use of extended background colour mode for the champion medal (you'll just have to beat it fair and square, no spoiler screenshots). This segment <a href="https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2015/09/17/flexible-line-distance-fld/">uses FLD</a> to scroll the medal into view and then cycles the ECM registers for a masked multiple colour bar effect without having to split the screen horizontally. It's a simple effect that I threw together in an afternoon but I think it looks nice. While the game configuration screen <em>looks</em> like it might use ECM for the top title, it actually doesn't because I needed lowercase letters, so I employ a much simpler trick for that screen which shouldn't take you long to figure out.
        <p>
        A key goal was to get the entire game in memory at once without additional loading or disk access, meaning you can even run it from cassette tape if you want to. In memory everything is arranged around the two character sets, the bank of sprites and the two hi-res title screens which are in fixed locations to deal with the VIC-II's more constrained view of memory (one of the hi-res screens is slotted under the BASIC ROM so I could free up 8K for something else). I then redistributed the various machine language subroutines and the three music tracks around those assets while also ensuring the BASIC menu stub had enough free memory to maintain its variables. After the core game was done I added two more extras on, the attract mode (which required some reworking to fit) and a really silly credits sequence, which implements a double-buffered screen scroller and takes advantage of the fact that the main music track sounds pretty neat slowed down. The entire mess is then single-parted using my custom cross-linker and optionally compressed.

Way back (well, six months ago, anyway), when I was [wiring up a Gremlin Blasto arcade board](/2025/06/refurb-weekend-gremlin-blasto-arcade.html), we talked at length about this 1978 arcade game&#39;s history and its sole official home computer port by Milton Bradley to the Texas Instruments 99/4A. In the single player mode you run around in a maze and try to blow up all the mines, which can set off sometimes impressive chain reactions, all the while making sure you yourself don&#39;t go up in flames in the process.

The TI-99/4A version was the Blasto I originally remember playing as I never did play Blasto in the arcades. (Also, for the record, we&#39;re not talking about Sony&#39;s unrelated Blasto for the PlayStation which, other than having the voice talents of the late and lamented Phil Hartman, was apparently a traumatic slog both for its developers and the few people who actually played it.) To the credit of its three composite authors, it is a competent and accurate conversion that also adds configurable options, colour graphics and music; in fact, TI&#39;s Blasto is probably my favourite game on the /4A, more so than any other cartridge. On the other hand, _because_ it&#39;s an accurate conversion, it also inherits all of the original&#39;s weaknesses, which admittedly hail from the limited CPU and ROM capacity of the arcade hardware.

So, in that article, I mentioned two [future Blasto projects](/search/label/blasto). One is to save my pennies for a custom arcade cabinet to put the board in, though I just spent a cool grand plus on tires which used up a lot of those pennies and I&#39;ve also got Christmas presents to buy. But the second was to write my own take on TI Blasto and soup it up. This project is the second one [from my bucket list](/search/label/bucketlist) that I&#39;ve completed. It took a couple years of work on it off and on, but it&#39;s finally done, with faster action and animation, a massive number of procedurally generated screens, and fully configurable gameplay.

I&#39;ve christened it Oblast, and it&#39;s free to play on your real Commodore 64 or emulator. Let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s the same and what&#39;s different.

The antediluvian [1978 Blasto](/2025/06/refurb-weekend-gremlin-blasto-arcade.html) ran on Hustle hardware, which was derived from Gremlin&#39;s original (and mercilessly copied) Blockade game as designed by Lane Hauck. Programmer Bill Blewitt managed to squeeze Blasto&#39;s entire game code, not counting character graphics, into just 2K of ROM. This code had to generate and draw the maze, handle one or two player inputs, handle their projectiles, check for collisions and trigger the audio and &#34;boom&#34; circuits, all while simultaneously setting off explosions that could trigger other explosions and other collisions. In the upright version it also had free game logic. Given its hardware and software size constraints the arcade game&#39;s gameplay limitations, which we&#39;ll discuss in a moment, were understandable.

When Milton Bradley picked up the license (from Gremlin&#39;s new owner Sega) as a developer for the new TI 99/4, they kept the gameplay and basic rules in their home computer port almost identical.

Instead, the programmers added music tracks, a colour display, and multiple configuration options. You could set not only the game&#39;s speed (I always played Full Tilt) ...

... but also how the maze was drawn, including whether trails existed (areas of the map pre-cleared for motion) and how dense the mines were.

Likely as a way to emphasize the TMS9918(A)&#39;s colour capabilities, the MB programmers changed the setting of the game to a green earth-bound landscape with blue (?) mines and reworked the spaceships into tanks. The density option probably had an even greater impact on gameplay than the speed setting because a maze with a lot of mines made for a zippier, more explosive game. You could rig some big bangs this way, though these were sadly were let down by the TMS9919/SN76489&#39;s relatively weak noise output. The program also vainly tried to play a simple tune during the game but this was inevitably interrupted and forced to start over by any sound effect (i.e., a tank shooting, mines exploding).

As with the original, you have infinite lives but finite time. If you trip on an explosion, or the other player shoots you in two-player mode, you lose valuable seconds until you respawn. However, you respawn at your original spawn point as if you were teleported there, a conceivable failure mode for a fanciful spaceship but an extremely unlikely one for a terrestrial tank, which makes a good segue into some of its other idiosyncrasies:

- Each player can only have a single projectile in motion at any time. However, as soon as that projectile impacts, you can immediately fire another one. This is clearly motivated by the limited memory in the original game, but I don&#39;t know of any artillery shell in real life that works like that!
- As a related phenomenon, although you can _move_ while an explosion or chain reaction is occurring (with a slight reduction in frame rate), you can&#39;t _shoot_ — at least not until the explosions stop, at which point you can once again shoot immediately. This also seems to be a concession to limited available memory as the game can&#39;t track multiple chain reactions at once.
- Tanks absolutely can&#39;t go over mines or obstacles; they act as completely impassible barriers. I guess that might make sense with spaceships, but it seems like a rather wussy sort of tank.

Also, there&#39;s only one screen. If you shoot all the mines before time runs out, the arcade Blasto would give you a free game in the single player mode, if you were playing on the upright version and if you were in a jurisdiction where free games weren&#39;t considered illegal gambling, as they were at the time in some areas (pinball also suffered from this). But that was meaningless on the no-coins-needed TI port, where shooting all the mines would win you a free ... game over screen, the same prize you&#39;d get for losing.

Now, I want to point out that despite those things, I loved TI Blasto and played quite a bit of it. But we can improve on what is already an awful lot of fun.

It took a while to get the fundamentals laid down, and it was immediately obvious that the most important mechanic in the game had to be the chain reaction since everybody likes to blow %@#$ up. Consequently, the code that handles the explosions was the first part of the game I wrote, as I reasoned the game wouldn&#39;t be worth completing if I couldn&#39;t get it fast or frantic enough. This very early draft was a simple proof of concept using PETSCII graphic characters to model the algorithm; character graphics were a must because doing this on the high-resolution screen would have played like molasses.

The game doesn&#39;t track explosions anywhere else but the screen itself: everything it needs to determine the next frame of animation is by looking at what&#39;s set on the characters present. It scans the entire playfield each time to do this which necessarily locks the animation to a constant frame rate — even if the whole screen were alive with multiple explosions, it would take nearly exactly as much time as if only one single bomb were being detonated, keeping gameplay speed consistent. I did a lot of code unrolling to make this work as quick as possible and the final draft of the original &#34;screen test&#34; is what&#39;s in Oblast now.

The black area is because I already knew I&#39;d be using sprites for the tank and I didn&#39;t want to mess around with having to manage the high bit for X coordinates greater than 255, so I reserved the right-hand portion of the screen for an information pane. This also had the nice side effect of reducing how much of the screen must be scanned.

For Oblast, I&#39;ve concentrated exclusively on the single-player mode in which I played Blasto most, which also simultaneously solved some technical issues. (I may make a two-player version in the future if I figure out good solutions to them.) Although I&#39;ve kept the spirit of TI Blasto&#39;s configurability, I made it extend not just to maze generation but even to the game&#39;s core rule set. The configuration portion is largely written as a BASIC stub with some 6502 assembly language helpers for speed, with the bulk of the remainder and the entirety of the main game loop also in assembly language.

There are four preset games, the parameters for which I selected after tweaking them during repeated playtesting. The first is the one I consider &#34;typical&#34; for most players to start with (and the one you&#39;ll see the computer attempt to play during Oblast&#39;s attract mode), the second has an increased number of bombs, the third adds trails and more Blasto-like rules for more classic gameplay, and the fourth is a completely gonzo game mode which has become my personal favourite after a rough day at work.

If you don&#39;t like those presets, or want to tweak them further, there is a full game configuration screen letting you set game modes and the starting level/screen. The game supports up to 384 procedurally generated screens and you can start on any of them from 0 to 255. The screens are generated from constant seed data (in this case the 64&#39;s BASIC ROM) and thus designed to generate the same screen with the same parameters, facilitating muscle memory for longer play if you get good.

Like the two versions of Blasto, Oblast has mines (bombs) and obstacles (trees). You can very precisely control the densities of both. You can also have the game generate Blasto-style trails horizontally, vertically or both, you can set how quickly your tank&#39;s fuel is exhausted (i.e., your time limit, the only option which cannot be zero), and you can indicate if your tank is invulnerable to explosions and how quickly to cycle your shells. I&#39;ll talk about how that works in a moment. If you press one of the preset function keys in the configuration screen, then its settings are loaded as a starting point for you to modify.

For the presets, where a new player wouldn&#39;t know exactly the game conditions they trigger, I pondered various in-game ways of informing them and hit on an easy-to-implement &#34;dot matrix printout&#34; motif where the BASIC stub scrolls a &#34;briefing&#34; before starting play, making asynchronous &#34;printer&#34; noises based on the bit pattern of each line&#39;s ASCII codes. This same motif is used for the basic built-in help since I had some extra space available.

Once you&#39;ve got the settings the way you want, or you just want to keep playing the same preset, after a game ends you can bypass the presets and game configuration screens and jump right into a new game with the same settings by pressing the fire button.

Here&#39;s two examples of the procedural screen generation at work, both level 0. The top screen is what you&#39;d start at if you chose the &#34;Regular Duty&#34; (F1) preset; the second is &#34;More Like Classic Blasto&#34; (F5). Both have the same seed pointer, and you can see some commonalities in bomb and tree positions, but the second screen has a slightly lower bomb density and a slightly higher tree density plus trails going both horizontally and vertically. Each collection of settings will always generate the same screens on your machine. The game code manually counts the number of bombs and trees at the end of map generation since they may be taken away by trails or in the process of ensuring the tank has a cleared starting position.

Although we&#39;re using a custom character set for speed, I still wanted the colour flexibility of high resolution where you can have different text and background colours. To do so Oblast is something of a love letter to one of the VIC-II&#39;s more underutilized display modes, extended background colour mode (ECM). ECM supports up to four background colours on the same screen and the main game uses two additional colours besides the green background, the most obvious being the black background of the information pane, but also a yellow background as part of animating explosions. The price you pay for this flexibility is that only 64 characters of the standard 256-entry character set can be used; the two high bits instead become a bit pair to select the background colour.

That meant making a lot of careful decisions about what I was going to actually display and getting those shapes into the first 64 character glyphs, shown here [in Ultrafont+](/2024/11/one-parting-some-commodore-64-utilities.html). You&#39;ll notice that I&#39;ve replaced some of the letters and typographic characters with graphic shapes because I knew I would never actually need to display those letters or symbols. Everything you see on the screen except for the tank and the shells is a character in this custom font. On the bright side, this character limit also means we can reduce the memory needed by the game font by 75 percent.

By looking for the bit set for the black background of the (impervious) information pane, as well as the wall character that also has this bit set, the game knows not to propagate explosions into that area. The yellow background comes in for knowing what needs to detonate _next_ frame: the routine uses that bit as a deferred marker so that as it sweeps sequentially through the screen it doesn&#39;t update the same bomb twice in the same frame and prematurely snuff it out. Since setting that bit will also cause a different background colour to be used, we use yellow to make the explosion visually interesting as another side effect.

Parenthetically, the TMS9918 and TMS9918A also have a feature like this which TI Blasto itself appears to use: each 32 character block of its 256-character fonts can have its own colours. Unlike the VIC-II&#39;s ECM which must be specially enabled, this is a standard feature of the 32x24 text mode (which TI calls &#34;Graphic I&#34;), but the character shapes remain unchanged in each block which may require making duplicates (whereas with ECM they are always drawn from the first 64 glyphs).

If there are a lot of bombs on screen, as is the case in the fourth preset and my favourite gameplay mode, nearly the entire screen will be consumed with the explosion which animates around you as you shoot other things. This wasn&#39;t possible in either of the original Blastos. Also, instead of trying to play music during game play, all three SID voices are used for noise generation (with a low-pass filter and some resonance smeared on for a woofer-like effect). Voice 1 is triggered when you fire your gun and voice 2 is always running as the tank&#39;s engine, with its frequency varying with motion and tank rotation. Voice 3 is used specifically for explosions because it&#39;s the only SID voice where you can directly sample both the oscillator waveform output and the current amplitude of the audio envelope. We take these samples, scale them to the activity on screen, and feed the result into the VIC-II&#39;s screen fine X scroll. Lots of explosions cause lots of shaking, yet the shaking is always in sync with the audio.

Besides the character graphics, the other major screen component are the sprites. The tank is a composite of three sprites: an animated set for the tank tread, the main tank body, and an accent layer. This is sharper than using multicolour sprites where your horizontal resolution is halved. These three sprites move together and the build system automatically precalculates frames to rotate them off a template, which are played back on screen when you turn. Unlike both versions of Blasto where the tank is limited to integral character positions, the tank in Oblast is larger than the bombs and trees and can move in single pixels, though I still limited movement to 90 degree angles so I didn&#39;t have to do expensive trig computations to figure out a shell&#39;s trajectory.

One sprite being used as the fuel gauge needle left four sprites for the shells. I had earlier considered using character graphics for them too, but animating shells that way would be slower and less smooth than moving sprites. On the other hand, then, [without resorting to tricks](https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/nine/index.php) there can only be four shells onscreen at once which also didn&#39;t seem very tank-like. After some thought I came up with a game mechanic to explain it. In the information pane in these two shots, you see the level number, the fuel gauge which acts as your timer, and then four blue shell indicators. Three of these indicators are dark blue, indicating they are reloading (the fourth is a bright cyan, indicating ready). We&#39;ll simply define the reloading time for any shell chamber as the maximum length of time it takes a shell to get across the screen in any direction. Thus, no matter how much you fire, you can only ever have four on-screen because the reloading time will lock you out. (Blasto-style fire control where shells recycle immediately as they hit something is preserved for that game mode, or if you turn on &#34;fast cycl\[ing\] shells&#34; from the configuration screen.)

While propagating explosions is approximately constant-time, other operations in the game may not be, and there&#39;s no reason to walk the screen if nothing&#39;s marked as needing it. That means we need a timebase to keep frame rates stable. For this purpose I used the Kernal jiffy clock, which on both PAL and NTSC systems is triggered by the Timer A interrupt to tick about every 1/60 second. The game loop locks to this and uses it to know when to move game objects and trigger screen updates. Still, even this isn&#39;t fast enough for moving very speedy things like the shells you fire and the game felt too slow. So ... we make the Timer A interrupt even faster, flogging it at 240Hz instead of 60Hz (the game has prescaler values for both PAL and NTSC), making jiffies 1/240 of a second instead and moving objects at that rate.

This does have interesting interactions when the VIC-II is still drawing your screen at either 50 or 60Hz even as you update it four times as quickly, and most of these interactions have to do with collisions because you can move objects faster than the VIC-II can detect they intersect. The bombs are as big as they are because that gives lots of opportunities to detect a shell striking one, but tank collisions remained unreliable with smaller graphics like trees. Fortunately, however, we&#39;ve already declared we didn&#39;t like the fact that trees and bombs (i.e., obstacles and mines) were impassible objects, so we can make this deficiency into a virtue. The game keeps running track of [where the tank last was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZe5J8SVCYQ) and if a collision is detected immediately moves it back to that position. However, because collisions are detected inconsistently at this rate of motion and the game updates the tank&#39;s coordinates faster than the VIC will draw them, it ends up manifesting onscreen as the tank simply slowing down when it has to cross an obstacle. I like that better than just coming to a dead halt.

Explosions, however, are nice big targets and we have no problem detecting when the tank gets nailed by one of those. In the game modes where your tank is vulnerable, we throw your tank into a temporary tailspin, start flashing the border and the information pane (which is just a matter of setting its colour register), turn on voice 1 and voice 3 at the same time for an even bigger boom, and take the envelope and waveform from voice 3 and put it into the fine Y scroll register as well as the X to really throw the screen around. My favourite game mode allows you to blow up the entire playfield with impunity, of course.

I also decided to overhaul the scoring with special bonuses silently awarded after completing a screen and detailed cumulatively at the end when your score is added up (total bombs exploded plus total bonuses earned). Don&#39;t cheat and look at the source code, but the descriptions of the bonuses should give you a clue as to how you win them. Note that some bonuses are mutually exclusive, and some are explicitly disabled (&#34;n/a&#34;) in certain game configurations that make them impossible or unavoidable.

Should you beat the default high score, you&#39;ll see another use of extended background colour mode for the champion medal (you&#39;ll just have to beat it fair and square, no spoiler screenshots). This segment [uses FLD](https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2015/09/17/flexible-line-distance-fld/) to scroll the medal into view and then cycles the ECM registers for a masked multiple colour bar effect without having to split the screen horizontally. It&#39;s a simple effect that I threw together in an afternoon but I think it looks nice. While the game configuration screen _looks_ like it might use ECM for the top title, it actually doesn&#39;t because I needed lowercase letters, so I employ a much simpler trick for that screen which shouldn&#39;t take you long to figure out.

A key goal was to get the entire game in memory at once without additional loading or disk access, meaning you can even run it from cassette tape if you want to. In memory everything is arranged around the two character sets, the bank of sprites and the two hi-res title screens which are in fixed locations to deal with the VIC-II&#39;s more constrained view of memory (one of the hi-res screens is slotted under the BASIC ROM so I could free up 8K for something else). I then redistributed the various machine language subroutines and the three music tracks around those assets while also ensuring the BASIC menu stub had enough free memory to maintain its variables. After the core game was done I added two more extras on, the attract mode (which required some reworking to fit) and a really silly credits sequence, which implements a double-buffered screen scroller and takes advantage of the fact that the main music track sounds pretty neat slowed down. The entire mess is then single-parted using my custom cross-linker and optionally compressed.

Oblast is [freeware and open source on Github](https://github.com/classilla/oblast). You can build it with Perl 5, the [`xa65` cross assembler](http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa) and optionally the [`pucrunch` compressor](https://a1bert.kapsi.fi/Dev/pucrunch/). The Perl tools to generate the sprites, the tokenized BASIC code and the uncompressed runnable linked version are all included. Say that you want to change the presets to your own preferred settings: just change the corresponding `DATA` statement in the BASIC code, do a `make` and instantly have your modified binary. All I ask is that modified binaries that you provide to others should use a different name so they aren&#39;t confused with the original, and note that this game and any derivative works based on it or its components are under the [Floodgap Free Software License](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ffsl/).

If you just want to play it, [the Github releases tab](https://github.com/classilla/oblast/releases) provides compressed (for actual floppy disks or tape or other media with limited space) and uncompressed (for fast DMA cartridges and emulators) builds as `.prg` files you can run directly. You&#39;ll need a joystick or equivalent in port 2, and the game should run on any PAL or NTSC Commodore 64. This is hardly the last game, let alone project, on [my bucketlist](/search/label/bucketlist), but it&#39;s good to knock another one off it. Also, please don&#39;t blow up trees in real life.

If you&#39;ve enjoyed playing, [buy me a coffee Pibb](https://ko-fi.com/classichasclass).</source:markdown>
