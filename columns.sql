INSERT INTO items VALUES('http://my.1999.io/users/dsearls/2020/02/01/theLostCenter.html','The lost center','<p>Listening to SCAN on the radio this last week, especially on the AM band—and then watching and listening to much of the Impeachment trial on TV and radio—it became clear to me that the Republican and Democratic parties are like divorced parents fighting over children who are also taking sides. Typically of people who don''t get along, they make broad and demeaning assumptions about each other, full of characterization and dismissiveness. Whether they are right or wrong about each other are beside this simple point: they are locked in a conflict that will only be resolved, unhappily, when one or the other wins.</p><p>The Republicans will win this round. I think they''ll win in November as well, with Trump crowing all the way about putting down "the coup."&nbsp; But they''ll lose in the longer run, because the demographics and the economy won''t keep working for them, and Trump''s celebrity will wear out. Some Democrat will be elected president in 2024, with a tide of other Democrats winning both houses of Congress. But it won''t be pretty in the meantime. Trump will pack the Supreme Court while remaining a dishonest egomaniac whose corrupt history will catch up with him one way or another—while the Democratic party will split between young and old, socialist and traditionalist. Its center will not hold.</p><p>The center in the country as a whole is already gone, lost in the divorce. (I did a TEDx talk about that center, <a href="https://tedxsantabarbara.com/2018/doc-searls/">here</a>.) I suspect the new center in Democratic politics will be a socialist one, because the giant problems—global warming, pandemics, economic disasters, rotten infrastructure—will be ones government will seem to be in the best position to solve.</p><p>I''m not saying any of what I just said is true, by the way. It''s just what I''m thinking on a Saturday evening in February 2020.</p>',NULL,'','2020-02-01 23:38:24','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

Also incomplete, because it leaves the private sector at liberty to do all the facial recognition it wants.</p><p>If you''re going to ban facial recognition, why not ban it completely? </p><p>Simply put, because it won''t work, at least not across the board. Facial recognition will&nbsp;still be developed and used by countless companies in many countries, some of which see it as a huge advantage.</p><p>Even if the UN bans facial recognition, countries such as China (which loves it) are still going to do it, and encourage its private sector to do the same.

Here in SoCal there''s Spanish (a lot), Chinese (on a 77kw Mexican signal), Sports (3 from L.A., 1 in San Diego now), a couple of music stations (one is playing "Adult Hits" out of Texas on a 50k signal) - There''s Middle Eastern radio, and more. The trouble here is in the numbers. Can you imagine how it would be if there were 10+ stations playing the same music? That''s kinda like how it is here. What we used to call "broadcasting" on AM is turning into "narrowcasting" - driving more and more people away. There are at least 15 ethnic stations, 2 News-Talkers and one all news station covering more than 15 million people. Not a knock either. It''s reality..a sad reality!</i><br><br>And to that I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/iloveamradio/permalink/10157489896585993/?comment_id=10157491843715993&amp;reply_comment_id=10157494085580993">replied</a>,</p><p><i>Here in Santa Barbara, with a salt water path bringing coastal AMs (all the way to Rosarita, NL) in like locals (and tropo doing the same for FMs much of the time), it''s clear that both bands, in different ways, are turning into narrowcasts: religion, ethnic groups, sports, partisan political talk. The list goes on. The one conditional exception is public radio, which tries hard to hold a political center it can''t have because, except for the local stuff, it''s based in Washington, where policy, governance and academic specialties are the lenses through which everything in the world appears.</i></p><p><i>I think the reason SiriusXM succeeds is that it offers a much wider range of channels programming on its "dial" than anything anywhere in terrestrial radio. It also has the good fortune to have stayed alive and thriving in an economy that is moving economically from a free basis to a subscription one.</i></p><p><i>What SiriusXM can''t (or doesn''t) offer yet is what will keep terrestrial radio alive: exactly what you''re talking about—ethnic,sports and other forms of narrowcasting.</i></p><p><i>The big challenge for all of it will be getting future devices to hunt from one "band" to another: over-the-air, satellite and streaming over the Internet. This is do-able, but in the long run only if the whole combined system is digital.</i></p><p><i>This is why I have some hope for full-digital AM radio. The open question is whether the gear-makers (especially for cars) will be willing to do the work. I suspect they won''t, especially if the transmission and reception ends require costly proprietary encoding and decoding, and just one source of parts. This, more than anything else, is what''s killing HD Radio. (Forget the actual engineering details. What matters is that HD Radio is a market captive to Ibiquity. Unless I have that wrong.

That was kind of the way <a href="http://weblog.searls.com">my old blog</a>&nbsp;(1999-2007) worked.&nbsp; The subject was the headline and each post was as short or long as I liked—as an email also might be. And, like an email, it was personal. I was speaking for myself.</p><p>These days I write on four blogs:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">my personal one</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/">ProjectVRM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/blog/">Customer Commons</a>, and here. Of those four, only this one is fully* personal, and only this one runs on a writing platform like my old blog had. (No surprise there, because both platforms were creations of our blogfather,&nbsp;<a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a>.) Sometimes I also cross-post to Medium, which is now less leveraged than it used to be. (I can explain later, but it''s beside the point of this post.) And I <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls">tweet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>*A bit of explanation: my personal blog is a Harvard one, and so is ProjectVRM''s. Customer Commons'' is also not mine. And I''m mindful of those institutions when I write there. Here the institution is me.</p><p>Bigger than all four of those blogs is <a href="http://linuxjournal.com"><i>Linux Journal</i></a>, where I wrote a great deal, including what amounted to blog posts on its website, for 25 years. That ended when <i>Linux Journal</i> ceased business in August. Also, as of today the entire site, with all its archives, is offline, erasing a third to a half of what I''ve written online so far.</p><p>While I''m hoping that <a href="https://londontrustmedia.com/">the owner</a> will bring the site back up again (they <i>did</i> promise to keep it up), the prospect of losing the whole thing has shaken my belief that the Web itself will ever be a true place for archiving anything. Instead it''s a whiteboard.† And writing on a whiteboard is not a prospect that energizes me. Quite the opposite, in fact. Especially when so much of my online work is gone. (Again, at least for now.)</p><p>Here''s another depressing thing: Google and Bing searches are now biased for traffic rather than links. I know this for two reasons. One is that I planted keyword easter eggs in some old and well-linked-to blog posts, which both search engines used to find; and now they bring up goose eggs: nada. (I''d tell you the keyword, but that would blow the test.) The other is that links to this blog don''t cause it to show up in search engines, but <i>visits</i> to this blog do cause it to show up—at least for me—presumably because Google and Bing watched one person come here, and customized the search result just for that person (moi).</p><p>Or so it seems. I really don''t know.</p><p>Are there studies on any of this... about how the Web is a whiteboard, or how search engines are becoming biassed for observed visits rather than for inbound links?</p><p>I suppose studies like that would be hard or impossible, given the operational opacity of search engines, their tendency to change constantly, and the ways they are rigged to personalize results.</p><p>So I''m in something of a liminal state right now, wondering where to invest my ceaseless writing energies. At the moment the Web is looking less appealing than ever. My mind might change, especially if we succeed in getting <i>Linux Journal</i>&nbsp;back up. But that''s where I am right now.</p><p>†I first wrote about this in <i>Linux Journal</i> back in 2003, noting a split between the "static" Web that was like a library (with its "locations," "sites," and "domains" you could "visit" and "browse"), and the "live" web of blogs and posts. I also wrote about it at greater length in 2005, when we had the first hints toward what became social media. <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8549">Here''s a link</a>&nbsp;to it I just found on Google. It currently goes nowhere. And, if the <i>Linux Journal</i>&nbsp;site doesn''t come back up, Google''s search engine will forget it, and the live Web''s whiteboard will be wiped clean.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',NULL,'','2019-11-10 18:18:36','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

We also need activists to reform all our standing institutions, from politics to health care to education to social media and its platforms. It''s also good that these kinds of work tend to pay, through credentials, experience and money.

Wanting "a better way to correlate media exposure with consumer actions like clicks, downloads, ''conversions,'' purchases and repurchases" is a road to hell for broadcasters, and it gets steeper on the downhill side with every new data-rationalized pitch for broadcast advertising to get as accountable as possible at the personal level.</i></p><p><i>Broadcasting''s greatest virtue as an advertising medium is its effects on populations, not on how it gets individuals to act.</i></p><p><i>Consider this: I don''t own a Ford, but I know the company''s trucks are Ford Tough. I don''t have insurance with Geico, but I know fifteen minutes can save me fifteen percent on my car insurance if I choose Geico.

So journalism isn''t just about newspapers. Second, because so many journalists have long made livings in those other media, the loss of work is far larger than the 2,400 gone from newspapers. It''s truly massive. I don''t know any field where the loss of jobs is larger. Not taxi driving, not hospitality, not retail, not manufacturing... not anything I can think of. (Well, maybe nuns. I don''t see many of those these days.)<br></p><p>And yet there is more journalism than ever: in blogs, social media, podcasting and other media. Most of it doesn''t pay, but that doesn''t disqualify it as journalism. Hell, I''m doing it here and this doesn''t pay.</p><p>Second, Big Tech is more effect than cause. (I''ll explain why shortly.) And it''s way too easy to blame.</p><p>And hey, if you''re blaming Big Things, why stop at those three tech companies? How about Amazon, which is in the middle of destroying and re-making all of retail and distribution? Or Netflix, which has turned all of television into one big streaming subscription business, much of it with no advertising (which once paid big news operations)? Or, within television, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, which have morphed into the trampoline-like walls of partisan echo chambers? They used to be where you went for news. Now they''re mostly opinion, most of which is one-sided.</p><p>The cause for all of it is digital technology plus the Internet. Simple as that. And damned hard to understand, because we''re pickled in it, and it''s still just starting. Everything we''re experiencing with digital technology on the Internet today is a radical hack on our minds and our lives.<br></p><p>Every new technology, McLuhan says (in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_Is_the_Massage">The Medium is the Massage</a></i>), "works us over completely." And no new medium, no new technologies, have ever worked us over more than digital tech.<br></p><p>A few months back I had a brief conversation about this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito">Joi Ito</a>.

"It''s the biggest thing since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event">oxygenation</a>." In case you don''t recall, that happened around 2 billion years ago.</p><p>Journalism is just one collateral casualty of digitalization. Also a beneficiary, methinks. But I don''t yet know, and I won''t ever know. Life is too short, and the change is too long.</p><p>But we do need to understand it as best we can in the meantime.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.digitallife.center/">Here''s one outfit</a> working on that.

In TV, that’s over the top of cable, which replaced over-the-air (OTA) for most people decades ago. In radio, it’s over the top of OTA, via streams and podcasts on the Net. In both cases, the final imagined product is subscription-only, with group owners competing in a silo-vs.-silo way. We see a drift in that direction with iHeart’s urging the listening world onto its app. and we see it more clearly in Entercom pulling its streams off the open Net (so they no longer appear, for example, on the TuneIn app, which prior to that move played all the streams in the world) and isolating them inside its own proprietary <a href="http://Radio.com"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="http://Radio.com">Radio.com</span></a> app. In the course of that, Entercom is saying “IP addresses on the Net are not the new radio dial at all. In fact there is no radio dial in the digital world. There are only proprietary isolated systems competing against each other for subscribers.” The end state is one where “stations” exist as fossil remnants with call letters and slogans within closed and proprietary subscription systems providing a mix of streams and podcasts. Localization is part of that, but it’s still a freaking mess while the future arrives, unevenly.</i></p><p><br></p>',NULL,'','2019-05-29 17:33:47','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

Today it was <a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/westwood-nj/ronald-schott-7867028">Ron Schott</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/rschott">@rschott</a>). Both died young: Sandy at 61 and Ron at 49. Both also died some time ago: Sandy in 2012 and Ron this past May. Their obituaries are at those links.<br><br>I met Sandy at a dance in 1983. She grabbed me out of a crowd and we just started swinging. I was a spaz and she was a pro, so she led and I followed. That&nbsp;was my first and last experience of feeling like a good dancer. We got to be friends, but fell out of touch after I moved to California in 1985. Yesterday I looked her up on a whim and found that obituary.</p><p>The cause of Sandy''s death remains a mystery to me, though I''m glad to know one mystery in her life was solved. The last I talked to her (I''m guessing in 1985), she thought her brother Steve, then already long missing, was possibly dead. But Steve was one of those writing kind words on Sandy''s obituary page. Another person there mentioned that she and Steve had recently reunited. So I''m glad that happened.<br><br>I learned about Ron just a few minutes ago. I had tipped my hat to Ron and other geologists in one of my tweets, and Andrew Alden (<a href="https://twitter.com/aboutgeology">@aboutgeology</a>) in a private reply gave me the news that Ron had passed. He also told me that, best he could recall, Ron had died of heart failure.</p><p>Ron was a leading field geologist specializing in the hard rocks of the American West. He was also <a href="http://gigapan.com/cms/ron-schott-and-his-1-000-gigapans">a first-rate gigapan photographer</a>. See <a href="http://gigapan.com/profiles/rschott/gigapans">here</a>. And <a href="http://googleearthdesign.blogspot.com/2018/06/in-memoriam-ron-schott.html">here</a>. The last of those was taken just a month before he died. Next to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a>, I learned more about geology from Ron than from anyone else. He was a great correspondent by email and Twitter. Callan Bentley (<a href="callanbentley">@callanbentley</a>) <a href="https://blogs.agu.org/mountainbeltway/2018/06/04/losing-ron-and-declan/">calls Ron</a>—&nbsp;</p><blockquote>a giant in geoscience outreach on the internet. He was an early adopter of just about every technology you can think of: Google Earth, GigaPan, Twitter, Google+, geological apps for augmented reality. He was always pushing to innovate for the public good with these technologies, making publically-accessible “Geology Office Hours” on Google hangouts and inventing new geo-ed hashtags like #weatheringWednesday and #btgt (“Been there; GigaPanned that”). He was the king of “Where on Google Earth?” so much so that the players of that game invented “the Schott Rule” in his honor. He was kind and inclusive, encouraging and thoughtful. His omnipresence on geology Twitter was pretty much unmatched. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/callanbentley/status/1002609873291501571">announced his death there last week</a>, the outpouring of grief was unprecedented.</blockquote><p>And now I''m grieving too.&nbsp;</p><p>So will the rest of ya''ll please stay alive?

Thanks.</blockquote><p>Since that was not helpful (no way&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com">CSO</a>&nbsp;will cave to that demand), and I really would like to help out here (and, if you follow the thread, Susan does pull her two hidden questions out from behind the registration wall), here are some thoughts which, far as I know, nobody other than my wife (a trustee of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>) and I are thinking. I''m not saying these thoughts are right, or fully formed or informed. Just that we''ve been co-thinking about them out loud for the last couple of days. Here goes.</p><p>In the natural world, where we are embodied beings, we are by default anonymous when to go about the world outside the social circles where we are known by name. By anonymous I mean <i>nameless</i>. Literally. (That''s what <i>anonymous</i> means. To be nameful is to be <i>onymous</i>.) This is a grace of civilization. We don''t need to wear name badges when we walk on a city street. If we pay cash at the coffee shop, we don''t need to identify ourselves by name, and if the barista needs to write our name on our cup, we can give them a pseudonym. Even if we pay with a credit card for something, the polite thing for the other person in the transaction to do is <i>not</i>&nbsp;look at the name on our credit card, because that would be kinda icky.</p><p>Why is that? Why is it weird when a waiter processing our credit card looks at it and thanks us by name? Or when anybody gets a bit too familiar with us.&nbsp; I''ve always wondered about that. What should we call the boundary we put around the public selves we present to others anonymously?&nbsp;</p><p>I got a good answer yesterday when I was walking to a medical appointment in far-uptown Manhattan. Along the way, none of the hundreds of people I passed knew, or wanted to know, my name. Nor did I want to know theirs. The same was true of every store I passed, before showing up at the doctor''s office, where I was <i>onymous</i>&nbsp; for a good reason.</p><p>The answer came through my earphones, which were playing Christopher Lydon''s latest <a href="http://radioopensource.org/">Open Source Radio</a> podcast, titled&nbsp;<a href="http://radioopensource.org/andre-dubus-iii-how-the-fighter-became-the-writer/"><i>Andre Dubus III: How “The Fighter” Became The Writer</i></a>. About eleven minutes into the podcast, Dubus speaks about "that membrane of inviolability that should be around every human being." Expanding on that, he adds, "You can''t violate someone''s sacred space without asking." Then, "but in a fight you have to violate it right away, and once you learn to do that, you can always do it."</p><p>Those two points—that we have a sacred space inside a membrane of inviolability, and that once we violate another''s sacred space we can make a habit of it— lay out the challenge for self-sovereign identity in the digital world.</p><p>In the natural world, we presume that every human being maintains that membrane of inviolability, even as they become <i>onymous</i> with others who have reason to know their names (or whatever they choose to call themselves).</p><p>In the digital world we don''t have that. We can''t walk around there in an anonymous way (unless we are geeky enough to know tricks for doing that). Here in these early decades of digital life on Earth, we have at most the illusion of inviolability. We become disillusioned when we learn that the unseen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">headers</a>&nbsp;in our browsers disclose virtual fingerprints of our hardware and —and that everywhere we go online, we carry cookies injected into our browsers by nearly every site we visit, so we can be identified, not only by those sites, but by countless third parties behind those sites, mostly for personalized advertising purposes, but also for God knows what else.</p><p>Our <i>onymity</i> in the digital world is conferred mostly by what digital identity geeks call <i>identity providers</i>. Others who need to know our provided identities are called&nbsp;<i>relying parties</i>. Every identity provider maintains an identifier for us in a <i>namespace</i>. We get a new one of these every time we create a login and a password. (According to my password manager, I now have 1208 login/password combinations.)</p><p>The idea behind self-sovereign identity, or SSI, is that each of us maintains our own portfolio of ways to present what are called <i>verifiable credentials</i>&nbsp;that are similar in ways to how we use the credentials we carry in our wallets to prove, for example, that we are licensed to drive, a member of a club, or old enough to be served alcohol. I''ll let others fill in the blanks there, or correct what I just said. What matters about SSI is that it at least begins to equip us with something like the membrane of inviolability we enjoy in the natural world. And, if it becomes normative, SSI should equip us to create and respect the natural state of anonymity we should each enjoy in our sacred private spaces, even as we walk about the digital world in clearly human forms.</p>',NULL,'','2019-03-17 00:53:09','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

It begins with this:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>It’s all about the data. Last week at The Radio Show in Orlando, a lot of time was dedicated to data and what radio stations can do with it to generate more revenue. General Motors has gotten into the data collection business and the automotive giant is using radio as a way to collect it<a href="http://it.GM"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="http://it.GM"><br>GM</span></a> conducted a three-month test using in-car Wi-Fi, tracking the habits of drivers. The goal was to explore whether there’s a relationship between what drivers listen to and what they buy. A GM spokesman also tells The Detroit Free Press that the data from this study could also help GM develop a better way to measure radio listenership, something advertisers would love to get their hands on, so they could target their ads.</blockquote><p>My response in the comments below:</p><p><i>It''s not "all about the data." It''s about preserving the sweetly private experience radio has always given the drivers and passengers in cars.

Alas, his talk has since disappeared from the Web and isn''t in Archive.org.</p><p>What’s missing from the account at that link (which thankfully survives) is what Paul said about how high energy physicists were the primary actors in spreading the Web outward from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC_National_Accelerator_Laboratory">SLAC</a>, and where Paul was one of those scientists. When Tim Berners-Lee''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> machine first made a Web connection outside of CERN, the story went, it was to Paul''s NeXT machine at SLAC in California.</p><p>Specifically, the physicists in Europe (Tim himself? I don''t recall) went to their national phone companies (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal,_telegraph_and_telephone_service">PTTs</a> there—the equivalents of what Ma Bell was before the U.S. feds broke her up) and said they wanted to exchange high-energy physics documents with each other, and would it be cool if they used this new HTTP protocol over this other protocol called TCP/IP.&nbsp;</p><p>Without knowing the implications, the phone companies said yes. And here we are.</p><p>In other words (I''m talking now, not Paul), the phone companies accepted into their midst a Trojan Horse with the whole digital world inside. They did that because they didn’t see that these protocols connected everything digital without restriction and at no cost, obviating their billing-the-shit-out-of-everything business models.</p><p>The coup was complete after graphical browsers appeared and the only “backbone” within the Internet (of many nets using the TCP/IP protocol) that specifically forbid commercial activity (in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network#Acceptable_Use_Policy_(AUP)">Acceptable Use Policy</a>)—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network">NSFNet</a> in the U.S.—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network#Privatization_and_a_new_network_architecture">stood down on 30 April 1995</a>.

It hasn''t been published yet there, and may never be, which is why I''m putting it here.</i></p><p>Some weekend evening, drive to the hilly end of Manhattan: Hudson and Washington Heights, Inwood, Fort George. Take one of the bridges across the Harlem River to Morris, University, Fordham or Kingsbridge Heights. Head down University Ave to Highbridge, Mt. Eden. Go out to Tremont through Mt. Hope. Explore the Pelhams, the West, East and South Bronx. Take another bridge or two to the outer regions of Queens, and work your way down to the less hip sections of Brooklyn.</p><p>All along the way, keep hitting SCAN on your car radio. Most of what you''ll hear that''s not in Obvious English will be pirates. In any one spot, such as were I live in a part of Manhattan the locals call Washington Depths (down along Broadway north of 181st), you''ll hear not just one or two pirates, but dozens. On your whole trip you might hear a hundred or more. Some you''ll hear for miles on your journey. I once listened to a pirate on 89.7fm all the way to JFK Airport and back. For most of the trip, it destroyed reception of adjacent WKCR/89.9.</p><p>All these stations serve either the obsessions of their operators or communities licensed broadcasters don''t serve or abandoned long ago. I suspect in most cases it''s both.</p><p>This phenomenon needs to be understood, and cannot be reduced to the "piracy" label alone. It''s too big for that.</p><p>From what I can tell, few outside the phenomenon understand what''s going on. Not the industry, not lawmakers, and especially not the mainstream media.</p><p>In fact, most of the coverage I''ve read is what I''ve written about every two years or so: <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2013/09/13/pirate-radio-lives-big-time-in-new-york/"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2013/09/13/pirate-radio-lives-big-time-in-new-york/">https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2013/09/13/pirate-radio-lives-big-time-in-new-york/</span></a>  <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/06/18/the-untold-pirate-radio-story-in-new-york/"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/06/18/the-untold-pirate-radio-story-in-new-york/">https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/06/18/the-untold-pirate-radio-story-in-new-york/</span></a> and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/11/29/pirate/"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/11/29/pirate/">https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/11/29/pirate/</span></a> .</p><p>So, since you might be asking, here''s why I think it''s a Thing:</p><p>1) It''s cheap. Do this search and see how easy it is to put out a pirate FM signal: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fm+transmitters"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fm+transmitters">https://www.google.com/search?q=fm+transmitters</span></a> . For a studio, use your iPad. For an antenna, run some cable TV co-ax to a 30-inch whip antenna on your building''s roof.</p><p>2) New York''s licensed FMs are weak, by design. All are Class B (50kw/150m max), and there are no high-power grandfathers. To get above the city''s concrete canyons, most of New York''s Class Bs radiate only 6kw from the master antenna near the top of the Empire State Building, 413 meters above the ground there. Soon there will be six other structures higher than that in Manhattan.</p><p>2) A signal from midtown reaching a low floor at the north end of Broadway in Manhattan will pass through, around and over a hundred-plus blocks of other buildings and terrain to get there—and will sound like crap. (Perhaps oddly, listening in HD helps a lot, if the signal is still there.) This leaves lots of room for hyper-local pirates to step in, especially in the hilly places I named above.</p><p>3) Nearly all the pirates are in Spanish or some other language (or English dialect). Being into Hispanic Radio, you guys should care about this. If you do, come visit. I''ll show you around.</p><p>4) It''s social. This matters a lot.</p><p>Anybody up for actually covering this thing? Just wondering.</p><p>BTW, this comment seems to have failed moderation, at least so far, at <i>RadioInk</i>.</p>',NULL,'','2018-03-15 21:24:16','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

So it''s clear that radio is moving from over the air to over the Net, and what we (soon) used to call "coverage" is no longer limited by range over geography, but by access over Internet devices.</p><p>That''s one upside.</p><p>Another upside is that radio can now be interactive, meaning the listeners can do the talking as well. They can also sing back, sing along, join in with their own instruments, record streams and create mixes to distribute or share back. Those are all within the technical horizon of smart speakers today.</p><p>The downside is that smart speakers, so far, are a form of premium subscription cable radio, and what you can get is limited by what Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Sonos or some other company facilitates. And much or all of that facilitation is in those companies'' "clouds," rather than on your own independent device. Worse, those systems are closed and proprietary, meaning they don''t get along well with each other, on purpose. That''s so you get trapped inside those companies'' "silos" or "walled gardens." Worse than that, you have levels of privacy—at least with some of them—that are hardly above zero. (<a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple is an exception here, or at least tries to be</a>.)</p><p>Another interesting effect of smart speakers (and satellite speakers in, for example, Sonos and Bose systems) is the end of stereo sound outside the headphone, car and home theater environments. Today only audiophiles still care deeply about the science and art of stereo music through speakers.</p>',NULL,'','2018-01-10 14:14:32','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

It would be like turning a cruise ship into an aircraft carrier.</p><p>And, to a creepy degree, both the ads and prejudice-stoking postings actually work well enough—at least for the people and organizations placing them. That it works for bad guys as well as good guys—and is bad for culture and democracy—is a feature, not a bug. Again, <i>it was designed to do exactly what it does</i>.</p><p>You know Goethe''s (or hell, Disney''s) story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice">The Sorceror''s Apprentice</a>? Look it up. It''ll help. Because Mark Zuckerberg is both the the sorcerer <i>and</i> the apprentice. The difference with Zuck is that he doesn''t have all the mastery that''s in the sorcerer''s job description. He can''t control the spirits released by machines designed to violate personal privacy, produce echo chambers, and to rationalize both by pointing at how popular it all is with the billions who serve as human targets for messages (while saying as little as possible about the $billions that bad acting makes for the company).</p><p>Switching metaphors, Facebook is Humpty-Dumpty, and it''s already on the ground. None of King Mark''s horses (e.g. better algorithms) or men (and women, doing icky jobs) can put it together again.&nbsp;</p><p>Look at what''s happening for Zuck in terms of grief stages: denial, anger, bargaining and acceptance.</p><p>At first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103253901916271">he denied that the problem was there</a>—<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/thats-not-fake-egg-on-zuck-s-face-550023fecd3d">even as fraudulent and misleading ads ran right next to the post</a> where he did the denying. I suppose he went through the anger stage in private. Now he''s at the bargaining stage, betting that humans with awful jobs can halt the rising tide of outrage and embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>He''s not alone. In <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2018/how-to-fix-facebook-before-it-fixes-us/">How to Fix Facebook—Before It Fixes Us</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McNamee">Roger McNamee</a>, an investor and old friend of Zuckerberg''s, deeply examines What Went Wrong, and teams up with ethicist Tristan Harris to produce an eight-point prescription for fixing Facebook, and all the awful shit it''s doing to us.</p><p>It won''t work, because it can''t.</p><p>John Battelle explains why in two pieces published in his magazine <i>NewCo Shift</i>. The first, which went up last September, is <a href="https://shift.newco.co/lost-context-how-did-we-end-up-here-fd680c0cb6da">Lost Context: How Did We End Up Here?</a>&nbsp;The second, published today, is <a href="https://shift.newco.co/its-the-advertising-model-stupid-b843cd7edbe9">Facebook Can''t Be Fixed</a>. As his subhead explains, "Facebook’s fundamental problem is not foreign interference, spam bots, trolls, or fame mongers. It’s the company’s core business model, and abandoning it is not an option." That nicely compresses my main point here.</p><p>The best thing all of us can do, both for ourselves and for Facebook, is face both what it has become and how terminal it is.</p><p>The best thing for Zuck to do is get the hell out, let it finish failing, and start over with something new and better, based on what he and others have learned from the experience. (Which tends to be the best teacher. And hell, he''s still young.) It should help him—and all of us—to know that all companies fail; they just fail faster in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Google has the same problem, by the way, but is more aware of it, more diversified, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/our-commitments/">founded on far better intentions</a> (e.g. that nice stuff about gathering and sharing all the world''s knowledge) and therefore more likely to survive, at least for awhile.<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2010/09/03/3250/">&nbsp;</a></p><p>It helps to remember that&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2010/09/03/3250/">all companies have souls</a>&nbsp;born of founding purposes. And there''s a helluva big difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#History">a search engine meant to find "all the world''s knowledge"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook#2003%E2%80%932006:_Thefacebook,_Thiel_investment,_and_name_change">one meant to find hot girls on a college campus</a>.</p><p>Yet what matters far more than Facebook and Google is that we all live digital lives now, on a network that puts us all <a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/the-giant-zero-ce71920a2580">a functional distance apart of zero</a>.&nbsp;(When we''re connected, that is. The distance apart when we''re not is infinite).</p><p>This is new to human experience.</p><p>What we know about digital life so far is largely contained within what we''ve retrieved from the analog ones that preceded it. To wit,</p><ul><li>Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon might all deal in digital goods, but their structures and operating methods mostly improve on the ones modeled by Carnegie, Ford and J.P. Morgan.</li><li>YouTube and Netflix are TV 3.x (where over-the-air is 1.x and Cable is 2.x).</li><li>BuzzFeed, Verge and Vox are all print magazines in digital drag.</li><li>Podcasts are shattered remnants of radio.</li><li>The Web is networked Gutenberg.</li><li>Search engines are library card catalogs.</li><li>AI systems just automate decisions based on how shit gets remembered.</li></ul><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Marshall McLuhan says</a>&nbsp;all technologies are extensions of ourselves. Hammers, pens, binoculars, cars and computers all give us ways to do what we can''t do with our brains and bodies alone. What I just listed are early rudiments of what will surely come.</p><p>It helps to recognize that we are still going through early stages in our new Digital Age. Everything we know about digital life, so far, is contained within prototypes such as Facebook''s and Google''s. And all of those prototypes are just projects. If you don''t doubt it, look at your computer and your phone. Both are either new or to some degree already obsolete. Hell, even the new ones are old. Nothing will feel older a year from now than today''s latest Samsung and Apple mobile thingies.</p><p>It isn''t turtles all the way down, it''s scaffolding.</p><p>So let''s at least try to look below what big companies, Trump and other dancing figures in the digital world are doing, and try to look at the floor they''re dancing on—and the ground under it. That ground is new and unlike anything that precedes it in human experience. Nothing matters more than at least trying to understand it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>',NULL,'','2018-01-05 18:34:02','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

The story should be about how those firefighters, saved Ojai, Mussel Shoals, La Conchita, Oak View, Much of Dulah, Mira Monte, Wheeler Springs, Santa Paula, Filmore, Carpinteria, Montecito and finally Santa Barbara—after losing enough homes and businesses to comprise a whole town, mostly in Ventura, when the fire began.</p><p>Second is that Santa Barbara especially took a huge business hit this holiday season. After the most common sign in the windows of retail establishments was "for lease," the town got smoked out before half its people were evacuated, its parades and other events canceled and visitors headed elsewhere. Thus the "retail apocalypse" became something like the real thing.

The company put out sticky sheets of cardboard all around the perimeters of our rooms, plus little boxes of poison. A crew would come back from time to time and check on these things, all of which did exactly nothing other than cost the landlord money.</p><p>So I went to a nearby hardware store, bought some old fashioned mouse traps, which ought to be called mouse killers, because that''s what they are. Mounted on a small piece of wood is a rectangular bar on strong spring, which cocked has the power to whap down on a mouse and fold it in two. The trap snaps when the bait moves and releases the bar holding the kill-bark cocked. Those worked. We knew the mice were gone when none were left to touch the bait and get snap-folded in two.</p><p>Here at our Santa Barbara place, we''ve had a similar problem lately, with rats. Or, a rat. Every night around 12:30am, it would make loud noises in the space under our bathroom cabinet. We don''t know what path it took to get in there, because it appears to be completely sealed from all times; but it apparently comes and goes because it also feasts on tomatoes in our kitchen pantry. So this time I got a rat trap, which is a big brother of the mouse trap. It''s by the same <a href="http://www.victorpest.com/">Victor</a> brand that''s been making these things since the 19th Century. I baited it with some Trader Joe''s no-salt organic crunchy peanut butter and put it on the floor of our pantry. Sure enough, around midnight a loud SNAP! echoed through the house. I went to the pantry, and there was our rat, folded in two.&nbsp;</p><p>I''ve got another trap set now, so we''ll see if our late rat had companions. I kinda don''t think so, because the noise in the bathroom cabinet was also gone last night. But we''ll see.</p><p>Compared with the fires, which are now snowing the cremains of Ventura County all over our house and yard—and scaring the shit out of the whole South Coast—the rat is a small thing. But an old fashioned trap does beat the more expensive options, and that''s cool.</p>',NULL,'','2017-12-07 19:07:21','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

The problem is that the tech industry uses "cloud" to blur where stuff actually is and where it is happening. It''s a sleight-of-noun trick that causes far more harm than good. It bloats cognitive overhead, wastes time and forecloses countless opportunities.</p><p>Let''s start with time. Exhibit A: Apple''s iCloud.</p><p>It isn''t just that Apple has blurred what the hell iCloud is and what it''s for, but that the company has a fully annoying way of putting stuff in iCloud that used to be on one''s device or devices. It does this on the incorrect assumption that it is unhelpful for the individual to know where computing takes place and files get stored.</p><p>After Apple did that to me during an iOS upgrade to my phone last month, I spent hours talking to AppleCare, trying to figure out what the fuck happened and how to fix it. Never mind why, because the damage was already done. The main problem was trying to figure out&nbsp;how to get the music back on my phone, so I could listen again when I go offline, which I do a lot. For example, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=interestingness-desc&amp;text=subway&amp;view_all=1">in subways</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=interestingness-desc&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=cruise">on boats</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=interestingness-desc&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=aerial">on planes</a>, in countries where cloud use is spinctered, or driving around the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157685178733601">middle of Wyoming</a>.</p><p>Apple has also done its ironic best to both popularize podcasting and to make listening to podcasts as hard as possible. The worst thing it has done, of course, is locate podcasts in iCloud, while making it nearly impossible to figure out where the hell one''s podcasts are.&nbsp;</p><p>All this blurring also masks loss of autonomy and agency, and increased dependency on what amount to feudal overlords. It''s getting to the point where, if you''re not a hacker with a full suite of tools and skills for remaining independent in the connected world, you are in a state of at least partial slavery.</p><p>I''d write more, but I gotta go deal with shit before I fly again to elsewhere.

Or place ads there.” And he said, “Well, let me just tell you the truth. We’re going to place ads there for a little bit, we’re going to drop cookies, we’re going to figure out who your readers are, we’re going to find out what other websites they go to that are way cheaper than your website and then we’re gonna pull our ads from your website and move them there.”</blockquote><p>Only programmatic adtech makes this possible, and it''s essential to know it''s <i>not</i>&nbsp;advertising as we used to know it, but only looks that way. As with magic, it''s pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdirection_(magic)">misdirection</a>.</p><p>What we miss is that adtech isn''t advertising. It just magically looks that way.</p><p>Let''s examine the differences.</p><p>In the old advertising world, advertising wasn''t personal. It was aimed at populations defined by the media people read, watched or listened to. Advertisers sponsored those media directly, because they wanted to reach the kinds of readers, viewers and listeners who liked particular papers, magazines, radio and TV stations, networks and programs.</p><p>Sponsor is what they did, and that''s what Walt Mossberg heard that Recode wasn''t going to get from programmatic adtech—straight from the magician''s&nbsp; mouth.</p><p>With programmatic adtech (tracking-based advertising), ads follow eyeballs. In the online print world, readers are tagged with spyware in their browsers or apps and tracked like animals. Personal data and metadata about those readers are harvested and munched by machines, which place ads against profiles of reader types, no matter where they show up.</p><p>The result on the receiving end looks like old-fashioned advertising, but it''s really direct response marketing (née direct mail, aka junk mail), which has always wanted to get personal, has always demanded that every ad get direct results, and has always excused massive negative externalities, such as the simple fact that people fucking hate it.&nbsp;</p><p>But nearly everybody covering the industry falls for it. So does the industry itself. As I wrote in <a href="http://j.mp/adwhtch">Separating Advertising''s Wheat and Chaff</a>, "Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself."</p><p>And the misdirection works.</p><p>Jennifer (@marketeer2u) fell for it when she <a href="https://twitter.com/Marketeer2u/status/918276046562226176">tweeted</a>&nbsp;".@ANAmarketers NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Your ads are running on Breitbart. Fix it. @slpng_giants." So does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giants">Sleeping Giants</a> in their campaign against "racist and sexist media," because they think the problem lies with advertisers. But the advertiser has little or no control, as long as they distribute ads through eyeball-chasing adtech.</p><p>But they <i>do</i> have control if they go back to sponsoring publications directly. As I suggest in <a href="http://bit.ly/ltst1t">Let''s get some things straight about publishing and advertising,</a>&nbsp;we need a word, a symbol or a hashtag that says an ad is <i>not</i>&nbsp;tracking-based adtech. There I suggest #SafeAd.</p><p>Programmatic at best can only blacklist a site like Breitbart, and program that blacklist into one or more of the thousands of systems that might aim an ad (and many may be in the supply chain between advertiser, agency and publication). But that''s not going to fix the problem. Advertisers need to fire adtech. Simple as that. This is what AdAge, the ANA, Sleeping Giants and everybody else who wants to save advertising''s ass should be urging.</p><p><a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/08/26/apples-content-blocking-is-chemo-for-the-cancer-of-adtech/">Adtech is a cancer</a>&nbsp;on advertisers, publishers, and everybody it tracks.</p><p>We already have one form of chemo in ad blocking.&nbsp;According to <a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/adblockreport/">PageFair’s 2017 Adblock Report</a>, at least 11% of the world’s population is now blocking ads on at least 615 million devices. <a href="http://blog.globalwebindex.net/chart-of-the-day/37-of-mobile-users-are-blocking-ads/">According to GlobalWebIndex</a>, 37% of all mobile users, worldwide, were blocking ads by January of 2016, and another 42% would like to. With <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/">more than 4.77 billion mobile phone users in the world by 2017</a>, that means more than 1.7 billion people are blocking ads already: a sum exceeding the population of the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>This easily amounts to <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in human history</a>. Yet a measure of the industry''s cluelessness is that it treats ad blocking <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/10/11/uk-publishers-lose-nearly-3bn-revenue-annually-due-adblocking">as a problem</a> rather than as a clear and legitimate signal of demand by the marketplace for something better. Which they had in plain old-fashioned media-sponsoring brand advertising, before they let their brains get eaten by adtech.</p><p>It''s no coincidence that<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/ad-blockers-and-the-next-chapter-of-the-internet">&nbsp;ad blocking took off in 2012-13</a>, when the advertising and publishing businesses together gave the middle finger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was never more than a polite request for what in the offline world we call good manners. (Think about it: what customer visiting a store would want to leave with a tracking beacon stuck to their butt like a wood tick, reporting their activities back to parties unknown, just so they can get a better "advertising experience" or whatever?) Its also no coincidence that the rise in ad blocking also traced the rise in retargeting by adtech: an obvious reveal that one is being followed. (<a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/woman-stalked-across-8-websites-obsessed-shoe-adve-51519">Woman Stalked Across Eight Websites By Obsessed Shoe Advertisement</a> is a typically right-on <i>Onion</i> story.)</p><p>And don''t fall for the story that tracking-based ads are "<a href="https://acceptableads.com/">acceptable</a>" as long as they aren''t&nbsp;<a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/trade-bodies-google-judge-jury-executioner/310865/">annoying." </a>That''s just more misdirection.</p><p>From&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/f1r8tch">Brands need to fire adtech</a>:</p><blockquote>It’s adtech that <a href="http://bit.ly/2mDBPLo">spies on people and violates their privacy</a>.

Yet plenty of brands have been harmed by it. For example, the ANA itself in the case AdAge reports.</p><p>The advertising business can''t save itself. It needs help from the very people it intends to reach. That''s why I co-founded <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, and why we''re working on <a href="http://customercommons.org/terms">terms</a>&nbsp;any one of us can assert <a href="http://bit.ly/cstmrs1st">that are friendly to advertisers and publishers</a>.

Nothing could be simpler, more do-able or more far-reaching.</p><p>We''ll also need this fix before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR, Europe''s General Data Protection Regulation</a>, comes into effect next May, with potentially enormous fines for spying on EU citizens, no matter where those citizens'' eyeballs may be.</p><p>I explain exactly what we need to do <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2017/09/03/good-news-for-publishers-and-advertisers-fearing-the-gdpr/">here</a>.

"Measure the tracking-protected audience," he says. "You can’t sell advertising without data on who the audience is. Much of that data will have to come from the tracking-protected audience. When quality sites share tracking protection data with advertisers, that helps expose the adfraud that intermediaries have no incentive to track down."</p>',NULL,'','2017-10-12 21:51:46','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

INSERT INTO items VALUES('http://my.1999.io/users/dsearls/2017/09/04/aCleverWayToDropAPileOfFmSignalsIntoTheSaltLakeMarket.html','A clever way to drop a pile of FM signals into the Salt Lake market','<p>When I was driving up to watch the eclipse, I naturally (for me) took an interest in what was happening on radio along the way. I have way too much to report on that (and I probably never will report most of it), but I''ll unpack one small discovery for the few (or none) of you who might be interested. It''s from notes I took en route but didn''t post because there was no connection.</p><p>Among the stations we heard heading through northeast Utah and southwest Wyoming was <a href="http://bit.ly/hUmpyFM">a collection of ten huge signals</a>, all Class C (the biggest allowed, with 100,000 watts at 2000 feet above average terrain), most radiating on channels called Class A (107.1, 102.3, 103.1... ) which are normally reserved for local signals (max of 6000 watts at 300 feet), though the rules got more lax about that in recent years.</p><p>The site they transmit from, I discovered, is <a href="http://bit.ly/wUmpy">Humpy Peak</a>&nbsp;in the Uintah mountains (far east of Salt Lake). They share a <a href="http://www.shively.com/im-6016.pdf">Shively 6016</a> panel antenna stacked 20 high (good sale for <a href="http://www.shively.com/">Shively</a>), to maximize gain toward the horizon. All the stations put out 89,000 watts at 2,123 feet, which is equivalent to 100,000 at 2,000 feet, and they do it with transmitters that are just 7,900 watts eacj. While that''s a good way to save watts, it''s highly unusual. Almost... insincere.&nbsp;</p><p>What are they really up to with this? I wondered. Is it just so all these signals can reach Evanston, Wyoming, population 12,000, 43 miles away and the only population center to which these giant signals have a clear shot? (FM stations want to be high up because FM is mostly a line-of-sight band.)</p><p>Here''s the reason, and I''d love to know who thought it up.</p><p>See, while the signals of all these stations are terrain-shadowed in the Salt Lake market by the Wasatch Mountains, the site is close enough to put the predicted signals'' primary service area over the Salt Lake metro, but far enough from Farnsworth Peak (home of all the big Salt Lake FMs) to allow Class C signals to drop in on second-adjacent channels, which are mostly those Class A''s. That way all the Humpy Peak FMs can put up boosters, some with powers up to 20,000 watts, at elevated locations on the east side of Salt Lake, Provo and Ogden, to fill in that shadowed terrain, which is full of people and business.</p><p>I just read that one of those stations was just sold for $1.1 million. What the new owner got was those boosters. Not the giant place-holder signal serving mountain goats in the wilderness.</p><p>For the record, such as it is, the stations are KZNS-FM/97.5 Coalville UT, KYMV/100.7 Woodruff UT, KEGA/101.5 Oakley UT, KDUT/102.3 Randolph UT, KSQN/103.1 Coalville UT, KNIV104.7 Lyman, WY, KBMG/106.3 Evanston WY, KEGH/107.1 Woodruff UT and KUMT/107.9 Randolph UT. </p><p>Of those only KDUT, KBMG and KNIV don''t have a raft of booster signals into the Salt Lake and adjacent valleys that are terrain-shadowed by the Wasatch Range from these powerful signals coming from the east.</p><p>A sale is also pending for KUMT, which will go to Brigham Young University. The booster for Provo is a highly directional 1.75kw one, radiating to the NNW from below the Y on the side of Y mountain, above the BYU campus.</p>',NULL,'','2017-09-05 01:25:17','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

Here''s one idea.',replace('<p>At a time when the U.S. is (or at least seems to be) growing more polarized than at any time since the Civil War approached, and when the two poles need more than ever to understand each other, and to respect what the other pole knows best (and not just what the other pole believes—a subtle and important distinction), maybe the dumbest thing the left pole can do is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36PcA6AscrI">start taking down</a>, defacing and (o shit, there it is: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/593e696be4b0b65670e56c2e">hanging</a>) statues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.myneworleans.com/Blogs/The-Editors-Room/August-2017/The-Monuments-Wisdom-From-Andrew-Young/">Andrew Young explains why</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I''ll add this: statues are symbols imbued with all kinds of deep and unspoken emotions: good, bad, too mixed to separate—and all to various degree historically inaccurate, regardless of what political point one views them from. They are also distractions away from the real work that needs to be done, starting with listening and caring. All you can do with them, at least politically, is attack or defend them. There are better things to do.</p>\n\n<p>(The dumbest things the right pole did were to elect Trump and keep supporting him after it became vividly clear that he''s a monomaniacal narcissist—in other words, everything&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@judithd/https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-2oo8qzdhimq-dfefbd063116">Judith Donath</a>, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-president-of-blank-sucking-nullity-roth">David Roth</a> and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/taibbi-blame-media-for-creating-world-dumb-enough-for-trump-w499649">Matt Taibbi</a>&nbsp;say about him.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead of taking down statues, the left needs to stand for what it knows best, which is good (not just bigger) government, caring about people, and civic life as a whole. None of this is well expressed on the left (least of all by the Democratic party), which would rather fight Trump and his most awful supporters: a sucker''s game that Trump is much better at than they are. (He''s one big attention sink, for everybody.)</p>\n\n<p>What the left needs most to <i>do</i>&nbsp;begins with understanding what the right forgot when it repurposed itself (with talk radio and Fox News) around throwing shit at the left. Specifically, <i>understanding</i>&nbsp;<i>business—especially the small kind</i>.</p><p>Depending on where you draw the line, small business is between 97% and 99% of all business in the U.S. and at the high end of that range in the rest of the world. From&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/smizbig">Small is the New Big</a>:</p><blockquote>Nearly all of what happens in business is too small and ordinary for Wall Street to care much about. Same goes for investors, business reporters and politicians. Even economists don’t pay much attention. What they see are the waves and weather on the surface of the world’s economic ocean, when what matters most is the mass of water below...&nbsp;None of them want to grow their businesses any larger than they need to be. None thought about an exit when they started up. None call themselves “entrepreneurs,” or go to expensive conferences. Instead they socialize at bars, clubs, gyms, restaurants, churches, city parks, beaches, ball games and on the street. They tend to have roles rather than jobs. When you need one, you look for a mechanic, a painter, a lawyer or a driver. All of them also help each other out, side by side, face to face, in the physical world.</blockquote><p>Of course this is an opportunity for both the left and the right. But the right abandoned small business when it moved its center of economic interest from Main Street to Wall Street, and decided that all business needed was "draining the swamp" and cutting taxes, especially for rich people.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this an opportunity for the left is that it''s a new place it can care about people. And the opportunity is there at all levels of government, from local on up.</p>\n\n<p>I don''t know if that''s possible, since I''ve always been amazed (as a political independent who has leaned left since fighting for civil rights and against the Vietnam War in the ''60s) at how little the left understands business, or outright dislikes it.</p><p>But I''m telling ya, the opportunity is there. Stop using "capitalism" as an epithet and start looking at ordinary people''s business opportunities, as well as their problems. Look for paths to small business success. Create openings for both ordinary and exceptional business ambitions. And yes, put cutting taxes and government red tape on the table. Republicans are right about those, even though they care far less about those things than about getting funded by the Koch Brothers.</p>\n\n<p>And please drop the statue thing, at least for now. It''s bad strategy.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/right-wing/president-nation-central-metaphor-trump-lives">Bonus link</a>&nbsp;from <a href="https://twitter.com/georgelakoff">@GeorgeLakoff</a>.</p>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2017-08-27 16:11:58','Doc Searls'' doc.blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:25','read');

In that sampling, which totaled about 1800 miles, the clichés obtained. From what I saw, eastern urban driving is on the whole aggressive, though not always competitive. Drivers just want to make the light, merge, cut the other driver off, and honk. Western driving can get competitive, meaning there seem to be a lot of drivers who want to win, which they do by getting ahead of other cars and trucks. Speeding is even more standard than elsewhere, perhaps because posted speed limits are 70 and 75. There is also much less honking.</p><p>California drivers are, in my ample experience outside this trip, relatively polite, meaning they''re more willing to let somebody cut in, or to wave somebody through an intersection. I think that''s because 4-way stops are standard throughout California (far more than anywhere else I''ve been), and the protocols are well understood. Californians also understand that the official protocol for merging traffic is to alternate. This was not understood very well during our time in Wyoming, but all my evidence gathering was in the worst traffic jam in the state''s history, when visitors in the dozens of thousands who came to see the eclipse departed <i>en masse</i>&nbsp;from their temporary stations from Lander east past Riverton and Shoshone. It took us six hours to creep west through those three towns, a distance of about 40 miles. License plates on the cars, trucks, campers and RVs we saw were from all over the West (with a few from the east, including our van, registered to Virginia but rented out of Santa Barbara). And it seemed like nobody other than folks with Wyoming plates were willing to let merging traffic in.</p><p>Strangest and most dangerous were the drivers eager to pass slower traffic that was already going the 70mph speed limit westbound on 2-lane Wyoming highway 28. We couldn''t count how many cars passed on blind hills in oblivity to the possibility of oncoming cars they might hit head on. As my son said, they seemed to be motivated more by anger than impatience. After sitting for hours in stopped traffic, they were damned if they would let any opportunity to get ahead go by.</p><p>After so long on the road in that van, it was good to get back into our nice little new ''05 Subaru in New York. It amazed me by starting right up and running perfectly. The only bummer was two months of sparrow guano and rotted juniper berries on the hood and the windshield.

Last year I noted that this rule applied to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/03/shadow-banking-20.html"><i>Shadow Banking 2.0</i></a> based on Prof. Hilary Allen''s <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4038788"><i>DeFi: Shadow Banking 2.0?</i></a> which she summarizes thus:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTL;DR: DeFi is neither decentralized, nor very good finance, so regulators should have no qualms about clamping down on it to protect the stability of our financial system and broader economy. \n</blockquote>\nAnd also <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.htm"><i> DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion </i></a> by Sirio Aramonte, Wenqian Huang and Andreas Schrimpf of the Bank for International Settlements who write:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWhile the main vision of DeFi’s proponents is intermediation without centralised entities, we argue that some form of centralisation is inevitable. As such, there is a “decentralisation illusion”. First and foremost, centralised governance is needed to take strategic and operational decisions. In addition, some features in DeFi, notably the consensus mechanism, favour a concentration of power.\n</blockquote>\nBelow the fold I look at new evidence that the process of centralizing DeFi is essentially complete.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nIn <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto"><i>DeFi Is Becoming Less Competitive a Year After FTX’s Collapse Battered Crypto</i></a> Muyao Shen highlights the situation:<br />\n<blockquote>\nA small number of participants are dominating the world of decentralized finance as the crypto sector, which seeks to replicate financial markets without middlemen, still hasn’t recovered from FTX’s collapse a year ago.<br />\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHHD8mf564mXHnAdezpbg7qrMsZnK0HeaYaGgr_iSm87BQQ3gOqllPvS7fhnBtNamb3kpWmsfCOi68JHidBwcoc4e1f3uO7vN31YJAKBT-FZTwd-hjv30oDGpWy6I8ooVT-CoT-_OHceYD08yQrnsBLnLoU9v1wlDk9cefVR82vY1pQKWjkmzdOrX1CoTr/s938/H-H-Index.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="796" data-original-width="938" height="170" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHHD8mf564mXHnAdezpbg7qrMsZnK0HeaYaGgr_iSm87BQQ3gOqllPvS7fhnBtNamb3kpWmsfCOi68JHidBwcoc4e1f3uO7vN31YJAKBT-FZTwd-hjv30oDGpWy6I8ooVT-CoT-_OHceYD08yQrnsBLnLoU9v1wlDk9cefVR82vY1pQKWjkmzdOrX1CoTr/w200-h170/H-H-Index.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nShen uses <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto">research from a "crypto-risk modeling company"</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMost categories in DeFi — from peer-to-peer lending to decentralized exchanges — are seeing capital largely held in a few major projects, according to data compiled by crypto-risk modeling company Gauntlet.

It shows that the top project, Lido, has 55% of the revenue, the top two have 2/3, and the top four projects have 78%. This is clearly a highly concentrated market, typical of cryptocurrency markets in general.<br />\n<br />\nWhy does the centralization of Defi matter? First, for all the bad things concentration causes in general markets — see for example Matt Stoller''s <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/"><i>Big</i></a>. But more importantly, because the technologies of decentralization impose massive costs over and above those of equivalent centralized systems. The incentive to pay these additional costs is to reap the profits centralized systems sacrifice to regulation. If you are paying the costs but not evading regulation, what is the point? I discussed this in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/02/economic-incentives.html"><i>Economic Incentives</i></a>.<br />\n<br />\nI''ve argued many times, most recently to the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html">IOSCO DeFi Working Group</a>, that regulators should ignore the alleged "decentralization" of cryptocurrency systems and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/dominoes.html">go after the major players</a> in each area. With lawsuits against <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=sam-bankman-fried-convicted">FTX'' management</a>, <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/06/07/the-sec-sues-coinbase-its-on/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/10/30/new-york-vs-dcg-genesis-and-gemini-kids-kids-youre-both-ugly/">DCG/Genesis and Gemini</a>, <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=kraken-sued-by-us-sec">Kraken</a>, and <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/07/15/crypto-collapse-alex-mashinsky-of-celsius-arrested-ripples-bizarre-xrp-win-gemini-sues-genesis-gisele-bundchen-knew-nothing/">Celsius and Alex Mashinsky</a>, and now their <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">$4.3B criminal conviction of Binance and CZ</a>, the US regulators no longer seem to be going after the small fry. Presumably, they used winning against the small fry to build precedents they are now using against bigger fish.<br />\n<br />\nIf despite claims of "decentralization" regulators can shut down the few big players in a market, the decentralized systems will be paying the massive extra costs but not reaping the unregulated profits. Of course, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a> aspect; kill a big player and one or more smaller players will get bigger enough to be worth taking out. But it won''t take many of these cycles for the market to get the message.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-28 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

Crypto-skeptics like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4">Bitfinex''ed</a> and <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2018/05/24/explaining-the-justice-department-cftc-criminal-investigation-into-bitcoin-trading-and-likely-bitfinex-tether/">Davd Gerard</a> have been pointing out obvious instances of manipulation for many years, and there is a considerable academic literature demonstrating manipulation, such as <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30783"><i>Crypto Wash Trading</i></a> by Lin William Cong <i>et al</i>, which demonstrates:<br />\n<blockquote>\nabnormal first-significant-digit distributions, size rounding, and transaction tail distributions on unregulated exchanges reveal rampant manipulations unlikely driven by strategy or exchange heterogeneity. We quantify the wash trading on each unregulated exchange, which averaged over 70% of the reported volume.\n</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, despite knowing about the manipulation, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/29/bitcoin-could-double-in-price-under-cftc-regulation-chairman-behnam-says/">CFTC approved Bitcoin futures ETFs</a>. Among the requests that the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/07/pump-and-dump-schemes.html">SEC refused</a> was one from <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/04/grayscale-bitcoin-trust.html">Grayscale Bitcoin Trust</a>. Grayscale sued the SEC and, back in August, the panel of judges <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/whats-stake-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-case-against-sec-2023-08-29/">ruled in their favor</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe court''s panel of judges said Grayscale showed that its proposed bitcoin ETF is "materially similar" to the approved bitcoin futures ETFs. That''s because the underlying assets— bitcoin and bitcoin futures - are "closely correlated," and because the surveillance sharing agreements with the CME are "identical and should have the same likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market for bitcoin."<br />\n<br />\nWith that in mind, the court ruled that the SEC was "arbitrary and capricious" to reject the filing because it "never explained why Grayscale owning bitcoins rather than bitcoin futures affects the CME’s ability to detect fraud."\n</blockquote>\nThe prospect of the SEC approving this ETF and others from, for example, BlackRock and Fidelity led to something of a buying frenzy in Bitcoin as shown in the "price" chart, and in headlines such as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-10/bitcoin-etf-exuberance-drives-four-week-nothing-for-sale-rally"><i>Bitcoin ETF Exuberance Drives Four-Week ‘Nothing for Sale’ Rally</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBitcoin is climbing for a fourth consecutive week, with the digital token’s price lingering just below an 18-month high of $38,000, as more investors bet that US exchange-traded funds that hold the largest cryptocurrency are on the verge of winning regulatory approval.\n</blockquote>\nBelow the fold I look into where this euphoria came from, and why it might be misplaced<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThere already are spot Bitcoin ETFs, just not in the USA. I believe the <a href="https://amycastor.com/2022/04/19/welcome-to-grayscales-hotel-california/">first launched</a> in:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFebruary 2021, when the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/18/2177751/0/en/Purpose-Investments-Launches-World-s-First-Bitcoin-ETF-Invested-Directly-in-the-Digital-Asset.html">Purpose bitcoin ETF</a> launched in Canada. Unlike GBTC, which trades over-the-counter, Purpose trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, close to NAV. At 1%, its management fees are half that of GBTC. Within a month of trading, Purpose quickly absorbed more than $1 billion worth of assets.\n</blockquote>\nSo why would a US-based Bitcoin ETF be a big deal? The thesis is that by making it easier for US <strike>investors</strike>gamblers to put money into BTC it would increase demand and thus the price.

That is the real problem, as shown in the graph of Coinbase''s trading volume. Volume, and thus liquidity, has collapsed since the heady days of 2021.

The exchange saw $76 billion in total trading volume in Q3, down from $92 billion in Q2. (They did $547 billion in trading volume in Q4 2021, their last profitable quarter.) \n</blockquote>\nSo volume is down 84% from its peak. No wonder Coinbase laid off staff in <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/18/coinbases-layoffs-show-growing-callous-side-of-cryptos-plummet/">June 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/business/coinbase-layoffs-crypto.html">January 2023</a>. And why <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/crypto-exchange-blockchain-com-raises-110-million-at-fraction-of-prior-value?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">Blockchain.com just raised money</a> at less than half its valuation in 2022.<br />\n<br />\nThe problems are exacerbated by the fact that last June the <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/06/07/the-sec-sues-coinbase-its-on/">SEC sued Coinbase</a> for:<br />\n<blockquote>\nselling unregistered securities and running an exchange, a broker-dealer, and a clearinghouse as part of the same operation — and without registering any of these.\n</blockquote>\nCastor and Gerard <a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/11/07/coinbase-q3-earnings-regulatory-clarity-is-all-we-need-and-a-miracle-or-two/">point out that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIf the SEC wins, Coinbase may have to stop trading in any cryptos other than CFTC-regulated commodity coins such as bitcoin. There isn’t enough volume in those for Coinbase to live on.<br />\n<br />\nThis is why Coinbase is so insistent on trading blatant unregistered securities  — it’s all they have left for a business model.\n</blockquote>\nLynn Parramore transcribes an interview with Jim Chanos in <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/jim-chanos-the-crypto-ecosystem-is-well-suited-for-the-dark-side-of-finance.html"><i>Jim Chanos: “The Crypto Ecosystem Is Well-Suited for the Dark Side of Finance.”</i></a> that expresses the famed short-seller''s skepticism:<br />\n<blockquote>\nJC: ... The last iteration that you just touched upon is the hope by aspects of Wall Street that crypto gets institutionalized because the one thing that Bitcoin really has — and we’ve pointed this out to our clients — is ridiculous levels of transaction fees associated with it. So Coinbase, for example, which is one of our shorts, charges customers over 4% per round trip trade to transact in a so-called currency.<br />\n<br />\n<b>LP: Why would people be willing to pay that?</b><br />\n<br />\nJC: Well, exactly. They think the asset price is going to go up. It’s like a Nasdaq stock, not a currency. So they’ll pay, and Wall Street wants the fees. The cost structure in crypto is quite high and so the fees are really high. You need retail investors because institutions aren’t going to be paying 4% per round trip to buy and sell Bitcoin. Mom and Pop are, so Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in the crypto space. The paradox, of course, is that if BlackRock and Vanguard and whoever do get ETFs, it’s actually going to force fees down, not up, because ETF fees will be a fraction of the cost of what Coinbase or Binance charge. It’s like mutual fund fees and stock trading fees: they’ve all converged to zero.\n</blockquote>\nSo, even if there <i>is</i> a flood of retail money into Bitcoin ETFs, the exchanges'' fee income isn''t going to recover. Chanos'' students share his <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/jim-chanos-the-crypto-ecosystem-is-well-suited-for-the-dark-side-of-finance.html">skepticism about the industry</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n<b>LP: Are your Wisconsin students still excited about crypto?</b><br />\n<br />\nJC: They were much more enthusiastic in 2021, 2020, 2019. There’s a lot less enthusiasm now in terms of students going to work for a crypto startup or whatever. I had a number of them in 2020 and 2021 who said they were going to work in the digital currency or blockchain space. I don’t hear that as much anymore.<br />\n<br />\n<b>LP: How about your Yale students?</b><br />\n<br />\nJC: The last two springs, they’ve been skeptical. During the spring semester of 2022, Bankman-Fried’s now-infamous interview with Bloomberg dropped about an hour before my class started. I ran to the audiovisual department to see if I could get the interview up on our screen because to me it was such a bombshell. This was where Bankman-Fried basically called the crypto ecosystem a giant Ponzi scheme. I told the class it was very rare to get an industry leader telling you that his industry is a Ponzi scheme. That was seven months before the collapse.\n</blockquote>\nWill the flood happen?\nTeresa Xie''s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-04/former-crypto-day-traders-say-no-thanks-even-as-bitcoin-roars-back"><i>Former Crypto Day Traders Say No Thanks Even as Bitcoin Roars Back</i></a> presents some negative evidence:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCraig Murray, who estimates he made almost $200,000 in the market, says he escaped losing everything to FTX by a hair after friends in the industry heard whispers about its imminent collapse. By that point, the 23-year-old — who lives in New York and recently dropped out of Vanderbilt University — had made up his mind.<br />\n<br />\n“That kind of put me over the edge,” Murray said. “I just decided it wasn’t worth it. Why would I have my money in this space when there’s a chance that one day it could just all go away?”<br />\n<br />\nAnother sign that retail investing in crypto isn’t returning to previous levels can be seen in weekday versus weekend volumes, with the presumption that the typical person trading on a weekend is a day trader.<br />\n<br />\n“It’s not unusual nowadays to see weekday trading volume average 50% higher values than weekend trading volume, whereas in the past this ratio was almost 1:1,” said Fredrick Collins, chief executive and founder of crypto data platform Velo Data.\n</blockquote>\nSo it seems unlikely that there will be a huge flood of retail dollars into the market. Even if there were, they would go into Bitcoin ETFs, which would present the exchanges with two big problems:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>much less retail trading, because it would migrate to ETFs for low fees and the security of dealing with institutions like BlackRock,</li>\n<li>and a much higher proportion of very low fee institutional trading.</li>\n</ul>\nIt seems likely that even if the cryptosphere''s hopes for ETFs materialize the exchanges will end up in an even worse position than they now are.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-21 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

This ethos has informed digital preservation best practices since its introduction, and has shaped the design and implementation of the LOCKSS open-source software.”<br />\n<br />\nDavid Rosenthal and Vicky Reich’s brainchild—and the enduring preservation networks that it has made possible—was at the leading edge of a global wave of digital preservation initiatives in the early 20th century. The effectiveness and reliability of LOCKSS software has been validated through rigorous third-party evaluation, including ongoing certification of the CLOCKSS archive as a trustworthy digital repository under the TRAC standard since 2014. The LOCKSS project has provided enduring proof of the concept that large-scale digital preservation work can be accomplished cost-effectively and with community benefits (not vendor profits) as the primary driver.<br /> \n<br />\nRosenthal and Reich’s work on LOCKSS stands as a benchmark against which other approaches to digital preservation and persistent access to digital resources are measured. \n<br />\n<h3>Response</h3>\nThe LOCKSS Program was <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/lockss-program-turns-25.html">25 years old</a> last month.

It has never been audited, and has been described as being "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">practically quilted out of red flags</a>". Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-31/bad-passwords-are-securities-fraud">says</a> "I feel like eventually Tether is going to be an incredibly interesting story, but I still don’t know what it is." He was commenting on Emily Nicolle''s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile"><i>Bankman-Fried Trial Renews Conjecture About Alameda’s $40 Billion Tether Stablecoin Pile</i></a> by Emily Nicolle. It includes a lot of interesting information, starting with this:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAlameda was Tether’s largest non-exchange customer between 2020 and 2022, with blockchain data showing it received almost $40 billion in transfers of its stablecoin USDT directly from the company — equal to roughly 20% of all USDT tokens ever issued.<br />\n</blockquote>\nBelow the fold, I discuss the questions Nicolle raises, and go on to ask one she doesn''t<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThe <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">obvious question is</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe vast amount has raised questions about where Alameda got the money to fund the issuance of the stablecoin, which is typically used as a dollar proxy and is the world’s most traded cryptocurrency. That even led to speculation Alameda might have used other means to help fund the purchases, similar to its bets on startups or dealings with lenders.\n</blockquote>\nBy "other means" Nicolle means using FTX''s FTT token. But, if you can believe Tether, that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">isn''t what happened</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTether’s incoming chief executive Paolo Ardoino appeared to clear up the mystery in a social media <a href="https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1715083160109683181?s=20">post</a> this month, reiterating an earlier statement that the hedge fund wired dollars to Tether in exchange for the cryptocurrency.\n</blockquote>\nAn important part of the story is that most people and institutions can''t buy USDT from, or sell USDT to, Tether directly. They have to go via one of the small number of institutions that are Tether customers. And those customers can only buy or sell in large amounts. Alameda was one of these customers. Nicolle quotes <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">Jonathan Reiter</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n“This was one major on-ramp, maybe the major on-ramp” for traders seeking access to USDT, said Jonathan Reiter, CEO of blockchain analytics firm ChainArgos. “It is certainly peculiar that FTX, which is now alleged to have run an essentially fraudulent exchange, still somehow managed to intermediate tens of billions in one-way flow from USD into USDT.”\n</blockquote>\nMy oversimplified mental model of stablecoins like USDT is that they are the chips in the casino. If you want to play the tables, you need to hand dollars to the cashier and get chips in return, because the tables only accept chips.  The cashiers in the cryptocurrency casino need accounts at banks, so they can receive dollars or other fiat, and accounts at Tether, so they can receive USDT. Since the early days of Tether, it has been increasingly difficult for cryptocurrency traders and exchanges to maintain accounts at banks. For example, in this interview of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Charles Yang by John Riggins</a>, Yang (head trader of Genesis Block based in Hong Kong) says:<br />\n<blockquote>\nbank acccounts are the absolute most valuable thing — you have to set up a bunch of different companies, a lot of different bank accounts just to facilitate trades that aren''t that big, maybe $50K. The moment you tell them this is for a USDT trade, you''re basically asking them to shut your bank account down.\n</blockquote>\nAlameda, run by ex-Wall Street whiz-kid US citizens, had the savvy and credentials to have bank accounts through which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">billions of dollars could be moved</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAlameda received around $39.6 billion in USDT tokens from Tether’s treasury wallet, according to on-chain data tracking its wallets, as labeled by the Arkham Intelligence platform.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile wallets connected to FTX sent $3.9 billion in USDT tokens back to Tether, all during the crash of TerraUSD and Luna in May 2022 — meaning that Alameda largely transferred the tokens it received to other entities, rather than cashing it out for dollars with Tether directly. It’s worth noting that this may not record all of FTX or Alameda’s redeemed tokens due to the way Tether swaps its coins between different blockchains, according to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan, who updated Alameda’s USDT total after most of its transactions were <a href="https://protos.com/tether-papers-crypto-stablecoin-usdt-investigation-analysis/">first reported</a> by Protos in 2021.\n</blockquote>\nPresumably, Alameda received dollars via their accounts at US banks such as the late lamented Signature and Silvergate, aggregated them into orders big enough for Tether, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">then</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTo mint or redeem USDT, FTX would transfer funds via its own accounts at Tether’s Bahamas-based bank Deltec Bank or a US-based correspondent bank, Bankman-Fried said in a series of social media posts in 2021. A popular solution utilized by Tether and other crypto firms were banking networks established by Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, both of which collapsed earlier this year.\n</blockquote>\nThe mismatch between the minting and redeeming is why Reiter talks about a "one-way flow from USD into USDT". It seems clear that Alameda was exploiting its access to both the banking system and Tether to facilitate this flow. How big a player were they <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">in this flow?</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nA rough estimate using transactional data for USDT’s main two networks — Ethereum and Tron, which support about 98% of USDT’s current circulation — shows Tether has issued about $190 billion in USDT between its inception and Oct. 20, according to analysis by ChainArgos.<br />\n<br />\nConversely, Tether has redeemed about $108 billion in its lifetime. The difference is about $82 billion, compared with around $84 billion in circulation. The discrepancy can be attributed to the amount of USDT trading on other blockchains, according to ChainArgos.\n</blockquote>\nAlameda bought $40B of USDT out of a total mint of $190B and sold $4B out of total burn of $108B.  They were ~21% of the on-ramp but only 4% of the off-ramp.<br />\n<br />\nNicolle again <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">quotes Reiter</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n“This does not really look like a market-maker or trading firm as those terms are normally used. It looks more like a money changer,” said Reiter.<br />\n<br />\nInflows and outflows from Alameda’s main wallet each month were almost equal, Reiter said, indicating that the main purpose for the mints was most likely to facilitate USDT purchases on behalf of FTX and its customers. This is supported by Bankman-Fried’s statements that FTX would transfer funds via bank accounts to Tether, in addition to evidence submitted to his trial which alleged that FTX often relied on Alameda’s bank accounts for exchange purposes.<br />\n<br />\n“These guys were running a one-way USD to USDT bureau de change,” said Reiter, adding that any USDT that Alameda actually held on to was never in large size relative to its minting activity.\n</blockquote>\nThis explains how a significant part of the $190B Tether minted was funded. But it begs the question of where the $104B redeemed went that didn''t go to Alameda? Who were the Tether customers who made the redemptions and what did they do with the dollars?<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7HGis5DNHrBvK6W-LNHaIL-bf6CPvPD-b51Phk0rNOxHClJToM33ZPuQ50dilmVu1s_CMalSxxElS1EaksSb769fd9ThOBKF1BPw_pRpbsqxCrATJejhjIgwaxbf8jVrW73Rw2ykO2ZI3zwlkiQMXhsm2y0hx1hyphenhyphenAFeMnNadmLDM3ceLS3cJCxArLkxbM/s824/WhaleActivity.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="447" data-original-width="824" height="109" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7HGis5DNHrBvK6W-LNHaIL-bf6CPvPD-b51Phk0rNOxHClJToM33ZPuQ50dilmVu1s_CMalSxxElS1EaksSb769fd9ThOBKF1BPw_pRpbsqxCrATJejhjIgwaxbf8jVrW73Rw2ykO2ZI3zwlkiQMXhsm2y0hx1hyphenhyphenAFeMnNadmLDM3ceLS3cJCxArLkxbM/w200-h109/WhaleActivity.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nOn the Chain Argos blog, Patrick Tan''s <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4"><i>A Tale of Tether on TRON Before and After the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</i></a> suggests one answer. Tan notes that:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAlthough most attention is focused on the use of Tether on the Ethereum blockchain, the reality is the bulk of transactions occur on TRON for a simple reason — low or zero transaction fees.<br />\n...<br />\nUsing data from ChainArgos, 50 so-called “whale wallets” for USDT on the TRON blockchain were analyzed in the weeks leading up to, and following, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br />\n<br />\nFrom the chart above, it’s clear that the 50 biggest wallets that transact in Tether on TRON saw a larger cluster of activity just before and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.<br />\n<br />\nNone of the wallets (as far as has been identified) are wallets belonging to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">But</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\none of those wallet addresses:<br />\n<br />\nTCTrwC2rxGFRS74XihgdMkp5mLYGezdrDL<br />\n<br />\n(the “Alameda Wallet”) also happens to be the wallet used by Alameda Research (yes that one) to deposit funds into cryptocurrency exchange FTX.com.<br />\n<br />\nEven as the trial of FTX.com founder Sam Bankman-Fried proceeds in earnest, the Alameda Wallet saw a massive $300 mm in Tether flow into it, occurring just days before the Russian invasion.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">And then</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOf particular note was this wallet address:<br />\n<br />\nTYZseM53iSPB75aN1V5N762GgzAjBp7PcX<br />\n<br />\nwhich sent a whopping $194 mm USDT in just two weeks around the time of the invasion.<br />\n<br />\nAnd a quick Google search of the address reveals Telegram (the messaging service) posts by “The Ghost of New Russia” containing this wallet address that appeared to be raising funds for Russia’s invasion.<br />\n<br />\nOn further analysis, this wallet, and others with large USDT transactions in the run-up to the Russian invasion are part of a massive Russian-Kazakh pyramid scheme that had already been blacklisted by the Russian central bank in 2022.<br />\n<br />\nAfter the USDT is collected into:<br />\n<br />\nTYZseM53iSPB75aN1V5N762GgzAjBp7PcX<br />\n<br />\nit’s then withdrawn into a collection of wallets, but with two in particularly large sizes:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>TXxU8LJ9wwQxUdg1YNP7LPz4YSXB5guhc5</li>\n<li>TCtVdT6XSoWcQifTHbBzFcuaUDX9oo8Yr5</li>\n</ol>\nThen there’s a few withdrawals for less than $2 mm, almost as if someone is taking their “commission” or “fees” for facilitating the transactions.<br />\n<br />\nWhat happens next is relatively predictable, from these withdrawal wallets, the USDT was sent to cryptocurrency exchange Binance, probably for the final cashing out into fiat currency.\n</blockquote>\nThat <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/01/binances-time-in-barrel.html">Binance</a> provided an off-ramp isn''t unexpected. What was unexpected was that the spike in off-ramping started two weeks before the invasion. The Russians maintained good enough operational secrecy that Ukraine was suprised and the troops thought they were on exercise. Knowing two weeks ahead that Ukraine would be invaded means the off-rampers were very close to Putin. Tan speculates that the funds were destined for the <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">Wagner Group</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOne possible explanation is Russia’s heavy use of the Wagner Group — mercenaries closely affiliated with the Kremlin, but disavowed when convenient.<br />\n<br />\nAnd as is known, mercenaries, whether at the Battle of Waterloo or the Donbas, need to be paid, whether in gold, or a hard currency like the dollar, failing which Tether will do.<br />\n<br />\nThis explanation becomes all the more plausible because the shadowy Wagner Group has been operating in the Donbas since 2014.<br />\n<br />\nSo if Russia wanted to wage an all-out invasion of Ukraine, and the Wagner Group needed to recruit mercenaries in a hurry without an audit trail linked to the Kremlin, what better way than using stablecoins such as Tether?<br />\n<br />\nAnd if a Wagner Group mercenary wanted to ensure he’d get paid no matter what, which would he prefer, the ruble against a backdrop of soon-to-be sanctioned Russian banks, or Tether on TRON?<br />\n</blockquote>\nIt is very plausible that the uptick in USDT activity was related to the invasion, but I am more skeptical about the far end of the off-ramp being the Wagner Group. As I understand it, the Russians did not plan an "all-out invasion of Ukraine"; they expected their armored thrusts and airborne landings to swiftly capture Kyiv and its government, which would be replaced by a puppet administration supported by the mass of the Ukrainian population. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group#2022_invasion_of_Ukraine">Wikipedia suggests</a> that Wagner''s initial involvement was limited to two of three attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy.<br />\n<br />\nDoubtless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> and Wagner''s leadership would have known of the invasion plans, probably much more than two weeks ahead, and seen it as prudent to accumulate fiat. But I doubt that this fiat was intended for recruiting additional mercenaries, which wouldn''t have been needed had the invasion plans worked out.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, I agree with Tan when <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">he argues</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nthat’s why it’s so important to monitor stablecoin flows — because they can provide an orthogonal data point that most fund and risk managers may miss.<br />\n<br />\nWhether as an indicator of leverage or risk appetite, or as a precursor to a potentially economically destabilizing conflict, stablecoin flows are becoming an increasingly important metric to monitor.\n</blockquote>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-14 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

Leaving aside the serious safety issues that finally forced the DMV to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/technology/cruise-driverless-san-francisco-suspended.html">stop Cruise operating</a>, their history of interference with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/18/cruise-self-driving-car-in-san-francisco-fire-truck-crash-one-injured.html">first responders</a>, and the <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-cruise-cars-halt-traffic-in-sf-cite-connectivity-issues-linked-to-outside-lands-festival/">traffic congestion</a> they exacerbate, the really devastating part of the article is the economics. Below the fold, I lay out the numbers.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThe reason robotaxis look like a good investment is that the up-front investment in equipping cars with high-tech sensors and powerful computers would earn returns in two ways, by removing the need to pay drivers, and by operating 24/7. In the real world, it isn''t quite that simple.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, the investment is very significant. \nThe NYT team reports on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">Waymo</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/technology/self-driving-cars-wait.html">cars are staggeringly expensive</a>, outfitted with high-tech sensors and cameras, and are worth as much as $200,000.\n</blockquote>\nAnd on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">Cruise</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  Each Chevrolet Bolt that Cruise operates costs $150,000 to $200,000, according to a person familiar with its operations.\n</blockquote>\nSo the upfront investment is around $150K/car. Assuming a 5-year life and 7% interest, the annual cost would be around $32K, or about $90/day. After paying about $12/hr for fuel, insurance, repairs, depreciation and so on an <a href="https://therideshareguy.com/how-much-do-uber-drivers-make/">Uber driver makes $18/hr</a>, or assuming an 8hr day, $144/day. The robotaxi looks like it is about $54/day ahead.<br />\n<br />\nProponents will claim that the robotaxi works 24hrs/day, not just 8. But the demand for rides isn''t constant through the day. The robotaxi fleet needs enough cars to satisfy peak demand, so most will be idle for most of the time, still consuming interest and depreciation. Uber doesn''t pay for the cars, and Uber drivers only work when there is enough demand for rides. I think this is roughly a wash, so the robotaxi stays about $54/day ahead.<br />\n<br />\nSo far I have assumed that the robotaxi fleet needs no humans. But, as the NYT team reports, that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">isn''t the case</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nHalf of Cruise’s 400 cars were in San Francisco when the driverless operations were stopped. Those vehicles were supported by a vast operations staff, with 1.5 workers per vehicle.\n</blockquote>\nWith 1.5 workers at Uber''s pay rate the robotaxi''s staff and equipment is costing $306/day, so the robotaxi is $162/day behind, and Cruise is unlikely to be able to pay only $18/hr. What were the 1.5 people per car <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">actually doing</a>?<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe workers intervened to assist the company’s vehicles every 2.5 to five miles, according to two people familiar with is operations.\n</blockquote>\nLora Kolodny followed up the NYT team''s reporting in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/06/cruise-confirms-robotaxis-rely-on-human-assistance-every-4-to-5-miles.html"><i>Cruise confirms robotaxis rely on human assistance every four to five miles</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nVogt confirmed that the General Motors-owned company does have a remote assistance team, in response to a discussion under the header, "GM''s Cruise alleged to rely on human operators to achieve ''autonomous'' driving."<br />\n<br />\nThe CEO wrote, "Cruise AVs are being remotely assisted (RA) 2-4% of the time on average, in complex urban environments. This is low enough already that there isn''t a huge cost benefit to optimizing much further, especially given how useful it is to have humans review things in certain situations."\n</blockquote>\nClearly, the robotaxi fleet needs some staff. The cars need refueling, say every 200 miles. They need cleaning. Lets guess the average ride is 5 miles and they need cleaning every 10 rides. That would be staff required every 40 miles. So the vast majority of interventions are because Cruise''s self-driving technology just can''t handle San Francisco traffic. They may be called robotaxis, just pay no attention to the driver behind the curtain. These remote drivers will be <i>more expensive</i> than the in-car drivers they are replacing!<br />\n<br />\nOverall, their robotaxi operation is costing GM a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">boatload of money</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nG.M. has spent an average of $588 million a quarter on Cruise over the past year, a 42 percent increase from a year ago.\n</blockquote>\n$2,232B/year for 400 cars is $5.6M per car per year! How could each car <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">earn this much</a>?<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe company charged an average of $10.50 per ride in the city.\n</blockquote>\nTo generate $5.6M each car would have to service 510K rides/year or 1,400 rides/day, or one ride per minute. Cruise''s goal, before they got shut down, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">was less ambitious</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe shutdown complicates Cruise’s ambition of hitting its goal of $1 billion of revenue in 2025.\n</blockquote>\nCovering less than half their costs in 2025 is about 91M rides, or about 250K/day. Lets be generous, and assume 10 rides/day/car. They would need 25K Chevrolet Bolts. Scaling the operation from 400 to 25K in under 2 years would be hard. It would be made harder because <a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2023/11/gm-confirms-2023-chevy-bolt-ev-bolt-euv-production-will-end-in-december/">Bolt production stops next month</a>. But even if the Bolts were available, this would be an additional investment of between $3.7B and $5B in order to lose only $1.2B/year.<br />\n<br />\nI''m not the only one pointing out that the numbers don''t add up. Here, for example, is <a href="https://www.eschatonblog.com/2023/11/imagine-theres-no-people.html">Atrios</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFocusing on the notoriously high margin taxi business has always been odd, in that even if they "work" it''s not entirely clear where the big profit opportunity is! Replacing low wage workers with expensive machines that require a lot of attention from people who have more specialized skills than "driving" doesn''t seem to be such a great plan!<br />\n<br />\nI get the appeal for the carbrained. What "we" all want is a 24 hour driver at an affordable rate. It''s just not quite clear what the business model is, even if the technology works!<br />\n<br />\nPeople always point to niche cases in which robot car would be particularly useful. But they''re niche cases and you need scale to make anything in this industry profitable!   Scale is necessary for a lot of reasons, but one is maintenance and spare parts production. Your self-driving campus vans won''t last long if there''s only one guy who knows to maintain them and the parts manufacturer just went bankrupt.\n</blockquote>\nLast August, Hubert Horan continued his long-running series with <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/08/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirty-three-uber-isnt-really-profitable-yet-but-is-getting-closer-the-antitrust-case-against-uber.html"><i>Part Thirty-Three: Uber Isn’t Really Profitable Yet But is Getting Closer; The Antitrust Case Against Uber</i></a>, which starts:<br />\n<blockquote>\n<b>After $33 Billion in Losses Over 14 Years, Uber is Finally Approaching GAAP Breakeven</b><br />\n<br />\nUber claimed its first ever quarterly GAAP profit when it released its second quarter and first half financial results on August 1. The claim was a bit of stretch as the reported $394 million second quarter profit ($237 million for the first half) was entirely explained by an alleged $386 million second quarter gain ($707 million in the first half) in the value of untradable securities they hold in companies like Didi, Grab, and Aurora that have nothing to do with their ongoing operations. Readers of this series will know that Uber has aggressively used claims like this to justify misleading claims about its corporate financial performance ever since 2018 when it inflated published net income numbers by $5.8 billion just prior to its IPO.\n</blockquote>\nUber has always viewed drivers as a temporary necessity to tide them over until robotaxis take over and boost them into actual instead of manipulated profits. Last month they started offering <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/uber-begins-offering-rides-in-self-driving-waymo-cars.html">robotaxi service in Phoenix</a> using Waymo''s cars. But unless Waymo is showing them radically different numbers than the NYT team found for Cruise, Horan''s series is going to run and run.<br />\n<br />\nThese numbers look even worse for Tesla. Last year Matthew Loh reported that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6"><i>Elon Musk says the difference between Tesla being ''worth a lot of money or worth basically zero'' all comes down to solving self-driving technology</i></a>, and the reason was that owners would rent out their Teslas as robotaxis when they weren''t using them. This was always obviously a stupid idea; who wants drunkards home-bound from the pub throwing up on their Tesla''s seats? But the fact that the numbers don''t add up for robotaxis in general, and the fact that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934691/hertz-tesla-uber-ev-plans-damage-repair-price-cuts"><i>Hertz is scaling back its EV ambitions because its Teslas keep getting damaged</i></a> because half of them are being used by Uber drivers as taxis, make the idea even more laughable.<br />\n<br />\nIt is really surprising that the DMV took so long to shut Cruise down. In August <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">the NYT team wrote</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLast week, a Cruise driverless car collided with a fire truck responding to an emergency. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/us/driverless-car-accident-sf.html">Another Cruise vehicle</a> got stuck in wet concrete. The week before, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-cruise-cars-halt-traffic-in-sf-cite-connectivity-issues-linked-to-outside-lands-festival/">several Cruise cars blocked traffic</a> in the city’s North Beach neighborhood.\n</blockquote>\nMore recently, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/06/cruise-self-driving-cars-children/">Sam Biddle reported that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\npreviously unreported internal materials such as chat logs show Cruise has known internally about two pressing safety issues: Driverless Cruise cars struggled to detect large holes in the road and have so much trouble recognizing children in certain scenarios that they risked hitting them. Yet, until it came under fire this month, Cruise kept its fleet of driverless taxis active, maintaining its <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/human-ridehail-crash-rate-benchmark/">regular reassurances of superhuman safety</a>.\n</blockquote>\nIn contrast, all the NYT team could find to report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">about Waymo was</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn May, one of its <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/waymo_052123-pdf/">cars struck and killed a small dog</a>. A few years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/">a driverless Waymo car with a human safety driver operating the wheel</a> hit a pedestrian who needed to be taken to the hospital. The company has been collecting fares in the Phoenix area for several years and now has a fleet navigating some 200 miles across that region, including to and from the airport.\n</blockquote>\nWhy is Cruise so much less safe? The NYT team <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">write</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCompany insiders are putting the blame for what went wrong on a tech industry culture — led by the 38-year-old Mr. Vogt — that put a priority on the speed of the program over safety. In the competition between Cruise and its top driverless car rival, Waymo, Mr. Vogt wanted to dominate in the same way Uber dominated its smaller ride-hailing competitor, Lyft.<br />\n<br />\n“Kyle is a guy who is willing to take risks, and he is willing to move quickly. He is very Silicon Valley,” said Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. “That both explains the success of Cruise and its mistakes.”\n</blockquote>\nAs someone who has been sharing the roads with Waymo cars for many years, I have always believed that Waymo, unlike Cruise and much worse <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">Tesla</a>, understood that it was necessary to <i>prove</i> that self-driving technology was safe, not just gaslight the public as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">Mr. Vogt did</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTo make streets safer, he said in an interview, cities should embrace self-driving cars like those designed by Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors. They do not get distracted, drowsy or drunk, he said, and being programmed to put safety first meant they could substantially reduce car-related fatalities.\n</blockquote>\nTwo months later Cruise''s safety record got them shut down. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/06/cruise-self-driving-cars-children/">The very same day</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCEO Mary Barra told financial analysts that Cruise “is safer than a human driver and is constantly improving and getting better.”\n</blockquote>\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-09 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#Third_generation_(FD3S)">Mazda RX-7</a> dated November 1993, carrying the California license RX7 DSHR. I bought it new and in the almost 30 years since have driven it for nearly 140K miles. Unusually for an RX-7 this old, it is almost completely stock and has never been on a track.<br />\n<br />\nBelow the fold, I recount an RX-7 saga spanning thirty-eight years and well over a quarter-million miles.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nI moved to California to work at Sun Microsystems in September 1985, so I needed a car. For the first few weeks, Andy Bechtolsheim lent me his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_944">Porsche 944</a>, which was really fun to drive, but too expensive. On an earlier visit to California a friend had driven me on part of Highway One in her first-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#First_generation_(SA22C,_FB)">(FB) RX-7</a>. I''d been impressed by the handling and the smooth power delivery of the rotary engine, so I test drove a second-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#Second_generation_(FC3S_and_FC3C)">(FC) RX-7</a>. It was immediately apparent that this was, in effect, a Porsche 944 at half the price, so I bought one in white with the "Sport" package (rear spoiler, stiffer suspension).<br />\n<br />\nThe car had more performance than I really needed and excellent handling although the stiff suspension meant you really felt the "imperfections" in the road surface. Driving to and from Lake Tahoe in ski season with chains on was a bit of a trial.  The FC served me well as my daily driver for nearly a decade and around 125,000 miles. These included several long road trips up the West Coast. The longest was from the Bay Area to Port Angeles, WA to collect my mother off the ferry from Victoria, BC and drive her back along the coast.<br />\n<br />\nEventually the FC got expensive to maintain and I needed a new car. By then Mazda had introduced the third-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_RX-7#Third_generation_(FD3S)">(FD) RX-7</a>. I test-drove one and it was immediately apparent that it was a huge step up from the FC; it was a Porsche 911 for half the price. Of course, half the price of a 911 was still a lot more than half the price of a 944, so I used a broker to find a base model in white. It was hard to find; I subsequently discovered from Shawn Fanning that it was one of only 13 1994 base models imported. The FD was my daily driver until grandkids arrived; you can''t put a child seat in it and even now the eldest is nearly my size their parents aren''t OK with them riding in it.<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnZ0V3KFPX8Oh65A29SXfIi3wxSalFBqllpvoCkeXodW1Y8MFIUgh6pIHdKLMXTkFKFEt2Gkx0WTlvqF-WLaGUHXefMdciz1g1wAQD4_kGAb5KrcQQ0EhJHlnHapHeSO1H5mh3AnHOuqpd8ivGyX80jXmVoUEM4pPDRmHETJfrq52QsqmiME7gHpGZvBU/s4032/RX-7-gauges.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="150" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAnZ0V3KFPX8Oh65A29SXfIi3wxSalFBqllpvoCkeXodW1Y8MFIUgh6pIHdKLMXTkFKFEt2Gkx0WTlvqF-WLaGUHXefMdciz1g1wAQD4_kGAb5KrcQQ0EhJHlnHapHeSO1H5mh3AnHOuqpd8ivGyX80jXmVoUEM4pPDRmHETJfrq52QsqmiME7gHpGZvBU/w200-h150/RX-7-gauges.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Old school<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>\nSome of the things that make the FD a wonderful driving experience are:<br />\n<ul>\n  <li>The rotary engine, which is turbine-smooth as it races up to the 8,000 RPM red-line.</li>\n  <li>The light weight and stiff chassis.</li>\n  <li>The handling, thanks to its 49/51 weight distribution, wide track, short wheelbase, firm suspension, low polar moment of inertia, and positioning of the center of rotation right where the driver sits.</li>\n  <li>The gear-change which, while not quite as good as that on the MX-5, is crisp, short and in the right place.</li>\n  <li>The driver-focused interior with seats that really hug you, a simple set of classic analog dials, and no distractions — not even cup-holders!</li>\n</ul>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpliLN4kftQSrraPIUq6qLrCjlpmE62cGdFNs3FGxAcrC-bz0-hUWO1uqD74phFyZ_57tNruJx7R1It3KGSG-k_E5QmrNLe13cA7qyc34m_XrMbIP6gRxWTmeWX1hmDT99rW-oXnQ5kbY-lEPWhC5MT-K8onzZqsy7kLcUt2n-WhrMwlQ7IOLL3DXt15m0/s1238/GranTurismoSport.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="695" data-original-width="1238" height="113" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpliLN4kftQSrraPIUq6qLrCjlpmE62cGdFNs3FGxAcrC-bz0-hUWO1uqD74phFyZ_57tNruJx7R1It3KGSG-k_E5QmrNLe13cA7qyc34m_XrMbIP6gRxWTmeWX1hmDT99rW-oXnQ5kbY-lEPWhC5MT-K8onzZqsy7kLcUt2n-WhrMwlQ7IOLL3DXt15m0/w200-h113/GranTurismoSport.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-NgifJO28">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nThese days I fairly often get appreciative waves and comments from other drivers. But my favorite was when, driving home from Mendocino, Vicky &amp; I stopped for a short hike at <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=438">Hendy Woods State Park</a>. A 7-year old boy and his 5-year old brother watched us park, and the elder excitedly announced "that''s a really cool car!". I said "I agree, but how did you know?" He replied "its in my video game." My guess is that it was <i>Gran Turismo</i>, but it could have been any of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-NgifJO28">27 games</a>.<br />\n<br />\nYou can get an impression of the FD from the many reviews on YouTube, for example:<br />\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quLmDySyO7k">Hagerty</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZgOhP_RMSM">Doug DeMuro</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLaPPrXzpO0">The Straight Pipes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRzgp_XFkDs">Everyday Driver</a> (300zx vs. Supra vs. RX-7)</li>\n</ul>\nThe three things every RX-7 review agrees on are that they are unreliable, that you have to watch out for the huge surge of power when the second turbo kicks in, and that the FD is among the best-handling sports cars ever.<br />\n<br />\nThe late, great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Chapman">Colin Chapman CBE</a> famously advised designers to "<a href="https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/genius-colin-chapman-simplify-then-add-lightness%E2%80%9D">simplify, then add lightness</a>".  Some things about the RX-7 are far from simple, such as the dual sequential turbochargers, but Mazda definitely added lightness.  My RX-7 weighs 2789lb (GVWR 3210lb); it was around 1000lb lighter than the competition at the time, such as the Toyota Supra. For comparison, the recent lightened, super-sporty Porsche Carrera T <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/porsche-911-carrera-t-first-drive-simplify-then-add-the-right-options/">weighs 3254lb</a>, 17% more. Of course, the Porsche has a 3.0 liter twin-turbo flat-6 giving it 357HP for 220HP/ton whereas three decades earlier the RX-7 only had a 1.3 liter twin-turbo dual-rotor giving 255HP for 183HP/ton.<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEia8dFl0oFvollXMPBCYQBhTFsdZEDJ_zwxb4kvS5DP4I9B4DkASptD1-8QDjngZQ_MUV1LMPGFUky0oXphX4UpSO62hYF0EfpfL3079ozLnJYRy3sSm-VF5Vl4HvcXRCpVZgfkaq5pka9xGpaP06exC8Hk1e4a_az1CdN7peuxMyf9HInHcJNXmLbRLe7u/s4032/RX-7-jack.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="150" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEia8dFl0oFvollXMPBCYQBhTFsdZEDJ_zwxb4kvS5DP4I9B4DkASptD1-8QDjngZQ_MUV1LMPGFUky0oXphX4UpSO62hYF0EfpfL3079ozLnJYRy3sSm-VF5Vl4HvcXRCpVZgfkaq5pka9xGpaP06exC8Hk1e4a_az1CdN7peuxMyf9HInHcJNXmLbRLe7u/w200-h150/RX-7-jack.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">3lb jack<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<a href="https://worldcat.org/title/34998165"><i>The Mazda RX-7: Mazda''s Legendary Sports Car</i></a>, Jack Yamaguchi and John Dinkel''s incredibly detailed book, recounts how far they went.

It weighs only 3lb. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdKLZtS2QVY">Jason Cammisa explains</a>, an obession with light weight was key to the design of the MX-5 Miata, by far the most successful sports car in history. In three and a half decades the MX-5 has gained only about 100lbs.<br />\n<br />\nAs regards unreliability, well yes, depending on how you treat an RX-7. All that weight-saving and power increase doesn''t come for free, and things under the hood get really hot.  The real reason the RX-7 is still on the road after nearly 140K miles and running well is the wonderful Ivan Koinok, who has taken care of it almost the whole time. The major items he has replaced include:\n<ul>\n  <li>Factory re-manufactured engine (water seals failed at 110K miles)</li>\n  <li>OEM stock turbo (oil leak)</li>\n  <li>OEM stock flywheel and clutch (I cooked it)</li>\n  <li>Competition radiator</li>\n  <li>OEM front struts</li>\n  <li>secondary air injection pump</li>\n  <li>central processing unit</li>\n</ul>\nExcept in stop-and-go traffic, driving the FD is a joy. Fortunately, California is well-equipped with RX-7-friendly roads, including CA1 South from Carmel through Big Sur, and North from Mill Valley to Fort Bragg, CA20 from Fort Bragg to Willits, and CA128 from Cloverdale to the coast.<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTINjbQWoGXcNAJICLUkF1MaYq-JseOIiaTdG6xD_O4oytNlrWm8RbgZGExhqreBVWKpHNSN3s52X8l1dbgFsvDFw1w18hzpUiQPCUeo_nHCTATeN_B90A5AXwUlcMDGKVQsqLD06r7VXbHAN6SSJZeL4ZlApeZESmC2awySAK4_qTGyjXGIJEFQ52lvTA/s4032/BMW-growth.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3024" data-original-width="4032" height="150" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTINjbQWoGXcNAJICLUkF1MaYq-JseOIiaTdG6xD_O4oytNlrWm8RbgZGExhqreBVWKpHNSN3s52X8l1dbgFsvDFw1w18hzpUiQPCUeo_nHCTATeN_B90A5AXwUlcMDGKVQsqLD06r7VXbHAN6SSJZeL4ZlApeZESmC2awySAK4_qTGyjXGIJEFQ52lvTA/w200-h150/BMW-growth.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Expansion of the universe<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>\nPS: Our other car is parent-approved for grandkid transportation.

The problem with this is that, for <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html">economic reasons</a>, the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/10/gini-coefficients-of-cryptocurrencies.html">Gini coefficients of cryptocurrencies</a> are extremely large. It is true that <i>most</i> of the participants have only a small part of the responsibility, but there are always <i>some</i> who have a large share and are thus worth enforcing liability against.<br />\n<br />\nIn <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/10/piercing-veil.html"><i>Piercing The Veil</i></a> I discussed a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8590-22">Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement action</a> in which the bZeroX exchange converted itself into a DAO:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBy transferring control to a DAO, bZeroX’s founders touted to bZeroX community members the operations would be enforcement-proof—allowing the Ooki DAO to violate the CEA and CFTC regulations with impunity, as alleged in the federal court action. The order finds the DAO was an unincorporated association of which Bean and Kistner were actively participating members and liable for the Ooki DAO’s violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations. \n</blockquote>\nBelow the fold I discuss a post in which Matt Levine reports on a more <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-24/big-bonuses-are-back-at-uk-banks">recent lawsuit making the same argument</a>.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nIn <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/list-and-dump-schemes.html"><i>List And Dump Schemes</i></a>, based on Fais Khan''s <a href="https://startupsandecon.substack.com/p/you-dont-own-web3-a-coinbase-curse"><i>"You Don''t Own Web3": A Coinbase Curse and How VCs Sell Crypto to Retail</i></a>, I described how A16Z and other VCs exploited crypto tokens. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-24/big-bonuses-are-back-at-uk-banks">Levine recaps this concisely</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn the crypto boom, VC firms discovered a different way to invest in startups. The startup would be a crypto project, and it would issue tokens, and the VC firm would buy the tokens. The tokens might have some governance rights: The crypto project might be a DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, whose token holders get to vote on what it should do.<br />\n<br />\nThe advantages of this structure, for VCs, were:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Crypto tokens, DAOs, web3, etc. got a lot of hype, so in 2021 you could buy these tokens and resell them for more of a profit than you might get by investing in normal stock in normal startups.</li>\n<li>You could sell <i>faster</i>: Crypto tokens lived, or seemed to live, in a weird regulatory gray area, so you could buy the crypto project’s tokens, say to yourself “ahhh these tokens are not <i>securities</i>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-17/branches-make-bank-runs-harder">they are</a> ‘little more than alphanumeric cryptographic sequences,’” and sell them to retail investors on some crypto exchange. Instead of buying stock and waiting for years for a startup to be successful enough to do an initial public offering, you could buy tokens and flip them quickly while the hype was strong.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\nThen Levine turns to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-24/big-bonuses-are-back-at-uk-banks">liability issue</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBut there is another problem with the token approach, which is that, while these tokens might be functionally stock, and while the SEC thinks ... that they are therefore securities, they are not literally stock, and these crypto DAOs are not literally corporations. Specifically, they are not <i>incorporated</i>. Nobody filed a form with the Delaware secretary of state to incorporate the crypto DAO as a corporation.<br />\n<br />\nThis seems like a small technicality, but one important benefit that you get, from filling out a form and paying a fee to incorporate a corporation, is <i>limited liability</i>. If you have a business entity that is not incorporated, then it is often, by default, a general partnership. Which means that the investors who fund and participate in running it are, arguably, general partners. Shareholders of a corporation are not generally liable for the corporation’s actions, but general partners of a partnership generally <i>are</i>. For instance, they might be liable for its unregistered sales of securities.\n</blockquote>\nThe recent lawsuit is about the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-24/big-bonuses-are-back-at-uk-banks">governance token for Compound</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLate last year, some holders of Compound DAO’s COMP tokens <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r1.jaahEw6Y4/v0">sued the venture capitalists backing Compound</a> for unregistered securities sales. The idea is:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>“Compound is a business that allows users to borrow and lend crypto assets, in much the same way that a traditional bank allows customers to borrow and lend traditional currencies.” ...</li>\n<li>Compound is governed by a DAO, and “Compound DAO is governed by the holders of a security called COMP.”</li>\n<li>Compound issued some COMP tokens to its early investors and founders. It issues others to people who use the Compound smart-contract protocol: If you deposit or borrow on Compound, you can earn COMP tokens ....</li>\n<li>COMP trades publicly on crypto exchanges: If you use Compound and get some tokens, you can sell them for cash, and people do.</li>\n<li>“Nine people control at least 51.56% of the COMP currently issued,” including the co-founders of Compound and venture capital firms including Bain Capital Ventures, Polychain Alchemy, Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm.</li>\n<li>Those people and firms are <i>general partners</i> of Compound, liable for any bad stuff that it does.</li>\n<li>One arguably bad thing that Compound does is list the COMP token on crypto exchanges, where people can buy it.</li>\n<li>The plaintiffs in this case bought some COMP on the exchanges — <i>not</i> from Compound or its venture investors — and are now suing, arguing that this was an unregistered sale of securities and that the <i>venture capitalists are responsible for it</i>.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYK-s9Bc5mzjFszGTgNufwjhD3Y0NFpyKM3n2JXDb8Iy1aFnKl5SKANiAwlueWUSTxiJUzl7JpD8wATeumtqKjEB3hL-g86wn8nvlc-uwunh1sN1LTjE9NhRNX7LSj0ZMsXTkKogwCKaQiPDH0ARabKpWqbL6xIbXpLrx2Pws0Fv50YEYbq4E4R8N8bueR/s975/COMP_All_graph_coinmarketcap.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="396" data-original-width="975" height="81" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYK-s9Bc5mzjFszGTgNufwjhD3Y0NFpyKM3n2JXDb8Iy1aFnKl5SKANiAwlueWUSTxiJUzl7JpD8wATeumtqKjEB3hL-g86wn8nvlc-uwunh1sN1LTjE9NhRNX7LSj0ZMsXTkKogwCKaQiPDH0ARabKpWqbL6xIbXpLrx2Pws0Fv50YEYbq4E4R8N8bueR/w200-h81/COMP_All_graph_coinmarketcap.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nThe reason the plaintiffs are unhappy with the VCs is obvious from the "price" chart.

It wasn''t a typical <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/list-and-dump-schemes.html">list-and-dump scheme</a>, because it actually went up from its launch for about a year before peaking.<br />\n<br />\nSo far, things <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-24/big-bonuses-are-back-at-uk-banks">don''t look good for the VCs</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe VCs moved to dismiss the complaint, and last month a federal judge <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rUwpDCc4_Ni4/v0">denied their request</a>, finding “that there are sufficient allegations against each of the Partner Defendants to allow the Securities Act claim to go forward at this juncture.”\n</blockquote>\nLevine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-24/big-bonuses-are-back-at-uk-banks">eloquently summarizes the problem</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n One thing that crypto enthusiasts and venture capitalists liked to say was that crypto was a new way of organizing human economic behavior, that crypto would enable a new “Web3” in which technology was organized collectively and belonged to its users instead of being owned by big corporations. This could seem pretty cynical, as VC firms often owned big stakes in (the tokens of) these web3 projects.<br />\n<br />\nBut also it was just a big factual mistake! Crypto and DAOs and web3 were not a new way of organizing human economic behavior; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-05-17/blockchain-company-wants-to-reinvent-companies">they were an old way</a>, the general partnership. They were a technological step <i>backward</i>: Ages ago, lawyers and financiers and governments figured out a new way to organize human behavior, the corporation, which allowed people to pool their capital in a new venture in ways that limited their risk and thus encouraged more and safer capital formation.

Below the fold I ask how this could possibly make sense.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThe thing is that, like the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/10/gini-coefficients-of-cryptocurrencies.html">Gini coefficients of cryptocurrency holdings</a>, the "more than 1.8 million tokens" have an incredibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long-tailed distribution</a>. Almost all the 1.8M tokens are completely irrelevant, and are very likely to be scams.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to coinmarketcap.com, the top 10 tokens have a combined "market cap" of about $1.1T, with #10 TRON at $8.2B and a daily volume of $386M. They represent about 88% of the total "market cap". The next 10 have a combined "market cap" of $52B, with #20 Avalanche at $3.7B and a daily volume of $365M. The top 20 represent about 92% of the total.<br />\n<br />\nFor contrast, tokens from 101 to 110 have a combined "market cap" of $2.7B with #110 NEM at $254M and a daily volume of $7M. Past #100 we are deep into shitcoin territory, but there is a long way yet to go.<br />\n<br />\nThe 1000<sup>th</sup> biggest token is currently <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/?page=10">Vesper</a>. Its "market cap" is $3.7M with a daily volume of $67K. This means that there are more than 1.799M tokens with "market caps" less than $3.7M, or that at least 99.9% of all tokens have "market caps" of less than $3.7M, and derisory daily volume.<br />\n<br />\nNearly 0.5% of the way to the 1.8M mark we find things like #8767 XPRO, whose "market cap" is $5K. So it is likely that 99.5% of all tokens have "market caps" of less than $5K. Imagine how easily a token with a "market cap" of less than $5K could be <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/the-invisible-hand-of-market.html">manipulated!</a><br />\n<br />\nAnother way to look at this is to compare "more than 1.8 million tokens" with 4 million, the number of listed companies in the US.

Modern cars have GPS so they know what road they are on, so why did Tesla allow this?</li>\n<li>The driver took his hands off the wheel, and was clearly not paying attention. Tesla''s driver monitoring system is notoriously inadequate. It would only have warned the driver to pay attention half a mile down the road. Why would Tesla think that the driver not paying attention for half a mile was OK?</li>\n<li>Autopilot didn''t brake - if it had braked only 160'' before impact the crash would not have happened. Apparently the fact that its cameras could not reliably detect cross traffic was well-known to Tesla''s engineers, which is why Autopilot was not supposed to be enabled on roads with cross traffic. Why would Tesla think a system unable to detect cross traffic was safe for use on public roads?</li>\n</ul>\nThe <i>Post</i> team <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">explain their methodology</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTo reconstruct the crash, The Post relied on hundreds of court documents, dash cam photos and a video of the crash taken from a nearby farm, as well as satellite imagery, NTSB crash assessment documents and diagrams, and Tesla’s internal data log, which the NTSB included in its investigation report.\n</blockquote>\nThe driver, Jeremy Banner started the accident by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">violating the law</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAt 6:16 a.m., Banner sets cruise control to a maximum of 69 mph, though the speed limit on U.S. 441 is 55. He turns on Autopilot 2.4 seconds later.\n</blockquote>\nIt is typical of Tesla''s disdain for the law that, although their cars have GPS and can therefore know the speed limit, they didn''t bother to program Autopilot to obey the law.<br />\n<br />\nBanner didn''t just violate the law, he also violated Tesla''s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">user documentation</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAccording to Tesla’s user documentation, Autopilot wasn’t designed to work on a highway with cross-traffic such as U.S. 441. But drivers sometimes can activate it in areas and under conditions for which it is not designed.\n</blockquote>\nAgain, Tesla''s disdain for the safety of their customers, not to mention other road users, meant that despite the car knowing which road it was on and thus whether it was a road that Autopilot should not be activated on, it allowed Banner to enable it.<br />\n<br />\nBanner immediately violated the user documentation <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">again</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTwo seconds later, the Tesla’s data log registers no “driver-applied wheel torque,” meaning Banner’s hands cannot be detected on the wheel.\n</blockquote>\nSafety should have required an immediate warning and for Autopilot to start braking the car. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">But no</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIf Autopilot does not detect a driver’s hands, it flashes a warning. In this case, given Banner’s speed, the warning would have come after about 25 seconds, according to the NTSB investigation.<br />\n<br />\nBanner does not have that long.\n</blockquote>\n25 seconds at 69 mph is 2,530 feet or 0.48 miles. Although Tesla admits that Autopilot is a Level 2 driver assistance system which requires the driver''s full attention at all times, they think it is OK for the car to drive itself for half a mile at 69mph before the driver needs to start paying attention. Of course, there would be an additional delay after the warning as the driver recovered situational awareness.<br />\n<br />\nCombined with Tesla''s pathetic "wheel torque" system for detecting whether the driver is paying attention, a 25-second delay is obviously why their cars keep running into first responders, highway dividers and other obstacles up to half a mile away from where the driver zoned out.<br />\n<br />\nBut from Tesla''s point of view, actually enforcing the rule that the driver have their hands on the wheel and be paying attention would involve "nagging" the driver. And this would make it clear even to the fan-bois that the technology was nothing like the fantasy of Tesla''s marketing.

The <i>Post</i> team have a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">suggestion</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBanner researched Tesla for years before buying a Model 3 in 2018, his wife, Kim, told federal investigators. Around the time of his purchase, Tesla’s website featured a video showing a Tesla navigating the curvy roads and intersections of California while a driver sits in the front seat, hands hovering beneath the wheel.<br />\n<br />\nThe video, recorded in 2016, is still on the site today.<br />\n<br />\n“The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons,” the video says. “He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”\n</blockquote>\nThis video is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">notorious fake</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n a Tesla engineer testified that a team specifically mapped the route the car would take in the video. At one point during testing for the video, a test car crashed into a fence, according to Reuters. The engineer said in a deposition that the video was meant to show what the technology could eventually be capable of — not what cars on the road could do at the time.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the video concerned Full Self-Driving, which operates on surface streets, the plaintiffs in the Banner case argue Tesla’s “marketing does not always distinguish between these systems.”\n</blockquote>\nThere is a massive disconnect between what Musk and Tesla''s marketing says about their driver assistance technologies and what they tell <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">regulators and juries</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn a Riverside, Calif., courtroom last month in a lawsuit involving another fatal crash where Autopilot was allegedly involved, a Tesla attorney held a mock steering wheel before the jury and emphasized that the driver must always be in control.<br />\n<br />\nAutopilot “is basically just fancy cruise control,” he said.<br />\n<br />\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has painted a different reality, arguing that his technology is making the roads safer: “It’s probably better than a person right now,” Musk said of Autopilot during a 2016 conference call with reporters.<br />\n<br /> \nMusk made a similar assertion about a more sophisticated form of Autopilot called Full Self-Driving on an earnings call in July. “Now, I know I’m the boy who cried FSD,” he said. “But man, I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year.”\n</blockquote>\nFor the past <i>seven years</i> Musk has been claiming <a href="https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">"better than human"</a> about a system that only works in limited situations and always <i>requires a human to be ready to take over at a moment''s notice</i>. Who are you going to believe, the richest man in the world or the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">fine print in the user documentation?</a><br />\n<blockquote>\nPhilip Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon who has studied self-driving-car safety for more than 25 years, said the onus is on the driver to understand the limitations of the technology. But, he said, drivers can get lulled into thinking the technology works better than it does.<br />\n<br />\n“If a system turns on, then at least some users will conclude it must be intended to work there,” Koopman said. “Because they think if it wasn’t intended to work there, it wouldn’t turn on.”\n</blockquote>\nBecause, after all, the system claims to be "better than human". Except in court, Tesla cannot tell the truth about their Level 2 driver assistance technologies because to do so would decimate their stock price.<br />\n<br />\nIt should be obvious that this technology needs <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">regulation</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe NTSB said it has repeatedly issued recommendations aiming to prevent crashes associated with systems such as Autopilot. “NTSB’s investigations support the need for federal oversight of system safeguards, foreseeable misuse, and driver monitoring associated with partial automated driving systems,” NTSB spokesperson Sarah Sulick said in a statement.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">But</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFour years later, despite pleas from safety investigators, regulators in Washington have outlined no clear plan to address those shortcomings, allowing the Autopilot experiment to continue to play out on American roads, with little federal intervention.\n</blockquote>\nAs I''ve been pointing out for years, Musk is running a human-subject experiment with Autopilot and FSD that has not just potentially but actually lethal outcomes. It isn''t even a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">well-designed experiment</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nNot only is the marketing misleading, plaintiffs in several cases argue, the company gives drivers a long leash when deciding when and how to use the technology. Though Autopilot is supposed to be enabled in limited situations, it sometimes works on roads it’s not designed for. It also allows drivers to go short periods without touching the wheel and to set cruising speeds well above posted speed limits.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, Autopilot was not designed to operate on roads with cross-traffic, Tesla lawyers say in court documents for the Banner case. The system struggles to identify obstacles in its path, especially at high speeds. The stretch of U.S. 441 where Banner crashed was “clearly outside” the environment Autopilot was designed for, the NTSB said in its report. Still, Banner was able to activate it.\n</blockquote>\nThe bigger problem is that there is no way for most of the subjects to provide informed consent for this experiment. As one of the involuntary subjects, if asked I would have refused consent. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">Steven Cliff, a former NHTSA administrator understands</a>:<br /> \n<blockquote>\n“Tesla has decided to take these much greater risks with the technology because they have this sense that it’s like, ‘Well, you can figure it out. You can determine for yourself what’s safe’ — without recognizing that other road users don’t have that same choice,” ...<br />\n<br />\n“If you’re a pedestrian, [if] you’re another vehicle on the road,” he added, “do you know that you’re unwittingly an object of an experiment that’s happening?”\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyULlf5HioGlYs8PylfKuvPm4SGprYOUnmaii8yLisNqlFw1vB7Us5QyZBK0QR-DVvbEi7wekAJqEEMu5S4kag5qSlf2nI4YLKF0UufjRdwFFZsnk17DbBm0K3ID_8dPjEz68OjAXMYY7fgZ-BnSYYid6d0zgoV1nD8etx3Vl7pYsdq2DysfsrBpnWaDjf/s800/CulverCityCrash.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="800" height="150" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyULlf5HioGlYs8PylfKuvPm4SGprYOUnmaii8yLisNqlFw1vB7Us5QyZBK0QR-DVvbEi7wekAJqEEMu5S4kag5qSlf2nI4YLKF0UufjRdwFFZsnk17DbBm0K3ID_8dPjEz68OjAXMYY7fgZ-BnSYYid6d0zgoV1nD8etx3Vl7pYsdq2DysfsrBpnWaDjf/w200-h150/CulverCityCrash.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/us-investigates-autopilot-after-11-teslas-crashed-into-emergency-vehicles/">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nIt might be arguable that experimental subjects like Banner <i>did</i> provide informed consent, although I would point out that he was misinformed by Musk and Tesla''s marketing.

So it was inevitable that someone would exploit this opportunity to manipulate the market and liquidate the shorts. And boy, did they ever! Vildana Hajric''s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-16/bitcoin-surges-above-30-000-on-etf-approval-speculation"><i>Bitcoin Whipsawed by False Report Claiming SEC Approval of ETF</i></a> explains how they did it:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAfter months of declining volatility, Bitcoin traders experienced some of the wildest price swings they’ve seen in a while when a false report circulated saying that the US had approved a long-awaited exchange-traded fund.<br />\n<br />\nThe largest digital asset jump more than 10% to $30,000 around 9:30 a.m. in New York, only to cut the gain by more than half a few minutes later after BlackRock said that its application for an ETF that invests directly in the cryptocurrency is still under review. The intraday move was the largest since March.<br />\n  <br />\n  Data from tracker Coinglass shows that more than $80 million worth of trading positions — mostly from traders who were betting on lower prices — were liquidated during the spate of volatility.\n</blockquote>\nHajric is careful not to suggest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-16/bitcoin-surges-above-30-000-on-etf-approval-speculation">anyone planted the rumor</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  The episode suggests that there remains a lot of excitement and hope for a spot-Bitcoin product in the US, which regulators have in the past refused to allow. The US Securities and Exchange Commission previously cited market manipulation, among other reasons, for not granting an endorsement. However, the incident also serves as a reminder that Bitcoin’s price can easily be moved by gossip or hearsay.\n</blockquote>\nSo the SEC was right that there is a "risk of manipulation", but no-one actually did a manipulation? How seriously market participants take their responsibilities for investor protection in the unregulated market was illustrated by Hajric''s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-16/bitcoin-surges-above-30-000-on-etf-approval-speculation">closing quote</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  “That was a good 30 minutes of fun and games,” Teong Hng, chief executive officer of crypto investment firm Satori Research, said of Monday’s roundabout.\n</blockquote>\nMatt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-16/cds-bet-bites-carl-icahn">gets it</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nI am not <i>that</i> sympathetic to the SEC’s objections to a spot Bitcoin ETF. But this story makes me a little more sympathetic? The price of Bitcoin jumped by 10% because people on social media were saying, falsely, that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF was approved. Seems like the sort of thing that could be manipulated!<br />\n<br />\nObviously the Chicago Mercantile Exchange front-month Bitcoin futures also briefly jumped above $30,000 today. If you want to move the price of Bitcoin futures with gossip and hearsay, that is pretty much exactly as easy as moving the price of spot Bitcoin with gossip and hearsay, because they are kind of the same price.\n</blockquote>\nExactly. The Bitcoin futures market may be regulated, but the price is based on an unregulated market which is notoriously manipulated. Planting the rumor on social media with the news that all the crypto-bros were expecting would goose the price was (a) free and trivially easy to do, and (b) trivially easy to predict. And it worked like an $80M charm! Why anyone takes the "price" of Bitcoin seriously is a mystery.<br />\n<br />\nIn another section of the same piece, Levine provides another example of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-16/cds-bet-bites-carl-icahn">insanity of the cryptocurrency market</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCrypto banking is purely financial, a levered bet <i>on the size of the crypto market</i>. There are crypto firms, quasi-banks, that hold people’s cryptocurrency for them and pay them interest, and they use that crypto to invest in more crypto. They lend out crypto to hedge funds that want to make levered bets on crypto, and as long as crypto prices generally go up those hedge funds will make enough money to pay back the loans with interest and get rich themselves. But <i>nothing productive is happening</i> with these money flows; people are buying tokens but not doing any activity that makes anyone better off in the real world. Crypto prices go up because people speculate on crypto, so there is more money in crypto, so it is easier to borrow more money to make more levered bets on crypto, so prices keep going up, etc., until a slight breeze blows it all over and there’s nothing left.\n</blockquote>\nSome people would claim that staking is a productive investment, earning rewards for validating transactions. Of course, this only happens in Ethereum and other Proof-of-Stake systems, not in Bitcoin. But both for staking and for mining, the real question is where the rewards are coming from? They are coming from increasing the number of coins or, in other words, <i>inflating the currency</i>. Even if you are lending coins to a staking pool, you aren''t actually doing anything that earns real money in the real economy, you are just benefiting from the inflation of your currency.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-10-19 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and <b>appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception</b>. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value.[9] And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, <b>the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure</b>, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required.\n</blockquote>\nFollow me below the fold for both the evidence that Hinman was talking though his hat, and also yet another update on the theme of my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html"><i>Brief Remarks to IOSCO DeFi WG</i></a>, that successful systems claiming to be decentralized, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, aren''t.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nHinman''s speech was, as we shall see, ill-informed to say the least. The consequence of his abdication of responsibility was to provide an opening for the much smaller and much less powerful CFTC, which already approved trading in futures contracts on the notoriously manipulated cryptocurrency spot markets. Grabbing the chance to expand her agency''s mandate, CFTC chair Rostin Banham later asserted that "<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/29/bitcoin-could-double-in-price-under-cftc-regulation-chairman-behnam-says/">Bitcoin might double in price if there’s a CFTC-regulated market</a>”.

In a later post, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/12/blockchain-whats-not-to-like.html"><i>Blockchain: What''s Not To Like?</i></a>, I included a pie chart showing that on 10<sup>th</sup> October that year three mining pools controlled the Ethereum blockchain.<br />\n<br />\nNot that in 2018 the centralization of these blockchains was news or hard to understand. That successful permissionless peer-to-peer systems inevitably centralize is a consequence of two observations, one from computer science and one from economics:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The security of these systems depends upon defending against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil attacks</a> by making participation more expensive than the reward from an attack. This had been well-known in computer science since well before the attack was named in 2002.</li>\n<li>Technologies in general, and these systems in particular, have very strong economies of scale. This had been well-known in economics since well before W. Brian Arthur''s 1994 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a></li>\n</ol>\nThus participation in these systems will have strong economies of scale, which will drive oligopoly, in other words centralization. I first detailed the process on 7<sup>th</sup> October 2014 in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a>. It wasn''t a prophesy; four months earlier Dan Goodin''s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/06/bitcoin-security-guarantee-shattered-by-anonymous-miner-with-51-network-power/"><i>Bitcoin security guarantee shattered by anonymous miner with 51% network power</i></a> reported that:<br />\n<blockquote>\non June 12, GHash produced a majority of the power for 12 hours straight,<br />\n...<br />\nGHash''s ascendency to a majority miner comes even as its operators <a href="https://ghash.io/ghashio_press_release.pdf">pledged never to cross the 51-percent threshold</a>. It also comes less than a year after GHash was accused of <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327767.0">using its considerable hashing power to attack a gambling site</a>. \n</blockquote>\nThus <i>four years and two days</i> before Hinman spoke, the centralization of the Bitcoin blockchain had become obvious even to the crypto-bros. The fact that the Ethereum blockchain had, by the time Hinman spoke, suffered at least as much centralization as Bitcoin''s was by then equally well-known. Indeed, 17 months before Hinman spoke, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum stressed the fragility of decentralization in <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274"><i>The Meaning of Decentralization</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists of many small actors that make decisions independently.\n</blockquote>\nand pointed out the <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">lack of it in practice</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\ncan we really say that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at the same conference?\n</blockquote>\nSaying that Hinman was ill-informed about the technology he was refusing to regulate is an understatement.<br />\n<br />\nWhy am I bringing up this history now, more than 5 years later? To point out that there has been no progress on resolving either the regulatory or the centralization problems.<br />\n<br />\nNine-digit political contributions and lobbying from Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame failed to get regulatory authority assigned to the CFTC before the collapse of FTX made the idea radioactive. The SEC''s enforcement actions have steered clear of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and now face <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-03/terra-is-usually-a-security">incompatible rulings</a> from Judge Analisa Torres in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/sec-bid-for-quick-appeal-of-crypto-ruling-is-denied-by-judge?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">Ripple case</a> versus Judge Jed Rakoff in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/ripple-ruling-on-crypto-rejected-by-federal-judge-in-terra-case?sref=1kJVNqnU">Terra case</a>.<br />\n<br />\nBut the proximate cause of this post was Olga Kharif''s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out"><i>Ethereum Is Becoming More Concentrated After a Key Infrastructure Provider Dropped Out</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOn Sept. 27, blockchain infrastructure provider Blocknative said it will stop operating as a so-called relay, a key participant in adding blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. Its exit leaves only four other major relay players to handle most Ethereum blocks and raises concern of potential problems, ranging from the censorship of transactions to stealing of other key operators’ profits.<br />\n<br />\nThe relay issue comes as Ethereum already faces concentration concerns in other parts of its operations. The network is run jointly by relays as well as parties called builders, which compile most transactions into blocks, and validators, which order blocks into a blockchain. Both builder and validator functions are dominated by a handful of participants. The relay decline is especially worrisome.<br />\n...<br />\nThe situation goes against the decentralized ethos of crypto, which was born in the fallout of the Global Financial Crisis as a reaction against powers that be: corporate and government control.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out">Kharif notes that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  The builder category is highly centralized, also. While a year ago one builder — Flashbots — controlled the market, nowadays four builders, including one run by crypto market maker Wintermute, account for the majority of blocks built, according to Relayscan.io.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out">And</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  To add to the problems, a pool called Lido currently controls 32.3% of total validator power. A validator controlling 34% could potentially falsify transactions.\n</blockquote>\nIt is worth repeating that, just like Bitcoin''s, Ethereum''s blockchain has never been really decentralized. Even more "against the decentralized ethos of crypto" is the fact that, as <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">Moxie Marlinspike documented</a>, most "smart contracts" on Ethereum use one of two services, Infura and Alchemy. On the 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019 <i>The Block</i> published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190114224145/https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/01/10/the-burden-of-infura/"><i>The Burden of Infura</i></a>, which started:<br />\n<blockquote>\nInfura (hosted on AWS) is positioned as a potential single central point of failure for a significant portion of the Ethereum network in its current form, as its infrastructure dependence is widely pervasive within the dapp ecosystem\n</blockquote>\nEthereum''s switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake clearly hasn''t reduced centralization, because the fundamental problem isn''t technical, it is economic. \n<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-30/ethereum-eth-concentration-grows-after-key-relay-provider-drops-out">Kharif writes</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCurrently, relays have little financial incentives to act, and many are simply there because they want to support the network or have side businesses that can benefit from offering the function. It costs $500,000 to $1 million a year to operate a relay, Klarman said, and relays don’t get paid. While several ways to compensate relays have been considered in the past year — since Ethereum moved to its new proof-of-stake system of ordering transactions that uses relays, builders and validators — none has taken off.\n</blockquote>\nI have often complimented the Ethereum team''s technical and operational skills; the Merge was an extraordinary success along both axes. But their devotion to Austrian economics means that they aren''t good at designing economic systems. Here, for example, they designed a clever piece of technical infrastructure that needed many instances if the system were to be "sufficiently decentralized". Running an instance cost "$500,000 to $1 million a year", so there were never going to be that many of them, and the designers forgot to provide the few instances that there were with any, let alone a viable, business model. It is really amazing that, after 8 years running a system in which economics forced centralization of its infrastructure, Ethereum failed to address the economic problems of its infrastructure.<br />\n<br />\nThe failure is actually quite understandable because the problem is fundamental. As I wrote in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/03/more-cryptocurrency-gaslighting.html"><i>More Cryptocurrency Gaslighting</i></a> what investors need is an investment:<br />\n<blockquote>\nProof-of-Stake has the same fundamental problem of gambling vs. investment. As I write 17.6M ETH have been staked. With a block time of 12s, each ETH can expect a reward on average once in 6.7 years (gambling). So the "nodes" in the Ethereum network are not individuals running their own validators, but staking services such as Lido, and exchanges staking their customers'' coins such as Coinbase and Kraken. Each of these nodes stakes millions of ETH (investment).\n</blockquote>\nIt seems the crypto-bros don''t need decentralization and trustlessness in practice, they only need it in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3326244">Prof Angela Walch''s words</a> as "a veil that covers over and prevents many from seeing the actions of key actors within the system".','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-10-10 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

Last March, Chainalysis posted <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/oracle-manipulation-attacks-rising/"><i>Oracle manipulation attacks rising: a unique concern for DeFi</i></a> in which they wrote:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOverall, we estimate that in 2022, DeFi protocols lost $403.2 million in 41 separate oracle manipulation attacks.\n</blockquote>\nWhat are oracles and how can manipulating them earn an average of $1.1M/day? Below the fold I attempt an explanation.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\n<h3>What Are Oracles?</h3>\nOnce Ethereum made it possible to store programs on a blockchain and execute them, the question of the sources for these  programs'' inputs arose. After all, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in%2C_garbage_out">Garbage in, garbage out</a>" has been a computer science mantra since at least 1957. These programs have access to data on the blockchain, which is assumed to be the ultimate repository of truth, but for all other data they must rely on APIs provided by external services. These services are called "oracles" because, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle">ancient Greek oracles</a>, they provide "wise and insightful counsel".<br />\n<br />\nThese oracular services are typically, like the Greek ones, opaque and centralized. Their pronouncements have to be taken on trust, violating on of the claimed core principles of cryptocurrencies (albeit one more honored in the breach than the observance). This isn''t a bug, it is a feature. In <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1117.pdf"><i>An impossibility theorem on truth-telling in fully decentralized systems</i></a>, Rodney Garratt and Cyril Monnet of the Bank for International Settlements show that:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWe show that truthful reporting about the realization of a publicly observed event cannot be implemented as a unique equilibrium in a completely decentralized environment. Our work provides a theoretical underpinning of the need for oracles and the related “oracle problem".\n</blockquote>\nThis is a fundamental problem for the utopian fully decentralized systems.<br />\n<h3>How Are Oracles Used?</h3>\nThe primary use of oracles is to provide "smart contracts" with price information to drive their trading strategies.  In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805499"><i>TWAP Oracle Attacks: Easier Done than Said?</i></a> Torgin Mackinga <i>et al</i> describe this mechanism:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLending protocols and exchanges enable each other in a bi-directional relationship, with exchanges informing lending protocols about exchange rates and lending protocols providing liquidity to exchanges. The former relationship is often called an oracle, where the exchange acts as an oracle and provides market data to the lending protocol. Lending protocols crucially depend on oracles for their price feeds,\n</blockquote>\nLending protocols are the heart of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805499">Mackinga <i>et al</i> explain</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLending protocols are smart contracts that allow borrowers to borrow funds at an interest rate. The borrowed assets come from a pool of assets that creditors have deposited as their investments. If this pool suffers a loss due to a bad debt, the loss is distributed among these creditors. If the borrower pays back the debt on time, the interest is divided among the creditors who contributed to the pool from which the loan was made from. Due to the inability of these protocols to take action against loan defaulters (borrowers are just public keys on a blockchain), they use over-collateralization to keep the protocols liquid.\n</blockquote>\nHow do these lending protocols work? Suppose Alice has some FOO coins each "worth" V<sub>FOO</sub> in USDT upon which she wants to earn interest, so she deposits N<sub>FOO</sub> into the lending protocol''s "smart contract". Now Bob has some BAR coins each "worth" V<sub>BAR</sub> in USDT but sees a profit opportunity in FOO that will take time to mature, so cannot be achieved with a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/06/flash-loans.html">flash loan</a>. He deposits M<sub>BAR</sub> into the lending protocol''s "smart contract" and withdraws N<sub>FOO</sub>. The lending protocol sets a collateralization ratio C&gt;1 such that, during the term of the loan:<br />\n<blockquote>\nN<sub>FOO</sub>•V<sub>FOO</sub> &lt; C•M<sub>BAR</sub>•V<sub>BAR</sub>\n</blockquote>\nI.e. Bob''s BAR collateral is "worth" C times the FOO loan. If, during the loan, Bob is right and FOO appreciates against BAR he will be required to deposit additional BAR to ensure the inequality remains satisfied.<br />\n<br />\nShould Bob fail to do so, a liquidator Charles may step in. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805499">Mackinga <i>et al</i> explain</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBefore a loan gets fully undercollateralized (C &lt; 1) it can go through a period of “bad health”, where its C has fallen from the time when the loan was made and is now too close to 1 (with some tolerance). To avoid the risk of going fully undercollateralized, the protocol offers liquidators a chance to pay back the loan at a discount, and redeem the remaining collateral for themselves. This makes the protocol whole again, the liquidator gets collateral for a slightly cheaper price, and the borrower is liquidated.  The borrower is thus motivated to “top-up” the collateral to make sure that the loan never becomes unhealthy.\n</blockquote>\nIn other words, Charles pays a bit less than N<sub>FOO</sub>•V<sub>FOO</sub> and gets Bob''s M<sub>BAR</sub> "worth" more.<br />\n<br />\nNote how this protocol depends upon real-time knowledge of V<sub>FOO</sub> and V<sub>BAR</sub>, the "prices" at which FOO and BAR are trading on exchanges. This information is accessible to "smart contracts" only via oracles. They might, for example, report the Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) for each coin across a number of exchanges. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805499">Mackinga <i>et al</i> describe two kinds of oracle</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThese assets are traded on many centralized exchanges which operate in the real world, outside of the blockchain. Through trusted third parties, it is possible to get these exchange rates into the lending protocol. These trusted third parties are also called off-chain oracles. They are dependent on a trusted third party, so they are not fully on-chain. Their operation is not fully governed by a smart contract that can be audited by users and about which users can have assurances of immutability. Lending protocols, which are themselves deployed as auditable smart contracts on-chain, could prefer on-chain oracles, which are deployed as smart contracts, but can still report market-based exchange rates of assets. Automated market makers (AMMs), a type of exchange, serve as a natural on-chain price oracle. They support trades between many pairs of assets and can report the relative exchange rates between asset pairs through state variables available on-chain.\n</blockquote>\nAn example AMM is Uniswap V2, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805499">works like this</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nConstant Function AMMs are a type of decentralized exchange that uses a well-known, simple formula to trade one asset for another. An AMM trading pair is a liquidity pool containing reserves RA, RB of two different assets A and B. If the AMM is using the constant product model, the reserves have a constant product RA · RB = K. There is a percentage fee (1 − γ) that is collected for every trade. When a user sells b units of B, they get a units of A such that the constant-product function (RB + γ · b)(RA − a) = K is preserved. The spot price of asset A is given by RA/RB, the spot price of asset B is RB/RA.\n</blockquote>\nThe spot price on the AMM is maintained by arbitrageurs comparing it with the price on centralized exchanges and other AMMs, buying in the cheaper and selling in the more expensive market. This imports the off-chain price into the blockchain. Note that although the AMM operates on-chain, the prices it reports are not the result of decentralized consensus and depend upon trust in arbitrageurs who in turn depend upon trusting price data feeds from centralized off-chain exchanges. AMMs provide the appearance of trustlessness but not the reality.<br />\n<h3>How Can Oracles Be Manipulated?</h3>\nFor example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805499">Mackinga <i>et al</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nanalyze the cost of manipulating on-chain time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles that use the arithmetic mean.\n</blockquote>\nThey show multiple attacks that profit using transactions large relative to the size of the AMM''s pools to move the price it reports for the target trading pair. The capital for these transactions is assumed to be available from more liquid off-chain exchanges. Both a single-block attack, and a two-block <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/miners-extractable-value.html">MEV</a>-style attack via collusion with a miner are possible. These attacks are of two kinds:<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Under-collateralized loan attack</b>. By increasing the price of coin A by buying it using coin B on the AMM the lending protocol uses as an oracle, the attacker is able to borrow from the lending protocol coin B worth more than the coin A collateral, sell it and not repay the loan. The profit is the difference between the value of the borrowed coin B and the sacrificed collateral coin A.</li>\n<li><b>Liquidation attack</b>. The attacker detects a loan of coin A close to liquidation and decreases the price of its collateral coin B by selling it for coin A on the AMM the lending protocol uses as an oracle, forcing the loan to be liquidated thus obtaining the collateral coin B for less than its market price.</li>\n</ul>\nA recent under-collateralized loan attack netted <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/06/code-isnt-law-analogy.html">Avraham Eisenberg</a> around $117M. <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/oracle-manipulation-attacks-rising/">Chainalysis describes the attack</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Eisenberg started with $10 million USDC (it’s possible he also used funds not attributable to him on-chain to manipulate asset prices on other exchanges), split across two separate accounts at Mango Markets.</li>\n<li>Eisenberg used one account to short 488 million MNGO (MNGO, or Mango, is the governance token for Mango Markets) — effectively selling 488 million MNGO on leverage — while the other account took the opposite side of that trade, using leverage to buy the same amount.</li>\n<li>Eisenberg’s leveraged purchase of MNGO, combined with further buying of MNGO on other DEXes, pushed the price of MNGO up very quickly on spot exchanges. This was possible because MNGO was a low-liquidity asset without much trading volume. The account used to purchase MNGO immediately profited roughly $400 million in paper gains because all of Eisenberg’s buying activity significantly boosted the asset’s price.</li>\n<li>With such a high portfolio value, Eisenberg was able to borrow against his artificially inflated MNGO holdings and remove virtually all of the assets held by Mango Markets. This activity caused MNGO’s price to drop immediately, so his long positions were liquidated due to loss of collateral value, but it was too late — Eisenberg had already “borrowed” all of Mango Market’s assets with any real value.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\nEissenberg pulled off a major heist, but most of the oracle manipulation attacks are far smaller, especially since the smaller and less liquid the coin, the easier it is to mount one.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Can Oracle Manipulation Be Prevented?</h3>\nBased on Rodney Garratt and Cyril Monnet''s <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1117.pdf"><i>An impossibility theorem on truth-telling in fully decentralized systems</i></a>, Chanelle Duley <i>et al</i>''s <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull76.pdf"><i>The oracle problem and the future of DeFi</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nexamines the “oracle problem” in DeFi and highlights the challenges of resolving it by laying out the trade-off between trust and efficiency in decentralised platforms. When this trade-off is understood, the future of DeFi in its purest sense looks bleak. Progress can be made by departing from decentralisation and by importing trusted actors into the crypto DeFi ecosystem. However, trust is a notion that is explicitly rejected in crypto. In any case, trust is not something that can be easily bolted onto an otherwise trustless system. Trust in finance is foundational ... As a result, the pure form of crypto-based DeFi is likely to remain the preserve of cryptoassets only.\n</blockquote>\nThey <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull76.pdf">write</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe obvious solution of increased regulation and supervision runs counter to the decentralisation ethos underpinning crypto DeFi. For this and related reasons, there is little clarity on legal recourse if a smart contract were triggered by false information ..., especially in jurisdictions where crypto activities are not regulated or forbidden.\n</blockquote>\nThey pose an "<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull76.pdf">intriguing question</a>":<br />\n<blockquote>\nwhether it would be technically feasible to design oracles that could themselves be fully decentralised. If so, this would eliminate the problems introduced with centralised external oracles. Yet implementing fully decentralised oracles that can incorporate real-world information presents severe challenges. Indeed, some argue that such decentralisation is not only practically difficult, but logically impossible, because it faces the inherent challenge of ensuring truthful reporting in the absence of a single authoritative source (<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1117.pdf">Garratt and Monnet (2023)</a>). However, even if decentralising oracles may be logically coherent, there is no doubt that efforts to reduce the need for trust in the reporting of real-world information through consensus mechanisms can be very costly, affecting financial resources, operational efficiency and consumer protection.\n</blockquote>\nThe current situation in DeFi is that the rhetoric stresses decentralization and trustlessness, but the reality is that at some levels in the stack centralized systems are trusted. The result is losses from oracle manipulation averaging $1.1M/day, not to mention a plethora of other attacks..\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-10-05 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

People such as David Chaum published extensively in journals such as Springer''s <i>Advances in Cryptology</i>. Staff at the US National Security Agency (NSA) were naturally interested in developments in cryptography, so on 18<sup>th</sup> June 1996 the NSA''s Laurie Law, Susan Sabett and Jerry Solinas reviewed the academic literature on electronic cash and published <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm"><i>HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH </i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n This report has surveyed the academic literature for cryptographic techniques for implementing secure electronic cash systems. Several innovative payment schemes providing user anonymity and payment untraceability have been found. Although no particular payment system has been thoroughly analyzed, the cryptography itself appears to be sound and to deliver the promised anonymity.<br />\n<br />\nThese schemes are far less satisfactory, however, from a law enforcement point of view. In particular, the dangers of money laundering and counterfeiting are potentially far more serious than with paper cash. These problems exist in any electronic payment system, but they are made much worse by the presence of anonymity. \n</blockquote>\nAlas, this understandable effort by NSA staff has become the keystone in a bizarre theory that Satoshi Nakamoto is an alias for the NSA, who developed Bitcoin in secrecy as a "monetary bioweapon" a decade before it somehow leaked and infected the world.<br />\n<br />\nI must apologize that, below the fold, I devote an entire post to this conspiracy theory.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nOn 14<sup>th</sup> September Daniel Roberts <a href="https://twitter.com/danroberts0101/status/1702440110002729356">tweeted</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe NSA invented Bitcoin?<br />\n<br />\n1996 paper titled: HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH*<br />\n<br />\nSources include "Tatsuaki Okamoto" 😳<br />\n<br />\nWho else would be able to sit anonymously on 1 million coins.<br />\n<br />\nOh, and they invented SHA-256...?\n</blockquote>\nand linked to the Law <i>et al</i> paper.  A week later prominent Bitcoin-bro <a href="https://niccarter.info/about/">Nic Carter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1704922555189182784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">responded</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nI actually do believe this. I call it the bitcoin lab leak hypothesis. I think it was a shuttered internal R&amp;D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release\n</blockquote>\nThe next day Martin Young at <i>Cointelegraph</i> posted <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nic-carter-supports-bitcoin-invented-by-nsa-conspiracy-theory"><i> Nic Carter doubles down on theory Bitcoin was invented by NSA</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBitcoin advocate Nic Carter has come out to reiterate his support for the theory that the United States National Security Agency (NSA) had something to do with the creation of Bitcoin<br />\n...<br />\nThe paper is one of the first known discussions of a Bitcoin-like system, which proposes using public-key cryptography to allow users to make anonymous payments without revealing their identity.<br />\n...<br />\nCarter has actually held the theory for several years, <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1260733240270368768">proposing</a> back in 2020: “If Bitcoin was written by NSA cryptographers as a monetary bioweapon, if you will, and the code escaped those sensitive confines... does that make it a virus... that escaped from a lab?”\n</blockquote>\nNote how Young asserts that a paper that <i>surveyed the academic literature</i> was somehow <i>one of the first known discussions</i> of a Bitcoin-like system. Law <i>et al</i> don''t claim originality for anything, they merely report the state of the art among academic cryptographers, who had been publishing papers on electronic cash for a decade. The paper is merely evidence that the NSA was tracking academic work in applications of cryptography; it would be a scandal if they weren''t.<br />\n<br />\nThere are a number of other problems with the theory that in the mid-90s NSA developed Bitcoin based on this paper, kept it secret for over a decade, and then some rogue employee published it in the depths of the global financial crisis:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nThe techniques academic researchers were publishing in the early 90s had some features that Bitcoin adopted, primarily public-key cryptography, but were not decentralized. As\n<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm">Law <i>et al</i> wrote</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWe will assume throughout the remainder of this paper that some authentication infrastructure is in place, providing the four security features. \n</blockquote>\nNakamoto assembled the well-known techniques of public-key cryptography, blockchain and proof-of-work, and added the innovation of the longest-chain consensus rule to build a <i>decentralized</i> system that Law <i>et al</i> never even saw as a goal.\n</li>\n<li>Law <i>et al</i> were very aware of the threat pseudonymous electronic cash posed to government functions such as taxation and law enforcement <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm">For example</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe untraceability property of electronic cash creates problems in detecting money laundering and tax evasion because there is no way to link the payer and payee. To counter this problem, it is possible to design a system that has an option to restore traceability using an escrow mechanism. If certain conditions are met (such as a court order), a deposit or withdrawal record can be turned over to a commonly trusted entity who holds a key that can decrypt information connecting the deposit to a withdrawal or vice versa. This will identify the payer or payee in a particular transaction.\n</blockquote>\nLaw <i>et al</i> did  not have trustlessness as a goal; most of the systems they discuss involve trusted entities.\n</li>\n<li>Thus the idea that the NSA would develop a decentralized, trustless cryptocurrency as a "monetary bioweapon" that would impair their own government''s functions and which they would be unable to control is implausible.</li>\n<li>Further, if the legendary skills of the NSA were to develop a "monetary bioweapon" it would presumably be a good one, but Bitcoin isn''t. It took about 6 years to achieve significant usage, then another 7 years to blow a $3T bubble of notional value. Even before it burst, that wasn''t enough to have a major effect on the real or monetary economies.</li>\n  <li>Roberts'' flagging of "Tatsuaki Okamoto" seems typical conspiracy theorizing - the NSA paper cites three of Okamoto''s papers from ''91, ''94 and ''95 in crypto conferences. It appears that Okamoto was among many cryptographers publishing on electronic cash at that time who moved to other topics because the then state of the art turned out to be a blind alley. </li>\n</ol>\nLaw <i>et al</i>''s paper is evidence that the NSA was tracking developments in academic research on electronic cash in the mid-90s. It provides no evidence that the NSA was interested in, or had developed, a decentralized, trustless cryptocurrency. Although Nakamoto was skilled in <i>applying</i> cryptography, he did not need NSA-level skills in <i>creating</i> cryptosystems. It is of course possible that Nakamoto was one or more presumably rogue NSA staffers, but this is an additional hypothesis that adds nothing, so should be rejected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam''s_razor">Occam''s Razor</a>.','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-09-26 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

These Responsible Person(s) include those exercising control or sufficient influence over a DeFi arrangement or activity.\n</blockquote>\nFootnote 44 cites the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-rba-virtual-assets-2021.html">Financial Action Task Force</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIndicia of control or influence can include, for example, ownership interest; significant financial interest; significant voting rights; management of or the ability to impact the operations of the protocol at an enterprise or fundamental level; the ability to set permissions or access rights for users of the protocol, or to otherwise impact the rights of other users of the protocol; control over user assets; and the ability to enter into agreements for the protocol or enterprise.\n</blockquote>\nThus the report is not fooled by the claim of "decentralization" but suggests a wide range of criteria for identifying the <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD744.pdf">loci of control over a DeFi protocol</a>.<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn conducting this analysis, a regulator should carefully examine any claim that the arrangement or activity is purportedly <i>decentralized</i> to the point that no persons or entities are responsible and should subject Responsible Persons to its applicable regulatory framework.\n</blockquote>\nThe report notices that "decentralizing" governance of a protocol via, for example, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/05/be-careful-what-you-vote-for.html">voting among holers of a governance token</a> doesn''t absolve <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD744.pdf">Responsible Persons of responibility</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWhen considering persons and entities that may be Responsible Persons, it is important to note that governance mechanisms currently used for DeFi arrangements are not self- implementing. Human involvement typically is necessary to effectuate governance decisions, or to translate and implement proposals to make changes to a project’s protocol, smart contracts or other code into usable code. So those making such proposals often must rely on others with technical control and skill (i.e., administrative access and requisite technical capability) to implement governance decisions. Code could also be designed and updated through the deployment of automated methodologies – including those that utilize artificial intelligence or other technologies. For such cases, the person or entity that is responsible for deploying or using such methodologies could also be considered in the assessment of Responsible Persons.\n</blockquote>\nRecommendation 4 concerns cryptocurrency''s epidemic problem of <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD744.pdf">conflicts of interest</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMany DeFi arrangements and activities today are being conducted in a manner that presents conflicts of interest. DeFi participants may be acting in roles and capacities that create conflicts of interest. Such conflicts can arise, for example, if the provider of a DeFi product or service itself has a financial interest derived from user or third-party activities, an ownership interest in a related third-party, or a favorable arrangement with a particular related party. In particular, the provider may take advantage of their control or influence over the governance of the DeFi arrangement to promote proposals or initiatives that inure to their benefit financially. Conflicts could also arise if the provider is engaged in multiple activities in a vertically integrated matter, either themselves or with affiliated parties. For example, the provider may operate a trading platform while simultaneously being a counterparty to transactions with a user as a market maker or employ technologies like bots or algorithms to transact with users. Indeed, a fundamental conflict may exist if developers, founders and early investors lack the incentive to maintain a project after receiving an initial investment and are instead incentivized to exit the project.\n</blockquote>\nSee <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/list-and-dump-schemes.html"><i>List And Dump Schemes</i></a> for examples of the last sentence. These conflicts of interest normally explain why the Resposible Persons want to retain "control or influence" behind the veil of decentralization; they are how they <strike>make money</strike> rip off retail customers.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the conflicts of interest the report discusses in detail, on Page 32 and in Annex B, is <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD744.pdf">Miners'' Extractable Value (MEV)</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nthe ability to reorder, insert, and otherwise control transactions enables conduct that in traditional markets would be considered manipulative and unlawful.\n</blockquote>\nSee <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/miners-extractable-value.html"><i>Miners'' Extractable Value</i></a> for a discussion of how MEV became a feature not a bug (spoiler: because there was no way to stop it).<br />\n<br />\nRecommendation 5 concerns <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD744.pdf">operational risks</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nDeFi arrangements and activities introduce unique operational and technological risks, including those stemming from the underlying DLT, smart contracts and protocols, governance structures, oracles, and bridges. These risks can arise from any one layer of the tech stack that underlies DeFi, as well as from interdependencies between and among those layers of the tech stack.  ...  These include, among others, risks arising from the operational interconnectedness of DeFi, due in part to the composability and modularity inherent to DeFi protocols; the proliferation of exploits targeting vulnerable code across protocols’ similar code; and a concentration of critical service providers and other participants within DeFi.\n</blockquote>\nMolly White''s <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/"><i>Web3 is Going Just Great</i></a> provides an invaluable resource tracking, among others, attacks on <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?collection=bridge-attack">bridges</a> and <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?collection=oracle-manipulation">oracles</a>. I''m planning a post on <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull76.pdf"><i>The oracle problem and the future of DeFi</i></a> by Chanelle Duley <i>et al</i> from the Bank for International Settlements. Citing Chainalysis, they note that:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn 2022, DeFi protocols lost $403.2 million in 41 separate oracle manipulation attacks\n</blockquote>\nThe report cites Chainalysis as <a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD744.pdf">estimating that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n64% of the $3.1 billion stolen from DeFi protocols in 2022 was attributable to cross-chain bridges\n</blockquote>\nThe report''s Annex E discusses these risks in detail; all the Annexes are well worth reading..<br />\n<br /> \nThe body of the report ends with a set of 10 questions for public comment. Those to which I have a substantive response are:<br />\n<ol>\n<li value="4"><b>\nDo you agree with the risks and issues around DeFi protocols identified in this Report?\n...\nHow can market participants help address these risks and/or issues, including through the use of technology?</b>\nThere are two big problems with this question:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The whole point of cryptocurrencies and DeFi in particular is to evade regulation. The "risks and issues" are the things that make "market participants" profitable. Thus "market particpants" are not motivated to address them.</li>\n<li>The "risks and issues" cannot be mitigated by applying technological fixes, because their cause is <i>economic</i> not technical. They are fundamental to any permissionless system. Because the security of the system depends upon its being expensive, economies of scale will be very powerful and will inevitably lead to centralization. Centralized systems whose loci of control lack accountabilty will inevitably suffer these kinds of "risks and issues". Providing accountability of the loci of control requires the ability to dedny permission, which in permissionless systems is impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li value="5"><b>\nDo you agree with the description of data gaps and challenges in the Report?\n...\nHow can market participants address these data gaps and challenges, including through the use of technology?</b> For the reasons outlined above "market participants" are not motivated to provide regulators with timely and accurate data that would be ammunition for reducing their profits.<br />\n<br />\n<b>How would you suggest IOSCO members address data gaps and challenges?</b> Given this adversarial situation, the best that regulators can do is to rely on the third-party data sources such as Chainalysis and DataFinnovation. While it is clearly important for regulators to understand what is happening, their important task is to identify the loci of control and impose accountability upon them. Thus the key use of data is deanonymization. These third party services are reasonably successful at deanonymizing wallets, but the more successful regulators are at using them, the greater the incentive to improve anonymity techniques including the use of currencies such as Monero and Zcash, or mixers such as Tornado Cash.</li>\n<li value="8"><b>\nGiven the importance of the application of IOSCO Standards to DeFi activities, are there technological innovations that allow regulators to support innovation in DeFi/blockchain technologies while at the same time addressing investor protection and market integrity risks?</b>\nThis is the most worrying sentence in the entire report. The task of regulators is to prevent harm to the public not to "support innovation", least of all to support innovation in a technology whose goal is to evade regulation. The harm to the public arises directly from the use of permissionless systems to evade accountability. What the public needs regulators to do is to impress upon market participants that the use of permissionless systems to evade accountability is unacceptable and ineffective. Doing so will mitigate the "risks and issues" because people will stop using these systems.\n</li>\n</ol>','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-09-19 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

For example, to start an HTTPS connection  between Alice and Bob using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange</a>, they each use their private key and the other''s public key to compute aa shared secret key used to encrypt the communication.<br />\n<br />\nHow does Alice know Bob''s public key, and vice versa? Alice obtains Bob''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">certificate</a>, which contains Bob''s public key. Alice can trust that the public key in the certificate belongs to Bob because it is signed by the private key matching the public key in the certificate of a Certificate Authority (CA) she trusts.<br />\n<br />\nHow does Alice know to trust the CA? Her browser has a list of certificates for CAs the browser vendor trusts, and Alice just accepts the browser vendor''s judgement.  Similarly, Alice can trust software packages signed by a CA she trusts to sign code. How does Alice know to trust this CA? Her operating system vendor has provided a code-signing certificate and Alice just accepts the vendor''s judgement.<br />\n<br />\nThis all works great in theory, but in practice not so much. There are many ways in which the system can fail:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The CA might be an organization Alice might not want to trust. For example, among the CAs Firefox trusts are several Chinese government organizations. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484768">Rusted Anchors: A National Client-Side View of Hidden Root CAs in the Web PKI Ecosystem</a> by Yiming Zhang <i>et al</i> documented that:<br />\n<blockquote>\nrecent security incidents and studies show that the management of local root stores can be the "Achilles’ heel" of Web PKI security. By injecting self-built root certificates into local root stores, local software such as anti-virus and parent-control applications creates a man-in-the-middle proxy to filter SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic. This approach can also be used by government agencies or malware, in order to monitor web users’ online behaviors. For instance, reports in 2019 show that citizens in Kazakhstan were forced to import government-built CAs on their devices. \n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>The CA might have been compromised. For example, Dan Goodin wrote in 2018''s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/counterfeit-certificates-sold-online-make-digitally-signed-malware-a-snap/"><i>One-stop counterfeit certificate shops for all your malware-signing needs</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBarysevich identified four such sellers of counterfeit certificates since 2011. Two of them remain in business today. The sellers offered a variety of options. In 2014, one provider calling himself C@T advertised certificates that used a Microsoft technology known as Authenticode for signing executable files and programming scripts that can install software. C@T offered code-signing certificates for macOS apps as well. ... "In his advertisement, C@T explained that the certificates are registered under legitimate corporations and issued by Comodo, Thawte, and Symantec—the largest and most respected issuers,"\n</blockquote>\nMuch of history''s most notorious malware was signed with compromised certificates, for example <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/stuxnet-201104">Stuxnet</a></li>\n<li>The CA might be incompetent. For example, in 2012 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/02/critics-slam-ssl-authority-for-minting-cert-used-to-impersonate-sites/">Goodin wrote</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCritics are calling for the ouster of Trustwave as a trusted issuer of secure sockets layer certificates after it admitted minting a credential it knew would be used by a customer to impersonate websites it didn''t own.<br />\n<br />\nThe so-called subordinate root certificate allowed the customer to issue SSL credentials that Internet Explorer and other major browsers would accept as valid for any server on the Internet.\n</blockquote>\nAnd in 2015 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/google-warns-of-unauthorized-tls-certificates-trusted-by-almost-all-oses/">Goodin wrote</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn the latest security lapse involving the Internet''s widely used encryption system, Google said unauthorized digital certificates have been issued for several of its domains and warned misissued credentials may be impersonating other unnamed sites as well.<br />\n...<br />\nThe certificates were issued by Egypt-based MCS Holdings, an intermediate certificate authority that operates under the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). The Chinese domain registrar and certificate authority, in turn, is included in root stores for virtually all OSes and browsers.\n</blockquote>\nSix months later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/symantec-employees-fired-for-issuing-rogue-https-certificate-for-google/">Goodin wrote</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSymantec has fired an undisclosed number of employees after they were caught issuing unauthorized cryptographic certificates that made it possible to impersonate HTTPS-protected Google webpages.\n</blockquote>\nBut it was far worse than Symantec admitted. Two years later a Google investigation revealed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/">Symantec CAs have improperly issued more than 30,000 certificates</a>.\n</li>\n<li>The CA''s certificate might have been spoofed. This is what the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962">Certificate Transparency</a> (CT) system is intended to detect. Five years ago I wrote about how <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/11/certificate-transparency.html">CT secures the certificates that secure HTTPS</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe basic idea is to accompany the certificate with a hash of the certificate signed by a trusted third party, attesting that the certificate holder told the third party that the certificate with that hash was current. Thus in order to spoof a service, an attacker would have to both obtain a fraudulent certificate from a CA, and somehow persuade the third party to sign a statement that the service had told them the fraudulent certificate was current.<br />\n...<br />\nClients now need two lists of trusted third parties, the CAs and the sources of CT attestations.  ...  In the real world it isn''t feasible to solve the problem of untrustworthy CAs by eliminating the need for trust. CT''s approach instead is to provide a mechanism by which breaches of trust, both by the CAs and by the attestors, can be rapidly and unambiguously detected.\n</blockquote>\nGoogle Chrome has required Certificate Transparency for all "Extended Validation (EV)" certificates since 2015.</li>\n<li>The CA might have created a certificate chain by delegating trust to another organization, that might be compromised or incompetent.</li>\n<li>One of the keys in the chain might not be long enough to be secure.</li>\n<li>One of the keys in the chain might not be truly random. Users who generated a vanity wallet address using the <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?collection=profanity-vulnerability">Profanity</a> service lost their coins for this reason.</li>\n<li>Someone might have developed a sufficiently powerful <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/11/the-65b-prize.html">quantum computer</a>.</li>\n</ul>\nThe first of the two Goodin posts above harks back to the Symantec disaster. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/a-renegade-certificate-is-removed-from-windows-then-it-returns-confusion-ensues/">Godin writes</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFor three days, system administrators have been troubleshooting errors that have prevented Windows users from running applications such as QuickBooks and Avatax. We now know the cause: an unannounced move or glitch by Microsoft that removed a once-widely used digital certificate in Windows.<br />\n...<br />\nJust minutes before this post was scheduled to go live, researchers learned that the certificate had been restored in Windows. It’s unclear how or why that occurred.<br />\n...<br />\nMicrosoft has yet to respond to a request to explain the errors. It may be that a glitch caused Windows to remove the root certificate. It’s also possible the removal was intentional, given that it’s one of several that faced an industry-wide blockade following the discovery in 2015 that its parent issuer at the time, Symantec, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/symantec-employees-fired-for-issuing-rogue-https-certificate-for-google/">improperly issued certificates</a> for google.com, www.google.com, and one other domain.<br />\n</blockquote>\nWhy was this certificate, first issued in 2006 and blockaded in 2015, still trusted by Microsoft? In 2017, Google published the result of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/">investigating Symantec''s CA</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nGoogle''s investigation revealed that over a span of years, Symantec CAs have improperly issued more than 30,000 certificates.\n</blockquote>\nThe right thing for security would have been to revoke <i>every</i> certificate that Symantec had issued, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/">but</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSymantec''s repeated violations underscore one of the problems Google and others have in enforcing terms of the baseline requirements. When violations are carried out by issuers with a big enough market share they''re considered too big to fail. If Google were to nullify all of the Symantec-issued certificates overnight, it might cause widespread outages.\n</blockquote>\nGiven a choice between keeping customers secure and keeping customers working, the tech industry adopted "too big to fail". Since they didn''t revoke or remove the certificate, the applications dependent upon it kept working and their developers didn''t notice that their security was compromised for <i>six years</i>. Unless Microsoft deliberately glitched the system to wake people up, their security will continue to be compromised until it expires in 2036, more than two decades after it was revealed that Symantec''s credibility as a root of trust was worthless.<br />\n<br />\nThere are CA certificates that my Firefox trusts that don''t expire until 2046! If it is effectively impossible to remove or revoke widely used certificates, it seems insane that CAs are allowed to create certificates valid for a quarter of a century. Doing so allows users of those certificates to completely ignore the issue of replacing their root certificates because by the time it is needed I''ll be gone and you''ll be gone. Because users can ignore the problem, the inability to remove or revoke compromised certificates becomes entrenched.

On Tuesday, a different set of researchers made a similarly solemn announcement: Microsoft’s digital keys had been hijacked to sign yet more malware for use by a previously unknown threat actor in a supply-chain attack that infected roughly 100 carefully selected victims.\n</blockquote>\nGoodin <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/facing-failure-after-failure-microsofts-driver-signing-program-fails-yet-again/">continued</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn July, security firm Sophos <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/11/microsoft-revokes-malicious-drivers-in-patch-tuesday-culling/">reported</a> its discovery of 133 malicious drivers, 100 of which had been digitally signed by Microsoft and the remaining ones by other trusted parties that went unnamed. The signings dated as far back as April 2021. In December, Sophos <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/12/13/signed-driver-malware-moves-up-the-software-trust-chain/">reported</a> its discovery of another malicious driver signed by Microsoft.<br />\n<br />\nThe Sophos July report coincided with related posts from security firm Trend and Microsoft. Trend <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/g/hunting-for-a-new-stealthy-universal-rootkit-loader.html">said</a> it had unearthed newly discovered malware that came as a standalone kernel driver signed directly by Microsoft through its hardware compatibility program. Compromised signatures are “an evolving attack vector that has been frequently appearing in today’s malware landscape,” Trend researchers wrote. “Despite how complex [it] is to build such capabilities, it seems that current malicious actors are exhibiting competence and consistent usage of such tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), regardless of their final motive and objectives.”<br />\n<br />\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, published a <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/ADV230001">post</a> that said the malicious signings were the result of “several developer accounts for the Microsoft Partner Center… engaged in submitting malicious drivers to obtain a Microsoft signature.” \n</blockquote>\nMicrosoft placed the accounts on a "block list" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/facing-failure-after-failure-microsofts-driver-signing-program-fails-yet-again/">but</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLast year, researchers showed that despite repeated Microsoft assertions to the contrary, the block list <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/how-a-microsoft-blunder-opened-millions-of-pcs-to-potent-malware-attacks/">failed to work</a>.<br />\n<br />\nMicrosoft’s July statement was almost a verbatim copy of one it <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/ADV220005">issued last December</a>, after being told two months earlier by security firms SentinelOne, Mandiant, and Sophos of similar abuse of its driver-signing program.\n</blockquote>\nIn <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/hunting-attestation-signed-malware"><i>I Solemnly Swear My Driver Is Up to No Good: Hunting for Attestation Signed Malware</i></a> Mandiant researchers wrote:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMandiant has continually observed threat actors use compromised, stolen, and illicitly purchased code-signing certificates to sign malware, lending legitimacy and subverting security controls such as application allow-listing policies. Attestation signed drivers take the trust granted to them by the CA and transfers it to a file whose Authenticode signature originates from Microsoft itself. We assess with high confidence that threat actors have subverted this process using illicitly obtained EV code signing certificates to submit driver packages via the attestation signing process, and in effect have their malware signed by Microsoft directly.\n</blockquote>\nSentinelOne concluded that the compromised certificates were probably purchased from a supplier similar to the ones Barysevich identified in 2018.<br />\n<br />\nGoodin described more instances of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/facing-failure-after-failure-microsofts-driver-signing-program-fails-yet-again/">Microsoft signing malware</a>, including:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn June 2021, for instance, the company gave its digital imprimatur to a driver with the innocuous name Netfilter. A researcher from security firm G Data later discovered it was a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/microsoft-digitally-signs-malicious-rootkit-driver/">rootkit that decrypted encrypted communications</a>, most likely to eavesdrop on SSL communications.\n</blockquote>\nAfter pointing to Microsoft''s opaque responses to recent breaches of its cloud systems Azure and Exchange, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/facing-failure-after-failure-microsofts-driver-signing-program-fails-yet-again/">Goodin concludes</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nVirtually all of the key-hijacking incidents reported in recent years have been attributed to Chinese hackers, usually for espionage purposes. Microsoft’s string of failures in locking down its certification program, and its reticence when disclosing them, are undermining the entire concept of security, much to the delight of these adversaries.\n</blockquote>\nMicrosoft''s business model, as a operating system vendor and a follower in cloud markets, depends upon being perceived as a safe choice for enterprise applications. Thus it has a strong motivation to play down and obfuscate serial security lapses such as these, and to avoid any security fixes that would significantly impact customers. Thus we can expect the parade of security lapses to continue.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-09-05 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

In the abstract she writes:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThis Article illuminates one path through which the prolonged period of low interest rates from 2009-2021 has impacted financial stability: it traces how yield-seeking behavior in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis and Covid pandemic led to a bubble in the venture capital industry, which in turn spawned a crypto bubble as well as a run on the VC-favored Silicon Valley Bank.<br />\n...<br />\nIt argues for increased monitoring of the venture capital industry by financial stability regulators, given that venture capital is well-positioned to generate asset bubbles now and in the future. More specifically, it argues for more aggressive enforcement of the securities laws to tamp down on the present crypto bubble, as well as for structural separation between crypto and the traditional financial system.\n</blockquote>\nProf. Allen describes yet another of the many ways the current <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/venture%20capital">venture capital industry is malfunctioning</a>, and calls for increased oversight of these risks to financial stability.  Below the fold I discuss this and one of the papers it cites.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThe fundamental problem is that, for understandable reasons, after the financial industry blew up the world economy in 2008 <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">money was too cheap for too long</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nInterest rates are one of the most important policy tools that exist to deal with the aftermath of financial crises, but the aftermath of the 2008 crisis made it clear that accommodative monetary policy won’t always be a complete response to the harms of financial crises. Furthermore, if accommodative monetary policy inspires yield-seeking behavior that causes a subsequent round of financial instability to erupt before interest rates have been meaningfully increased, traditional monetary policy won’t even be available as a crisis response because interest rates won’t have any room to go lower.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmS03QzPraWAA1jZjIIyDwqUgeXQLREwh3XdhmPpCwSvpo_SVKwSIjLY8ol6UYny7zaq26cNgVODXeN17X324Yo1hhyTvJgFQrCNxSv8hU7B6aKFSTRBKcwDk4qftjh66EFfZRMFteLu1itkbKTMIwcwnAaHuqxAqui2nnbwDRZfWNZ0iYm6A0s1bVhGrO/s1000/AnnualVC-Investment.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="603" data-original-width="1000" height="121" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmS03QzPraWAA1jZjIIyDwqUgeXQLREwh3XdhmPpCwSvpo_SVKwSIjLY8ol6UYny7zaq26cNgVODXeN17X324Yo1hhyTvJgFQrCNxSv8hU7B6aKFSTRBKcwDk4qftjh66EFfZRMFteLu1itkbKTMIwcwnAaHuqxAqui2nnbwDRZfWNZ0iYm6A0s1bVhGrO/w200-h121/AnnualVC-Investment.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Source</td></tr></tbody></table>\nAnother way of describing "yield-seeking behavior" is that investors don''t adequately price in risk and, as a result, pay too much for their investments, thus blowing a bubble.  Until recently interest rates had been at historic lows for 14 years, almost one-and-a-half times the span of a typical VC fund. The result was that investors blew a bubble in VC funds:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCharts from the Financial Times ... show that in the United States, both the number of VC deals and the dollar amount invested in VC increased at a reasonably steady pace during the post-financial crisis era of low interest rates, with a significant spike in investment in 2021. “The scale of the most recent venture boom has dwarfed that at the end of the 1990s, when annual investment peaked at $100bn in the US. By comparison, the amount of cash pumped into American tech start-ups [in 2021] reached $330bn. That was twice was much as the previous year, which was itself twice the level of three years earlier.”\n</blockquote>\nAt some point the bubble pops as investors come face-to-face with the risks they discounted.  It was not surprising that, once interest rates started their recent rise, investors discovered that they had <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">discounted that risk</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAnd then there are financial stability risks associated with exiting a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is hard to say whether and when these stability risks may be significant enough to justify deviations from inflation-fighting monetary policy, but it remains true that once easy money ceases to be available, that can prick bubbles created as a result of increased yield-seeking behavior during the low interest rate period. Although not all bubbles cause financial instability, financial stability will probably be impacted if banks and other leveraged financial institutions are significantly exposed to a bubble that pops.\n</blockquote>\nVC funds are not at an obvious risk of <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">runs similar to banks</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFortunately, the end of a VC bubble is unlikely to have any immediate financial stability implications: a VC investor cannot withdraw their money from a VC fund before the end of the fund’s term, and so we need not be worried about runs on VC funds. Even if individual VC funds end up closing at a loss at the end of their 10-year terms, the financial stability implications are likely to be muted. Investors in a VC fund <i>could</i> end up with negative returns at the end of a fund’s term if the fund were not able to exit profitably from enough startup ventures to deliver positive returns to its investors, but those losses would only impact the stability of the broader financial system if the investors were unable to absorb these losses and started to engage in destabilizing behaviors like fire sales of other assets. Such outcomes are unlikely if investors are well diversified.\n</blockquote>\nBut Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Silvergate were "significantly exposed to a bubble that pops". When SVB suffered a run, the Federal Reserve decided there was enough risk to financial stability that they bailed everyone out, including the VCs that triggered the run, and the USDC stablecoin. SVB was bought down by "herd behavior" among the VCs and their startups that provided the bulk of the bank''s deposits.<br />\n<br />\nIn the tightly connected world of Silicon Valley, herd behavior is  not new. It is endemic among VCs. For example, Nvidia was started in one of the Valley''s regular downturns. It was the only hardware to be funded that quarter, but it was pitched to three top-drawer VCs and funded by two (Sutter Hill and Sequoia). Six months later we knew <i>over 30</i> startups attacking the same market &mdash; 3D graphics chips for the PC. Nvidia''s pitch had become known and the VCs who missed out on the deal figured that they needed a similar deal. FOMO in action. Why are VCs so vulnerable to herd behavior? Prof. Allen quotes Peter Lee''s <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4005801"><i>Enhancing the Innovative Capacity of Venture Capital</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n[h]istorical evidence reveals several trends of “hot” technologies receiving significant VC funding and then losing favor. Perhaps owing to the close-knit, socially connected nature of the VC-startup ecosystem, information signals from a few key decisionmakers can steer significant shifts in funding trends.\n</blockquote>\nAnd <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">observes that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLee notes his interviewees’ observations that this herding “creates significant waste and overlooks promising innovations outside the mainstream.” One such interviewee commented that “there’s just countless examples of that, where poor quality innovation is what actually makes it to market, ’cause of the team, the network, the location, the hype, the everything.”\n</blockquote>\nAin''t that the truth! Prof. Allen details some of the reasons for VCs'' habit of <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">"spraying and praying"</a>. First, the fact that most of their investments will fail:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIt is entirely expected that VC funds will see many of their investments become worthless, and so those funds won’t worry about failures in the same way traditional financiers would. Instead, the focus is on the possible exponential upside of a new business, even if its success seems somewhat unrealistic, on the assumption that “the future is best discovered by means of maverick moon shots” – it is these maverick moon shots that will deliver the funds’ returns. Optimism is therefore structural, and not just a matter of groupthink. This is exacerbated because it is difficult to express pessimism in startup investment – short- selling of startup shares is not possible in any meaningful sense, and so there is a pronounced and asymmetric preference for optimism over pessimism.\n</blockquote>\nSecond, the way that optimism, as with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-14/sequoia-ftx-profile-of-sam-bankman-fried-sbf-was-a-face-plant">Sequoia and FTX</a>, leads to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">inadequate due diligence</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLow levels of diligence can contribute to the growth of bubbles, as they allow more and lower quality startups to enter the market. These limitations of VC oversight may also persist after VC funds first invest in a project: “the board [on which VC interests are represented] typically invests little in compliance and internal controls...because...the company is usually still figuring out if it can even make an innovative product or service that people want and develop a strategy to bring it to market.” If the project goes well, then VCs “need the company’s valuation to keep going up in order to raise another round of financing and not get significantly diluted, and eventually to reach an exit that generates returns.” The desire for exponential growth and profits certainly provide an incentive for VC firms to refrain from being too critical of their investments, as does the clubby natures of the relationships between VCs and founders (VCs are sometimes too worried about scaring away founders to exercise real oversight).\n</blockquote>\nThe flood of too-cheap money <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">exacerbated these problems</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nVC firms had a glut of money which they had to deploy <i>somewhere</i>: as one industry commentator put it, with money flooding into VC funds, things “quickly went from not enough capital to not enough ideas for the flood of capital to fund.” In such an environment, it would not be surprising for herding to intensify, startup valuations to increase, and diligence standards to suffer:\n</blockquote>\nAfter discussing the failure of SVB, Prof. Allen turns to the cryptocurrency bubble, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">arguing that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nthe VC industry has played a central role in both building, and sustaining, the crypto industry. While the fact that the crypto industry has not failed completely might superficially seem like good news from a financial stability perspective, in the longer term, keeping the crypto industry going could prove negative for financial stability – especially if the traditional financial system embraces crypto in that longer term.\n</blockquote>\nThe attraction of cryptocurrency investment for VCs is the way <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/list-and-dump-schemes.html"><i>List And Dump Schemes</i></a> provide much faster liquidity than developing a startup to the point of IPO or acquisition (hat tip to <a href="https://startupsandecon.substack.com/p/you-dont-own-web3-a-coinbase-curse">Fais Khan</a>). The leader in exploting this was <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">A16Z</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAs of May 2022, a16z had funded more than $7.6 billion in crypto and Web3 ventures ...  A16z’s first crypto investment was in the crypto exchange Coinbase in 2013, and it has since launched several dedicated crypto venture funds, backing at least 75 crypto/blockchain companies. As one industry publication put it, “[c]rypto has become central to a16z’s business, and the firm plans to own large portions of the digital world.” A16z therefore has a vested interest in the success of the crypto industry.\n</blockquote>\nThey and other cryoptocurrency VCs were able to use the flood of too-cheap money to pursue their "vested interest" by means <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4513037">other than success in the market</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nA16z has used money invested with it during low-interest rate periods to aggressively lobby regulators and legislators. It is no secret that a16z has been pursuing this kind of strategy for some time: as one New York Times article from 2021 put it, “[d]elivering significant returns on all this investment, executives at A16Z quickly realized, would necessitate playing a major role in shaping rules for these companies.” A16z has sent numerous letters to federal regulators, hired a significant number of former government officials, engaged in campaign financing, and organized fundraisers for elected officials: one article reported that “a16z’s leaders have given millions of dollars to pro-crypto candidates and PACs that wound up supporting them.” Overall, the crypto industry is spending amounts on lobbying that are roughly comparable to the defense and pharmaceutical industries, although it has not yet been able to secure the bespoke legislation it seeks.\n</blockquote>\nPerhaps this is because the defense and pharmaceutical industries, for all their rapacious rent extraction, do actually create socially useful products?<br />\n<br />\nPeter Lee''s <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4005801"><i>Enhancing the Innovative Capacity of Venture Capital</i></a> is a fascinating read, full of deft observations such as:<br />\n<blockquote>\nEmpirical research on unicorns—private companies with implied valuations of over $1 billion—is consistent with herding behavior among VCs. Tellingly, approximately 40% of VCs had invested in a unicorn, and over 90% of VCs believe that unicorns were overvalued. While numerous theories could explain why many VCs seem to be investing in companies that they believe are overvalued, such behavior is consistent with herding.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4005801">And</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFurther exacerbating herding is significant concentration in the VC industry; in 2019, the ten largest firms raised a third of all new VC funds.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4005801">And</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nStudy participants describe herding as a sociological phenomenon that often entails following recognized leaders. According to a scientist who has worked with several startups, “I will tell you, from my perspective, there’s a few probably lead venture capitalists, then a lot who follow. And some people will come in early and are risk-takers on things like that. Others will kinda wait and see how things develop.” ...  Part of this following mentality arises from a desire to free-ride on the due diligence that lead VC firms have already conducted. One technology transfer official noted that “nobody wants you ‘til one actually is ready to take the lead, then all of a sudden they’re all, all there. Somebody did all the diligence.”\n</blockquote>\nThe fact that a small number of high-profile VCs effectively direct the flow of funds to startups is an instance of the "Problem of Twelve" that affects the economy in general. Robin Wigglesworth''s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/847dbd13-4cd8-46e2-903a-659b61348641"><i>The ‘Problem of Twelve’ — redux</i></a> explains:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLast summer Alphaville wrote a list of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cb818afb-4ac3-430b-8e17-2de9129f5ac7">dozen most powerful people of the investment world</a>, inspired by a paper written by Harvard University’s John Coates that argued that “in the near future roughly twelve individuals will have practical power over the majority of US public companies”.<br />\n<br />\nCoates is now back at Harvard Law School after a stint at the SEC, and the original <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247337">Problem of Twelve</a> article from 2018 has now become an <a href="https://worldcat.org/title/1377284577">entire book</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/847dbd13-4cd8-46e2-903a-659b61348641">Wrigglesworth notes that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMeasured by assets under management, the roughly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a104a668-061f-4040-923d-85ffa7262759">$4tn in private equity</a> is dwarfed in size by the approximately <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/73a6527d-cd59-498e-9923-af5143cbb952">$20tn or so that resides inside index funds</a> (though a small but growing chunk of this is in bonds, not equities). But the real power of private equity is magnified many times its AUM by the leverage the industry uses.<br />\n<br />\nTogether, they are a force to be reckoned with. Coates estimates that index funds and private equity collectively control about 30 per cent of US corporate equity, with private equity actually owning more than index funds.<br />\n<br />\nAnd while index funds by their nature own a little bit of every public company, a private equity firm’s control over the companies it takes over is total. The Harvard professor therefore argues that the explosive growth of private equity could be even more problematic. \n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/847dbd13-4cd8-46e2-903a-659b61348641">Wrigglesworth quotes Coates</a>, and provides emphasis:<br />\n<blockquote>\nPrivate equity funds, such as Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR, are doing as much if not more than index funds to erode the legitimacy and accountability of American capitalism, not by controlling public companies, but by taking them over entirely, and removing them from the SEC’s disclosure regime. Private equity funds are creating their own problem of twelve.<br />\n<br />\n<b>. . . Private equity firms have moved beyond the buy-strip-sell model of the 1970s and 1980s to become a permanent, parallel capital universe.</b> They now trade businesses among themselves, and have gathered assets at a rate that outstrips growth by public companies and the economy. While index funds are coming to dominate Berle and Means — style companies, private equity funds are shifting increasing amounts of wealth out of those companies altogether, into a separate system of ownership and control.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Private equity is in part a long-term strategy of regulatory avoidance. Private equity funds are intentionally structured so as not to trigger disclosure laws. The private equity industry helped shape those laws, with lobbying and political influence.</b> Once a private equity fund acquires control of a business, the business goes “dark.” The results are less known to researchers and private equity professionals, much less to the public. General assessments of private equity are necessarily tentative. Yet we know enough about private equity to identify another problem of twelve in the making.\n</blockquote>\nThe VCs also have effective control over their startups, avoid regulation, and lobby for them; the same problem at a smaller scale.<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-08-29 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

First, Kim Stanley Robinson in passing during a fascinating <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-03/how-sci-fi-author-kim-stanley-robinson-imagines-a-low-carbon-future">interview by Oscar Boyd and Akshat Rathi</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCapitalism is the name of a power relationship of the few over the many.

Think of renting out a house you own: not only do you get paid when someone pays you to live there, you also get the benefit of rising property values, which are the result of the work that all the other homeowners, business owners, and residents do to make the neighborhood more valuable.<br />\n<br />\nThe first capitalists hated rent. They wanted to replace the "passive income" that landowners got from taxing their serfs'' harvest with active income from enclosing those lands and grazing sheep in order to get wool to feed to the new textile mills. They wanted active income – and lots of it.<br />\n<br />\nCapitalist philosophers railed against rent. The "free market" of Adam Smith wasn''t a market that was free from regulation – it was a market free from rents. The reason Smith railed against monopolists is because he (correctly) understood that once a monopoly emerged, it would become a chokepoint through which a rentier could cream off the profits he considered the capitalist''s due:<br />\n<br />\n<a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/03/cory-doctorow-free-markets/">https://locusmag.com/2021/03/cory-doctorow-free-markets/</a><br />\n</blockquote>\nWikipedia describes many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_feudalism">forms of feudalism</a> but the one Robinson and Doctorow have in mind is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism">manorialism</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIts defining features included a large, sometimes fortified manor house in which the lord of the manor and his dependants lived and administered a rural estate, and a population of labourers who worked the surrounding land to support themselves and the lord. These labourers fulfilled their obligations with labour time or in-kind produce at first, and later by cash payment as commercial activity increased.\n</blockquote>\nThe lord held his manor from the monarch, and usually part of his duties was to maintain a body of armed retainers the monarch could call upon at need. This force also ensured that the manor''s "population of labourers" remained subservient.<br />\n<br />\nDoctorow describes <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/">techno-feudalism</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nToday, we live in a rentier''s paradise. People don''t aspire to create value – they aspire to capture it. In Survival of the Richest, Doug Rushkoff calls this "going meta": don''t provide a service, just figure out a way to interpose yourself between the provider and the customer:<br />\n<br />\n<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/13/collapse-porn/#collapse-porn">https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/13/collapse-porn/#collapse-porn</a><br />\n<br />\nDon''t drive a cab, create Uber and extract value from every driver and rider. Better still: don''t found Uber, invest in Uber options and extract value from the people who invest in Uber. Even better, invest in derivatives of Uber options and extract value from people extracting value from people investing in Uber, who extract value from drivers and riders. Go meta.<br />\n<br />\nThis is your brain on the four-hour-work-week, passive income mind-virus. In Techno Feudalism, Varoufakis deftly describes how the new "Cloud Capital" has created a new generation of rentiers, and how they have become the richest, most powerful people in human history.<br />\n<br />\nShopping at Amazon is like visiting a bustling city center full of stores – but each of those stores'' owners has to pay the majority of every sale to a feudal landlord, Emperor Jeff Bezos, who also decides which goods they can sell and where they must appear on the shelves. Amazon is full of capitalists, but it is not a capitalist enterprise. It''s a feudal one:\n</blockquote>\nThe basis of feudalism was owning land, the basis of techno-feudalism is owning <i>intellectual property</i>. The enforcement mechanism of feudalism was the armed force of the lord of the manor''s goons, the enforcement mechanism of techno-feudalism is the army of lawyers the IP owners can deploy against dissenters, ultimately backed by the state''s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3711661">monopoly of legitimate force</a>.

Rogers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/venture-capital-big-tech-antitrust-predatory-pricing-uber-wework-bird-2023-7">writes</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWansley and Weinstein — who, not coincidentally, used to work in antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department — set out to change that. In a new paper titled "<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4437360">Venture Predation</a>," the two lawyers make a compelling case that the classic model of venture capital — disrupt incumbents, build a scalable platform, move fast, break things — isn''t the peak of modern capitalism that Silicon Valley says it is. According to this new thinking, it''s <i>anti</i>capitalist. It''s illegal. And it should be aggressively prosecuted, to promote free and fair competition in the marketplace.\n</blockquote>\nBelow the fold I discuss Wansley and Weinstein''s paper and relate it to events in the cryptosphere.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nJanuary 2017''s <i>Yale Law Journal</i> contained Lina M. Khan''s influential <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"><i>Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</i></a>. In the abstract Khan wrote:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAlthough Amazon has clocked staggering growth, it generates meager profits, choosing to price below-cost and expand widely instead. Through this strategy, the company has positioned itself at the center of e-commerce and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it.<br />\n...<br />\nWe cannot cognize the potential harms to competition posed by Amazon’s dominance if we measure competition primarily through price and output. Specifically, current doctrine underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive. These concerns are heightened in the context of online platforms for two reasons. First, the economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded. Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational—even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible. Second, because online platforms serve as critical intermediaries, integrating across business lines positions these platforms to control the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend. This dual role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors. \n</blockquote>\nWansley and Weinstein''s abstract reads:<br />\n<blockquote>\nPredatory pricing is a strategy firms use to suppress competition. The predator prices below its own costs to force its rivals out of the market. After they exit, the predator raises its prices to supracompetitive levels and recoups the cost of predation. The Supreme Court has described predatory pricing as “rarely tried” and “rarely successful” and has established a liability standard that is nearly impossible for plaintiffs to satisfy. We argue that one kind of company thinks predatory pricing is worth trying and at least potentially successful—venture-backed startups.<br />\n<br />\nA venture predator is a startup that uses venture finance to price below its costs, chase its rivals out of the market, and grab market share. Venture capitalists (VCs) are motivated to fund predation—and startup founders are motivated to execute it—because it can fuel rapid, exponential growth. Critically, for VCs and founders, a predator does not need to recoup its losses for the strategy to succeed. The VCs and founders just need to create the impression that recoupment is possible, so they can sell their shares at an attractive price to later investors who anticipate years of monopoly pricing. In this Article, we argue that venture predation can harm consumers, distort market incentives, and misallocate capital away from genuine innovations. We consider reforms to antitrust law and securities regulation to deter it.\n</blockquote>\nThe idea of lavishly subsidizing a company''s customers wouldn''t be attractive to most investors, but Wansley and Weinstein explain the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4437360">attraction for VCs</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nVCs are motivated to fund predation because it can deliver the rapid, exponential growth that venture investing requires. Venture funds are invested in portfolios of startups. The distribution of returns from a successful venture portfolio follows a power law. Most of the startups will fail or generate only modest growth, but one or two will grow exponentially. The outsized returns from those outlier companies must offset the losses from the rest of the portfolio. The skewed distribution of venture returns makes VCs focused on upside potential and relatively insensitive to downside risk. They seek out startups with the potential for rapid, exponential growth and push them to take risks to realize that potential.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqSlEeV8enpobL1Psz_861fJkBlyBX4ueOayF8BMrvIHXurBK_YzO09s2B4rbZrR8Oqml4XrKLSj1YrOQPKR6AXqf29K6ZNJi3pfALXA2ZFY1g4g6VShM9ELFrgFfXpkIi8gVm39ggvia_dFYaXqDpt9rB5f3znkTpAiiTf7JRBBFflrdsqtAReNGS7SaG/s1200/EGgJV_amazon_s_revenue_versus_profit_versus_free_cash_flow_.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="1200" height="105" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqSlEeV8enpobL1Psz_861fJkBlyBX4ueOayF8BMrvIHXurBK_YzO09s2B4rbZrR8Oqml4XrKLSj1YrOQPKR6AXqf29K6ZNJi3pfALXA2ZFY1g4g6VShM9ELFrgFfXpkIi8gVm39ggvia_dFYaXqDpt9rB5f3znkTpAiiTf7JRBBFflrdsqtAReNGS7SaG/w200-h105/EGgJV_amazon_s_revenue_versus_profit_versus_free_cash_flow_.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19316793/EGgJV_amazon_s_revenue_versus_profit_versus_free_cash_flow_.png">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nIt is likely that VCs'' focus on "venture predation" really started with Amazon.

Only the VCs and insiders made money; the stock spent most of its history below the IPO price and, after 4 years, is just 12% up.<br />\n<br />\nAnd now Uber is running out of money to subsidize rides, and riders are discovering that the un-subsidized price is astonishing. Steven Levy discovered this on his way to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-ceo-will-always-say-his-company-sucks/">interview Dara Khosrowshahi</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFifty-one dollars and 69 cents.

It’s 10 am on a sunny weekday, and it’s not like the president’s in town. I do agree that this is higher than I normally see, but in general, an Uber now costs more.

We do not know. Our point is that, <i>from the perspective of the VCs who funded the predation, it does not matter</i>. All that matters is that investors were willing to buy the VCs’ shares at a high price. The VC firm Benchmark, which led Uber’s Series A round, generated a return of about $5.8 billion on its investment. To Benchmark, Uber was a smashing success.\n</blockquote>\nIn other words, "venture predation" is a strategy of creating hype about the inevitable progress moonwards of the stock of a budding monopolist then dumping the stock on retail before it becomes clear that the business model doesn''t actually work.<br />\n<br />\nViewing "venture predation" as a precursor, you can see why VCs were so attracted to cryptocurrency <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/list-and-dump-schemes.html"><i>List And Dump Schemes</i></a>.

Those insiders include venture capital firms like a16z and, incredibly, Coinbase’s own venture arm, which has a number of investments listed on Coinbase. Other exchanges like Kraken, FTX, and Gemini are also all active in venture, and have listed their own investments. \n</blockquote>\nAnd in fact, <a href="https://startupsandecon.substack.com/p/you-dont-own-web3-a-coinbase-curse">Khan showed that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nA16z’s returns are much worse than Coinbase’s listings overall! This to me smells of insider selling. These should be the best coins there are, given a16z’s access, but instead 100% of those older than 12 months and 90% older than 6 months lag Ethereum.\n</blockquote>\nHe <a href="https://startupsandecon.substack.com/p/you-dont-own-web3-a-coinbase-curse">concluded</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nI think this is a microcosm of how bad the incentives are in crypto - VCs and private investors that used to have to wait ten years for liquidity can now get it within one. The last time that happened was 1999, and we know how that ended. It’s a recipe for risk taking that is then quickly passed on to the public.\n</blockquote>\nYes, the rewards are smaller than Wansley and Weinstein-type "venture predation" but there are lots of them and waiting less than a year to turn the investment around means that the lots of smaller returns multiply quickly. And the risk is much lower; the returns are essentially guaranteed by the addiction of crypto-bros to buying VC-funded coins listed on Coinbase.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-08-08 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

These low numbers are consistent across platform ecosystems and time periods. Troublingly, the reissue rate drops below 3 percent for games released prior to 1985—the foundational era of video games—indicating that the interests of the marketplace may not align with the needs of video game researchers. Our experiences gathering data for this study suggest that these problems will intensify over time due to a low diversity of reissue sources and the long-term volatility of digital game storefronts.\n</blockquote>\nBelow the fold I discuss some of the details.<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThe report points out that the industry agrees on the cultural importance of video games:<br />\n<blockquote>\na <a href="https://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Video-Games-in-the-21st-Century-2020-Economic-Impact-Report-Final.pdf">report</a> published in 2019 by the Entertainment Software Association, the largest video game trade organization in the United States, declared that “Video games have grown to become an iconic component of American culture.”\n</blockquote>\nBut:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAlthough the game industry agrees with the cultural heritage field that preservation is important, they disagree about how severe this problem is and how to address it. Industry lobbyists in the United States have opposed new copyright exemptions for game preservation on the grounds that there is already a thriving reissue market.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4jJpq01JHcBKJ0fxg8MGI4CQm4ThogCkjJXpi0uSnC8v6xtcKoKrRL0xxTXp9y13V46qcKe5mk7oQrIcWS7FBFChbgi18Iq77ZUW2aAkBxtHkvwNIScXZs0MitmoV7v0HbPGUU6krOCtZTKXsSVHyMcqsFLI-T3IgcJ2VY8sQ_QjJBUjOdqwrvWWlPckQ/s1455/GameAvailability.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="848" data-original-width="1455" height="117" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4jJpq01JHcBKJ0fxg8MGI4CQm4ThogCkjJXpi0uSnC8v6xtcKoKrRL0xxTXp9y13V46qcKe5mk7oQrIcWS7FBFChbgi18Iq77ZUW2aAkBxtHkvwNIScXZs0MitmoV7v0HbPGUU6krOCtZTKXsSVHyMcqsFLI-T3IgcJ2VY8sQ_QjJBUjOdqwrvWWlPckQ/w200-h117/GameAvailability.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492">Salvador Figure 1</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nDespite this the report finds that:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOnly 13 percent of classic video games published in the United States are currently in release. This figure is comparable to the commercial availability of pre-World War II audio recordings (10 percent or less) or the survival rate of American silent-era films (14 percent), two other mediums at risk.\n</blockquote>\nThe problem this causes scholars is:<br />\n<blockquote>\nPublishers do reissue historical video games through a variety of formats, services, and products, but their collective effort has amounted to recommercializing or otherwise making available less than one- fifth of all historical games. As a result,  nearly 90 percent of the game industry’s historical output is inaccessible without acquiring vintage games and hardware from the expensive second-hand market, visiting library collections in person due to restrictions imposed by Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or resorting to piracy.\n</blockquote>\nIf a game hasn''t been reissued, scholars have to hope that it has been preserved. The report lists the reasons why reissues are so rare:<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Technical</b>: As I explained in my 2015 report for the Mellon Foundation entitled <a href="https://mellon.org/Rosenthal-Emulation-2015"><i>Emulation and Virtualization as Preservation Strategies</i></a>, emulation is the preferred technique for replaying obsolete games, and the game emulation community has been extrordinarily successful in developing emulations for older systems. But the report points out that:<br />\n<blockquote>\nHowever, as Video Game History Foundation founder Frank Cifaldi explained in a series of talks presented at the annual Game Developers Conference, the video game industry has a long history of demonizing emulation technology for its association with piracy. Emulation technology for games first became widely viable in the mid-to-late 1990s and faced immediate pushback, notably in the high-profile 1999 lawsuit <i>Sony v. Connectix</i>, in which major game publishers challenged protected fair-use emulation activity.<br />\n...<br />\nWhile anti-emulation hysteria seems to be subsiding, Cifaldi paints the picture that years of anti-emulation stances from the industry stunted the growth of the game reissue market at the time when it was becoming technologically viable.\n</blockquote>\nEmulation in the browser powers the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>''s astonishing collections of early games, but for more recent games both for consoles and for PCs there are serious difficulties. The architecture of modern consoles and GPUs is both proprietary and complex, making it difficult to emulate them. And it may not be possible for in-browser emulation to deliver adequate performance.</li>\n<li><b>Licensing</b>: Game publishers typically do not create all the content for their games in-house, but license some from suppliers. These licenses may prevent reissue:<br />\n<blockquote>\nResolving technical issues does not guarantee that a game can be reissued. Complex rights and licensing agreements for games and their content may also prevent them from being re-released.  This is particularly true for games that were designed before there was a notion of a reissue market, when games were produced for a shorter shelf life and long-term availability was not an expectation or a concern.<br />\n...<br />\nSometimes licensing issues can affect specific content used in games, which also impacts their long-term availability. For instance, the role-playing Alpha Protocol was removed from digital storefronts in 2019 due to the expiration of the game’s music licenses, which the game’s publisher Sega chose not to renew. At the time of this study, Alpha Protocol remained unavailable, despite Sega fully owning the game’s publishing rights. In addition to licensed music, similar content licensing concerns affect titles such as sports video games with complex trademark and likeness agreements and games that use stock video footage.\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><b>Ownership</b>: Even if there are no license problems, the ownership of the game may be unclear:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThis is not an uncommon problem. A mass-scale case study for these types of ownership issues is the Stephen M. Cabrinety Collection at Stanford University Libraries (SUL), a collection of more than 18,000 game and software titles released from 1975–1995. According to Henry Lowood, curator for History of Science &amp; Technology Collections at SUL, Stanford and the National Institute of Standards and Technology attempted to contact the rightsholders for every game held in the collection to proactively seek permission for preservation activities. For a significant number of games—Lowood estimates 20 to 30 percent—the documented rightsholders could not confirm that they controlled the rights to those titles. Accounting for other issues determining and contacting owners, Lowood estimates that up to half of the Cabrinety Collection could be considered orphaned works. In addition to the challenges this poses for Stanford’s preservation efforts, the uncertainty about the ownership for these games means they may never have a pathway to recommercialization.\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><b>Digital: Availability</b> The situation is even worse for games that were never issued on physical media but depended upon a game platform:\n<blockquote>\nThe largest major platform shutdown in recent memory is the closure of the digital stores for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U platforms. Nintendo shut down the 3DS and Wii U eShops on March 27, 2023, resulting in the removal of 2,413 digital titles. Although many of these are likely available on other platforms, Video Games Chronicle estimates that over 1,000 of those games were exclusive to those platforms’ digital stores and are no longer available in any form, including first-party Nintendo titles like Dr. Luigi, Dillon’s Rolling Western, Mario &amp; Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, and Pokémon Rumble U. The closures also affected around 500 historical games reissued by Nintendo through their Virtual Console storefronts, over 300 of which are believed not available on any other platform or service.\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><b>Physical: Availability</b> Even if a researcher has the physical medium and the obsolete hardware they may still be stymied:<br />\n<blockquote>\nHaving a physical copy of a game and vintage hardware in working condition is also not a guarantee that the game is playable. Games released during the digital game distribution era may have content or features tied to online services, which may be (and regularly are) deactivated. According to researcher James Newman, this is sometimes employed by game publishers as a deliberate strategy to devalue used games, shorten their distribution window, and encourage sales of new titles, which has ominous implications for preservation.\n</blockquote>\nThis is part of the looming death of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">First-sale Doctrine</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThese days if researchers don''t have the media or hardware they likely can''t afford to buy them:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWhile used games were once affordable, functional, and plentifully available, it has now become unreasonable to expect researchers to acquire rare out-of-release titles on the second-hand market as a way to access them.\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><b>Piracy</b>: This is the usual result of copyright maximalism:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn the absence of a fuller reissue market or other reasonable research options, piracy fills in the gap.  For both consumers and researchers, piracy is one of the only methods—often the easiest method—for playing out-of-release games. Researchers especially depend on unauthorized copies of games for scholarship and teaching, often under fair use claims to reproduce and emulate games without rightsholder permission.<br />\n...<br />\nThere are a variety of reasons why members of the general public would pirate out-of-release video games. But for video game history researchers, piracy is often a last resort and necessity for proper study.\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><b>Availability: in Libraries</b> Libraries such as Stanford''s collect and preserve video game media and hardware, but:<br />\n<blockquote>\nFederal regulations in the United States currently require researchers to access most games in library video game collections on-premises, which can be impractical and expensive. The fan-sourced game statistics website HowLongToBeat reports that video games, on average, take around 20 hours to complete.  If a researcher wants to play through an entire game held by a library or archive, they may need to prepare for days or even weeks of travel, lodging, childcare, and other accommodations needed to visit a research collection.\n</blockquote>\nEven this may be impractical. Some collections have resorted to video recording a skilled player navigating the game as a form of ensuring some access to obsolete games.</li>\n</ul>\nThe legal and technical difficulties of preserving state-of-the-art games mean that future scholars of the art will increasingly depend upon reissues, and thus upon the whims of the publishers. This isn''t a happy prospect because as the report notes:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIndustry lobbyists in the United States have opposed new copyright exemptions for game preservation on the grounds that there is already a thriving reissue market.\n</blockquote>\nWhereas the report shows that the "thriving reissue market" only provides around 13% of the possible titles.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-08-03 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

So who are the customers of "miners and others that validate and secure transactions on a blockchain"?<br />\n<br />\nMerriam-Webster''s definition of "<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/customer">customer</a>" is "one that purchases a commodity or service". When a transaction is submitted to a blockchain it must include a fee, which is paid by the submitter to the validator. This clearly represents a purchase of the service of validating the transaction. Thus the submitter of each transaction is a customer of the validator, and under the bill in question the validator must "keep tabs of" their identity.<br />\n<br />\nIt would seem that the bill would therefore require miners and validators within US jurisdiction to blacklist transactions that involve a wallet the identity of whose owner is unclear. Thus it appears that the bill implements Nicholas Weaver''s proposal from two years ago in <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-start-disrupting-cryptocurrencies-mining-money-transmission"><i>How to Start Disrupting Cryptocurrencies: “Mining” Is Money Transmission</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSo a miner who creates a block is explicitly making decisions about which transactions to confirm. This successful miner ... is a money transmitter.\n</blockquote>\nUS law requires money transmitters to apply the Know Your Customer/Anti-Money-Laundering (KYC/AML) rules, thus Weaver argued that confirming transactions for wallets requires knowing the identity of the wallet owner. And he pointed out that miners could not argue that this was impossible <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-start-disrupting-cryptocurrencies-mining-money-transmission">because</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n  There is proof that one can attempt to produce a “sanctions-compliant” mining pool. <a href="https://marathondh.com/">Marathon Digital Holdings</a> is a small mining pool (<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/marathon-digital-holdings-announces-bitcoin-120000156.html">roughly 1 percent of the current mining rate</a>).

Yet they <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106865/marathon-ofac-bitcoin-mining-pool-taproot">stopped doing this</a> because the larger Bitcoin community objects to the idea of attempting to restrict Bitcoin to legal uses!\n</blockquote>\nPerhaps the validators believe that because the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network hasn''t enforced the KYC/AML rules against them, the DoJ wouldn''t use this proposed law against them either. But it easy to see why the Wall Street banks are getting behind a law to subject their competitors to the same rules they have to obey.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-08-01 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

They realized that repealing the law outright would be unpopular, and that Congress wouldn’t like it. So they decided to repeal the antitrust laws, de facto, by doing it quietly through administrative action.<br />\n<br />\nHere’s a memo that a researcher at my organization found in the Reagan library. It’s titled “Throttling Back on Antitrust: A Practical Proposal for Deregulation.” In it, two important Chicago Schoolers, George Stigler and Richard Posner, made the case that Reagan could get rid of antitrust law if his Antitrust chief just stopped bringing cases. But to do that, they would need a policy change in an obscure document known as ‘merger guidelines’ that organize antitrust enforcement. \n</blockquote>\nNow the Biden administration is proposing to re-enable anti-trust enforcement via a revision to these "merger guidelines", and are requesting the public to <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2023-0043-0001">submit comments</a> by September 18.

Still others are attempts to update guidance for how the economy has changed, with the rise of institutions like tech platforms and private equity firms.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXElEb23rpwXjrKNLe6kLMNfwjZNMRMZW75e3hpdD8OOMEdxJAGitphu2mb8OZ0DoozM6--tNSqeyV2wGVdAidXoJisCF8dGg1t4BQfBd2q4Uj-oYOWAX9IZb1d2w9xMT-gJMrD3IUmAYzj4w3pLqmj_UE6-a8r8AuXBnTht4lJfS6Ooguu1JJvZVD9TJE/s603/Summers.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="470" data-original-width="603" height="156" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXElEb23rpwXjrKNLe6kLMNfwjZNMRMZW75e3hpdD8OOMEdxJAGitphu2mb8OZ0DoozM6--tNSqeyV2wGVdAidXoJisCF8dGg1t4BQfBd2q4Uj-oYOWAX9IZb1d2w9xMT-gJMrD3IUmAYzj4w3pLqmj_UE6-a8r8AuXBnTht4lJfS6Ooguu1JJvZVD9TJE/w200-h156/Summers.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-07-20/summers-us-m-a-crackdown-seems-like-war-on-business-video">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nThe easy way to assess the importance of the "merger guidelines" is to watch the business press and the GOP <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-guidelines-and-overthrowing?">freaking out</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLarry Summers, the avatar of Democratic Party economic policymaking under both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, is in a rage, asserting these represent a “war on business.” Biglaw firms are <a href="https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2023/july/21/back-to-the-future-biden-administration-issues-draft-merger-guidelines">sending out</a> alerts to clients, saying “investors, boards and C-suites should anticipate significant delays and expenses associated with a far broader range of proposed transactions.” And the House Republicans are even trying to defund the very ability of the government to publish this document in their <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP19/20230714/116251/BILLS-118--AP--CJS-FY24CJSSubcommitteeMark.pdf">government funding bills</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWhy does this document create such anger? The answer is that it is an attempt to return antitrust back to the rule of law, and away from the corporate revolution of the 1980s.\n</blockquote>\nIf Larry Summers, big law firms and House Republicans are all foaming at the mouth, it has to be a good idea, right?<br />\n<br />\nSo what are the <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-guidelines-and-overthrowing?">guidelines</a>?<br />\n<blockquote>\nThese guidelines help instruct the courts how to interpret a complicated area of law. One problem is that successive versions of merger guidelines since 1982 have told judges that most mergers are good. I’m not kidding, or exaggerating. Here’s a sentence from the most recent version of these guidelines, written in 2010: “<i>A primary benefit of mergers to the economy is their potential to generate significant efficiencies and thus enhance the merged firm’s ability and incentive to compete, which may result in lower prices, improved quality, enhanced service, or new products</i>.”<br />\n<br />\nThat’s… the opposite of the Clayton Act. The 2010 guidelines, like those written in 1982, basically said that large mergers where rivals bought one another were illegal, but everything else was fine. What’s also astonishing is that these guidelines cited no legal precedent, but were merely guesses from economists using unwieldy and speculative tools. It was a priesthood selling indulgences, with no basis in the underlying text.\n</blockquote>\nThe <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-ftc-seek-comment-draft-merger-guidelines">thirteen principles</a> are:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Mergers should not significantly increase concentration in highly concentrated markets;</li>\n<li>Mergers should not eliminate substantial competition between firms;</li>\n<li>Mergers should not increase the risk of coordination;</li>\n<li>Mergers should not eliminate a potential entrant in a concentrated market;</li>\n<li>Mergers should not substantially lessen competition by creating a firm that controls products or services that its rivals may use to compete;</li>\n<li>Vertical mergers should not create market structures that foreclose competition;</li>\n<li>Mergers should not entrench or extend a dominant position;</li>\n<li>Mergers should not further a trend toward concentration;</li>\n<li>When a merger is part of a series of multiple acquisitions, the agencies may examine the whole series;</li>\n<li>When a merger involves a multi-sided platform, the agencies examine competition between platforms, on a platform, or to displace a platform;</li>\n<li>When a merger involves competing buyers, the agencies examine whether it may substantially lessen competition for workers or other sellers;</li>\n<li>When an acquisition involves partial ownership or minority interests, the agencies examine its impact on competition; and</li>\n<li>Mergers should not otherwise substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly;</li>\n</ol>\nSome of these are critical for technology markets:<br />\n<ol>\n<li value=4>"eliminate a potential entrant" is a frequent problem. One popular technique is to spot a "potential entrant" at an early stage and do an "acquihire" to prevent their talent from creating a viable competitor. Mark Zuckerberg wasn''t exactly clear about this motivation when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Meta_Platforms">he said</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn order to have a really entrepreneurial culture one of the key things is to make sure we''re recruiting the best people. One of the ways to do this is to focus on acquiring great companies with great founders\n</blockquote>\nAll but a few of Zuckerberg''s currently 100 acquisitions are in this category. Failing to do this soon enough can get very expensive; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Meta_Platforms">Instagram cost him $1B</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Meta_Platforms">WhatsApp cost him $19B</a>.</li>\n<li value=7>"entrench or extend a dominant position", as for example Facebook''s acquisition of Imstagram and WhatsApp did. Microsoft''s massive investment in OpenAI and acquisition of Activision are other examples. In an environment of strong economies of scale firms dominating one area should definitely not be allowed to use their monopoly rents to buy dominance in another.</li>\n<li value=10>"a multi-sided platform" such as Google, which sits between advertisers and web sites, or Amazon, which sits between suppliers and potential customers, has an inherent conflict of interest. In finance, regulators ensure that exchanges, which perform a similar function, cannot trade in their own marketplace. Amazon, by contrast, owns and sells hundreds of brands that are typically clones of products that others have successfuly sold on Amazon. Google''s search engine, which itself sells ads, goes to extraordinary lengths to dissuade visitors from going to the Web sites it indexes, which earn money by showing their visitors ads from Google.</li>\n</ol>\nStoller stresses the importance of <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-guidelines-and-overthrowing?">public participation</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nNow, here’s where you come in. Two days ago, I asked a question to Antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter at a Federalist Society event about the role of public comments in this process, and he said that hearing from the public is incredibly important in helping the agencies understand how markets actually work. Thousands of people chimed in a year and a half ago, including doctors, writers, truck drivers, nurses, and software programmers. Now it’s time to do it again. These guidelines are in draft form, they will be finalized soon.<br />\n<br />\nThere are 60 days to give our feedback. The government has set up <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2023-0043-0001">a site</a> on Regulations.gov where you can tell them about your experience with mergers, or offer thoughts on antitrust law, mergers, big business, or unfair methods of business.\n</blockquote>\nSo, please use the opportunity to submit comments to recount your experience with dominant companies, and how the revised merger guidlines would improve matters. I am considering what I should submit, and will update this post when I have decided.<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-07-25 15:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:30','read');

Holders with immediate liquidity demands have an incentive (or first-mover advantage) to rush to sell in the secondary market before the supply of tokens from other liquidity-seekers picks up.

Their market capitalization has grown exponentially over the last couple of years, from $5 billion in 2019 to around $180 billion in 2022. Notwithstanding their name, however, stablecoins can be very unstable: between May 1 and May 16, 2022, there was a run on stablecoins, with their circulation decreasing by 15.58 billion and their market capitalization dropping by $25.63 billion (see charts below.) In this post, we describe the different types of stablecoins and how they keep their peg, compare them with money market funds—a similar but much older and more regulated financial product, and discuss the stablecoin run of May 2022. \n</blockquote>\nTheir three types of stablecoins are:<br />\n<ul>\n<li><b>Asset-backed coins</b>, which they <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/07/runs-on-stablecoins/">describe thus</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nStablecoins backed by traditional financial assets resemble the structure of money market mutual funds (MMFs). Users can mint new coins by depositing dollars with the issuer. When users want to withdraw their dollars, they send their stablecoins back to the issuer, who returns dollars to users’ bank accounts.\n</blockquote>\nAt least in the case of USDT, this isn''t actually true, as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a9a0bf66-9232-4980-8ac5-e6d6b8f1cb75">Bryce Elder noted</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n Tether’s closed-shop redemption mechanism means it cannot be viewed like a money-market fund. Processing delays can happen without explanation, there’s a 0.1 per cent conversion fee, and the facility is only available to verified customers cashing out at least $100,000. \n</blockquote>\n"Processing delays can happen without explanation" may be an understatement. IIRC Tether''s terms of service mean they don''t actually have to permit withdrawals at all.<br />\n<br />\nThe need for a custodian to hold the reserve assets backing these coins means that they cannot be decentralized.\n</li>\n<li><b>Crypto-backed coins</b> such as DAI, which they <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/07/runs-on-stablecoins/">describe thus</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nDAI, for instance, can be backed by Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the decentralized, open-source blockchain Ethereum. In order for the peg to be credible, every dollar of DAI is backed by more than one dollar worth of Ether ... In order to mint DAI, an investor deposits the collateral in the smart contract; in order to redeem DAI, the investor deposits the DAI in the smart contract and receives back the collateral. Importantly, if the value of the collateral drops below the minimum collateralization level required by the contract, any user can call a function on the contract to liquidate the collateral through an auction and receive a percentage of the collateral as a reward. ...

Any investor in Terra had access to a smart contract that allowed them to create or redeem one unit of UST for one dollar worth of Luna. For instance, if the price of Luna was $10, the smart contract would exchange one Terra for 0.1 units of Luna. Therefore, irrespective of the price of Luna—as long as it was greater than zero—the value of UST should  have been $1 due to an arbitrage opportunity.\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAnadu <i>et al</i>''s <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/07/runs-on-stablecoins/">focus is on runs in algorithmic coins</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTerra redemptions increased the supply of Luna. As the price of Luna dropped due to the increase in its supply, each dollar redeemed out of Terra triggered an even greater increase of the supply of Luna. For instance, if Luna traded at $0.1, redeeming one unit of Terra would create ten units of Luna; but if Luna dropped to $0.01, redeeming one unit of Terra would create 100 units of Luna. At some point, investors would be unwilling to buy Terra even if its price dropped below $1 because it would be backed by an asset, Luna, whose price was rapidly declining.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2re5pELru0-kvq4FgZP6U7uzxv5y0ppb-CFlVPtkYW3FhVgoMkhC1EXc4-0MODtzm500CUT_MR3x8Fw7Gfr2oAflQjhE5anBpeCC7bSgloLaA5rQh-UkVuHkh7_4LtZ28ZEf0LE5P-91B2ZYVUvbJRsuK7l_frU0pzCpKeHFFTOQSWWYfPR7-MJmLll0-/s966/ChangeIn1H22.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="685" data-original-width="966" height="142" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2re5pELru0-kvq4FgZP6U7uzxv5y0ppb-CFlVPtkYW3FhVgoMkhC1EXc4-0MODtzm500CUT_MR3x8Fw7Gfr2oAflQjhE5anBpeCC7bSgloLaA5rQh-UkVuHkh7_4LtZ28ZEf0LE5P-91B2ZYVUvbJRsuK7l_frU0pzCpKeHFFTOQSWWYfPR7-MJmLll0-/w200-h142/ChangeIn1H22.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/07/runs-on-stablecoins/">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nExactly that is what <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/07/runs-on-stablecoins/">happened</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAs Terra suffered heavy redemptions, the supply of Luna increased from 365 million units on May 9, to more than 6 trillion units by May 13.

U.S.-based stablecoins backed by traditional safe financial assets, however, such as USDC and BUSD, received significant inflows during the same period as investors moved from riskier stablecoins to less risky ones.

And nothing else: no cache, no FPU.</p><p>The FPU was a discrete part, the 80387DX.</p><p>Because  OS/2 1.x didn''t support the 80386, and so couldn''t run DOS apps well,  and so flopped, the 16-bit 80286 kept selling well. It ran DOS fast and  it could run Windows 2/286 and Windows 3 in Standard Mode which was good  enough. It could only address 16MB of RAM but that was fantastically  expensive <i>and</i> it was more than enough for DOS and Windows 3.</p><p>So,  because DOS still ruled, Intel made a cost-reduced version of the  80386DX, the 80386SX. This had a 16-bit data bus, so it could use  cheaper 16-bit motherboards and 16-bit wide RAM, still limited to a max  of 16MB. Still enough.</p><p>That needed a maths copro for hardware floating point, too: a different part, the 80387SX.</p><p>Then  Windows 3 came along, which was also good enough, and started a move in  PC apps to GUIs. Windows 3.1 (1992) was better still.</p><p>So Intel  had a 2nd go at the 32-bit chip market with the 80486, marketed as the  &quot;486&quot;. This integrated a better 386DX-compatible CPU core with a few  extra instructions, complete with MMU, <i>plus</i> a 387-style FPU, plus a small amount of L1 cache, all onto one die.</p><p>But it was expensive, and didn''t sell well.</p><p>Also,  all the 3rd party x86 makers leapt on the bandwagon and integrated the  extra instructions into 16-bit bus 386SX compatible chips and branded  them as 486s: the Cyrix and IBM &quot;486slc&quot; for instance. This ate into  sales of the real 486.</p><p>So Intel came up with an ethically very  dodgy borderline scam: it shipped 486s with the FPU disabled, calling  them the &quot;486DX&quot; to reuse the branding that distinguished the 32-bit-bus  models of 386 from the 16-bit-bus.</p><p>People don''t understand stuff like bus widths or part numbers, as your post demonstrates, and I mean no offense. They don''t.</p><p>So now there was a new model of 486, the 486SX with a disabled FPU, and the 486DX with it still turned on.</p><p>The  &quot;SX&quot; model needed a new motherboard with a 2nd CPU socket that accepted  a &quot;floating point co-processor&quot;, called the &quot;487&quot;, which was nothing of  the kind. The &quot;SX&quot; was a lie and so was the &quot;487 copro&quot;. The 487 was a  2nd complete 486 chip that disabled the original and took over.</p><p>But it reused the older branding, which is what you''ve remembered.</p><p>Later,  briefly, Intel made a cheaper cost-reduced 486SX with a smaller die  with no FPU present, but not many of them. The clock-doubled 486DX2 took  over quite quickly and killed the 486DX <i>and</i> 486SX market.</p><p>Some  commentators speculated that the 486DX vs 486SX marketing thing allowed  Intel to sell defective 486s in which the FPU didn''t work but if it did  that was a tiny tiny number: a rounding error.</p><div class="reply"><p><font size="1">                       </font></p></div></span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=89795" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2023-11-15 10:51:34','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/89370.html','Anti-aliasing and subpixel allocation and how it''s all going away','There used to be multiple ways to try to smooth out text on screen. Most are no longer relevant.<br /><br />XP&nbsp;used several such methods quite heavily, such as font antialiasing and hinting.<br /><br />1. Font antialiasing: using grey pixels that are not 100% on/off to soften the edges of screen fonts on portions of letters that are not vertical or horizontal, and therefore are stepped (&quot;aliased&quot;). First OS to do this was Acorn RISC OS in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s Windows started to catch up using greyscale pixels.<br /><br />2. Subpixel allocation (used heavily in Windows in the 20x0s). This takes advantage of knowledge of the display screen type, acquired through more sophisticated (that is, bigger and slower) display systems. Pixels are not 1 colour dot. They are a group of a red dot, a green dot, and a blue dot, working together.<br /><br />CRT displays used triangular or other shaped grids of R/G/B pixels. Sony Trinitron CRTs used stripes of R/G/B pixels because their [shadow mask](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask</a>) was a grille not a grid of holes. The then-new active matrix colour LCDs have R/G/B pixels turned on and off individually (that''s what &quot;active matrix&quot; means, 1 transistor per pixel, as opposed to 1 transistor per rows and 1 per column, where the intersection goes on or off).<br /><br />Subpixel allocation is antialiasing using R, G and B pixels where the arrangement of the individual colour pixels is known to the renderer. It is colour antialiasing but it doesn''t work right if, for example, the pixels are:<br /><br />`R B G`<br /><br />But the renderer thinks they are <br /><br />`B R G`<br /><br />3. Running displays at non-native resolutions used to break this. CRTs do not have a single fixed native res. LCDs all do. Standard definition (SD) LCDs have, for example, 1024&times;768 pixels, or 1280&times;1024. Later, hi-def (HD) ones have more than you can easily see, e.g. my iMac''s 2nd screen is 2560&times;1440 pixels on a 27&quot; LCD. You''d often run this at 1.5&times; or so zoom<br /><br />Now, HiDPI displays have way more than even that. My iMac''s built in screen is 27&quot; but 5120&times;2880. <br /><br />You can''t use a HiDPI (&quot;retina&quot;) screen at its native res: letters would be too small to see. They always run at 2&times; or 2.5&times; or even weird ratios like 3.33&times;. <br /><br />There is no longer a linear relationship between pixels the display has and pixels you see, because they''re too small to see any more. So it''s OK to have a resolution that means 6 pixels per dot in places and 7 in others because you can''t see individual pixels except with a [hand lens](<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/a-brief-guide-to-hand-lenses">https://extension.psu.edu/a-brief-guide-to-hand-lenses</a>) so you don''t see fringing and aliasing.<br /><br />It is meaningful to talk about having no subpixel smoothing or hinting on an SD screen where you can see pixels, but it''s all more or less gone away now, because it''s all programmatically curves on pixel-oriented displays where there are no visible pixels any more. <br /><br />Ever since the iPhone 6 series, AFAIK, iOS devices *never* run at 1:1&nbsp; native res _or_ 1:x ratios. The actual display res is almost unrelated to the lower res the OS runs the screen at and there''s never a linear relationship between logical display pixels and actual hardware screen dots.<br /><br />So the 1990s stuff about antialiasing has gone away now. At a microscopic scale it''s all blurred out but the blurring is at such a small scale the human eye can''t see it. So the OS UI options to turn on greyscale antialiasing or RGB subpixel allocation have gone away.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=89370" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2023-10-30 11:33:05','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

I think this might have been the first review of a machine preinstalled with Linux from a major manufacturer in the UK.</em><br /><br />EXCLUSIVE</p><p>Linux&rsquo;s growing popularity gets a boost as Dell entrusts its latest high-end workstation to the OS.</p><p>A sure sign of Linux&rsquo;s growing popularity is that vendors are starting to offer it as a pre-installed OS. Until recently, this has largely been confined to specialist Linux system builders such as Penguin Computing, Digital Networks UK or the large US company VA Linux Computing. Now, though, mainstream corporate vendors are starting to preload Linux and Dell is one of the first to deliver.</p><p>The Precision Workstation 420 is a high-end workstation system. The midi-tower case can be opened without tools and internal components, such as the PSU and drive cage, can be released with latches and swung out on hinges for access to thei840-based motherboard. This supports dual Pentium III processors running at up to 1GHz and up to four RIMMs; the review machine had two 64MB modules for 128MB of dual-channel RDRAM.</p><p>The highly-integrated motherboard includes Cirrus Logic sound, 3Com Fast Ethernet and Adaptec Ultra2 Wide LVD SCSI controllers. The only expansion card fitted is a Diamond nVidia TNT2 32MB graphics adaptor driving a flat-screen 19in Dell UltraScan Trinitron monitor, leaving the four 32-bit PCI slots and one PCI/RAID port free.</p><p>Internal components include an 866M Hz Pentium III with a 133MHz front-side bus (FSB) and full-core-speed 256KB secondary cache, an 18GB Quantum Atlas Ultra2 SCSI hard disk, LiteOn 48-speed ATAPI CD and an ATAPI Iomega Zip250 drive.</p><p>It is certainly a powerful and expandable high-end workstation with very few corners cut. However, all-SCSI storage might be more preferable and the 3D card, while ideal for gamers, is somewhat wasted in business use.</p><p>However, the real interest lies in the operating system installed: Red Hat Linux 6.1. (Since this machine was supplied, Dell has upgraded this to Red Hat 6.2.) When appropriately configured with a GUI desktop, Linux isn&rsquo;t much harder to use than Windows or any other graphical OS; the hardest part is often getting it installed. Buying a pre-configured system is therefore attractive, as the vendor does this for you, but what matters is how well the job is done.</p><p>The system boots into the Linux loader, LILO, offering a choice of kernels &mdash; the default multiprocessor one and one for single-processor machines. Choosing either takes you straight into X and the GNOME login screen. There&rsquo;s only one pre-configured user account, <code>root</code>, with no password. Logging in as root reveals a standard GNOME default desktop, but with Dell-logo wallpaper. The installation is largely a default Red Hat one with some minor tweaks, such as the AfterStep window manager offered as an alternative to Enlightenment.</p><p>Most of the system&rsquo;s hardware was correctly configured. XFree86 was correctly set up for the graphics card with a default resolution of 1,024 x 768, the SCSI controller, Ethernet, Zip and CD-ROM devices were all configured, and TCP/IP was set to auto-configure itself using DHCP. Red Hat&rsquo;s <code>linuxconf</code> tool made it easy to check and adjust the various parameters, and a Dell directory of drivers and basic documentation was provided on the hard disk to accompany a slim paper manual introducing Red Hat Linux. One area where Linux is more complex than Windows is disk partitioning. Dell has chosen sensible settings: a 20M B boot partition close to the start of the drive, a 5GB (root) partition, 2GB <code>/home</code> and 10GB <code>/usr</code> volumes, plus 128MB of swap space (larger for machines with more memory).</p><p>There were some niggles, though. The mount point for the Zip drive was created as a symbolic link instead of a directory, which had to be corrected before the Zip drive could be used, and the GNOME desktop icon for the CD-ROM drive didn&rsquo;t work correctly.</p><p>As Red Hat doesn&rsquo;t support the onboard CS4614 sound chip, the machine was mute; a SoundBlaster Live will be fitted if the customer requests sound capabilities.</p><p>Although it&rsquo;s the most popular distribution in the US, Red Hat is quite spartan, with few added extras, but we tried popular programs such as StarOffice, WordPerfect 8 and VMware without a hitch. Internet access was easily configured, too. Dell also bundles 90 days&rsquo; free phone and email support through LinuxCare alongside the three-year on-site warranty.</p><p>The system has some teething problems, although they aren&rsquo;t critical and as shipped it was usable - but they would require some Linux expertise to repair. Once these are smoothed out, though, this will be an excellent high- specification Linux workstation.</p><p>LIAM PROVEN</p><p>DETAILS</p><p>★★★★</p><p>PRICE &pound;3,053.83 (&pound;2,599 exVAT)</p><p>CONTACT Dell 0870 152 4699</p><p>www.dell.co.uk<br />&nbsp;</p><p>PROS Well-built, high-specification hardware; reasonable Linux configuration</p><p>CONS Some rough edges to Linux configuration; no sound support; no ISA slots</p><p>OVERALL A good first try.

A very small Linux distro, tailored to talk to VirtIO devices and to net-mount all its filesystems over 9P. No `initrd`, because we know exactly what the virtual hardware will be in advance. Maybe some tiny simple init like tini: <br /><a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini">https://github.com/krallin/tini</a> <br /><br /> Boot, run the binary supplied on the command line, when it exits quit. <br /><br /> 2. Plan 9''s VM, vmx, cut down even further to make a microVM. <br /><br /> <a href="https://9lab.org/plan9/virtualisation/">https://9lab.org/plan9/virtualisation/</a> <br /><br />   3. Some tool that lets you start a Linux binary and spawns a microVM to run it, with the current working directory your current dir in the Plan9 FS. <br /><br />  `lxrun strings foo` <br /><br /> MicroVM starts, loads `strings`, supplies it with `foo` as input, outputs to your `rc` session -- just like starting a VM with Vagrant on Linux: disk chugs, and suddenly you''re SSHed into some totally different distro _in the same terminal session_. <br /><br /> If the app is graphical it could attach to X11 or Equis: <br /><br /> <a href="https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/x11_installation/index.html">https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/x11_installation/index.html</a> <br /><br /> The root idea: provide something much simpler and easier than the existing Linux-emulation tools out there -- which are very much a Thing, but are _hard_ and don''t work terribly well -- but with much the same end result. <br /><br /> Examples:<br /><br />  &bull; the FreeBSD Linuxulator: <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/Linuxulator">https://wiki.freebsd.org/Linuxulator</a><br /><br />   &bull; the SCO `lxrun` tool: <a href="http://download.nust.na/pub3/solaris/intel/7/lxrun/lxrun.html">http://download.nust.na/pub3/solaris/intel/7/lxrun/lxrun.html</a><br /><br />  &bull; Solaris lx zones: <a href="https://docs.huihoo.com/opensolaris/solaris-containers-resource-management-and-solaris-zones/html/p99.html">https://docs.huihoo.com/opensolaris/solaris-containers-resource-management-and-solaris-zones/html/p99.html</a><br /><br />I just found out that there _is_ a Linux emulator for Plan 9 -- Linuxemu: <a href="http://9p.io/wiki/plan9/Linux_emulation/index.html">http://9p.io/wiki/plan9/Linux_emulation/index.html</a> <br /><br />So, a Plan 9 &quot;Linuxulator&quot; exists, but this might still be easier, more current, and need less work.   In other words, make a Plan 9 setup that you can use like a Linux distro, to encourage Linux folks to try it and maybe move over.  TBH if I could run Waterfox and Chrome or Epiphany, plus a Markdown editor, I could do most of my job right there. <br /><br /> Is this absurd, or is it fairly doable? <br /><br /> I daresay the Plan 9 fans would regard this as heresy or simply incomprehensible, but they''re not the target audience. People who like minimal terminal-driven Linux distros are. <br /><br /> As for _why_... well, my impression is that in many ways Plan 9 is a better Unix than Unix... but it''s not better _enough_ to have driven adoption. As a result, it still has a _lot_ of rough edges, and in that, it reminds me of mid-1990s Linux: weird, cryptic, and _hard_. <br /><br /> Qubes OS is a thing: keep your system safe by running everything in a different VM. It''s hard and it''s complicated and most people are not that worried.  But what if you put a better OS underneath?<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=89039" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2023-09-08 18:34:01','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

(Frameworks, supporting libraries,  deployment costs, whatever. E.g. it''s very cheap to deploy Javascript  because all you need is a reasonably modern browser, and those are free  and almost all OSes have them.)</p><p>Those are the externalities, in a manner of speaking.</p><p>But the other side of the answer is the inside: the area, not the shape.</p><p>The mainstream, conventional, software industry is huge, and hugely lucrative.</p><p>Writing  just-barely-good-enough apps, minimum viable products, gets you out  there and making money. Then you can put a share of your revenues into  incrementally improving it.</p><p>Every now and then you can push out a  big new version, with disruptive changes. You can charge for getting the  new major releases, but more to the point, once an old version is  officially obsolete, you can charge for continued fixes to the  now-obsolete versions.</p><p>It makes money. It''s an ecosystem, a food  chain or more accurately a web. Some  members are predators, some are  prey, but they all work together and if you just eliminate either  predators or prey, the system collapses.</p><p>In other words:</p><p>Most  people use the tools most people use, because most people use them,  because you can make big money from volume of cheap junk.</p><p>But  there is another model of making and selling stuff: make small volumes  of really good products, using highly skilled workers, and sell those  high-quality products in very small volumes but for very high prices, to  discerning customers who know they''re buying something built to last  and who may not come back to you for new versions every couple of years,  but that''s fine if you made a couple of decades'' revenue from them on  the original sale.</p><p>Because cars are a long standing metaphor in computers and computing:</p><p>If  you have a mass market for cars, then you get cheap cars, and  everyone''s cars are much the same because they are built down to a price  and mass produced.</p><p>These car consumers can be upsold some extra  buttons and minor features, and a lot of those combined may double the  price of the car.</p><p>(This is how different Linux distros survive.  Some have more buttons. Some have A/C. Some are fully automatic, others  have fully manual controls. Some have power steering, some don''t.)</p><p>But  such a market also supports hand-made sports cars (and, inevitably,  superficially similar cheaper sports cars from the mass-producers). It  also supports vast tanklike cars that weigh as much as 10 normal cars,  but produce 10x the engine power of those cars so they still perform.</p><p>Very  different products, but they cost an order of magnitude more than the  mass-produced cars... and do the same job. Some owners of mass-produced  cars aspire to own fancy sports cars, and some aspire to own luxury  behemoths. Most never will.</p><p>People who don''t care much for cars  and just see them as a tool for getting from A to B do not see why  anyone would pay for fancier cars. That''s OK, too.</p><p>Some people  live in other countries and see more clearly, because for them trains  and bicycles are a perfectly viable way of getting from A to B, and are  both cleaner, healthier, use less resources and create less waste.</p><p>Tools  like Lisp are the artisanal hand-made cars compared to the mass market.  People who''ve never used anything but cheap mass-produced tin boxes  can''t even imagine that there are things that are <i>so much</i> better, let alone that in the long run, you might be better off using them.</p><p>As Terry Pratchett put it:</p><p>&laquo; &ldquo;The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.</p><p>Take  boots, for example. He earned $38 a month plus allowances. A really  good pair of leather boots cost $50. But an affordable pair of boots,  which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when  the cardboard gave out, cost about $10. Those were the kind of boots  Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could  tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the  cobbles.</p><p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and  years. A man who could afford $50 had a pair of boots that''d still be  keeping his feet dry in ten years'' time, while the poor man who could  only afford cheap boots would have spent a $199 on boots in the same  time and would still have wet feet.</p><p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes ''Boots'' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.&rdquo;  &raquo;</p><p>Some of us live in countries with really good public transport,  and know that it''s possible to replace the entire category of personal  automobiles with something better for everyone...</p><p>But try telling that to an American. They won''t even try to understand; they will instead earnestly explain why <i>they</i> need cars, and their country is better because everyone has cars.</p><p>More wild generalisation:</p><p>In  the late 20th century, there was another model of software  construction, an alternative to the &quot;Worse is better&quot; model. The WIB  model is that one type of software fits all, and build one (or a very  few) minimum viable operating systems, from minimal viable programming  languages, and make them cheap or give them away for free.</p><p>The  artisanal software model was more common in Europe and Japan: pick the  best language for the job, and build tiny bespoke OSes for each category  of device. Have multiple whole incompatible families of desktop OSes,  and families of totally different unrelated server OSes, and families of  different OSes for handhelds and games consoles and school computers  for teaching kids, and so on.</p><p>Unify them, minimally, with some  standard formats: network protocols, disk and file formats, maybe some  quite similar programming languages in lots of weird little nonstandard  dialects.</p><p>iTron, RISC OS, SiBO/EPOC/EPOC32/Symbian, QDOS/Minerva/SMSQe, Con-Tiki, Symbos, GEOS, Novell Netware.</p><p>Keep  the complexity are the market level, in which multiple radically  different products compete for sales in their market segments. Lots of  overlap, lots of duplication... but also competition, evolution,  rivalry, advancement.</p><p>The software remains small and relatively  simple. This aids development, but mainly, it keeps the resource  requirements low, so the devices are cheaper. Human brainpower is cheap:  spend it on clever software to enable cheap hardware.</p><p>The  approach I am calling WIB is of vast general-purpose OSes which can do  anything, so you only need a handful of them... but you need massive  hardware to run it, so devices powered by WIB software are expensive,  and very complicated, and the software is vastly complicated, so you  need armies of programmers to maintain it, meaning frequent updates, so  you need lots of storage and fast connections.</p><p>And there is no overview, because it''s much too big to fit into a single human head, so improvement is incremental, not radical.</p><p>The  end result is a handful of vast monoliths, full of holes and leaks, but  a vast economic machine that generates continuous income and lots of  jobs.</p><p>When you live in one of these monoliths, the fact that there  are happy accomplished people working in weird tools making weird  little products for tiny markets seems incomprehensible. Why would they?</p><p>Most  people use the standard tools, meaning the ones most people use. So  obviously they are good enough: look at these trillion-dollar  corporations that use them!</p><p>So obviously, there isn''t really any point to the weirdoes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></span><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=88750" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2023-07-01 12:50:13','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');
INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://liam-on-linux.dreamwidth.org/88538.html','Evaluating Plan 9 (and Inferno)','[Repurposed HN comments. May grow into an article. Saving for my own reference.]<br /><br />There are a lot of things in Plan 9 which are not improvements over conventional Unix... b<span class="commtext c00">ut it seems to me that this is partly  because it''s stuck in its tiny little niche and never got the rough  edges worn down by exposure to millions.<p>I was a support guy, <i>not</i>  a programmer. I started Unixing on SCO Xenix and later dabbled in AIX  and Solaris, and they were all painful experiences with so many rough  edges that I found them really unpleasant to use.</p><p>Linux in the 1990s was, too. Frankly WinNT was a much more pleasant experience.</p><p>But  while Win2K was pleasant, XP was a bloated mess of themes and mandatory  uninstallable junk like Movie Maker. So I switched to Linux and found  that, 5-6 years after I first tried Slackware and RHL and other early  distros with 0.x or 1.0 kernels, it was much more polished now.</p><p>By a few years later, the experience <i>for non-programmers</i>  was pretty good. It uses bold and underline and italics and colour and  ANSI block characters, right in the terminal, because it assumes you''re  using a PC, while the BSDs still don''t because you might be on a dumb  terminal or a VAX or a SPARCstation or something. (!)</p><p>Linux just  natively supports the cursor keys. It supports up and down and  command-line editing, the way Windows does, the way PC folk <i>expect</i>. BSD doesn''t do this, or very poorly.</p><p>Linux  just natively supports plain old DOS/Windows style partitions, whereas  BSD did arcane stuff involving &quot;slices&quot; inside its own special primary  partitions. (GPT finally banishes this.)</p><p>I''ve taken this up with the FreeBSD and OpenBSD devs, and they just plain do not understand what my problem is.</p><p>But this process of going mainstream on mainstream hardware polished the raw Unix experience -- and it was <i>very</i> raw in the 1990s.  Linux from the 2nd decade of the 21st century onwards got refined into something much less painful to use on</p><p>Plan 9 never got that. It still revels in its 1990s-Unix weirdness.</p><p>If  Plan 9 went mainstream somehow, as a lightweight Kubernetes replacement  say, it would soon get a lot of that weirdness eroded off. The purists  would hate it, of course, just as BSD purists still don''t much like  Linux today.</p><p>Secondly, Plan 9 did a tonne of cleaning up the C  language, especially (AFAICT) after it dropped Alef. No includes that  contain other includes is obvious and sensible and takes orders of  magnitude off compilation times. That rarely gets mentioned.</p><p>The  other vital thing to remember is that despite 9front (and HarveyOS and  Jeanne and so on), Plan 9 was not the end of its line.</p><p>After Plan 9 came Inferno.</p><p>I have played around with both and just by incorporating late-1990s GUI standardisation into its UI, Inferno is <i>much</i> more usable than Plan 9 is.</p><p>Plan 9 made microkernels and loosely-couple clustering systems obsolete &gt;25y ago.</p><p>A  decade or so later, Inferno made native code compilation and runtime  VMs and bytecode and all that horrible inefficient 1980s junk obsolete.  It obsoleted WASM, 2 decades before WASM was invented.</p><p>With Plan 9, all the machines on your network <i>with the same CPU architecture</i> were parts of your machine if you wanted.</p><p>(A  modernised one should embed a VM and a dramatically cut-down Linux  kernel so it can run text-only Linux binaries in system containers, and  spawn them on other nodes around the network. Inelegant as all get-out,  but would make it 100x more useful.)</p><p>But with Inferno, the  restrictions of CPU architecture went away too. The dream of Tao Group''s  Taos/Intent/Elate, and AmigaDE, delivered, real, and FOSS.</p><p>When considering Plan 9, also consider Inferno. It fixed some of the issues. It smoothed off some of the rough edges.</p><p>I  feel, maybe wrongly, that there could be some mileage in somehow  merging the two of them together into one. Keep Plan 9 C and native code  <i>as an option</i> for all-X86-64 or all-Arm64 clusters. Otherwise, by default, compile to Dis. Maybe replace Limbo with Go.<br /><br />-----<br /><br /><span class="commtext c00">It doesn''t <i>need</i> cgroups or containers,  because every process has its own namespace, its own view of the  network-global filesystem, so everything is in a container by default.</span></p><p>It doesn''t <i>need</i>  a microkernel, because the concept of microkernels is to split a big  monolithic kernel into lots of small simple &quot;servers&quot; running in user  space, and have them communicate by passing messages over a defined  communications protocol, some kind of RPC type thing. It works, and QNX  is the existence proof. <i>But</i> it''s really hard and it''s really inefficient -- of which, the HURD and Minix 3 are the existence proofs.</p><p>So  most of the actual working &quot;microkernel&quot; OSes kludge it by embedding a  huge in-kernel &quot;Unix server&quot; that negates the entire microkernel concept  but delivers compatibility and performance. Apple macOS and iOS are the  existence proof here. (It could be argued that Windows NT 4 and later  are also examples.)</p><p>Plan 9 achieves the same result, without the difficulties, <i>by default</i> by having most things user space processes and communicating via the filesystem.</p><p><span class="commtext c00"><div class="reply"><p><font size="1">                       </font></p></div></span></p><p><br />Disclaimer: this is my very rudimentary understanding. I am not an expert on Plan 9 by any means.<br /><br />------<br /><br />In general, what I am getting at is that  Unix is a (?) uniquely weird situation that happens to have grown like  Kudzu. It''s an early generation of a long running project, where that  early generation caught on and became massive and thus ignores simple  but profound improvements from later versions <i>of the same project</i>.<p>And  since in that ecosystem, almost everything is built on a foundation of  C, problems with C affect everything layered on top... even though they  do not in any other ecosystem. But something like 99% of inhabitants of  the ecosystem are not even aware that other ecosystems even exist, let  alone knowing anything about them.</p><p>If they know of any, it''s macOS  or Windows. macOS is also UNIX, and modern Windows is NT, which is  Windows built with Unix tools and a Unix type design... so they are not  really different at all.</p><p>So what I am getting at is that Plan 9  has aspects other than the namespaces and the cosmetic aspects of the  design. It makes changes to the language and how it''s compiled that are  just as important, and hacks to gain some of that on modern versions of  the parent OS family are not of comparable significance.</p><p>Famous quote:</p><p>&lt;&lt;</p><p>So...  the best way to compare programming languages is by analogy to cars.  Lisp is a whole family of languages, and can be broken down  approximately as follows:</p><p>* Scheme is an exotic sports car. Fast. Manual transmission. No radio.</p><p>* Emacs Lisp is a 1984 Subaru GL 4WD: &quot;the car that''s always in front of you.&quot;</p><p>* Common Lisp is Howl''s Moving Castle.</p><p>&gt;&gt;</p><p>Comparison:  if somehow you make a pruned-down Howl''s Moving Castle, you can  probably never ever, whatever you do, no matter how much effort you  invest, make it into something as small and light as the Subaru, let  alone the sports car.</p><p>In more detail:</p><p>Let''s imagine one team invented first the train, then the bicycle, then the car.</p><p>The  bicycle takes the idea of a wheeled vehicle from the train but reduces  it down to an incredibly minimal version. It needs no fuel, just 2  wheels, but it is very simple, very light, and can go almost anywhere.</p><p>Although  you do need 1 per passenger, it''s true, whereas a single carriage train  can carry 100 people, you can make 100 bicycles for those 100 people  with fewer materials than that 1 train, even excluding consideration of  the rails etc.</p><p>If someone still making trains looked at bicycles  and inspired by them came up with  a train with just 2 wheels, that  balanced or hung from the track, they do not get to claim that they have  successfully imported the simplicity of the bicycle.</p><p>They have  retained just one aspect and may have achieved savings in moving parts,  or slight reduction of complexity, or a slightly simpler machine... but  it''s still a train.</p><p>If you tweak  a conventional C compiler to not  waste time rereading text that has already been read once, or a disk  cache obviates it, then you have not caught up with the advance I am  trying to discuss here.</p><p>For clarity, this is not my original thinking. This idea is from a Go talk over a decade ago:</p><p><a href="https://go.dev/talks/2012/splash.article#TOC_5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://go.dev/talks/2012/splash.article#TOC_5</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p></span><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=88538" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2023-07-01 12:48:22','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

(The Inquirer, January 3 2007)','I thought this was gone forever, like the rest of the late lamented Inq, but I found a <a href="https://forum.amiga.org/index.php?topic=27363.0">copy</a>.<br /><br /><div><strong>The Amiga is dead. Long live the Amiga!</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=36685</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>AmigaOS 4 launches after last Amiga compatible dies</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>THE END OF 2006 brought good and bad news for nostalgic geeks.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>On the plus side, an unexpected Christmas pressie: on December 24, Amiga, Inc. released AmigaOS 4.0, the all-new PowerPC version of the classic 1980s operating system.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The bad news is rather more serious, though - just a month earlier, the only remaining PowerPC Amiga-compatible went out of production, as Genesi announced that it was ending production of the Pegasos.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So although there is, at long last, a new, modern version of the OS, there''s nothing to run it on. Bit of a snag, that.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But all isn''t lost. The first successor to the Pegasos, Efika, a low-end motherboard based on a PowerPC system-on-a-chip intended for the embedded market, is sampling and will be available Real Soon Now(TM). Genesi is also considering a more powerful high-end dual-core machine.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Just to complicate things, though, the AmigaOS 4 betas wouldn''t run on Pegasos hardware; the only machine the new OS would run on, the AmigaOne, has been out of production for years, and its creators, small British manufacturer Eyetech, have sold off their remaining stock of Amiga bits to Leaman Computing and left the business.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>What''s an Amiga and why should I care?<br /></em></div><div>Launched in 1985, the Amiga was the first multimedia personal computer. Based like the Mac on a Motorola 68000, it sported 4,096 colour graphics, multichannel digital stereo sound and a fully preemptively-multitasking operating system - in 512K. That''s kilobytes, not meg - 0.5MB of RAM and no hard disk. It''s hard to convey today how advanced this was, but ''85 is the same year that Windows 1.0 was released, when a top-end PC had an 80286, EGA graphics and could go &quot;beep&quot;. EGA means sixteen colours at 640x350. My last phone did better than that. Macs of the time offered 512x384 black and white pixels and one channel of sound.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Amiga dominated multimedia and graphics computing at the time. Babylon 5 was made possible because it used Amiga-generated special effects: cinematic quality at TV programme prices.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But even in today''s Windows-dominated world, it''s never gone away. The original 68000 OS continued development until 2000 - you can still buy version 3.9 from Haage &amp; Partner in Germany today. You''ll need a seriously-uprated Amiga though: recommended specs are a 68030 and 32MB of RAM. Do they think we''re made of money?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>Hang on - Amiga is still around?</em></div><div><br />Oh, yes. It never went away. But it''s had a rough time of it.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>After Commodore went bust in 1994, the Amiga line was sold off to Escom as that company expanded rapidly through multiple acquisitions - including that of British high-street electronics vendor Rumbelows. Escom grew too fast and went under in 1996, and Amiga was sold to Gateway. In 2000, a new company was set up by former Amiga employees Fleecy Moss and Bill McEwen, which licensed the name and rights from Gateway. The OS itself was sold off to KMOS, Inc. in 2003, which subsequently changed its name to Amiga, Inc.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Over the years, Amiga Inc. has tried several times to come up with a new product to recapture the Miggy magic.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The first effort was to be based on the Unix-like embedded OS QNX. It''s small, fast and highly efficient, but not very Amiga-like. Negotiations broke down, though since then, QNX has boasted a GUI and multimedia support. Then there was a plan based around the Linux kernel.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Then came AmigaAnywhere, based on Tao Group''s remarkable Intent OS. Intent is amazing, like Java on steroids: the entire OS and all apps are compiled for a nonexistent, generalised &quot;Virtual Processor&quot;. Code is translated for the actual CPU as it''s loaded from disk - no &quot;virtual machine&quot; involved. Complete binary compatibility across every supported marchitecture. It''s very clever, but it''s not got much to do with the original Amiga and the fans weren''t very interested.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Finally, Amiga Inc. came up with an idea to get the fans on board - a new, PowerPC-native version of the Amiga OS: AmigaOS 4. This would run on new PowerPC hardware, but look and feel like an updated version of classic AmigaOS and offer backwards compatibility. Amiga no longer had the manpower to develop this in-house, so the product was licensed to Hyperion, a games house specialising in ports of Windows games for Amiga, Mac and Linux.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>Pegasos: the IBM Amiga</em></div><div><br />The idea of moving to PowerPC came from Phase5, a German maker of accelerator cards for Amigas and Macs. Some of Phase5''s later Amiga accelerators, the Blizzard and Cyberstorm range, featured PowerPC processors and some nifty code to allow apps to be compiled for PowerPC but run on the 68K-based Amiga OS.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As the Amiga market withered, Phase5 went under, but a group of its former engineers set up bPlan GmbH. Amongst other products, bPlan agreed to license OS4 from Amiga and make PowerPC-based Amiga-compatibles.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Around the turn of the century, things were looking very bleak for Amiga and little progress was being made. Growing impatient, bPlan set up Genesi with the management of Thendic, a vendor of embedded and Point-Of-Sale equipment, and decided to go it alone. Genesi designed a new PowerPC-based desktop machine, Pegasos, based on OpenFirmware and IBM''s Common Hardware Reference Platform - the Mac/PC hybrid that was the basis of some of the last models of licensed Mac clones, which could even run the short-lived PowerPC version of Windows NT.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Pegasos was designed and built to run Morphos. This started out as an OS for Amigas with PowerPC accelerators and required the presence of classic 68000 AmigaOS. Genesi sponsored development of a stand-alone version of Morphos for the Pegasos. Rather than re-implementing AmigaOS from scratch, this uses an entirely new microkernel, Quark, which hosts an Amiga-compatible environment, ABox. Morphos looks like an updated AmigaOS, provides 68K emulation so that it can run cleanly-written Amiga apps. There''s also an emulator for code - like games - which hits the hardware directly.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Mark 1 Pegasos has problems due to the Articia northbridge chip, causing major arguments between Genesi and chipset designer MAI Logic. Despite production of a patch chip, &quot;April&quot;, the Pegasos I was quickly replaced by the Pegasos II with a different chipset.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>So what happened with AmigaOS 4, then?</em><br /><br />While Genesi worked on the Pegasos, Amiga made its own deal with MAI and announced a new range of PowerPC-based Amigas. The original plan was that the new machines would connect to an original Amiga 1200 or 4000 motherboard, allowing the Miggy''s custom chipset to be used - for compatibility with original Amiga apps. That didn''t pan out, so a simpler, all-new design was adopted based on MAI''s Teron motherboards. These were put into production by Eyetech as the AmigaOne.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The snag is that AmigaOS 4 wasn''t ready, so the AmigaOne shipped in 2002 with only Linux. The first public betas of OS4 followed 18 months later.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Unfortunately for Amiga, MAI went bankrupt, and unable to source bridge chips, Eyetech ended production of the AmigaOne in 2005. Only around 1,500 units were shipped.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So as of the end of 2006, AmigaOS 4.0 is finally complete, but there''s no currently-shipping hardware to run it on. It''s tiny, fast, can run clean classic Amiga apps and is compatible enough with the older version that veteran Amiga users - of which there were hundreds of thousands - will find it instantly familiar. But because Genesi and Amiga Inc. don''t exactly see eye to eye, OS4 won''t run on Pegasos - only on near-identical official Amiga hardware with Hyperion''s &quot;U-Boot&quot; firmware.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>And where''s the Pegasos gone?<br /><br /></em>Genesi realised that the Amiga market was not only a small one but potentially crowded, too, and changed the emphasis of the Pegasos II from being an Amiga-compatible to being an open PowerPC desktop machine running Linux - a course that''s brought it rather greater success. After Apple''s move to Intel processors, the Pegasos II-based Open Desktop Workstation is the main desktop PowerPC machine. But it still runs Morphos and thus Amiga apps.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Now, though, the ODW is the latest victim of RoHS - the Reduction of Hazardous Substances legislation that amongst other things compels European manufacturers to use only lead-free solder. It''s hit minority platforms particularly hard and the sad result is the end of Pegasos'' flight.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>The future</em></div><div><br />PowerPC was - and is - the main alternative workstation CPU to x86. Indeed, with the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft XBox 360 and Sony Playstation 3 all based on PowerPC derivatives, sales prospects for PowerPC are looking great, despite Apple defecting to Intel processors.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The story of the Amiga isn''t over. The successor to Pegasos II has been announced: the Efika. This is a tiny low-end motherboard based on a PowerPC 5200 system-on-a-chip. It''s not fast, but it''s small, cheap, quiet and cool-running with extremely low power requirements. It''s being described as ideal for use in tough or constrained environments, such as Third World education.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Amiga Inc. has also announced a similar product, codenamed &quot;Samantha&quot;: again, a small-form-factor, highly-integrated system based around the PPC5200 SoC.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Either way, PowerPC Amigas are interesting machines. Sure, they can run Linux, from Yellow Dog to Ubuntu or Fedora, or even Gentoo if you''re masochistic enough. But running Morphos or OS4 they show their real power. These tiny, elegant OSs occupy a few dozen meg of disk space, run happily in 128MB RAM and boot to their graphical desktops in seconds. Both are very fast and relatively full-featured, Internet-capable OSs, fully buzzword-compliant from MP3 to USB. Finally, they share a library of thousands of high-quality apps from the 1980s and 1990s and a lot of experienced users and developers.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The main problem they face now, though, is compatibility with one another. Genesi has done the only sane thing - gone with open standards where they exist and courted the Linux market. Amiga and Hyperion still fear the rife piracy of the 1980s, when kids traded duplicated floppies of Amiga software freely. OS4 only runs on machines with Amiga firmware. It''s too late for that now: it has to run on anything with a PowerPC or it''s already-meagre chances shrink to nothing. If anything, the best market for OS4 is probably on the PowerPC consoles. They have abundant anti-piracy measures built in.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you fondly remember your old Miggy but aren''t interested in this exotic minority kit, then check out the FOSS project AROS - a reimplementation of AmigaOS 3 for generic x86 hardware. It''s not binary-compatible but Amiga code need only be recompiled, and it will be instantly familiar to anyone who knew the classic Amiga.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If plans come together, these future PPC5200 machines will offer a choice of OSs: as well as Linux, both Morphos and AmigaOS 4 - and maybe AROS too. Twenty-two years after its introduction, the Amiga is not quite dead yet. If you need a low-resource, high-performance Internet-ready graphical embedded or kiosk OS, even in 2007, you could do a lot worse than check out the world of the Amiga.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=88110" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2023-03-08 22:55:03','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

But perhaps more important than finding reasons for tolerance is questioning the causes: <i>What drives software toward complexity?</i><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US">A primary cause of complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want. Any incompatibility with the original system concept is either ignored or passes unrecognized, which renders the design more complicated and its use more cumbersome. When a system&rsquo;s power is measured by the number of its features, quantity becomes more important than quality. Every new release must offer additional features, even if some don''t add functionality.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><h2 style="margin: 12pt 0cm 3pt; break-after: avoid; font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri; font-style: italic;"><span lang="EN-US">All features, all the time<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US">Another important reason for software complexity lies in monolithic design, wherein all conceivable features are part of the system''s design. Each customer pays for all features but actually uses very few. Ideally, only a basic system with essential facilities would be offered, a system that would lend itself to various extensions. Every customer could then select the extensions genuinely required for a given task.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US">Increased hardware power has undoubtedly been the primary incentive for vendors to tackle more complex problems, and more complex problems inevitably require more complex solutions. But it is not the inherent complexity that should concern us; it is the self-inflicted complexity. There are many problems that were solved long ago, but for the same problems we are now offered solutions wrapped in much bulkier software.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US">Increased complexity results in large part from our recent penchant for friendly user interaction.

Of course, a customer who pays&mdash;in advance&mdash;for service contracts is a more stable income source than a customer who has fully mastered a product&rsquo;s use.

In the 1970s, it was widely believed that program design must be based on well-structured methods and layers of abstraction with clearly defined specifications. The abstract data type best exemplified this idea and found expression in then-new languages such as Modula-2 and Ada. Today, programmers are abandoning well-structured languages and migrating mostly to C. The C language doesn&rsquo;t even let compilers perform secure type checking, yet this compiler task is by far most helpful to program development in locating early conceptual mistakes, Without type checking, the notion of abstraction in programming languages remains hollow and academic. Abstraction can work only with languages that postulate strict, static typing of every variable and function. In this respect, C fails&mdash;it resembles assembler code, where &ldquo;everything goes.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><h2 style="margin: 12pt 0cm 3pt; break-after: avoid; font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri; font-style: italic;"><span lang="EN-US">Reinventing the wheel?<o:p></o:p></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US">Remarkably enough, the abstract data type has reappeared 25 years after its invention under the heading <i>object oriented</i>.

To be worthy of the description, an object-oriented language must embody strict, static typing that cannot be breached, whereby programmers can rely on the compiler to identify inconsistencies.

Specifications can turn out to be as unsuitable as implementations can turn out to be wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt 24pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt 24pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US">IN CONCLUDING, HERE ARE NINE LESSONS LEARNED from the Oberon project that might be worth considering by anyone embarking on a new software design:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt 24pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt 42pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria; text-indent: -18pt;"><span lang="EN-US">1.<span style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">     </span></span><span lang="EN-US">The exclusive use of a strongly typed language was the most influential factor in designing this complex system in such short time.

Primarily designed as a batch-oriented system, meaning that they are not  directly interactive. Jobs are queued up, run without interaction,  results stored, and then the next job processed. Later models added  interactivity as a secondary feature, usually like most mainframe I/O  handled by intelligent peripherals which in effect are networked to the  main processors. So, the terminal, on its own, shows a form and then  handles all user input as the user completes the form, without  communicating with the host at all. Then, when the user signals that the  form is complete, the entire contents, maybe many pages, are sent as a  single message to the host.<p>Separate processors in storage, in  terminals, in networking controllers, in printers, in everything.  Typically the machine cannot actually drive any output or input directly  (e.g. mouse movements, or keystrokes, or anything): peripherals do  that, collect and encode the results, and send them over a network. So  as someone else commented, a mainframe isn''t really <i>a</i> computer,  it''s a whole cluster of closely-coupled computers, many with dedicated  functionality. Quite possibly all implemented with different  architectures, instruction sets, programming languages, bit widths,  everything.</p><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/Print/2011/07/14/brief_history_of_virtualisation_part_2/">Here''s an article I wrote</a> about a decade back about  how IBM added the new facility of &quot;time sharing&quot; -- i.e. multiple users  on terminals, all interacting with the host at the same time -- by  developing the first hypervisor and running 1 OS per user in VMs,  because the IBM OSes of the time simply could not handle concepts like  &quot;terminal sessions&quot;.</p><p>Minicomputer:  the 2nd main style of computer. Smaller, cheaper, so affordable for a  company department to own one, while mainframes were and are mostly  leased to whole corporations. Typically 1 CPU in early ones, implemented  as a whole card cage full of multiple boards: maybe a few boards with  registers, one with an adder, etc. The &quot;CPU&quot; is a cabinet with thousands  of chips in it.</p><p>Hallmarks: large size; inherently multitasking,  so that multiple users can share the machine, accessing it via dumb  terminals on serial lines. User presses a key, the keystroke is sent  over the wire, the host displays it. Little to no networking. One  processor, maybe several disk or tape drives, also dumb and controlled  by the CPU. No display on the host. No keyboard or other user input on  the host. All interaction is via terminals. But because they were  multiuser, even the early primitive ones had fairly smart OSes which  could handle multiple user accounts and so on.</p><p>Gradually acquired networking and so on, but later.</p><p>In  some classic designs, like some DEC PDPs, adding new hardware actually  adds new instructions to the processor''s instruction set.</p><p>Wildly  variable and diverse architectures. Word lengths of 8 bit, 9 bit, 12  bit, 18 bit, 24 bit, 32 bit, 36 bit and others. Manufacturers often had  multiple incompatible ranges and maybe several different OSes per model  range, depending on the task wanted, so offering dozens of totally  different and incompatible OSes across half a dozen models.</p><p>Microcomputer:  the simplest category. The entire processor is implemented on a single  silicon chip, a microprocessor. Early machines very small and simple,  driven by 1 terminal with 1 user. No multitasking, no file or other  resource sharing, no networking, no communications except typically 1  terminal and maybe a printer. Instead of 1 computer per department, 1  computer per person.  Facilities added by standardised expansion cards.</p><p>This  is the era of standardisation and commoditisation. Due largely to  microcomputers, things like the size of bytes, their encoding and so on  were fixed. 8 bits to a byte, ASCII coding, etc.</p><p>Gradually grew  larger: 16-bit, then 32-bit, etc. In the early ''80s gained onboard ROM  typically with a BASIC interpreter, on-board graphics and later sound.  Mid-''80s, went to 16-bit with multicolour graphics (256+ colours),  stereo sound. Lots of incompatible designs, but usually 1 OS per  company, used for everything. All single-user boxes.</p><p>These  outperformed most minis and minis died out. Some minis gained a hi-res  graphical display and turned into single-user deskside &quot;workstations&quot;,  keeping their multitasking OS, usually a UNIX by this point. Prices  remained at an order of magnitude more than PCs, and processors were  proprietary, closely-guarded secrets, and sometimes still implemented  across multiple discrete chips. Gradually these got integrated into  single chip devices but they usually weren''t very performance  competitive and got displaced by RISC processors, built to run compiled C  quickly.</p><p>In the ''90s, generalising wildly, networking became  common, and 32-bit designs became affordable. Most of the 16-bit  machines died out and the industry standardised on MS Windows and  classic MacOS. As internet connections became common in the late ''90s,  multitasking and a GUI were expected along with multimedia support.</p><p>Apple bought NeXT, abandoned its proprietary OS and switched to a UNIX.</p><p>Microsoft  headhunted DEC''s team from the cancelled MICA project, merged it with  the Portable OS/2 project, and got them to finish OS/2 NT, later Windows  NT, on the N-Ten CPU, the Intel i860, a RISC chip, then on MIPS, and  later on x86-32 and other CPUs. This was the first credible commercial  microcomputer OS that could be both a client and a server, and  ultimately killed off all the proprietary dedicated-server OSes, of  which the biggest was Novell Netware.</p><p>That is a vastly overlong answer but it''s late and I''m just braindumping.</p><p>Mainframe:  big tightly-clustered bunch of smart devices, flying in close  formation. Primary role, batch driven computing, non-interactive;  interactivity bolted on later.</p><p>Mini: departmental shared computer  with dumb terminals and dumb peripherals, interactive and multitasking  from the start. Most text-only, with interactive command-line interfaces  -- &quot;shells&quot; -- and multiprogramming or multitasking OSes. Few had batch  capabilities; no graphics, no direct I/O, maybe rare graphical  terminals for niche uses. Origins of the systems that inspired CP/M,  MS-DOS, VMS, UNIX, and NT.</p><p>Micro: single-chip CPU, single-user  machines, often with graphics and sound early on. Later gained GUIs,  then later than that networking, and evolved to be servers as well.</p><p>If  the machine can control and be controlled by a screen and keyboard  plugged into the CPU, it''s a micro. If its CPU family has always been a  single chip from the start, it''s a micro. If it boots into some kind of  firmware OS loader, it''s probably a micro. The lines between micros and  UNIX workstations are a bit blurred.</p></span><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=87578" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-10-06 20:22:58','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

It already had established an ecosystem before 32-bit OS/2 appeared.</p><p>Secondly,  OS/2 2 really wanted a 386DX and 4MB of RAM, and a quality PC with  quality name-brand parts. I owned it. I ran it on clones. I had to <i>buy</i> a driver for my <i>mouse.</i> From another <i>CONTINENT.</i></p><p>Windows  3.0 ran on any old random junk PC, even on a PC XT class box with EGA.  At first only high-end users of high-end executive-class workstations  got the fun of 386 Enhanced Mode, but that was all OS/2 2.0 could run on  <i>at all</i>.</p><p>OS/2 died when OS/2 1.x was a high-end OS with  low-end features, and a cheapo low-end 386SX PC with 1 or 2MB of RAM,  with MS-DOS and DESQview (not DESQview/X, just plain old text-mode  DESQview) could outperform it.</p><p>(Remember the 386SX came out in 1988 and was common by the time Windows 3.0 shipped.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></span>But as soon as OS/2 1.x was a flop, MS turned its attention back to Windows, and before even the first betas of Windows 3.0, there were rumours in the tech press that MS was going to abandon the project. This<span class="commtext c00">&nbsp;was widely discussed in the media at the time.<p>In my then-job, around 1989, my boss sent me on a training course for 3Com''s new NOS, 3+Open, which was based on OS/2 1.0.</p><p>I  did not realise it was a clever evaluation strategy. He knew I might  have enthused about it if given a copy to play with. Instead, being  trained on it, I was told some of the holes and weaknesses.</p><p>I came  back, told them it was good but only delivered with OS/2 clients and  had no compelling features for DOS clients, and they were very pleased  -- and the company went on to start selling Novell Netware instead.</p><p>Looking  back that was a good choice. In the late 1980s Netware 2 and 3 were  superb server OSes for DOS, and OS/2 with LAN Manager wasn''t.</p><p>But  yes, I think from soon after OS/2 launched, it was apparent and widely  reported to IBM that MS was not happy, and as soon as MS started talking  about launching a new updated version of Windows -- circa 1989 -- it  was very clear to IBM that MS was preparing a lifeboat and would soon  abandon ship. By the time Windows 3.0 came out MS had left the project.  Its consolation prize was to keep Portable OS/2, also called OS/2 3.0,  later OS/2 NT.</p><p>This wasn''t secret, and everyone in the industry  knew about it. The embarrassment to IBM was considerable and I think  that''s why IBM threw so many people and so much money at OS/2 2.x. It  was clear early on that although it was a good product, it wasn''t good <em>enough</em>.</p><p>NT 3.1 launched in July 1993, almost exactly 1 year before OS/2 2.1, and NT made it pretty clear that OS/2 2.x was toast.</p><p>I  deployed NT 3.1 in production and supported it. Yes, it was big and it  needed a serious PC. OS/2 2.0 was pretty happy on a 486 in 4MB of RAM  and ran well in 8MB. NT 3.1 needed 16MB to be useful and really wanted a  Pentium.</p><p>But NT was easier to install. For instance, you could  copy the files from CD to hard disk and then run the installer from  MS-DOS. OS/2 had to boot to install, and it had to boot with CD drivers  to install from CD. Not trivial to achieve: ATAPI CD-ROM drives hadn''t  been invented yet. It was expensive SCSI drives and a driver for your  SCSI card, or proprietary interfaces and proprietary drivers, and many  of those were DOS-only.</p><p>NT didn''t have OS/2''s huge, complicated  CONFIG.SYS file. NT had networking and sound and so on integrated as  standard, while they were paid-for optional extras on OS/2.</p><p>And NT ran  Windows 3 apps better than OS/2, because each Windows 3 app had its own  resource heaps under NT. Since the 64kB heap was the critical  limitation on Win3 apps, NT ran them better than actual Windows 3.</p><p>If  you could afford the &pound;5000 PC to run NT, it was a better OS. OK, its UI  was the clunky (but fast) Windows 3 Program Manager, but it worked.  OS/2''s fancy Workplace Shell was more powerful but harder to use. E.g.  why on earth did some IBMer think needing to use the right mouse button  to drag an icon was a good idea?</p><p>I owned OS/2, I used it, and I liked it. I am still faintly nostalgic for it.</p><p>But aside from the fancy front-end, NT was better.</p><p>NT  3.5 was smaller, faster and better still. NT 3.51 was even smaller,  faster and stabler than that, and was in some ways the highpoint of NT  performance. It ran well in 8MB of RAM and very well in 16MB. On 32MB of  RAM, if you were that rich, we NT users could poke fun at people with  &pound;20K-&pound;30K UNIX workstations, because a high-end PC was as fast, as  stable, and had a <i>lot</i> more apps and a much easier UI.</p><p>Sad  to say, but the writing was on the wall for OS/2 by 1989 or so, before  2.0 even launched. By 1990 Windows 3.0 was a hit. By 1992 Windows 3.1  was a bigger hit and by 1993 it was pretty clear that it was all over  bar the shouting.</p><p>There was a killer combination that had a  chance, but not a good one: Novell Netware for OS/2. Netware ran on OS/2  and that made it a useful non-dedicated server. IBM could have bought  Novell, combined the products, and had a strong offering.

(I still have one. One of the best-built PCs ever made.)</p><p>All had the Microchannel (MCA) expansion bus, and VGA as standard.</p><p>Note, I am <i>not</i> including the Model 30, as it wasn''t  a true PS/2: no MCA, and no VGA, just MCGA.</p><p>IBM promised buyers that they would be able to run the new OS/2 operating system it was working on with Microsoft at the time.</p><p>This  is the reason why IBM insisted OS/2 must run on the 286: to provide it  to the many tens of thousands of customers it had sold 286 PS/2 machines  to.</p><p>Microsoft wanted to make OS/2 specific to the newer 32-bit  386 chip. This had hardware-assisted multitasking of 8086 VMs, meaning  the new OS would be able to multitask DOS apps with excellent  compatibility.</p><p>But IBM had promised customers OS/2 and IBM is the sort of company that takes such promises seriously.</p><p>So, OS/2 1.x was a 286 OS, not a 386 OS. That meant it could only run a single DOS session and compatibility wasn''t great.</p><p>This  is why OS/2 flopped. That in turn is why MS developed Windows 3, which  could multitask DOS apps, and was a big hit. That is why MS had the  money to headhunt the MICA team from DEC, headed by Dave Cutler, and  give them Portable OS/2 to finish. That became OS/2 NT (because it was  developed on Intel''s i860 RISC chip, codenamed N-Ten.) That became  Windows NT.</p><p>That is why Windows ended up dominating the PC  industry, not OS/2 (or DESQview/X or any of the other would-be DOS  enhancements or replacements).</p><p>Arguably, although I admit this is  reaching a bit, that''s what led to the 386SX, and later to VESA local  bus computers, and Win95 and a market of VGA-equipped PCI machines: the  fertile ground in which Linux took root and flourished.</p><p>PCs got  multitasking combined with a GUI because of Windows 3 and its  successors. (It''s important to note that there were lots of <i>text-only</i>  multitasking OSes for PCs: DR''s Concurrent DOS, SCO Xenix, QNX,  Coherent, TSX-32, PC-MOS, etc.) The killer feature was combining DOS, a  GUI, and multitasking of DOS apps. That needed a 386SX or DX.</p><p>These  things only happened because OS/2 failed, and OS/2 failed because there  were lots of 286-based PS/2 machines and IBM promised OS/2 on them.</p><p>The  286 and VGA went closely together, and indeed, IBM later made the  ISA-bus &quot;PS/2&quot; Model 30-286 in response to the relatively failure of  MCA.</p><p>It was a pivotal range of computers and it sealed the future  of the PC industry long after PS/2s themselves largely disappeared. They  were a hugely important range of computers, and they introduced the  standards that dominated the PC world throughout the 1990s and into the  2000s: PS/2 ports, VGA sockets, 72-pin RAM, 1.4MB floppies etc. Only the  expansion bus and the planned native OS failed. All the external ports,  connectors, media and so on became the new industry standards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></span><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=87108" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-09-28 20:58:30','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

Mainframes were and are expensive. Very, very expensive.  Minicomputers were cheaper &ndash; that&rsquo;s why they thrived, briefly, and are  now totally extinct &ndash; and microcomputers were very cheap.</p> <p><em>All</em> modern computers are microcomputers. Maybe evolved to  look like minis and mainframes, like ostriches and emus and cassowaries  evolved to look a bit like theropod dinosaurs, but they aren&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re  still birds. No teeth, no claws on their arms/wings, no live young.  Still birds.</p> <p>One of the defining characteristics of micros is that&rsquo;s they are  cheap, built down to a price, and there&rsquo;s very little R&amp;D money.</p> <p>But mainframes aren&rsquo;t. They cost a lot, and rental and licensing  costs a lot, and running them costs a lot&hellip; everything costs a lot.  Meaning you don&rsquo;t use them if you care about costs that much. You have  other reasons. What those are doesn&rsquo;t matter so much.</p> <p>Which means that even serving a market of just hundreds of customers  can be lucrative, and be enough to keep stuff in support and in  development.</p> <p>Result: in a deeply homogenous modern computing landscape, where  everything is influenced by pervasive technologies and their cultures &ndash;  Unix, C, the general overall DEC mini legacy that pervades DOS and  Windows and OS/2 and WinNT and UNIX, that deep shared &ldquo;DNA&rdquo; &ndash; mainframes  are <em>other</em>.</p> <p>There used to be lots of deeply different systems. In some ways,  classic Mac and Amigas and Acorn ARM boxes with RISC OS and Lisp  Machines and Apollo DomainOS boxes and so many more &ndash; were deeply and  profoundly unlike the DEC/xNix model. They were, by modern standards,  profoundly strange and alien.</p> <p>But they&rsquo;re all dead and gone. A handful persist in emulation or as  curiosities, but they have no chance of being relevant to the industry  as a whole ever again. Some are sort of little embedded parasites,  living in cysts, inside a protective wall of scar tissue, persisting  inside an alien organism. Emacs and its weird Lispiness. Smalltalk.  Little entire virtual computers running inside very very different  computers.</p> <p>Meantime, mainframes tick along, ignored by the industry as a whole,  unmoved and largely uninfluenced by all the tech trends that have come  and gone.</p> <p>They have their own deeply weird storage architectures, networking  systems, weird I/O controllers, often weird programming languages and  memory models&hellip; and yes, because they have to, they occasionally sully  themselves and bend down to talk to the mainstream kit. They can network  with it; if they need to talk to each other, they&rsquo;ll tunnel their own  strange protocols over TCP/IP or whatever.</p> <p>But because they are the only boxes that know where all the money is  and who has which money where, and who gets the tax and the pensions,  and where all the aeroplanes are in the sky and who&rsquo;s on them, and a few  specialised but <em>incredibly important</em> tasks like that, they  keep moving on, serene and untroubled, like brontosauri placidly pacing  along while a tide of tiny squeaky hairy things scuttle around their  feet. Occasionally a little hairy beast jumps aboard and sucks some  blood, or hitches a ride&hellip; A mainframe runs some Java apps, or it spawns a  VM that contain a few thousand Linux instances &ndash; and the little hairy  beasts think they&rsquo;ve won. But the giant plods slowly along, utterly  untroubled. Maybe something bit one ankle but it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p> <p>Result: the industry ignores them, and they ignore the industry.</p> <p>But whereas, in principle, we could have had, oh, say, <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/55562.html" rel="ugc">multi-processor BeOS machines</a> in the late 1990s, or smoothly-multitasking <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/74998.html" rel="ugc">386-based OS/2 PCs</a> in the late 1980s, or <a href="https://liam-on-linux.livejournal.com/46833.html" rel="ugc">smoothly multitasking 680x0 Sinclair clones</a>  instead of Macs, or any one of hundreds of other tech trends that  didn&rsquo;t work out&hellip; they were microcomputer-based, so the R&amp;D money  wasn&rsquo;t there.</p> <p>Instead, we got lowest-common-denominator systems. Not what was best,  merely what was cheapest, easiest, and just barely good enough &ndash; the  &ldquo;minimum viable product&rdquo; that an industry of shysters and con-men think  is a <em>good</em> thing.</p> <p>And a handful of survivors who keep doing their thing.</p> <p>What is funny about this, of course, is that it&rsquo;s cyclic. All human  culture is like this, and software is culture. The ideas of  late-20th-century software, things that are now assumptions, are just  what was cheap and just barely good enough. They&rsquo;ve now been replaced  and there&rsquo;s a new layer on top, which is even cheaper and even nastier.</p> <p>And if we don&rsquo;t go back to the abacus and tally sticks in a couple of  generations, this junk, which those who don&rsquo;t know anything else  believe is &ldquo;software engineering&rdquo; and not merely fossilised accidents of  exigency &ndash; will be the next generation&rsquo;s embedded, expensive,  emulated  junk.</p> <p>What sort of embedded assumptions? Well, the lower level is currently  this&hellip; quote marks to indicate mere exigencies with no real profound  meaning or importance:</p> <p>&ldquo;Low-level languages&rdquo; which you &ldquo;compile&rdquo; to &ldquo;native binaries&rdquo;. Use  these to build OSes, and a hierarchy of virtualisation to scale up  something not very reliable and not very scalable.</p> <p>Then on top of this, a second-level ecosystem built around web tech,  of &ldquo;dynamic languages&rdquo; which are &ldquo;JITted&rdquo; in &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; &ldquo;runtimes&rdquo;  so they run on anything, and can be partitioned up into microservices,  connected by &ldquo;standard protocols&rdquo;, so they can be run in the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; at  &ldquo;web scale&rdquo;.</p> <p>A handful of grumpy old gits know that if you pick the right  languages, and the right tools, you can build something to replace this  2nd level system in the same types of tools as the first level system,  and that you don&rsquo;t need all the fancy scaling infrastructure because one  modern box can support a million concurrent users no problem, and a few  such boxes can support tens of hundreds of millions of them, all in  something in the corner of one room, with an uptime of decades and no  need for any cloud.</p> <p>But it&rsquo;s <em>hard</em> to do it that way, and it&rsquo;s much easier to slap it together in a few interpreted languages and <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/" rel="ugc">ginormous frameworks</a>.</p> <p>And <a href="https://xkcd.com/224/" rel="ugc">twas ever thus</a>.</p></div><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=86995" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-09-24 13:14:47','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

But I think this is amazing work and really impressive. <br /><br />So I stuck in on HN and some pillock went &quot;yah boo TOS sucks Amiga is better&quot; like it was 1986. I paraphrase. I am unimpressed.<br /><br />In fact, while I don''t want to be mean, you''re missing two or possibly three different points... among which are the reasons I posted this link.<br /><br />[1] It''s not that TOS is less advanced than AmigaOS. Yes it is, and anyone who knows them realises that, but that''s not the issue here. The issue is that this FOSS project has brought these two platforms together after about 35 years, and that''s both really technologically impressive and also just plain fun.<br /><br />[2] It means in principle that Amiga owners can run Atari apps, and the ST had some impressive apps.<br /><br />[3] AROS is great but it''s an x86 OS. It doesn''t readily run on classic Amigas, or even especially well on the handful of later PowerPC Amigas, AFAIK. It also doesn''t run natively on modern RISC hardware, like say the Raspberry Pi.<br /><br />[4] But because it doesn''t, that''s prompted the creation of another really cool FOSS project, Emu68 -- a native 68K emulation environment for Arm, something comparable to Apple''s nanokernel for running Classic MacOS on PowerMacs.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/michalsc/Emu68">https://github.com/michalsc/Emu68</a><br /><br />[5] Creating an OS that''s as good or even better than the original while running on original hardware is impressive. Improved localisation opens it up to more people. That''s good. It enables reviving vintage kit more easily, and expanding it. That''s great.<br /><br />You were so busy mocking something that you didn''t stop to consider all the good sides.<br /><br />[6] We know TOS was limited. We all know that. OTOH its simplicity enabled this. Its simplicity also was part of why the ST survived as a musicians'' tool of choice for decades after it went out of production: super low latencies for music, and so on.<br /><br />But others knew that TOS was limited, which drove a 3rd party OS market, with products such as MagiC:<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagiC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagiC</a><br /><br />And MagiC is now FOSS:<br /><br /><a href="https://gitlab.com/AndreasK/Atari-Mac-MagiC-Sources">https://gitlab.com/AndreasK/Atari-Mac-MagiC-Sources</a><br /><br />Which is good, but OTOH, it''s not attracted much interest or development, AFAICS...<br /><br />Whereas EmuTOS is now on v 1.21 and is seeing new releases several times a year. This is great, and is one reason I posted it.<br /><br />[7] The limitations of TOS are also what prompted the development of MINT, and that''s FOSS too, and it''s quite mature:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/totalspectrum/atari-mint">https://github.com/totalspectrum/atari-mint</a><br /><br />And it has distros, such as AFROS:<br /><br /><a href="https://aranym.github.io/afros.html">https://aranym.github.io/afros.html</a><br /><br />Which you can run on x86 kit:<br /><br /><a href="https://aranym.github.io/">https://aranym.github.io/</a><br /><br />All of which is amazing work.<br /><br />So, yes, while you just wanted to do some advocacy, you missed a huge amount of great work by a committed community.<br /><br />Not cool, dude.<br /><br />Leave the Amiga-v-ST hate in the 1980s where it belonged. It wasn''t very welcome then. They''re both great computers. But hey, then the fans were children, so they can be excused.<br /><br />In 2022, they can''t.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=86583" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-09-18 16:22:39','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

Recently, I pulled the mSATA SSD that was giving errors from my X220, replaced it with a new bigger one -- that''s only been waiting for a couple of years -- and bunged the old, possibly-flakey one into the sacrificial T420. I tried it with Ubuntu Kylin, the international remix. Kylin worked well although there are numerous little glitches.)<br /><br />This machine''s primary SSD has ChromeOS Flex on it. I rather like it. It''s slick, it''s fast, it does its one job very well. I am using a Debian container to run Firefox ''cos I am perverse like that. Firefox is slow to start, issues with maximisation, but works well.<br /><br />Tonight, because the radio has gone Very Very Solemn And Dull And Worthy, I spent a while faffing with DR-DOS VMs and then I decided on something that might be more educational.<br /><br />I nuked Kylin and put FreeBSD 13.1 on it.<br /><br />Now recently I tried GhostBSD on my multiboot testbed. It was a nightmare. Hard, fiddly, falls over in its own install process, and the end result has an ugly theme. Not impressed.<br /><br />So I went with the vanilla version.<br /><br />First boot: it finds the wifi card, but can''t see any WLANs. That is not much cop.<br /><br />Tried again. Found a hint online on my phone, switched vconsoles, did `ifconfig wlan0 down` and then `ifconfig wlan0 up`. Went back to the installer, and lo! It sees WLANs! Pick mine, connect, and now I can install stuff.<br /><br />So, violating the recommended process -- since it''s booted off a DVD image via Ventoy, I figure that if I reboot, I won''t be able to readily mount and install stuff off that. So let''s do it while I''m booted off the install medium. It leaves you in a `chroot` console so it should be installing stuff onto the hard disk.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I followed this:<br />https://unixcop.com/how-to-install-xfce-in-freebsd-13/<br /><br />Install xorg, then install slim, then install xfce, then manually write some config files because FreeBSD is a bit BDSM like that.<br /><br />Reboot... no GUI. `startx` fails with an error about not being able to use the framebuffer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Google. Find some vague hints. This seems to be the BSD way: no straight answers, nothing current, sort it out newbie.<br /><br />This thread has info. And people arguing, and disagreeing, and telling each other they''re wrong.&nbsp;<br /><br />https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/new-to-freebsd-startx-fails-with-cannot-run-in-framebuffer-mode-help.68882/<br /><br />But it has some pointers. Install Intel video drivers. Reboot. Nope.<br /><br />There are vague conflicting things about DRM-mod, whatever that is. Most of the packages don''t exist, but `drm-kmod` does. It says it''s something to do with Linux, but what the hell, it''s a sacrificial system. Install it.<br /><br />It pulls in dozens and dozens of other things... AMD drives, nVidia drivers, Intel drivers, hypothetical deities know what. Anyway. Let it finish, reboot.<br /><br />And lo! A desktop!<br /><br />Obviously my ordinary user can''t log in, because I only hand-wrote an `.xinitrc` for root. Use that. It works. Switch consoles and handwrite one for `lproven` too, in Vi, because fsck you, newbie.<br /><br />Luckily for me, I am not a newbie. I am a grumpy old git but I do have some skills and I did do this in a VM just a couple of months ago.<br /><br />And stone me, but it works. I can log in.<br /><br />No volume control. No sound. No network controls. No browser. It''s all a bit minimal but it''s there, and it works.<br /><br />So I have just spent an hour or so installing Firefox, Chromium, LibreOffice, a PDF viewer -- watch out, the default install of `atril` tries to pull in all of MATE! Feck!&nbsp;Ctrl-C Ctrl-C! OK, now I know why `atril-lite` is there.<br /><br />I have a decent shell. With manual installing of Xfce packages, and a graphical package manager, which in turn needed manual installation and configuration of `sudo` -- but ahaha, I added a `wheel` group during installation because this is not my first rodeo -- I have a perfectly nice desktop.<br /><br />I had to manually install a fake network-manager, whose webpage implies it''s an external thing but it isn''t, it''s in the repos, and it works. And Chromium pulled in Pulseaudio and now sound works. LibreOffice pulled in a JVM.&nbsp;<br /><br />It only took a few hours'' work, some jiggery-pokery to get it connected, but it works. And on a Core i5 with 6GB of RAM, running off an old and possibly knackered 128GB SSD, it''s <strong>fast.<br /><br /></strong>Grudgingly, I am impressed. It is much<em> much</em> too much hard work. There really ought to be an Ubuntu-like distro of this that <em>doesn''t fsck around with it and leaves everything on defaults</em> -- which disqualifies GhostBSD and MidnightBSD, and FuryBSD is dead.<br /><br />There''s a ports system still although interestingly now it''s an optional install. Everything so far has been in the repos, and it remember my wifi credentials from installation and it still autoconnects. Updating is painless.<br /><br />FreeBSD has come quite a long way. This is a usable desktop OS. It most certainly wasn''t last time I tried, on version 9 or 10. I failed to get 12 to install completely, although getting a networked text-only server was fairly easy.<br /><br />Small stuff that pleases me: my brightness controls work, Lenovo''s volume controls work, etc. The mouse works on the console.<br /><br />And it doesn''t take much RAM, and in 6GB of RAM, it feels very smooth and not at all like it''s trying hard. I don''t think I''ve heard the laptop''s fans come on yet.<br /><br />I haven''t seen much noise out of the Hello System for a while now, which looked like the last best hope for an easy, clean, desktop FreeBSD. I know he is not a fan of GNUstep but I like it -- I reckon ProbonoPD should have adopted NeXTspace.<br />https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace<br /><br />I have yet to try suspend and resume. I should. Power management seems to be on, though; the machine runs nice and cool.<br /><br />A lot of people are getting very irked with Linux these days. GNOME is a mess and getting worse, Snap and Flatpak are grossly inefficient, systemd has lots of enemies, Btrfs isn''t that trustworthy -- it ate my OS multiple times at SUSE -- Bcachefs and Stratis aren''t ready and ZFS is only in Ubuntu and is controversial.<br /><br />All of that goes away with FreeBSD.&nbsp;<br /><br />But currently, it is much much too hard to install, even if it''s better than it was, and it is going to scare Linux people off unless they are seriously hardcore.<br /><br />I''ve been running TrueNAS Core on my home NAS for a while now and I like it. So far it''s been bulletproof.<br /><br />There is potential in this OS, but it needs to work a bit harder on its outreach. Pick a nice simple default desktop, something that isn''t mainstream in the Linux world for differentiation -- Xfce works great -- and a simple clean default set of apps. Something akin to an Ubuntu Minimal Install: desktop, file manager, maybe some viewers, text editor, and a good browser.&nbsp;<br /><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=86277" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-09-09 00:30:23','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

Microsoft produced that  on very short notice by licensing (note, <b><i>not</i></b>&nbsp;buying) 86-DOS from  Seattle Computer Products. That was originally called QDOS, for  Quick&rsquo;n&rsquo;Dirty OS.<p>Tim Paterson wrote QDOS based on studying the docs for CP/M and  CP/M-86. It was API compatible, but used a different disk filesystem:  Paterson used the FAT format of MS&rsquo; standalone disk BASIC.</p> <p>It was wholly-new code, but written to be closely compatible with DR&rsquo;s published info about CP/M.</p> <p>That is not even reverse-engineering. Indeed CP/M-86 was released  late and it didn&rsquo;t even exist to be reverse-engineered yet, AFAIK. QDOS  was written for and sold with SCP&rsquo;s 8086 cards in 1979; CP/M-86 did not  ship until 1981.</p> <p>Writing compatible code to a published API is what APIs are for. That&rsquo;s why the info is published.</p> <p>QDOS wasn&rsquo;t a clone of CP/M-86; in fact, it is older than and predated CP/M-86.</p> <p>It was a compatible OS written to info DR published. That is entirely  legal. DR published the APIs intending this for app writers, not for  people writing OSes compatible with DR OSes, but it&rsquo;s not breaking any  rules.</p> <p>In fact in the late 1970s there were lots of CP/M clones out there,  such as CPN and Cromemco CDOS and many others. Later MSX-DOS was a  much-enhanced CP/M clone.</p> <p>The difference is, most other companies cloned CP/M on 8080 or Z80. SCP did it on 8088/8086.</p> <p>But while yes, it&rsquo;s arguably something like a clone (for different  hardware, with a different file system), it was just one of many and  didn&rsquo;t use anything illegal or violate any licenses.</p> <p>The key thing is that QDOS ran on then-modern hardware with a future.  Most of the others ran on what was rapidly becoming obsolete hardware.  SCP QDOS  became 86-DOS became PC DOS and MS-DOS, and sold in the tens  of millions of copies, and made MS huge amounts of money.</p> <p>DR and IBM made big bad mistakes and it cost them dominance of their  industries and lots of money. MS was smart and got lucky and got very  very rich.</p> <p>Later on, MS abused that power repeatedly, stole code, copied ideas,  unfairly pushed rivals out of business, and generally became a bully and  a criminal. MS effectively killed Be, Netscape, and Central Point  Software; it crippled Aldus and STAC; and many more.</p> <p>But DR survived and briefly it staged a successful comeback, before being bought by Novell.</p> <p>I entirely understand how angry Dr Gary Kildall was. It was  justified. But he did make mistakes. Sadly some of them are only clear  in hindsight. DR should have rushed to make CP/M-86 quickly for IBM, and  reserved the rights to sell it to others, as Microsoft did. DR should  have sold single-user single-tasking CP/M-86 cheaply, building the  market, and made Concurrent CP/M the premium product. It should have  sold GEM cheaply to get wide adoption. It should have made standalone  single-user multitasking CP/M a desirable power-user OS, rather than  aiming at the multiuser market, which was on the way out as PCs got  cheaper and cheaper.</p> <p>But as little as I personally like MS, in how it cornered the market  and became rich, it did it by being clever, and fast, and outmaneuvering  bigger, slower rivals, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=85836" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-08-15 11:09:23','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

A handful of those were imported to North America, and right after, NeXT &quot;invented&quot; the Dock, and then Microsoft invented the task bar which is quite a bit more sophisticated.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>One source: the team that programmed it.

(When KDE was first launched, Qt was not GPL, so Red Hat refused to bundle it or support it, and wrote its own environment instead.)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Ubuntu tried to get involved with the development of GNOME 3, and was rebuffed.

Ubuntu used Unity, alienated a lot of people who only knew how to use Windows-like desktops, and that made Mint a huge success. GNOME 2 got forked as MATE, and Mint adopted it, helping a lot.

And no mouse scroll-wheel support, because they hadn''t been invented yet, but makes it feel very broken on a modern OS.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Otherwise, I would use it now, TBH. It''s tiny and fast and has 100&times; the functions I need.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Word 95 fixes all that, but the snag with Word 95 is that it uses the old DOS version file format. Modern apps don''t support the file format.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Word 97 uses a new file format, which remained the same until 2003. Office 2007 introduced new Zip-compressed XML files, and the Ribbon, and broke everything.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But it''s a lot easier to load Word 97 .DOC files into any other modern app than Word 95 ones, or else I''d still use Word 95.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But yes, Word 6 harmonized the UI, the file format, and the version number across Win, Mac and DOS. And it *did* come after Word 5.5 for DOS and Word 5.1 for Mac.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>DOS Word 5.5 is freeware now, but the differences from the Word 6 UI are annoying.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Word 6 for DOS fixes that and is a nice app to use, but it''s not free. I wish MS made it freeware too, but I think the company knows that for a lot of professional writers, Word 6 for DOS is adequate to the task and it might actually hurt sales of Office.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>OTOH Corel could free WordPerfect 6 for DOS and it might actually _help_ sales of the Windows version. It also should re-enter the Mac market, IMHO.

I learned on VAX/VMS at university in the 1980s, and it did.</p><p>Cheap low-end minis didn''t, and nor did the early 8-bit machines whose design was inspired by low-end minicomputers.</p><p>The main influences on CP/M were DEC OSes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/8">OS/8</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS-10">TOPS-10</a>.</p><p>The 2nd is mentioned in Wikipedia''s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M#Early_history">history of CP/M</a>.</p><p>I have never used either -- I''m not <i>that</i> old -- and I am not sure but I don''t think either supported hierarchical subdirectories.</p><p>The  closest thing that evolved into something that did was the DEC OS  RSX-11, which influenced VMS. They used a filesystem called DEC  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files-11">Files-11</a>. So that <strong>did</strong> end up supporting hierachical directories, but there isn''t a &quot;directory separator&quot; <i>per se</i>. That''s a UNIX-ism that MS-DOS 2.0 copied.</p><p>A VMS file in its folder might have been called something like:</p><p>VAXA$DKA100::[USERS.LPROVEN.SOURCE.FORTRAN]WUMPUS.FOR;42</p><p>In  other words, devices had multicharacter names that had meaning (e.g.  what type of controller board, then which controller, then which disk),  possibly after a cluster node name, then in square brackets a folder  path separated by dots, then a filename, then another dot, then a  3-letter extension, then a semicolon, then a version number.</p><p>Looks baroque compared to the dead simple UNIX name style...</p><p>/home/lproven/source/fortran/wumpus</p><p>Every  time you save a file, the version number increments automatically. And  path specs combined with device names and cluster names mean that the  filename could point to another disk on this controller, or another disk  on a different controller, or a disk on another node in the cluster, or  a disk on any node in a named cluster.</p><p>You can''t do that so  easily with the Unix naming system. So the sysadmin has to mount folders  from other machines into this one''s filesystem, and that means also  setting up some kind of distributed authentication like NIS or YP or  LDAP, and then some PAM modules or something... and it all gets very  complicated.</p><p>In other words, the simplicity of the UNIX design doesn''t take complexity away: it just <i>hides</i> it. It''s still there but it becomes someone else''s problem.</p><p>Whereas  the DEC way of doing things sort of puts the complexity right there in  front of you, but in return, you got rich facilities right there.</p><p>Much  less need for Git when files are versioned and you can go back to an  older version before you broke something just using info encoded into  the filename. Much less need for NFS mounts when the filesystem knows  about controllers and networking and clusters and lets you address them.  Much less need for bolted-on fancy authentication when that''s built  into the OS because the designers thought about stuff like networks,  clusters, and authentication, when all that got taken _out_ of UNIX and  then had to be bolted back on later.</p><p>So, yeah, the UNIX way is  simpler, but OTOH that also means it''s poorer. Poorer as in less rich.  As in the DEC system was richer: being richer lets you do more.</p><p>CP/M evolved into multitasking multiuser OSes in time, but DR didn''t get to re-invent all this stuff.</p><p>Maybe  if DOS had never happened, DR would have prospered and bought DEC  instead of Compaq buying DEC, and this stuff would have made it into PC  OSes.</p><p>Who knows...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></span><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=84476" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-07-13 15:22:37','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

So, although MS kept asking, and provided Novell with betas, Novell did not write a Netware client for NT.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254);">So MS wrote its own. It reverse-engineered the protocol and embedded its own Netware client into NT. It was initially able to connect to Netware 3 servers, but later gained basic authentication-only support for Netware 4''s NDS as well.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254);">Novell backpedalled and hastily wrote a client. If I recall correctly &ndash; it''s more than 30 years ago now &ndash; it shipped after NT 3.1 came out. So it was initally buggy and that meant it could crash the new crash-proof OS.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254);">Meaning that they competed: admins, including me, had a choice. Run the functionally-limited but stable MS client, or the feature-rich Novell client that could destabilise your very expensive high-end workstations?</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254);">Worse was to come. Since they''d already reverse-engineered the client, MS implemented a server as well. NT</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;could pretend to be a Netware server, and unmodified Netware client PCs (DOS, Windows 3, Windows for Workgroups, whatever) could connect to an NT box without changing the client. And as that was elaborate and involved a lot of memory optimisation, that helped.<br /><br />The server emulation wasn''t a deal-breaker, but it weakened the Novell position. But failing to write a client for what rapidly became a serious business workstation OS was a critical error and at that extremely risky time for Novell, it contributed to the company''s fall.</span></span></p><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=83538" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments',NULL,'','2022-05-06 09:04:53','Liam on Linux','',NULL,'2023-11-29 18:19:31','read');

Part 2 isn''t specific to Musk''s plans; I discuss two attempts to list the set of "knowns" about Mars exploration, for which the science is fairly clear but the engineering and the economics don''t exist,  and the much larger set of "known unknowns", critical aspects requiring robust solutions for which the science, let alone the engineering, doesn''t exist:<br />\n  <ul>\n    <li>Kelley and Zach Weinersmith''s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWH5YYTR/"><i>A City on Mars</i>.</a>\n    </li><li>Maciej Cegłowski''s <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm"><i>Why Not Mars?</i></a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics</i><br />\n<blockquote>\nAttributed to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-quote-of-Amateurs-talk-strategy-professionals-talk-logistics-come-from-Is-it-true-or-not">General Omar Bradley</a>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\nChris Young reported that <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/elon-musk-spacex-1000-starships-humans-mars"><i>Elon Musk: SpaceX will build over 1,000 Starships to move 1 million humans to Mars</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe plan is to "build 1000+ Starships to transport life to Mars.

In that interview, he stated that SpaceX would achieve this goal by 2050.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Space_colonization">Wikipedia reports that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSpaceX and Musk have stated their goal of colonizing Mars to ensure the long-term survival of humanity, with an ambition of sending a thousand Starship spacecraft to Mars during a Mars launch window in a very far future.\n</blockquote>\nSpaceX''s Starship is claimed to be able to "<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/starship-spacex-mega-rocket-makes-it-to-space">carry more than 100 tons of payload to the lunar surface in a single flight</a>" and, using on-orbit refueling, "<a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">up to 100 tons all the way to Mars</a>". The Mars mission depends upon refueling the Starship on-orbit from fuel tankers launched beforehand on the Super Heavy booster.<br />\n<br />\n"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Potential_uses">Musk has predicted that a Starship orbital launch will eventually cost $1 million</a>" but a more realistic estimate is about $1.5M, or $10/Kg. Each launch requires a <i>lot</i> of fuel.\n"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Planned_mission_profile">Roughly four hundred truck deliveries are needed for one launch</a>"<br />\n<br />\nThe problem with refueling on-orbit is that getting the fuel up for one mission requires a <i>lot</i> of launches. For a manned Moon landing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">the Government Accountability Office said that SpaceX would "require 16 launches overall"</a>.  So delivering 100,000 tonnes to Mars would require 16,000 Super Heavy launches costing around $24B and involving 6.4M truck deliveries. One might think that the launches could take the whole of the 780-day interval between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Launch_windows">Mars launch windows</a>, or a rate of just over 20/day. But because the fuel in the orbital tanks boils off over time, the launches have to happen much faster than that, perhaps around 50/day. in 2022 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9#Launch_history">Falcon 9 launched 60 times</a>, or 0.16/day. Getting to 50/day requires scaling up over 300 times.<br />\n<br />\nSpaceX''s Falcon 9 has an astonishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9#Launch_history">99.3% success rate</a>. If the Mars vehicle had the same rate, an extra 113 launches would be needed to cover the failures. Of the 1,000 manned launches, 7 would be failures, carrying 7,000 people.<br />\n<br />\n1000 Starships carrying 1,000,000 people is 1,000 per Starship, which can deliver 100 tons to Mars. That is 220lb/person, so apart from the person and the spacesuit they will need to disembark, they won''t have many carry-on bags in the overheads, let alone the air and food needed for the journey. Everything they need to survive on Mars must already have been delivered by earlier missions. Lets guess that each person needs 10 times their weight in life support and other equipment. So the 1M person launch window must be preceded by 10 similar launch windows delivering freight. Now we are talking $264B in launch costs alone, or $264K per person. Even for Elon Musk, over a quarter-trillion dollars is real money. Even that may not be enough. The history of Mars missions shows that Mars landing is a high-risk endeavour. It is <i>very</i> unlikely that all 10,000 freight missions would be successful.<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgolhDFB3zfoi15DzUSF3cbuTJtoGjmiy8fDKTeXSE63pvEsZRXh3aoJVlHo87XPFGHqI6SUOVubSLlnGFlUNir3rdRGnYBNGXejPNq5dlLzIOz3qsygWcYecaPN9LqcTFIhti0tEG4UWcCEqNffgEDCwaIRh7qr2tH1KStenvGPdPGhkv5eNwXBQq5EAif/s1150/LaunchWindows.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="731" data-original-width="1150" height="127" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgolhDFB3zfoi15DzUSF3cbuTJtoGjmiy8fDKTeXSE63pvEsZRXh3aoJVlHo87XPFGHqI6SUOVubSLlnGFlUNir3rdRGnYBNGXejPNq5dlLzIOz3qsygWcYecaPN9LqcTFIhti0tEG4UWcCEqNffgEDCwaIRh7qr2tH1KStenvGPdPGhkv5eNwXBQq5EAif/w200-h127/LaunchWindows.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/dtm5bc/mars_launch_windows_20202030/?rdt=55849">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n10 launch windows is 7,800 days or more than 21 years. So if Musk wants to land a million humans by 2050 he needs to start launching 50 Starships a day in 2029, a bit more than 5 years from now. Fortunately, he has time to experiment. There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/dtm5bc/mars_launch_windows_20202030/?rdt=55849">two launch windows</a> before the one when he needs to start in earnest.<br />\n<br />\nIf the Starships are to be reused, they have to be re-fueled on Mars using fuel made locally from Martian resources. Each Starship requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">1,200 tons</a> of fuel. Thus unless the Starships are to be expended, during the 2024 and 2026 launch windows Musk needs to deliver a factory to Mars capable of producing 1.2M tons of fuel every 780 days, or nearly 1600 tons/day. Clearly, the factory must weigh several times its daily output. Lets guess it weighs 20 times, or 32,000 tons. So in each of those two launch windows Musk needs to send another 160 Starships to Mars, requiring another 2,560 launches.<br />\n<br />\nBut there''s another huge problem with Musk''s fantasy. The 1,000 Martian emigrants will spend something like 180 days cooped up in each Starship''s payload bay, which has a volume of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">1,000m<sup>3</sup></a>. The average human''s volume is around <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/the-human-cube-the-volume-of-humanity">0.06m<sup>3</sup></a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#Specifications">cabin volume per passenger of a 1-class 737</a> is around 0.22m<sup>3</sup>, so each emigrant will spend 180 days in the equivalent of 4 seats in coach in a 737. I think people paying more than a quarter-million dollars in launch costs alone would be imagining something more like business class! The migrants will end up fighting each other long before they arrive.<br />\n<br />\nAnd, of course, once the million people land on Mars the story isn''t over. They will still be dependent upon supplies from Earth until they can build a completely self-sustaining ecology. They may not need 100,000 tons of supplies every 780 days, but there will still need to be a lot of launches to get fuel into orbit to get a smaller number of Starships with supplies to Mars.<br />\n<br />\nLook, I totally understand that what people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos really want is to call up the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magratheans</a> and order one of their custom-made luxury planets lovingly made to their exacting specifications, so they don''t have to deal with taxes, government, competitors or people who disagree with them. Let alone having to survive in a 2.5C warmer world racked with war, migration and starvation that is depleting their support staff. It must be really frustrating that niggling little issues like the speed of light mean that the only planet they can afford isn''t just a long, slow, expensive commute, but also needs a <i>lot</i> of work to make it a suitable home for a multi-billionaire. That work is the subject of part 2.<br />\n<br />\nAll it took for me to get this level of understanding of just the logistics of Musk''s fantasy was his own numbers, an Internet connection, a couple of hours, and basic arithmetic. Given Musk''s notorious lack of credibility when it comes to schedules, it is disappointing that as far as I can tell no journalist made the effort to inform the public that Musk was BS-ing. Chris Young expressed mild skepticism, "just not very realistic" and "risks putting him in similar territory as he was with Tesla''s progress on Level 5 autonomy". But that is a long way from explaining Musk''s specific implausibilities.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-11-30 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2023-11-30 16:10:43','read');

It was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust and raised similar unanswerable questions about the capacity of our species to do evil.

Jackie only discovered how much water Riot needed via records requests. “They asked for 1.6 million gallons a day in the height of the summer, and we are all being told to conserve,” Jackie said.<br />\n<br />\n“When Riot tells people they are going to be wasting 1.6 million gallons a day, more than the iron smelt, more than the candy factory, they are going to be the number one user of water,” said Jackie.\n</blockquote>\nIn <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004"><i>Bitcoin’s growing water footprint</i></a> Alex de Vries discovers some very large water losses:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAmid growing concerns over the impacts of climate change on worldwide water security, Bitcoin’s water footprint has rapidly escalated in recent years. The water footprint of Bitcoin in 2021 significantly increased by 166% compared with 2020, from 591.2 to 1,573.7 GL. The water footprint per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for those years amounted to 5,231 and 16,279 L, respectively. As of 2023, Bitcoin’s annual water footprint may equal 2,237 GL.\n</blockquote>\nThat is, each Bitcoin transaction consumes a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/a-single-bitcoin-transaction-uses-enough-water-to-fill-a-swimming-pool/ar-AA1kJBzC">small swimming pool worth</a> of water.<br />\n<br />\nde Vries <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">computes two kinds of losses</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe first involves onsite (direct) water use for cooling systems and air humidification. Water usage depends on cooling system types and local climate conditions. It is important to differentiate between water withdrawal and water consumption in terms of this usage. Water withdrawal pertains to the water taken from surface water or groundwater sources, while water consumption refers to the portion of water that becomes unavailable for reuse after withdrawal, primarily due to evaporation in cooling systems. Water consumption is not extensively studied in Bitcoin mining or generic data center research, as reliable data on water consumption factors are challenging to obtain.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">And</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe second way in which miners use water relates to the (indirect) water consumption associated with generating the electricity necessary to power their devices. Thermoelectric power generation plays a major role in water consumption, as a portion of the withdrawn water for cooling purposes evaporates (unless dry cooling technologies utilizing air are employed).\n</blockquote>\nNote some <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">caveats</a> (my emphasis):<br />\n<blockquote>\nThese systems can utilize both freshwater and non-freshwater sources. This commentary, however, exclusively focuses on freshwater <i>consumption</i>. ...\nThe total water footprint of Bitcoin examined in this commentary encompasses the freshwater <i>consumed</i> due to both direct and indirect water <i>consumption</i> during the operational stage of Bitcoin mining devices.\n</blockquote>\nIt is important to note that water consumed is not the only concern, withdrawn water can be too.  <a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/10/23/texans-versus-bitcoin-jackie-sawicky-and-the-texas-coalition-against-cryptomining/">Sawicky points out that</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe water gets quite hot — over 100 degrees Fahrenheit — and that hot water needs to go somewhere. Where will it go?<br />\n<br />\nJackie hasn’t been able to get a clear answer, but she has concerns. “The property Riot purchased here in Navarro Country feeds into Richland Creek and Richland Creek feeds into Richland-Chambers Reservoir, and that’s the tap water for Arlington-Fort Worth.”\n</blockquote>\nHot water kills fish, and any pollution from the Riot facility will end up in the water supply.<br />\n<br />\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0XL69evW-Cerb1uI4NtUiQKejGiq6P6ddYNTnMe1rBliqmPKioKh7NTiY1IGA90Kan-2YuB6FZQoOy3FIRU2JniWSZnS1UhU4e7BgGFqCBA1cYG0u1U-PSeJJXcoO89JuZypaPQ-2dE_5xTbtY2PD_9uv7E426aE9oSL455Tj3SyNwqmb9jsFcqYK9lPO/s2233/deVriesFig2.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1857" data-original-width="2233" height="166" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0XL69evW-Cerb1uI4NtUiQKejGiq6P6ddYNTnMe1rBliqmPKioKh7NTiY1IGA90Kan-2YuB6FZQoOy3FIRU2JniWSZnS1UhU4e7BgGFqCBA1cYG0u1U-PSeJJXcoO89JuZypaPQ-2dE_5xTbtY2PD_9uv7E426aE9oSL455Tj3SyNwqmb9jsFcqYK9lPO/w200-h166/deVriesFig2.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">de Vries Fig. 2</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nThe US hosts a significant part of the total Bitcoin mining fleet.

In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004"><i>The growing energy footprint of artificial intelligence</i></a> he starts with the notoriously compute-intensive training phase:<br />\n<blockquote>\nHugging Face reported that its BigScience Large Open-Science Open-Access Multilingual (BLOOM) model consumed 433 MWh of electricity during training.4 Other LLMs, including GPT-3, Gopher and Open Pre-trained Transformer (OPT), reportedly used 1,287, 1,066, and 324 MWh, respectively, for training. Each of these LLMs, was trained on terabytes of data and has 175 billion or more parameters.\n</blockquote>\nde Vries then turns to the less-studied <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">inference phase</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nResearch firm SemiAnalysis suggested that OpenAI required 3,617 of NVIDIA’s HGX A100 servers, with a total of 28,936 graphics processing units (GPUs), to support ChatGPT, implying an energy demand of 564 MWh per day. Compared to the estimated 1,287 MWh used in GPT-3’s training phase, the inference phase’s energy demand appears considerably higher.  Furthermore, Google reported that 60% of AI-related energy consumption from 2019 to 2021 stemmed from inference.\n</blockquote>\nHe estimates for Google the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">energy needed per inference in LLMs</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSemiAnalysis estimated that implementing AI similar to ChatGPT in each Google search would require 512,821 of NVIDIA’s A100 HGX servers, totaling 4,102,568 GPUs. At a power demand of 6.5 kW per server, this would translate into a daily electricity consumption of 80 GWh and an annual consumption of 29.2 TWh. New Street Research independently arrived at similar estimates, suggesting that Google would need approximately 400,000 servers, which would lead to a daily consumption of 62.4 GWh and an annual consumption of 22.8 TWh.  With Google currently processing up to 9 billion searches daily, these scenarios would average to an energy consumption of 6.9–8.9 Wh per request. This estimate aligns with Hugging Face’s BLOOM model, which consumed 914 kWh of electricity for 230,768 requests,4 averaging to 3.96 Wh per request.<br />\n...<br />\nAlphabet’s chairman indicated in February 2023 that interacting with an LLM could ‘‘likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search.6" As a standard Google search reportedly uses 0.3 Wh of electricity,9 this suggests an electricity consumption of approximately 3 Wh per LLM interaction.\n</blockquote>\nAnd similarly for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">ChatGPT</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSemiAnalysis’ assessment of ChatGPT’s operating costs in early 2023, which estimated that ChatGPT responds to 195 million requests per day, requiring an estimated average electricity consumption of 564 MWh per day, or, at most, 2.9 Wh per request.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcn7ww8koW7xd3bINrqFogxoq-BYZ7GKUNaNkYJ-nNiDDgyDTMGFU7aMiiu5hYorN1SLBaKo8O4iScS3unDlJDE1v4O74qTbDZUAZM-4Ja4V8ur9fMbuAhKFeyja9gSKdZLv1c1N5zRMdRXbK3AR4IcivmRpF2hsnm-5hTrku-d_yIF0wFLeGtH0tmzkg_/s1564/deVriesFig1.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="892" data-original-width="1564" height="114" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcn7ww8koW7xd3bINrqFogxoq-BYZ7GKUNaNkYJ-nNiDDgyDTMGFU7aMiiu5hYorN1SLBaKo8O4iScS3unDlJDE1v4O74qTbDZUAZM-4Ja4V8ur9fMbuAhKFeyja9gSKdZLv1c1N5zRMdRXbK3AR4IcivmRpF2hsnm-5hTrku-d_yIF0wFLeGtH0tmzkg_/w200-h114/deVriesFig1.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">de Vries Fig. 1</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nde Vries considers a worst-case scenario in which <i>every</i> search involved interacting with an LLM:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn 2021, Google’s total electricity consumption was 18.3 TWh, with AI accounting for 10%–15% of this total. The worst-case scenario suggests Google’s AI alone could consume as much electricity as a country such as Ireland (29.3 TWh per year),\n</blockquote>\nFortunately, the hardware supply chain can''t deliver the chips needed to do this, and even if it could Google would not want to make the roughly $100B investment. A more realistic scenario is based on Nvidia''s projected sales of 100,000 AI servers in 2023:<br />\n<blockquote>\nthese servers would have a combined power demand of 650–1,020 MW. On an annual basis, these servers could consume up to 5.7–8.9 TWh of electricity. Compared to the historical estimated annual electricity consumption of data centers, which was 205 TWh, this is almost negligible.\n</blockquote>\nNote that this estimate assumes 100% duty cycle but ignores the power needed to cool the servers, two effects which tend to cancel each other. It also ignores the embedded energy in the servers, and their eventual contribution to the e-waste problem. de Vries concludes:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWhile the exact future of AI-related electricity consumption remains difficult to predict, the scenarios discussed in this commentary underscore the importance of tempering both overly optimistic and overly pessimistic expectations. Integrating AI into applications such as Google Search can significantly boost the electricity consumption of these applications. However, various resource factors are likely to restrain the growth of global AIrelated electricity consumption in the near term. Simultaneously, it is probably too optimistic to expect that improvements in hardware and software efficiencies will fully offset any longterm changes in AI-related electricity consumption. These advancements can trigger a rebound effect whereby increasing efficiency leads to increased demand for AI, escalating rather than reducing total resource use.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKPZhAos7JVO96Yhde6Bm8aN2qu0jAH4diezaueejfEekKbh7enWfmRUQsftZIkRN9xOHdc3IymqYiCcBfzKZO0XWm547Ib55kp-t8JMzUAdx0rKsPEFZPhK3cbtGbxHO4Gde79hjDmTI0o0gVQckqZ6ZSU0B5YqMk0MDhGQKm2HrjNctyNWyinaNZPQcR/s1339/LuccioniFig1.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="687" data-original-width="1339" height="103" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKPZhAos7JVO96Yhde6Bm8aN2qu0jAH4diezaueejfEekKbh7enWfmRUQsftZIkRN9xOHdc3IymqYiCcBfzKZO0XWm547Ib55kp-t8JMzUAdx0rKsPEFZPhK3cbtGbxHO4Gde79hjDmTI0o0gVQckqZ6ZSU0B5YqMk0MDhGQKm2HrjNctyNWyinaNZPQcR/w200-h103/LuccioniFig1.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">Luccioni Fig. 1</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nde Vries'' pivot to the cost of AI inference is joined by Alexandra Sasha Luccioni, Yacine Jernite and Emma Strubell with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf"><i>Power Hungry Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?</i></a> who:<br />\n<blockquote>\npropose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and ‘general-purpose’ models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters.\n</blockquote>\nAs with de Vries, they justify their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">focus on inference</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAccording to AWS, the largest global cloud provider, inference is estimated to make up 80 to 90% of total ML cloud computing demand [2, 28], whereas a 2021 publication by Meta attributed approximately one-third of their internal end-to-end ML carbon footprint to model inference, with the remainder produced by data management, storage, and training [56]; similarly, a 2022 study from Google attributed 60% of its ML energy use to inference, compared to 40% for training [40].\n</blockquote>\nLuccioni <i>et al</i>''s Figure 1 (note Y axis logarithmic) shows that the range of carbon emissions for the various tasks they tested spans 3 orders of magnitude.

No, because Tether only deals with authorized institutions, and only in amounts over $100K, Did institutions send Tether $20B in cash? It seems unlikely. At various times over its history Tether has been caught minting USDT in return for things other than cash, such as loans to mysterious Chinese companies, or even thin air.\nIt has never been audited, and has been described as being "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">practically quilted out of red flags</a>".

Paolo Ardoino, recently promoted from CTO to CEO of the company, is the public face of Tether on Twitter and in the media. Giancarlo Devasini, the failed plastic surgeon, then failed software pirate, now billionaire CFO (how’s that for a career trajectory?), is widely regarded as the de facto leader of the company. And people often joke about Tether’s absentee former CEO, JL van der Velde, asking whether he even exists (he does, and he also was a serial failure before joining Tether).<br />\n...<br />\nWe have been puzzled by Tether’s leadership for some time. The massive success of the company and the complexity of its operations seem beyond the abilities of a small-time scam operator and repeat failure (Giancarlo), an inexperienced and sweaty front man (Paolo), and another failed businessman and absentee executive (JL). Notably, none of these guys had any significant prior experience in finance, and it is unlikely that any of them had the sorts of business and political ties that would be essential for keeping a controversial company like Tether afloat.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvboHXiL5MuriIDGEQjmhXK9igJZnhEo3RM_GN_rbN9QLfZy3a1RunR-UWHPha-g03jzyKdKHOEXJCDNFIpGFMJfoNv3bWc9L3ikiQjrhKWBY-WjOTN6dSLoaNaJA6DnJoMoGEvGc-WwqaET6csgMQOJrapOejTXngdnx8AQxdw9wnz5pArn5jEvtsVAxZ/s639/Harborne.png" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="627" data-original-width="639" height="196" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvboHXiL5MuriIDGEQjmhXK9igJZnhEo3RM_GN_rbN9QLfZy3a1RunR-UWHPha-g03jzyKdKHOEXJCDNFIpGFMJfoNv3bWc9L3ikiQjrhKWBY-WjOTN6dSLoaNaJA6DnJoMoGEvGc-WwqaET6csgMQOJrapOejTXngdnx8AQxdw9wnz5pArn5jEvtsVAxZ/w200-h196/Harborne.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">Harborne?</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nBut Dirty Bubble Media identifies <a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">someone else involved</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nHis name is Christopher Charles Sherriff Harborne, AKA Chakrit Sakunkrit. Styling himself a “digital nomad,” Mr. Harborne’s busy hands reach across continents, industries, and political movements. The scope of Mr. Harborne’s activities and the apparent wealth backing his activities is staggering. Among those many diverse interests, it appears that Tether has become one of his most important interests. And Mr. Harborne has been far more than a passive investor in the company. Indeed, the available evidence suggests that Mr. Harborne’s involvement in Tether is far more significant than generally recognized…\n</blockquote>\nThe details of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Harborne">Harborne</a>''s career are <a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">fascinating</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMr. Harborne has major ownership interests in other notable companies. Through a Delaware corporation he is the largest minority shareholder in QinetiQ, a major British defense contractor; this stake is worth around $200 million at present. He is also the sole owner of IFX Payments, a British fintech company specializing in moving large sums of money around the globe (hm). In total, over a dozen corporate entities spread across the globe have been linked to Mr. Harborne, with many more likely still hidden.\n</blockquote>\nHe was a major funder of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/30/britons-brexit-bad-uk-poll-eu-finances-nhs">disastrous Brexit campaign</a> and the UK''s second <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/iceberg-lettuce-in-blonde-wig-outlasts-liz-truss">worst recent Prime Minister</a>, Boris Johnson. He owns "<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">around 12% of Tether and a similar percentage of equity in Bitfinex</a>".  After the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal">Crypto Capital Corp seizure</a> they lost access to the US banking system, and Harborne was apparently <a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">critical to rescuing them both</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nHe used his fuel-selling business AML Global to obtain an account with the crypto-friendly Signature Bank. On the account application, Mr. Harborne did not disclose his significant stake in Tether, nor did he indicate the true purpose of the new account: It was intended to serve as a backdoor for Bitfinex to access the U.S. banking system. However, Signature caught on shortly thereafter and closed the account.<br />\n<br />\nIn other words, Mr. Harborne cared so deeply for the fate of Bitfinex and Tether that he <b>risked the welfare of one of his primary companies, and a <i>conviction for bank fraud</i></b>, to try to save the company. It’s worth noting that Mr. Harborne received some $70 million in Tether stablecoins over 2019, making him one of the largest individual recipients of the token.\n</blockquote>\nWith a cast of characters this sketchy, skepticism is warranted, and in <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/"><i>Bitcoin goes up!

Molly White reports that <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=tether-christmas-2023-mint"><i>Tether mints itself a $1 billion Christmas present</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOn December 25, Tether minted 1 billion of its USDT dollar-pegged stablecoin. CEO Paolo Ardoino announced on Twitter that the mint was an "authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps". This seems to be a recent trend for Tether, as similar language was used for a $1 billion mint in September.<br />\n<br />\nThe activity has raised more questions around where the real money backing Tether is coming from, and if it even exists at all. Some have argued that these recent Tether mints are being used to artificially inflate the price of Bitcoin, which has been on an upward trend since mid-October.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJbZz4zTM1ZScRjtjTrv7Fec7vVLS1naQjx_u1sJgv9eHU4ghbCClZ1yCIUQEK_N8BHPsA3P-p3dclgjk6_EgrqVRAWMBVyojcbBjMe9iBBnd6WaTh8n8gcZd9hWPfgp9dP_0AGwwylNiazsvkSmm1-Yx9As52rKaWzfi1aJoKrYoRAu5C_AFpljluoHMw/s975/USDC_1Y_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="396" data-original-width="975" height="81" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJbZz4zTM1ZScRjtjTrv7Fec7vVLS1naQjx_u1sJgv9eHU4ghbCClZ1yCIUQEK_N8BHPsA3P-p3dclgjk6_EgrqVRAWMBVyojcbBjMe9iBBnd6WaTh8n8gcZd9hWPfgp9dP_0AGwwylNiazsvkSmm1-Yx9As52rKaWzfi1aJoKrYoRAu5C_AFpljluoHMw/w200-h81/USDC_1Y_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/">USDC "market cap"</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nAmy Castor and David Gerard <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">ask the right question</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nYou would think, with that kind of totally genuine and organic market demand for stablecoins, USDC’s issuance would also be going up — but no. USDC’s issuance is 24.4 billion, having seen a steady decrease from 44 billion in March 2023.<br />\n<br />\nSo where is Tether getting all the dollars to back these tethers?<br />\n<br />\nIt isn’t. Tether’s printing press is not fueled by demand. This is Tether issuing loans to some of its biggest customers — printing pseudo-dollars out of thin air, with the only “backing” being the loan itself, counted as an asset. The loans are secured by cryptos held as collateral — not as reserves. No actual dollars flow into the system this way.<br />\n</blockquote>\nWhy would crypto-bros prefer USDT to USDC if it is doubtful that it is fully backed? It might have something to do with USDT lacking "regulatory clarity". How do we know Tether is printing USDT out of thin air? <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">Because</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTether spent years denying that they issued tethers from thin air as loans — then Alex Mashinsky of Celsius Network confirmed in October 2021 that Celsius had been taking out such loans from Tether. It came out in the <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/10/29/the-cftc-settlement-with-tether-and-bitfinex-42-5-million-dollars-in-fines/">CFTC settlement</a> later that month that they had been doing this precise thing for a while.<br />\n<br />\nTether admitted in September that it was making “secured” loans again — after saying in December 2022 that it would reduce its secured loans to zero. [<a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/tether-is-lending-its-stablecoins-again-b11705f2">WSJ</a>]\n</blockquote>\nPresumably, during the "crypto winter", there would have been a need for customers to exchange USDT for USD. But <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">did they?</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn mid-2022, after <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/05/10/terras-stablecoin-does-a-2008-crisis-ust-crashes-and-takes-bitcoin-with-it/">the Terra-Luna collapse</a>, Tether <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/06/13/celsius-goes-fahrenheit-451-and-number-goes-down/">bragged</a> that it had <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/06/22/crypto-collapse-latest-the-contagion-spreads/">“redeemed” 16 billion USDT</a>. We would assume most or all of that was loans being canceled and the tethers burned. We certainly don’t know of any independently verifiable evidence that a single actual dollar was transferred in return.<br />\n<br />\nFor comparison, USDC reserves are held in short-term treasuries and cash in US bank accounts. A USDC appears to have an actual dollar backing it — and now that interest rates are up, Circle has been making a ton of money.<br />\n<br />\nIf Tether had billions of real dollars backing its tethers — as it claims — then the folks running Tether could also make a ton of money simply by putting the reserve into Treasury bills. They do not need to be making loans.<br />\n<br />\nIn late 2022, CZ from Binance was deeply upset that Sam Bankman-Fried from FTX might destabilize tethers by <a href="https://amycastor.com/2022/12/18/crypto-collapse-binance-is-not-so-fine-ftx-delaware-vs-ftx-bahamas-celsius-voyager-gemini-tether/">trying to cash out … $250,000 worth</a>. That’s out of a supposed reserve in the <i>billions</i>. This brings into serious question how many actual dollars are anywhere near Tether — clearly not enough.\n</blockquote>\nWhat is going on has similarities with Celsius'' <a href="https://celsius.network/cel-token-explained">"flywheel"</a>. <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">Castor and Gerard explain</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCrypto institutions — exchanges, hedge funds — use the tethers to buy leverage and pump the price. They post their inflated crypto as collateral to borrow more USDT and keep pumping. [<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/examining-tethers-secret-loan-portfolio">Dirty Bubble</a>]\n</blockquote>\nThese crypto-backed loans are the fuel for the pump inflating the cryptocurrency bubble. <a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/examining-tethers-secret-loan-portfolio">Dirty Bubble Media concludes</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nBased on the current dataset, we can estimate that Tether issued many billions of USDT backed by crypto collateral. The impact is far larger than one might assume just from looking at the loan balances. For example, Tether lent Celsius Network just over $4 billion in total. Our data indicates that other parties like Amber and 3AC similarly received billions in loans, which round-tripped their way through the crypto-conomy without ever touching the real financial system or ever being backed by real money….<br />\n<br />\nMany questions remain unanswered:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>What percentage of Tether’s “redemptions” are actually loan repayments?</li>\n<li>What is the impact of cycling billions of crypto-backed USDT through the crypto markets?</li>\n<li>And, why did Tether’s reported secured loans massively diverge from this data starting in May/June 2022, around the same time as Terra, Celsius Network, and Three Arrows Capital collapsed?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nUS regulators have been suspicious of Tether for a long time, and they <a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/12/28/crypto-collapse-mt-gox-payouts-tether-hooks-up-the-feds-sec-says-no-to-coinbase-crypto-media-mergers/">seem to have lost patience</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe US government isn’t entirely happy with Tether’s financial shenanigans. But they’re really unhappy about sanctions violations, especially with what’s going on now in the Middle East. <br />\n<br />\nSo Tether has announced that it will now be freezing OFAC-sanctioned blockchain addresses — and it’s onboarded the US Secret Service and FBI onto Tether!

We expect they were told that they would allow this or an extremely large hammer would come down upon them.\n</blockquote>\nIt looks like Tether has achieved some "regulatory clarity". It isn''t just US authorities who can get Tether to freeze wallets. Patrick Tan asks <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508"><i>What happens when Tether “freezes” your Tether?</i></a>, and recounts the tale of The Victim, whose wallet was frozen at the request of Indian law enforcement. Tan <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">concludes</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe Victim’s transactions are at very most 3 hops away from known bad actors, so it’s not entirely unreasonable for Indian authorities to require more information and detailed documents, not to mention the backdrop of ongoing scams abusing already stretched Indian law enforcement agencies.<br />\n<br />\nFor Tether’s part, it looks as though they received a request from Indian law enforcement and followed it.<br />\n<br />\nBut perhaps, and somewhat more significantly, there is also the risk that Tether blacklists the USDT in your wallet, in response to government requests, regardless if those requests are lawful or not.<br />\n<br />\nIt’s entirely possible for government officials or authorities with a personal vendetta, to target causes, or political opponents who receive donations or are known to transact in USDT, and for Tether to err on the side of caution and comply.<br />\n<br />\nIt’s entirely possible that many “innocent” addresses are blacklisted in such opaque processes, collateral damage in purges.\n</blockquote>\nThe Victim might well be collateral damage, but it was essentially impossible to supply the "more information and detailed documents" that law enforcement required to lift the freeze. Such are the risks of operating without "regulatory clarity". But the kind of "regulatory clarity" the US has imposed on Tether isn''t likely to help The Victim or others who become collateral damage, it is likely to increase their numbers. An increasing number of users unable to access their funds is a double-edged sword for Tether; the good news is that Tether gets to keep the interest on frozen funds, the <i>good</i> news is that more and more people figure out how risky USDT is.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-02 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2024-01-03 18:04:20','read');

Below the fold I continue, first by discussing Maciej Cegłowski''s equally basic dissection of NASA''s economically implausible plans for Mars in <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm"><i>Why Not Mars?</i></a>. Second, by reviewing the host of non-logistical and non-economic problems facing humans attempting to survive on Mars based on:<br />\n <ul>\n  <li>Kelley and Zach Weinersmith''s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWH5YYTR/"><i>A City on Mars</i>.</a></li>\n  <li><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2309.16806"><i>Towards Sustainable Horizons: A Comprehensive Blueprint for Mars Colonization</i></a> by Florian Neukart.</li>\n </ul>\n<br />\n<span><a name=''more''></a></span>\n<br />\nThere are two known programs planning to land humans on Mars, Musk''s and NASA''s. Cegłowski''s massively footnoted (which I omit) post starts by asking the obvious question of each "<a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">What are they trying to achieve?"</a>:<br />\n<ul>\n  <li>Musk''s is the establishment of a backup planet for humans in case the primary fails. <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">Cegłowski writes</a>:<br />\n  <blockquote>\nElon Musk, the Martian spiritual leader, has talked about the need to “preserve the light of consciousness” by making us a multiplanetary species. As he sees it, Mars is our only way off of a planet crawling with existential risk. And it''s not just enough to explore mars; we have make it a backup for all civilization. Failing to stock it with subsistence farming incels would be tantamount to humanity lying down in its open grave.\n    </blockquote>\nThe best that can be said for this is that it is "aspirational", many orders of magnitude more aspirational than, for example, the idea of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html">autonomous Tesla robotaxis</a> earning while their owners sleep.\n  </li>\n  <li>NASA''s primary goal is much less aspirational; it appears to be to use the idea of "one small step for a man" on Mars to ensure the continuation of the manned space-flight program. Cegłowski is scathing about NASA''s inability to articulate a rational justification, <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">quoting NASA administrator Bill Nelson</a>:<br />\n    <blockquote>\n      First of all, we are explorers and adventurers as a species. That basically is the fulfilment of our destiny. But, in that exploration, we’re going to learn new things and develop new things that is going to improve, just as it’s been under our space program, our lives here on Earth.\n    </blockquote>\nThe destiny that is being fulfilled here is NASA''s manned space-flight program, which has conspicuously failed to deliver "new things ... to improve ... our lives here on earth". The things that <i>have</i> improved lives, from weather forecasts, satellite communications, earth observation and so on have all come from the unmanned side of NASA. As have all the scientific discoveries from astronomical missions such as Hubble and James Webb, and of greater relevance here, planetary missions such as Opportunity and Perseverance. Note how Nelson elides the difference. \n    </li>\n</ul>\nIf NASA''s justification for landing on Mars is science, helping to answer the <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Earth">Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything</a> by discovering life there, there are three big problems:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Economics: using humans increases the cost by at least a couple of orders of magnitude.</li>\n<li>Schedule: using humans delays results by at least a couple of decades.</li>\n<li>Science: using humans inevitably contaminates Mars with Earth lifeforms, rendering a definite answer to the research questiuon impossible.<br />\n</li></ul>\nCegłowski points out that the last couple of decades have seen a vast expansion of understanding of <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">life on Earth</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMicrobiologists had long suspected that the 12,000 or so known species of microbes were just a fraction of the total, with perhaps another hundred thousand “unculturable” species left to discover. But when new sequencing technology became available at the turn of the century, it showed the number of species might be as high as one trillion. In the genomic gold rush that followed, researchers discovered not just dozens of unsuspected microbial phyla, but two entire new branches of life.<br />\n<br />\nThese new techniques confirmed that earth’s crust is inhabited to a depth of kilometers by a ‘deep biosphere’ of slow-living microbes nourished by geochemical processes and radioactive decay. One group of microbes was discovered still living their best lives[24] 100 million years after being sealed in sedimentary rock. Another was found enjoying a rewarding, long-term relationship with fungal partners deep beneath the seafloor[25].\n</blockquote>\nAnd that what this means for the search for <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">life on Mars</a> is critical:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe fact that we failed to notice 99.999% of life on Earth until a few years ago is unsettling and has implications for Mars. The existence of a deep biosphere in particular narrows the habitability gap between our planets to the point where it probably doesn’t exist—there is likely at least one corner of Mars that an Earth organism could call home. It also adds support to the theory that life may have started as an interplanetary infection, a literal Venereal disease that spread across the early solar system by meteorite[36]. If that is the case, and if our distant relatives are still alive in some deep Martian cave, then just about the worst way to go looking for them would be to land in a septic spacecraft.\n</blockquote>\nCegłowski points out that NASA has to care about <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">contaminating Mars</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe requirement to avoid contamination is a clause in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty">1967 Outer Space Treaty</a>. The detailed guidelines for what this means are formulated by an international body called COSPAR.\n</blockquote>\nMusk''s likely attitude to this treaty can be inferred from the title of Douglas Rushkoff''s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/25/we-will-coup-whoever-we-want-the-unbearable-hubris-of-musk-and-the-billionaire-tech-bros"><i>‘We will coup whoever we want!’: the unbearable hubris of Musk and the billionaire tech bros</i></a>.<br />\n<br />\nCegłowski has noticed <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">NASA manned spaceflight''s track record</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nSticking a flag in the Martian dust would cost something north of half a trillion dollars, with no realistic prospect of landing before 2050. To borrow a quote from John Young, keeping such a program funded through fifteen consecutive Congresses would require a series “of continuous miracles, interspersed with acts of God”. Like the Space Shuttle and Space Station before it, the Mars program would exist in a state of permanent redesign by budget committee until any logic or sense in the original proposal had been wrung out of it.<br />\n...<br />\nHow long such a program could last is anyone’s guess. But if landing on the Moon taught us anything, it’s that taxpayer enthusiasm for rock collecting has hard limits. At ~$100B per mission, and with launch windows to Mars one election cycle apart, NASA would be playing a form of programmatic Russian roulette. It’s hard to imagine landings going past the single digits before cost or an accident shut the program down.\n</blockquote>\nMembers of the cult of Musk will ignore the elephant in the room, which is life support, <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">but NASA cannot</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe things that make going to Mars hard are not fun space things, like needing a bigger rocket, but tedious limits of human physiology. Understanding these limits well enough to get to Mars will require years of human experiments beyond low Earth orbit.<br />\n<br />\nIn particular, we need preliminary data on the physiological effects of partial gravity, and a better estimate of the risk from heavy ion radiation. Since core tradeoffs around crew safety depend on the outcome, these experiments have to be done before NASA can finalize a mission design.\n</blockquote>\nBut partial gravity and radiation aren''t the <a href="https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm">big life support problem</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe chief technical obstacle to a Mars landing is not propulsion, but a lack of reliable closed-loop life support. With our current capability, NASA would struggle to keep a crew alive for six months on the White House lawn, let alone for years in a Martian yurt.<br />\n<br />\nThe technology program required to close this gap would be remarkably circular, with no benefits outside the field of applied zero gravity zookeeping. The web of Rube Goldberg devices that recycles floating animal waste on the space station has already cost twice its weight in gold and there is little appetite for it here on Earth, where plants do a better job for free.<br />\n...<br />\nWhat makes life support so vexing is that all the subcomponents interact with each other and with the crew. There’s no such thing as a life support unit test; you have to run the whole system in space under conditions that mimic the target mission. Reliability engineering for life support involves solving mysteries like why gunk formed on a certain washer on Day 732, then praying on the next run that your fix doesn’t break on Day 733. The process repeats until the first crew makes it home alive (figuratively speaking), at which point you declare the technology reliable and chill the champagne.\n</blockquote>\nNASA''s requirement is for a completely closed-loop life support system capable of keeping say 6 people healthy for at least 30 months. This is way beyond the state of the art. Musk''s is for a similar system capable of keeping a million people healthy indefinitely.<br />\n<br />\nThere isn''t a good justification for sending humans to Mars, and the technology for doing it doesn''t exist yet. Even assuming the bill was only $500B in 2023 dollars, the idea that Congress would consistently fund $20B every year for a program that wouldn''t produce its headline result for two-and-a-half decades fails the laugh test. Implausible is a polite way to describe the economics of NASA''s plan.<br />\n<br />\nLets suspend disbelief and assume some humans do land on Mars. \nTwo popular works of hard science fiction about Mars that are fairly plausible about logistics both ignore some of the known problems:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Andy Weir''s <i>The Martian</i> ignores two big problems. First, Mark Watney spends 549 sols (564 days) on the Martian surface plus the outbound and return trips, for a total of say 1000 days radiation exposure with no shielding. Second, he survives by eating potatoes grown in a mixture of Martian soil and human excrement.</li>\n<li>Kim Stanley Robinson''s <i>Martian Trilogy</i> describes how Mars is terraformed, including providing it with a breathable atmosphere. He doesn''t describe how the atmosphere is prevented from leaking back into space.</li>\n</ul>\nProblem 1: The collapse of Mars'' magnetic field caused it to lose its primordial atmosphere. Without a magnetic field, the same processes would require the terraformed atmosphere to be continually resupplied from elsewhere. Providing Mars with a magnetic field is an interesting engineering problem.<br />\n<br />\nProblem 2: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00159-021-00136-5"><i>Radiation environment for future human exploration on the surface of Mars: the current understanding based on MSL/RAD dose measurements</i></a> by Jingnan Guo <i>et al</i> states:<br />\n<blockquote>\n The accumulated GCR dose equivalent, via a Hohmann transfer, is about 0.65±0.24 sievert and 1.59±0.12 sievert during solar maximum and minimum periods, respectively.<br />\n...<br />\nA typical round-trip mission scenario to Mars using a Hohmann transfer trajectory both ways thus includes about 400–500 days of transit time and 500 days of surface stay.\n</blockquote>\n<a href="https://research.csu.edu.au/integrity-ethics-compliance/radiation/forms-templates-proformas/radiation-life/ionising/how-much">A 1 sievert dose</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn a short term dose is about the threshold for causing immediate radiation sickness in a person of average physical attributes, but would be unlikely to cause death. Above 1000 mSv, severity of illness increases with dose.\nIf doses greater than 1000 mSv occur over a long period they are less likely to have early health effects but they create a definite risk that cancer will develop many years later.\n</blockquote>\nLets say the radiation dose for the emigrants is around 0.75 sieverts/year. <a href="https://research.csu.edu.au/integrity-ethics-compliance/radiation/forms-templates-proformas/radiation-life/ionising/how-much">0.02 sieverts/year</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nAveraged over 5 years is the limit for radiological personnel such as employees in the nuclear industry, uranium or mineral sands miners and hospital workers (who are all closely monitored).\n</blockquote>\nSo the emigrants are subject to 36 times the radiation level considered safe for persons subjected to radiation in their jobs. Watney would likely get cancer. Robinson acknowledges but underplays the radiation issue.<br />\n<br />\nProblem 3: Plants grown in Martian soil will take up <a href="https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html">perchlorates</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n"Anybody who is saying they want to go live on the surface of Mars better think about the interaction of perchlorate with the human body," he warned. "At one-half percent, that''s a huge amount. Very small amounts are considered toxic. So you''d better have a plan to deal with the poisons on the surface."<br />\n<br />\nAny humans exploring Mars, Smith said, will find it hard to avoid the finest of dust particles. "It''ll get into everything…certainly into your habitat."<br />\n...<br />\nThe research emphasizes that perchlorate is widespread in Martian soils at concentrations of between 0.5 to 1 percent. There are dual implications of calcium perchlorate on Mars. On one hand, at such concentrations, perchlorate could be an important source of oxygen. But it could also become a critical chemical hazard to astronauts.\n</blockquote>\nPerchlorates aren''t just toxic, <a href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-03/documents/ffrrofactsheet_contaminant_perchlorate_january2014_final.pdf">but also</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nPerchlorate is highly soluble in water, and relatively stable and mobile in surface and subsurface aqueous systems.\n</blockquote>\nWatney would have been poisoned both by his potatoes and by breathing the Martian dust. So would Robinson''s Martians, who would also be poisoned by the Martian water.<br />\n<br />\nThe implications of the toxicity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchlorate#On_Mars">Martian dust</a> for human exploration are so awkward that the response seems to be "ignore it and hope it goes away". For example <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/science/mars-needs-insects.html"><i>Mars Needs Insects</i></a> by Sarah Scoles in the <i>NYT</i> is about the virtues of soldier fly larvae for growing plants in Martian regolith. It is based on research using simulated Martian regolith from a company called Martian Garden that <a href="https://www.themartiangarden.com/tech-specs"><i>doesn''t contain perchlorates</i></a>. Presumably this is because its toxicity would severely limit the potential market.<br />\n<br />\nBut toxicity isn''t the only problem posed by Martian dust. It is a real problem for <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/the-fact-and-fiction-of-martian-dust-storms/">solar power</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nMars’ dust storms aren’t totally innocuous, however. Individual dust particles on Mars are very small and slightly electrostatic, so they stick to the surfaces they contact like Styrofoam packing peanuts.<br />\n<br />\n“If you’ve seen pictures of Curiosity after driving, it’s just filthy,” Smith said. “The dust coats everything and it’s gritty; it gets into mechanical things that move, like gears.”<br />\n<br />\nThe possibility of dust settling on and in machinery is a challenge for engineers designing equipment for Mars.  <br />\n<br />\nThis dust is an especially big problem for solar panels. Even dust devils of only a few feet across — which are much smaller than traditional storms — can move enough dust to cover the equipment and decrease the amount of sunlight hitting the panels. Less sunlight means less energy created.<br />\n<br />\nIn “The Martian,” Watney spends part of every day sweeping dust off his solar panels to ensure maximum efficiency, which could represent a real challenge faced by future astronauts on Mars.<br />\n</blockquote>\nThis alone likely makes solar power impractical for powering human habitation on Mars. But there''s an even worse problem; every few years Mars is completely covered in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/the-fact-and-fiction-of-martian-dust-storms/">dust storm that lasts months</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\n“Once every three Mars years (about 5 ½ Earth years), on average, normal storms grow into planet-encircling dust storms, and we usually call those ‘global dust storms’ to distinguish them,” Smith said.<br />\n...<br />\nGlobal storms can also present a secondary issue, throwing enough dust into the atmosphere to reduce sunlight reaching the surface of Mars.<br />\n...<br />\nLarge global dust storms put enough dust in the air to completely cover the planet and block out the sun, but doing so ultimately dooms the storm itself. The radiative heat of sunlight reaching the surface of the planet is what drives these dust storms.\n</blockquote>\n<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwuiwZEvdFaNBDVxBkca-AY4T0r_F-3Hg2_XCEeoTztUBQTH95gKFNeYBrgcO_pJYU3TaHjYRR2YkDSNzcEI1Et_KRX-QKTPcnk5D3tpRZ_DTLfAwxxgG5e-d0HzT4KYEfd8uMeuS03-uiJA4dPxD0dDk2_W-9zyRQBBnDIll_hkgVlEf-9BRrOLoF2QnZ/s800/Mars_dust_opacities_MER-B_Sol_1205_to_1235.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="533" data-original-width="800" height="133" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwuiwZEvdFaNBDVxBkca-AY4T0r_F-3Hg2_XCEeoTztUBQTH95gKFNeYBrgcO_pJYU3TaHjYRR2YkDSNzcEI1Et_KRX-QKTPcnk5D3tpRZ_DTLfAwxxgG5e-d0HzT4KYEfd8uMeuS03-uiJA4dPxD0dDk2_W-9zyRQBBnDIll_hkgVlEf-9BRrOLoF2QnZ/w200-h133/Mars_dust_opacities_MER-B_Sol_1205_to_1235.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mars#Atmospheric_properties_and_processes">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\nThis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mars#Atmospheric_properties_and_processes">image is a</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTime-lapse composite of the Martian horizon as seen by the Opportunity rover over 30 Martian days; it shows how much sunlight the July 2007 dust storms blocked; Tau of 4.7 indicates 99% sunlight was blocked.\n</blockquote>\nIt is clearly uneconomic to over-provision solar panels by a factor of 100, even if they could be swept clear of dust. Nor is it practical to store enough power to last an unpredictable number of months while waiting out the storm. Nuclear reactors are the only feasible way to power human habitation on Mars, but putting tons of nuclear fuel on rockets that can fail and dump their contents in Earth''s atmosphere isn''t going to be popular. Let alone the chances of contaminating the Martian atmosphere when a reentry is misjudged.<br />\n<br />\nThese are far from the only known problems facing humans on Mars; there are bound to be many others, as yet unknown. Mitigating each of them will involve both difficult engineering and massive expense. All this for no clearly expressed benefit, and very clearly expressed negative scientific benefit. A far more practical and afforable policy would be to divert a small proportion of the funding from manned space-flight to a massive increase in automated exploration of the solar system and its plaents. And divert the rest to dealing with actual pressing problems on Earth, such as climate change.<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2023-12-26 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2024-01-03 18:04:20','read');

But in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2023/12/28/robocar-2023-in-review-the-fall-of-cruise/"><i>Robocar 2023 In Review: The Fall Of Cruise</i></a> he acknowledges that things aren''t going well:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLooking at 2023 in review for self-driving cars, one story stands out as the clear top story of the year, namely the fall of General Motors’ “Cruise” robotaxi division, which led to a pause of operations for Cruise over the whole USA, a ban on operations in California, the resignation of the founder/CEO and much more. That was actually the most prominent component of the other big story of the year, namely the battle between San Francisco and both Cruise and Waymo.<br />\n<br />\nEven this serious mistake should not have and perhaps would not have driven Cruise to its fate. The bigger mistake was they did not want to talk about it. They were eager to show the car’s recorded video of events to the press, and to officials, but only over Zoom. They did not mention the dragging, even when asked about it. I did not ask to see the part of the video after the crash, but others who did see it say it ended before the dragging. The DMV states they were not shown the dragging, and Cruise did not tell them about it, including in a letter they sent shortly after the events. Cruise insists they did show the full video to the DMV, and the DMV insists otherwise, but there is little doubt that they were not open about what was obviously the most important part of the chain of events when it came to understanding the role of the robotaxi in the calamity. Cruise was very eager to show that the initial crash was not their fault, but didn’t want to talk at all about their own serious mistake.\n</blockquote>\nLaura Dobberstein  reports on part of the aftermath in <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/gms_cruise_sacrifices_9_execs/"><i>GM''s Cruise sheds nine execs in the name of safety and integrity</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nGM’s self-driving taxi outfit, Cruise, has dismissed nine execs – including its chief operating officer – after staff withheld information regarding an incident in which a woman was injured by one of the firm''s robotaxis.<br />\n<br />\n"Today, following an initial analysis of the October 2 incident and Cruise''s response to it, nine individuals departed Cruise. These include key leaders from Legal, Government Affairs, and Commercial Operations, as well as Safety and Systems," a Cruise spokesperson told <i>The Register</i>.<br />\n<br />\n"As a company, we are committed to full transparency and are focused on rebuilding trust and operating with the highest standards when it comes to safety, integrity, and accountability and believe that new leadership is necessary to achieve these goals," the spokesperson added.\n</blockquote>\nIt isn''t just the executives who are feeling the pain, as Hayden Field and Michael Wayland report in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/gms-cruise-laying-off-900-or-24percent-of-its-workforce.html"><i>GM''s Cruise laying off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce: Read the memo here</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nCruise on Thursday announced internally that it will lay off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce, the company confirmed to CNBC.<br />\n<br />\nThe layoffs, which primarily affected commercial operations and related corporate functions, are the latest turmoil for the robotaxi startup and come one day after Cruise <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/gms-cruise-dismisses-nine-key-leaders-amid-safety-probe.html">dismissed nine “key leaders”</a> for the company’s response to an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise self-driving car after being struck by another vehicle.<br />\n<br />\nThe company had 3,800 employees before Thursday’s cuts, which also follow a round of contractor layoffs at Cruise last month.\n</blockquote>\nTempleton''s main argument is that Cruise mishandled the PR problem resulting from their vehicle dragging an injured pedestrian. They certainly did, in particular by apparently concealing information from the Dept. of Motor Vehicles. But the PR problem they faced is generic to autonomous vehicles. They are marketed as being safer than human drivers and, statistically, this may even be true. Waymo certainly makes a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/human-drivers-crash-a-lot-more-than-waymos-software-data-shows/">plausible claim</a>. But although "safer" implies it does not mean "safe", so serious crashes will inevitably occur.<br />\n<br />\nWhen they do the company''s PR department is in a no-win situation. The reporters who call asking for the company''s reaction know that the company has a vast amount of detailed information about what happened, logs and video. But the PR people don''t, and even if they did they don''t have the skills to interpret it. Given the nature of the AI driving the vehicle, it will take considerable time for the engineers to find the bug that was the root cause.<br />\n<br />\nThe honest thing for the PR people to say is "we don''t have the details, we''ll get back to you when we do". Reporters are likely to hear this as buying time for a cover-up.<br />\n<br />\nThe wrong thing for them to do is to give the reporters what little they know, and spin it in ways that minimize the company''s fault. Later, when the full details emerge, they will have been shown to have been covering up the worst. Next time, even if they are honest, they won''t be believed.<br />\n<br />\nThe PR problem is even worse because it is fundamentally asymmetric. The marketing pitch is that, statistically, autonomous vehicles cause less accidents than humans. But the public will never know about accidents that would have happened were a human driving, but were averted by the AI driver. They will know about accidents that did happen because the AI driver did something that a human would not have, as with the Uber and Cruise incidents. When set against the expectation of airline-level safety, this is an insuperable problem.<br />\n<br />\nIn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport"><i>Driverless cars were the future but now the truth is out: they’re on the road to nowhere</i></a>, Christian Wolmar who has a book about the autonomous winter entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driverless-Cars-Road-Nowhere-Perspectives/dp/1913019217/"><i>Driverless Cars: On a Road to Nowhere?</i></a> points out that Cruise isn''t the first robotaxi company felled by an accident. That would be Uber:<br />\n<blockquote>\nRight from the start, the hype far outpaced the technological advances. In 2010, at the Shanghai Expo, General Motors had produced a video showing a driverless car taking a pregnant woman to hospital at breakneck speed and, as the commentary assured the viewers, safely. It was precisely the promise of greater safety, cutting the terrible worldwide annual roads death toll of 1.25m, that the sponsors of driverless vehicles dangled in front of the public.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that is now proving their undoing. First to go was Uber after an accident in which one of its self-driving cars killed Elaine Herzberg in Phoenix, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode, and its “operator” was accused of watching a TV show, meaning they did not notice when the car hit Herzberg, who had confused its computers by stepping on to the highway pushing a bike carrying bags on its handlebars. Fatally, the computer could not interpret this confusing array of objects.<br />\n<br />\nUntil then, Uber’s business model had been predicated on the idea that within a few years it would dispense with drivers and provide a fleet of robotaxis. That plan died with Herzberg, and Uber soon pulled out of all its driverless taxi trials.\n</blockquote>\nIn her <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/12/self-driving-cars-hit-the-wall.html"><i>review of Wolmar''s book</i></a> Yves Smith makes two good points:<br />\n<blockquote>\nWolmar describes how this Brave New World has stalled out. The big reason is that the world is too complicated. or to put it in Taleb-like terms, there are way too many tail events to get them into training sets for AI in cars to learn about them. The other issue, which Wolmar does not make explicit, is that the public does not appear willing to accept the sort of slip-shod tech standards of buggy consumer software. The airline industry, which is very heavy regulated, has an impeccable safety record, and citizens appear to expect something closer to that…particularly citizens who don’t own or have investments in self-driving cars and never consented to their risks.\n</blockquote>\nIt isn''t just Cruise that is figuring out that <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html"><i>Robotaxi Economics</i></a> don''t work.  Rita Liao''s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/"><i>Facing roadblocks, China’s robotaxi darlings apply the brakes</i></a> reports that they don''t work in China either:<br />\n<blockquote>\nDespite years of hype and progress in self-driving technologies, the widespread availability of robotaxis remains a distant reality. That’s due to a confluence of challenges, including safety, regulations and costs.<br />\n<br />\nThe last factor, in particular, is what has pushed China’s robotaxi pioneers toward more opportunistic endeavors. To become profitable, robotaxis need to eventually remove human operators. Though China recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/china-autonomous-vehicle-driving-regulation/">clarified rules around the need for human supervision</a>, taxis without a driver behind the wheel are allowed only in restricted areas at present. To attract customers, robotaxi services offer deep discounts on their paid rides.<br />\n<br />\nOnce the subsidies are gone and initial user curiosity wanes, who’s willing to pay the same amount as taxi fares for a few fixed routes?<br />\n<br />\nStruggling to address that question, China’s robotaxi startups have woken up to the money-burning reality of their business.\n</blockquote>\nSo they are pivoting to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/">viable product</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nOne logical path to monetize self-driving technology is to sell a less robust version of the technology, namely, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that still require human intervention.<br />\n<br />\nDeeproute, which is backed by Alibaba, significantly scaled back its robotaxi operations this year and plunged right into supplying ADAS to automakers. Its production-ready solution, which includes its smart driving software and lidar-powered hardware, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/autonomous-driving-darling-deeproute-ai-sets-sight-on-europe-carmakers/">sold competitively at $2,000</a>. Similarly, Baidu is “downgrading the tech stacks” to find paying customers on its way up what it calls the “Mount Everest of self-driving.”<br />\n<br />\n“The experience and insight gleaned from deploying our solutions in [mass-produced] vehicles is being fed into our self-driving technology, giving us a unique moat around security and data,” a Baidu spokesperson said.\n</blockquote>\nNot a good year for the robotaxi concept, the thing that was supposed to distinguish Tesla''s cars from everyone else''s because they would earn their owners money while they slept.<br />\n<h3>Tesla</h3>\nAs usual, when it comes to self-driving Tesla''s story is worse than almost everyone else''s. Elon Musk famously claimed that <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-worth-zero-without-fsd-why-he-is-completely-wrong-191416.html">Tesla is worth zero without Full Self Driving</a>. But although this is typical Musk BS, but unlike some other utterances it contains a kernel of truth. Tesla is valued as a <i>technology</i> company not a <i>car</i> company. Thus it is critical for Telsa that its technology be viewed as better than those of other car companies; anything that suggests it is limited or inadequate is a big problem not just for the company but also for Musk''s personal wealth.<br />\n<br />\nI believe this is why Tesla hasn''t implemented effective driver monitoring nor geo-fenced their systems. And why members of the Musk cult are so keen on defeating the driver monitoring system with weights on the steering wheel and smiley-face stickers on the camera. Depending upon what you believe, the technology is either groundbreaking autonomy or a below average Level-2 driver assistance system (Mercedes has fielded a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">Level 3 system</a>). The congnitive dissonance between the pronouncements of the cult leader and the reality of continually being "nagged" about the limits of the technology is too hard for the cult members to take.<br />\n<br />\nThe <i>Washington Post</i> team of Trisha Thadani, Rachel Lerman, Imogen Piper, Faiz Siddiqui and Irfan Uraizee has been delivering outstanding reporting on Tesla''s technology. They started on Octoober 6<sup>th</sup> with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/"><i>The final 11 seconds of a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash</i></a>, in which a Tesla driver enabled Autopilot in conditions for which it was not designed, and set the speed to 14mph above the limit. Then on December 10<sup>th</sup> they followed with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/"><i>Tesla drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly consequences</i></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/"><i>Why Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you think</i></a>.<br />\n<br />\nThey recount a 2019 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">crash in Florida</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nA Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about 70 mph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was “driving on cruise” and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.<br />\n<br />\nBut the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It occurred on a rural road where Tesla’s Autopilot technology was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/">not designed to be used</a>. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and obtained exclusively by The Post shows the car blowing through a stop sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends and drivers must turn left or right.\n</blockquote>\nNote that, just like the repeated <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-opens-formal-probe-tesla-autopilot_n_611a651de4b0f7bc26a7eef4">crashes into emergency vehicles</a>, the victims did not volunteer to debug Tesla''s software. And also that the Autopilot system was driving 15mph above the speed limit on a road it wasn''t designed for, just like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">2019 Banner crash</a> into a semi-trailer. As I wrote about <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">that crash</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIt is typical of Tesla''s disdain for the law that, although their cars have GPS and can therefore know the speed limit, they didn''t bother to program Autopilot to obey the law.<br />\n...<br />\nAgain, Tesla''s disdain for the safety of their customers, not to mention other road users, meant that despite the car knowing which road it was on and thus whether it was a road that Autopilot should not be activated on, it allowed Banner to enable it.\n</blockquote>\nFederal regulators have known there was a problem for more than seven years, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">haven''t taken effective action</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nNor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called for limits on where driver-assistance technology could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, the NTSB has no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto safety standards — but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.\n</blockquote>\nThe reason may be that car manufacturers "self-certify" <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">conformance with safety standards</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nThe <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">string of Autopilot crashes</a> reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly evolving technology to operate on the nation’s roadways without significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics argue the agency’s approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed technology to put Tesla drivers — and those around them — at risk.<br />\n<br />\nThe approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment — such as recurring issues with Boeing’s 737 Max — have resulted in sweeping action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a process called “type certification,” passenger car models are not prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to meet.\n</blockquote>\nAnd Tesla''s self-certification is self-serving.<br />\n<br />\nSelf-certification would work well if the penalty for false certification was severe, but the NTHSA has declined to impose <i>any</i> penalty for Tesla''s manifestly inadequate system.  It seems that the team''s reporting finally drove the NHTSA to do <i>something</i> about the long-standing problems of Autopilot. Reuters reported that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/13/tesla-recall-us-autopilot"><i>Tesla recalls more than 2m vehicles in US over Autopilot system</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted with its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new safeguards, after a safety regulator said the system was open to “foreseeable misuse”.<br />\n<br />\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been investigating the electric automaker led by the billionaire Elon Musk for more than two years over whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay attention when using the driver assistance system.<br />\n<br />\nTesla said in the recall filing that Autopilot’s software system controls “may not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse” and could increase the risk of a crash.<br />\n...<br />\nSeparately, since 2016, NHTSA has opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to date.<br />\n<br />\nNHTSA said there might be an increased risk of a crash in situations when the system is engaged but the driver does not maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to intervene or fails to recognize when it is canceled or not.\n</blockquote>\nThe obfuscation is extraordinary &mdash; "forseeable misuse", "may not be sufficient" and "could increase". There is no "foreseeable", "may" nor "could"; multiple people have already <i>died</i> because the system <i>was</i> abused. When Tesla is sued about these deaths, their <i>defense is that the system was abused</i>! I believe the system is specifically <i>designed</i> to allow abuse, because preventing abuse would puncture the hype bubble.<br />\n<br />\nFortunately from the NTHSA''s point of view the recall is pure kabuki, posing no risk from Musk''s attack-dog lawyers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/buttigieg-defends-safety-agency-appointment-after-musk-claims-bias/">cult</a> <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/tesla-missy-cummings-nhtsa-elon-musk.html">members</a> because the over-the-air update is cheap and doesn''t actually fix the problem. The <i>Washington Post</i>''s headline writers didn''t understand this whan they captioned the team''s timeline <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall-timeline/"><i>How Tesla Autopilot got grounded</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nNow, more than 2 million Tesla vehicles are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/">receiving a software update</a> to address “insufficient” controls to combat driver inattention while in Autopilot mode. Here’s how the recall unfolded, according to documents from Tesla, safety officials and reporting by The Washington Post.\n</blockquote>\nThe team did understand that Autopilot hadn''t been "grounded". In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/"><i>Recalling almost every Tesla in America won’t fix safety issues, experts say</i></a> they lay it out:<br />\n<blockquote>\nTesla this week agreed to issue a remote update to 2 million cars aimed at improving driver attention while Autopilot is engaged, especially on surface roads with cross traffic and other hazards the driver-assistance technology is not designed to detect.<br />\n<br />\nBut the recall — the largest in Tesla’s 20-year history — quickly drew condemnation from experts and lawmakers, who said new warnings and alerts are unlikely to solve Autopilot’s fundamental flaw: that Tesla fails to limit where drivers can turn it on in the first place.<br />\n...<br />\nTesla has repeatedly acknowledged in user manuals, legal documents and communications with federal regulators that Autosteer is “intended for use on controlled-access highways” with “a center divider, clear lane markings, and no cross traffic.”\n</blockquote>\nThe <i>Washington Post</i>''s Geoffrey A. Fowler checked on the result of the kabuki, and wrote <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/tesla-autopilot-recall-test/"><i>Testing Tesla’s Autopilot recall, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should you</i></a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nLast weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing down.<br />\n<br />\nIn December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall, affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software.<br />\n<br />\nAfter testing my Tesla update, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should you, knowing that this technology is on the same roads you use.<br />\n<br />\nDuring my drive, the updated Tesla steered itself on urban San Francisco streets Autopilot wasn’t designed for. (I was careful to let the tech do its thing only when my hands were hovering by the wheel and I was paying attention.) The recall was supposed to force drivers to pay more attention while using Autopilot by sensing hands on the steering wheel and checking for eyes on the road. Yet my car drove through the city with my hands off the wheel for stretches of a minute or more. I could even activate Autopilot after I placed a sticker over the car’s interior camera used to track my attention.\n</blockquote>\nFowler concludes "I found we have every reason to be skeptical this recall does much of anything". Good job, Tesla!<br />\n<br />\nAs a final note Rishi Sunak, the UK''s tech-bro Prime Minister is naturally determined to make the UK a leader in autonomous vehicles with his new legislation on the subject. But, being a tech-bro, he has no idea of the fundamental problem they pose. Wolmar does understand it, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport">writing</a>:<br />\n<blockquote>\nIn the UK, Tesla will fall foul of the legislation introduced into parliament last month, which prevents companies from misleading the public about the capability of their vehicles. Tesla’s troubles have been compounded by the revelations from ex-employee Lukasz Krupski who claims the self-drive capabilities of Teslas <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67591311">pose a risk to the public</a>. Manufacturers will be forced to specify precisely which functions of the car – steering, brakes, acceleration – have been automated. Tesla will have to change its marketing approach in order to comply. So, while the bill has been promoted as enabling the more rapid introduction of driverless cars, meeting its restrictive terms may prove to be an insuperable obstacle for their developers.\n</blockquote>\nTesla''s stock market valuation <i>depends</i> upon "misleading the public about the capability of their vehicles".<br />\n<br />','\n',char(10)),NULL,'','2024-01-09 16:00:00','David Rosenthal''s blog','',NULL,'2024-01-09 16:25:50','read');
