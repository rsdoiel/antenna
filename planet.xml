      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today is the federal holiday that honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was born January 15, 1929. He was assassinated April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just 39 years old. While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed the cause of the poor and organized the Poor People&#8217;s Campaign to address issues of economic justice. Dr. King was also a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy and the Vietnam War. We play his &#8220;Beyond Vietnam&#8221; speech, which he delivered at New York City’s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967, as well as his last speech, &#8220;I&#8217;ve Been to the Mountaintop,&#8221; that he gave on April 3, 1968, the night before he was assassinated.]]>

      <title>&#34;This Regime Will Fall&#34;: Director Jafar Panahi on Deadly Iran Protests &#38; Filmmaking Under Censorship</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/15/jafar_panahi</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[With Iran gripped by nationwide protests that activists say have left at least 2,600 people dead, we recently spoke with renowned Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, whose latest film, <em>It Was Just an Accident</em>, was shot entirely in secret inside Iran and won the Palme d&#8217;Or at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. The film has since been shortlisted for an Oscar in the international feature category. Panahi dedicated a recent New York Film Critics Circle Award to Iranian protesters.</p>
        <p><em>It Was Just an Accident</em> centers on a group of former prisoners who kidnap a man they believe was their interrogator and grapple with whether to exact revenge, and Panahi says the film drew directly from his own experience with state violence and repression. Panahi has been repeatedly arrested in Iran, served prison sentences, and was recently sentenced in absentia to an additional year in prison and a two-year travel ban.</p>
        <p>In an extended interview, Pahani discussed the protests in Iran, fighting against censorship, and the risk of prolonged cycles of violence. &#8220;I have always said this regime will fall. It is impossible for it to not fall, because it&#8217;s a failed state in every sense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I care about is the future of my country. I want the country to stand. I want there to be peace, and I want our children and the children of our children to not be facing bullets.&#8221; He was interpreted by Sheida Dayani.]]>

The film has since been shortlisted for an Oscar in the international feature category. Panahi dedicated a recent New York Film Critics Circle Award to Iranian protesters.

_It Was Just an Accident_ centers on a group of former prisoners who kidnap a man they believe was their interrogator and grapple with whether to exact revenge, and Panahi says the film drew directly from his own experience with state violence and repression. Panahi has been repeatedly arrested in Iran, served prison sentences, and was recently sentenced in absentia to an additional year in prison and a two-year travel ban.

In an extended interview, Pahani discussed the protests in Iran, fighting against censorship, and the risk of prolonged cycles of violence. “I have always said this regime will fall. It is impossible for it to not fall, because it’s a failed state in every sense,” he said. “What I care about is the future of my country. I want the country to stand. I want there to be peace, and I want our children and the children of our children to not be facing bullets.” He was interpreted by Sheida Dayani.</source:markdown>

      <title>Supreme Court Appears Poised to Uphold State Bans on Trans Student Athletes</title>

        <![CDATA[When Becky Pepper-Jackson started middle school, she wanted to join her school&#8217;s track and field team. Like many girls her age, she was excited to make new friends and cultivate a passion for a sport. But unlike the other girls on her school&#8217;s track and field team, Pepper-Jackson is trans. And because she lives in West Virginia, a state which has banned transgender girls from participating in public school sports, Pepper-Jackson was excluded from what for her classmates is a normal childhood experience. Pepper-Jackson sued, and her case is now before the conservative-majority Supreme Court — which, after oral arguments Tuesday, appears likely to uphold similar laws throughout the country. &#8220;The states have attempted to justify these things in terms of some sort of alleged sex-based athletic advantage,&#8221; says Karen L.

Vali Nasr, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, says the U.S. “can wage full-scale war on Iran — which President Trump does not seem to be eager to do — or it can hope to squeeze Iran economically in order to create political unrest in Iran.”

“We feel like we’re being forced out because of this fire and not really getting the support that we need from our elected officials to be sure to preserve and protect our Black and Brown community,” says Hughes.

      <title>Iran Escalates Deadly Crackdown on Mass Protests as Trump Threatens to Launch Military Attack</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/12/iran_protests</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in Iran as authorities crack down on protests against inflation and the government&#8217;s handling of the economic crisis, with thousands more arrested amid a nationwide communications blackout. The protests started in late December and quickly spread across the country, marking the strongest internal challenge to the Iranian government in years. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran in support of the protesters.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Many civil and political activists in Iran have warned against any kind of foreign intervention, because it actually increases repression inside of the country,&#8221; says Narges Bajoghli, associate professor of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <p>We also speak with Iranian dissident Hamidreza Mohammadi, brother of the imprisoned Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi.

      <source:markdown>Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in Iran as authorities crack down on protests against inflation and the government’s handling of the economic crisis, with thousands more arrested amid a nationwide communications blackout. The protests started in late December and quickly spread across the country, marking the strongest internal challenge to the Iranian government in years. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran in support of the protesters.

“Many civil and political activists in Iran have warned against any kind of foreign intervention, because it actually increases repression inside of the country,” says Narges Bajoghli, associate professor of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.

We also speak with Iranian dissident Hamidreza Mohammadi, brother of the imprisoned Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi. Speaking from Oslo, he says he has been unable to reach his family inside Iran since the start of the protests. “In the lack of internet and telephone communication, the regime has been able to kill a lot of people,” Mohammadi says. “People in Iran simply want \[a\] different system, and they don’t want to be enslaved by this regime for its ideological purposes.”</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[Israeli American Liat Beinin Atzili was taken captive during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Over the next two months, her family members, including film director Brandon Kramer, tirelessly advocated for her release, an endeavor now documented in Kramer&#8217;s new film, <em>Holding Liat</em>. We speak to Atzili and Kramer about their family&#8217;s ordeal and Atzili&#8217;s captivity in Gaza, where she was held in isolation alongside another Israeli woman by members of Hamas until November 2023. &#8220;They kept telling us that they had no idea what was going on with other hostages, and that it was their job to keep us safe and to keep us healthy until we were released in a hostage deal. And that&#8217;s what they did,&#8221; she says. Since her release, Atzili has become a fierce advocate for peace and reconciliation. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t any conflicts that are unsolvable. It&#8217;s just a matter of people wanting to speak to each other and wanting to listen and to understand each other&#8217;s stories,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t do that, we&#8217;re just allowing violence to take over.&#8221;</p>

      <title>&#34;The Voice of Hind Rajab,&#34; Shortlisted for Oscar, Uses Audio of 6-Year-Old Girl Killed in Gaza</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Two years ago this month, the world was gripped by a series of shocking recordings of a 6-year-old girl in Gaza pleading for help as she sat trapped in a car riddled with bullets alongside the bodies of her cousins, aunt and uncle, who had just been killed by Israeli forces as the family attempted to flee the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza City. Emergency responders with the Palestine Red Crescent Society attempted to secure safe passage to rescue the child, an elementary school student named Hind Rajab, but Israeli forces also targeted and destroyed an ambulance as it arrived on the scene, killing medical workers Yusuf al-Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun, before firing again at the family&#8217;s car, killing Rajab.</p>
        <p>&#8220;When you hear her voice, you can&#8217;t unhear it,&#8221; says the award-winning Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, whose new Oscar-shortlisted film, <em>The Voice of Hind Rajab</em>, incorporates recordings of Rajab&#8217;s emergency calls to depict responders&#8217; race-against-the-clock attempt to save her — and the ultimate failure of the international community to prevent her violent death. Ben Hania says the film, a hybrid of documentary and drama, is an effort to &#8220;honor [Rajab&#8217;s] voice, but also to tell this incredible story of those heroes trying to save lives in impossible conditions.&#8221;]]>

      <source:markdown>U.S. forces have seized two more oil tankers with links to Venezuela, days after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and abducted President Nicolás Maduro along with his wife, making former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez the new leader of the country. “This is a decapitation without regime change,” says Venezuelan economist Francisco Rodríguez. “The political system in Venezuela remains intact.” In Caracas, former Venezuelan diplomat Carlos Ron says Maduro is a “prisoner of war” and that Venezuelans “are angry and are upset about this incursion from the United States.” This comes as the Trump administration has announced plans to control sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely.”</source:markdown>

With investments across sectors like real estate, hospitality, media, cryptocurrency and more, the Trumps are “increasingly integrating their business empire” into the wider U.S. economy, says David Uberti, who has been reporting on the family’s self-enrichment for _The Wall Street Journal_.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<i>Zeteo</i>&#39;s Mehdi Hasan outlines Donald Trump&#39;s &#8220;Donroe Doctrine,&#8221; a throwback foreign policy exemplified by the Trump administration&#8217;s shocking intervention in Venezuela.

      <source:markdown>_Zeteo_&#39;s Mehdi Hasan outlines Donald Trump&#39;s “Donroe Doctrine,” a throwback foreign policy exemplified by the Trump administration’s shocking intervention in Venezuela. With his claims of U.S. sovereignty over nations in the Western Hemisphere, “Trump’s basically saying, &#39;Well, this is ours, and China, Russia can have their spheres of influence.&#39; And it is very 19th-century-esque. ’Let’s divide up the world between the powers.’” This orientation is a major shift from U.S. foreign policy of recent decades, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when interventionist actions were framed around ideological motivations, explains Hasan. “They said it was WMDs. They said it was democracy. They said it was al-Qaeda. They at least pretended that it wasn’t about the oil.” Meanwhile, Trump is brazen about his aims to seize control of Venezuela’s resources and demonstrate that “might is right.”</source:markdown>
