BBC Director General Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, head of BBC News, have resigned over accusations that the broadcaster has been biased in its coverage of US President Donald Trump, the war in Gaza, and transgender issues. The allegations followed a memo published by the Telegraph in which Michael Prescott, a former external adviser on editorial standards at the BBC, raised concerns over &quot;systemic&quot; bias in coverage. Prescott&apos;s primary criticism was aimed at what he says was the selective edit of a January 6, 2021 speech made by Trump to supporters, which aired in a BBC Panorama episode ahead of the 2024 US election. Some pundits have responded to the resignations with claims that the BBC is the target of a right-wing political campaign to dismantle the media organization.
