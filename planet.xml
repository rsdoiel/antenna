      <source:markdown>We look at _All the Walls Came Down_, a new short documentary directed by filmmaker Ondi Timoner that looks back at the devastating 2025 fires in Los Angeles, which destroyed Timoner’s home and left the historically Black community of Altadena in ruins. The film, which has been shortlisted for an Academy Award, follows community organizer Heavenly Hughes as residents confront the aftermath of the fires and organize to rebuild their town.

“We feel like we’re being forced out because of this fire and not really getting the support that we need from our elected officials to be sure to preserve and protect our Black and Brown community,” says Hughes.

Timoner says Southern California Edison, which has taken responsibility for the Eaton Fire, has refused to tap its emergency funds. The utility company needs to “bridge families over so that they’re not pushed off their generational land,” Timoner says. “It’s an urgent situation in our town.”

        <![CDATA[Israeli American Liat Beinin Atzili was taken captive during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Over the next two months, her family members, including film director Brandon Kramer, tirelessly advocated for her release, an endeavor now documented in Kramer&#8217;s new film, <em>Holding Liat</em>. We speak to Atzili and Kramer about their family&#8217;s ordeal and Atzili&#8217;s captivity in Gaza, where she was held in isolation alongside another Israeli woman by members of Hamas until November 2023. &#8220;They kept telling us that they had no idea what was going on with other hostages, and that it was their job to keep us safe and to keep us healthy until we were released in a hostage deal. And that&#8217;s what they did,&#8221; she says. Since her release, Atzili has become a fierce advocate for peace and reconciliation. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t any conflicts that are unsolvable. It&#8217;s just a matter of people wanting to speak to each other and wanting to listen and to understand each other&#8217;s stories,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t do that, we&#8217;re just allowing violence to take over.&#8221;</p>

      <title>&#34;The Voice of Hind Rajab,&#34; Shortlisted for Oscar, Uses Audio of 6-Year-Old Girl Killed in Gaza</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/9/the_voice_of_hind_rajab</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Two years ago this month, the world was gripped by a series of shocking recordings of a 6-year-old girl in Gaza pleading for help as she sat trapped in a car riddled with bullets alongside the bodies of her cousins, aunt and uncle, who had just been killed by Israeli forces as the family attempted to flee the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza City. Emergency responders with the Palestine Red Crescent Society attempted to secure safe passage to rescue the child, an elementary school student named Hind Rajab, but Israeli forces also targeted and destroyed an ambulance as it arrived on the scene, killing medical workers Yusuf al-Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun, before firing again at the family&#8217;s car, killing Rajab.</p>
        <p>&#8220;When you hear her voice, you can&#8217;t unhear it,&#8221; says the award-winning Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, whose new Oscar-shortlisted film, <em>The Voice of Hind Rajab</em>, incorporates recordings of Rajab&#8217;s emergency calls to depict responders&#8217; race-against-the-clock attempt to save her — and the ultimate failure of the international community to prevent her violent death. Ben Hania says the film, a hybrid of documentary and drama, is an effort to &#8220;honor [Rajab&#8217;s] voice, but also to tell this incredible story of those heroes trying to save lives in impossible conditions.&#8221;]]>

      <source:markdown>We speak with two people who responded to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by an ICE agent in Minneapolis Wednesday. Trump administration officials claim the agent acted in self-defense, but local officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, reject that claim.

“This could happen to you in your city,” says Robin Wonsley, member of the Minneapolis City Council. “This happening here in Minneapolis sets a tone for this to play out in many other cities.”

The shooting comes after the Trump administration deployed over 2,000 ICE agents to Minnesota.

“This is not normal,” says Edwin Torres DeSantiago with the Immigrant Defense Network, which monitors ICE activity and has received thousands of requests from Minnesotans who want to volunteer as “constitutional observers” of ICE in Minneapolis. “We’ve been seeing people terrorized all over the state and all over the country under the guise of protection.”</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[His name might not be familiar to many, but his songs are sung by millions around the world. Today, we take a journey through the life and work of Yip Harburg, the Broadway lyricist who wrote such hits as &#8220;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&#8221; and who put the music into <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the movie that inspired the hit Broadway musical and now Hollywood blockbuster, <em>Wicked</em>. Born into poverty on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Harburg always included a strong social and political component to his work, fighting racism and poverty. A lifelong socialist, Harburg was blacklisted and hounded throughout much of his life. We speak with Harburg&#8217;s son, Ernie Harburg, about the music and politics of his father. Then we take an in-depth look at <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, and hear a medley of Harburg&#8217;s Broadway songs and the politics of the times in which they were created.]]>
