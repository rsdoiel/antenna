      <title>&#34;Witch Hunt&#34;: Jailed U.K. Palestine Action Activists Continue Hunger Strike Despite Health Risks</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[His name might not be familiar to many, but his songs are sung by millions around the world. Today, we take a journey through the life and work of Yip Harburg, the Broadway lyricist who wrote such hits as &#8220;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&#8221; and who put the music into <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the movie that inspired the hit Broadway musical and now Hollywood blockbuster, <em>Wicked</em>. Born into poverty on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Harburg always included a strong social and political component to his work, fighting racism and poverty. A lifelong socialist, Harburg was blacklisted and hounded throughout much of his life. We speak with Harburg&#8217;s son, Ernie Harburg, about the music and politics of his father. Then we take an in-depth look at <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, and hear a medley of Harburg&#8217;s Broadway songs and the politics of the times in which they were created.]]>

      <title>Doctors in Jail? Hospitals Stripped of Fed Funding? The Criminalization of Trans Youth Healthcare</title>

        <![CDATA[The Trump administration on Thursday announced new measures to target hospitals and doctors providing care to trans youth. Under the new rules unveiled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads Medicaid and Medicare, the government would strip federal funding for any hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The new rules were announced a day after the House of Representatives narrowly approved a bill that aims to criminalize providing gender-affirming medical care for any transgender person under 18 and subject providers to hefty fines and prison time.</p>
        <p>&#8220;This is a drastic departure from any concern about science, concern about parents and their rights,&#8221; says Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union&#8217;s <span class="caps">LGBTQ</span> &amp; <span class="caps">HIV</span> Project. &#8220;It is putting hospitals in an impossible situation, and just another example of this administration undermining and threatening all of our health and welfare.&#8221;</p>
        <p>We also speak with Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist who works with transgender youth in New York City. He says the families he works with are &#8220;terrified right now,&#8221; but vows to continue his work. &#8220;I refuse to stop providing this care, knowing that I could potentially face 10 years in prison and a felony charge. I&#8217;m willing to go down that route, if necessary.&#8221;]]>
