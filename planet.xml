      <title>Trump Family Businesses Rake in $4 Billion After His Reelection with Focus on AI, Crypto &#38; Nuclear</title>

        <![CDATA[Ventures launched by the Trump family since Donald Trump&#8217;s reelection have generated at least $4 billion in proceeds and paper wealth for the Trump family. With investments across sectors like real estate, hospitality, media, cryptocurrency and more, the Trumps are &#8220;increasingly integrating their business empire&#8221; into the wider U.S. economy, says David Uberti, who has been reporting on the family&#8217;s self-enrichment for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The coupling of Trump&#8217;s economic and political influence is raising major questions about conflicts of interest. &#8220;You have all of these different business interests in different areas in which the government regulates,&#8221; and this &#8220;proximity to power may help along some of these deals and the valuations at which they&#8217;re made.&#8221;</p>

He appeared in more than 40 films and directed documentaries highlighting the experiences of Palestinians living under occupation. &#8220;On a personal level, I can&#8217;t tell you how much I loved him,&#8221; says Levy. On one hand, Levy describes him as a &#8220;brave Palestinian patriot.&#8221; On the other hand, he was a victim of &#8220;Israeli machinery, which totally crushed his life and his career.&#8221; Bakri was best known for his 2002 documentary <em>Jenin, Jenin</em>, featuring the voices of Palestinians in the Jenin refugee camp following a devastating Israeli military operation that killed 52 Palestinians. The film is banned in Israel. &#8220;Literature, poetry, cinema, art, cooking — any creative work that Palestinians do that reflects their humanity and their attachment to their ancient land, the Israelis and the Zionist movement want to crush this,&#8221; adds Khouri.]]>

      <title>&#34;Witch Hunt&#34;: Jailed U.K. Palestine Action Activists Continue Hunger Strike Despite Health Risks</title>

        <![CDATA[Alarm is growing over the treatment and deteriorating health of eight pro-Palestinian activists jailed in the United Kingdom who are on hunger strike to protest their detention. The activists remain imprisoned as they await trial over charges linked to their work with Palestine Action, which the British government has banned under its Terrorism Act over direct action protests against Israel&#8217;s treatment of Palestinians. Several of the activists who began their hunger strike in early November are now in &#8220;a critical stage&#8221; and facing grave health risks or death, according to Dr. James Smith, a doctor supporting the hunger strikers. &#8220;This is an extremely critical moment, and, frankly speaking, it defies comprehension that members of the government have refused even to meet with the hunger strikers in an attempt to resolve this situation.&#8221;</p>
        <p>We also speak with Francesca Nadin, a spokesperson for Prisoners for Palestine, which is supporting the jailed activists. She says the harsh treatment of the hunger strikers is part of a &#8220;coordinated witch hunt that reflects the wider repression of the pro-Palestine movement&#8221; in the U.K. and around the world. &#8220;The people that have taken part in this hunger strike feel like they have no other choice left to them but to take this into their own hands,&#8221; Nadin says.]]>

      <title>&#34;Out for Blood&#34;: Writer Jasper Nathaniel on Surviving Israeli Settler Attack on W. Bank Olive Farmers</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/12/23/jasper_nathaniel</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We speak to independent journalist Jasper Nathaniel, who has recently returned from documenting Israeli settler and state violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Nathaniel describes being ambushed by settlers in October, on the first day of the olive harvest, in an attack that left one middle-aged Palestinian woman with a brain hemorrhage. &#8220;It was clear that this was a planned ambush,&#8221; says Nathaniel. &#8220;They were out for blood.&#8221; Earlier this week, the Israeli Cabinet approved 19 more settlements in the occupied West Bank. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening right now is these really violent settlers are going out into the fields. They&#8217;re stealing land from Palestinians,&#8221; explains Nathaniel. &#8220;[Then the government will] retroactively legalize the land that was stolen, and basically reward the violent settlers by giving them the stamp of state legitimacy.&#8221;]]>

      <title>Doctors in Jail? Hospitals Stripped of Fed Funding? The Criminalization of Trans Youth Healthcare</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/12/19/trans_healthcare</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Trump administration on Thursday announced new measures to target hospitals and doctors providing care to trans youth. Under the new rules unveiled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads Medicaid and Medicare, the government would strip federal funding for any hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The new rules were announced a day after the House of Representatives narrowly approved a bill that aims to criminalize providing gender-affirming medical care for any transgender person under 18 and subject providers to hefty fines and prison time.</p>
        <p>&#8220;This is a drastic departure from any concern about science, concern about parents and their rights,&#8221; says Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union&#8217;s <span class="caps">LGBTQ</span> &amp; <span class="caps">HIV</span> Project. &#8220;It is putting hospitals in an impossible situation, and just another example of this administration undermining and threatening all of our health and welfare.&#8221;</p>
        <p>We also speak with Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist who works with transgender youth in New York City. He says the families he works with are &#8220;terrified right now,&#8221; but vows to continue his work. &#8220;I refuse to stop providing this care, knowing that I could potentially face 10 years in prison and a felony charge. I&#8217;m willing to go down that route, if necessary.&#8221;]]>

        <![CDATA[Former immigration judge Tania Nemer, who was fired in February, is now suing the Trump administration, alleging that she was discriminated against despite strong performance reviews. Nemer is one of about 100 immigration judges who have been fired or reassigned since Trump took office. The system is notoriously backlogged, with more than 3 million cases pending. &#8220;I was pulled away in the middle of the hearing,&#8221; she says.</p>
        <p>Nemer filed a discrimination complaint with the Department of Justice, which officials dismissed, citing Article II of the Constitution on presidential powers. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been practicing employment law and representing federal employees for almost 30 years, and I have never seen a federal agency dismiss a complaint for this reason,&#8221; says Nemer&#8217;s attorney, James Eisenmann.]]>
