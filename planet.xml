      <link>https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-11/pope-leo-xiv-motu-proprio-presidency-vatican-city-commission.html</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>With a Motu Proprio, Pope Leo XIV has abrogated Article 8 n. 1 of the previous Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, which had allowed only cardinals to serve as president of the Commission, a position currently held by Sister Raffaella Petrini. The Pope, therefore, consolidates a change wanted by Francis and resolves an issue that had emerged due to increasingly “complex and pressing” governance needs.</p>
