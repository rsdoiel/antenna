<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Kilauea has been erupting episodically for the past two months in Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u, nested within the south end of Kaluapele, the summit caldera. Captivating lava fountains burst from the vent(s) during each eruption episode. Fascinating as those episodes are, scientists at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are equally as interested in what&amp;#8217;s happening beneath the surface between episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
