<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Ihave written about how the Portuguese traders had such an influence in Japan, introducing bread and frying which then created manju or anpan, (&amp;#8220;pan&amp;#8221; comes from the Portuguese word for bread), breaded katsu and tempura. All these adopted foods became very important in Japanese cuisine. Last week I wrote about how the Chinese, Indians, Arabs and the Dutch influenced the foods of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, they figured, their political party might stand a chance in November &amp;#8212; though many still expressed deep doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;A couple of decades ago, universities entered a new kind of competition. In addition to the academic programs, campuses were enhancing their living and recreation facilities. I still remember the first time I heard about the lazy river installed at Louisiana State University in 2017 that spelled out &amp;#8220;LSU,&amp;#8221; but they were by no means the only university that sought to woo students based on out-of-class amenities. Water parks, giant spa pools, aquatic basketball, etc. popped up at several large campuses. Predictably, there was also backlash from faculty and citizens, especially concerning these projects at public universities (see the NY Times opinion piece &amp;#8220;No College Kid Needs a Water Park to Study&amp;#8221;). Still, despite these amenities, students still come to universities to learn and to gain the credentials to make a good living, support their families, and contribute to the well-being of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

spicier sectors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Iused to think of Athens as a big ugly city with obligatory ancient sights, fine museums, the Plaka (the extremely touristy old center), and not much else. &amp;#8220;The joy of Greece is outside of Athens,&amp;#8221; I wrote. &amp;#8220;See Athens&amp;#8217; museums and scram.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;When Venice introduced a 5 euro entrance fee in April, officials said the aim was to dissuade day-trippers from visiting at peak times, in a bid to ease the pressure on beleaguered residents forced to share the fragile Italian city&amp;#8217;s limited space and public resources.&lt;/p&gt;
