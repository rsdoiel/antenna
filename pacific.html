<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There were &amp;#8220;years of heartbreak,&amp;#8221; songwriter Johnny Marks once recalled of his start in the music business in 1935. He eventually found some modest success collaborating on a No. 1 hit for the Ink Spots, &amp;#8220;Address Unknown,&amp;#8221; and songs made popular by Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller. It was just enough renown for Billboard magazine to briefly note his decision to pause to volunteer for World War II in the spring of 1942, when he enlisted as a U.S. Army private.&lt;/p&gt;
