<p>date: 2024-08-04, updated: 2024-08-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>I AM a daughter of Saipan, Virginia Flores Camacho. This June, I
brought my family of seven to Saipan, the key destination of our
three-week trip that included visits to Japan, Guam, and Honolulu. I was
excited to introduce my grandchildren, Linden, age 7, and Callen, age
10, to Northern Marianas heritage and history. I hoped to open their
eyes to my homeland’s future in the world market and also as a potential
future home. My own adult children, daughter Chrissy and son Robby,
shared this vision as they enjoyed revisiting the island.</p>

62: It’s OUR Managaha — Stewardship!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, updated: 2024-08-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is that it is OUR Economy falling off a cliff
and this Governor and the next Governor will continue to be faced with
stewardship rebuilding our Economy.  The stewardship over the need to
rebuild our Economy, that has obviously been decimated by nature &amp;
Ralph, is critical to making sure all the moving parts are functioning
properly but that is not the case with Managaha. There has been entirely
tooooo much left up to the Secretaries &amp; Directors to “do the Right
&amp; BEST thing FOR the People they represent, yet the Managaha fiasco
is just another reason WHY the People “don’t like and don’t TRUST OUR
Government to DO the People’s bidding,” not their personal desires &amp;
belief. It should be duly noted that Managaha was the MOST productive
when the operations were “INDIVIDUALS,” it was the very concept of
“exclusive operator” that KILLED Local Operators and the diversity for
Tourists and the future growth of Managaha is still in limbo. At least
our Governor has interceded like he is doing with Star Marianas and CPA
to try and resolve the problem and pray he will think about “his people
are FIRST” —  the first law of nature self-preservation.</p>
