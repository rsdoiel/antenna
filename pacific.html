      <h1>Divided Fed lowers rates, signals pause and one 2026 cut as growth rebounds</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday in another divided vote, but signaled it will likely pause further reductions in borrowing costs as the U.S. central bank looks for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that “remains somewhat elevated.” New projections issued after the Fed’s two-day meeting showed the median policymaker sees just one quarter-percentage-point cut in 2026, the same outlook as in September, with inflation expected to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%. “In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,” the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions — an outlook at odds with market expectations, which remained locked into two rate cuts next year even after the Fed issued its statement.</p>

<p>Tafuna JROTC staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Tafuna High School Army JROTC program made history by hosting American Samoa’s first-ever Aerial Drone Competition, bringing together cadet drone teams from Manu’a, Faga’itua, Samoana, Tafuna, and Leone High Schools. The inaugural event was held at the Mafutaga Tina CCCAS Hall in Kanana Fou under the Robotics Education &amp; Competition Foundation (RECF) Aerial Drone Competition program.</p>
<p>Ten teams, two from each high school, with five cadets per team, took on this season’s game, Time Warp. The game features four missions that challenge different aspects of drone STEM skills: Teamwork Mission (alliance match play), Piloting Skills Mission (individual piloting), Autonomous Flight Mission (coding and sensor-based flight), and Communications Mission (logbook and interview).</p>
<p><strong>TAFUNA’S TOA DRONES CROWNED ALL AROUND CHAMPION</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna High School’s Team 96799A – TOA DRONES – Army JROTC earned the tournament’s top honor as All Around Champion. This award recognizes a team that demonstrates excellence both in judged categories and on-field performance, including strong communications, professionalism, and sportsmanship. Toa Drones is made up of the following members:</p>
<p>Team Captain and Programmer- Loraine Steckert</p>
<p>Co-Captain and Teamwork Mission Pilot- Everett Painter</p>
<p>Co-Pilot for Teamwork Mission- Atonio Miller</p>
<p>Pilot for Piloting Skills Mission- Taylor Lemo</p>
<p>Visual Observer for Skills and Teamwork Mission- Schoemacher Puletasi</p>
<p>As All-Around Champion, Team 96799A has qualified for the All-Services Aerial Drone Championship in Fort Benning, Georgia, where they will compete against JROTC teams from across the United States and from all service branches, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. This will be the team’s second appearance at the All-Services Championship. At last year’s event in Batesville, Mississippi, 96799A brought home the Coding Award from a field of more than 100 JROTC teams.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER MISSION AWARDS AND SPECIAL RECOGNITION</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna’s two TOA Drone teams and Samoana’s cadets led the way in the mission-based and judged awards:</p>
<ul>

<p>CLOSE BATTLES ON THE FIELD</p>
<p>All five high schools brought their “A game” to the Time Warp field, resulting in exciting alliance selections and close scores throughout the playoffs.</p>
<p>Teams advancing to the semi-finals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>      Tafuna High School: 96799A and 96799B, who chose each other as alliance partners.</li>
<li>       Leone High School: 2811A, who allied with Manu’a’s 63729Z – Matasaua Drones.</li>
<li>       Samoana High School: 1946A and 1946B, who formed a Samoana alliance.</li>
<li>       Faga’itua High School: 1684V, who partnered with Manu’a’s second team 63729C.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, two alliances reached the finals: Tafuna’s alliance of 96799A and 96799B, and the alliance between 2811A (Leone) and 63729Z (Manu’a). The championship match came down to just two points, with Tafuna taking the Tournament Championship 190–188, a finish that kept cadets, instructors, and spectators on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p><strong>MONTHS OF PREPARATION AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna High School JROTC spent months preparing to host this first island-wide Aerial Drone Competition. The staff coordinated with community volunteers who contributed an estimated 15 hours each, six hours of online training to serve as head referee and judge advisors, 7.5 hours during the competition itself, plus additional time in meetings, scrimmages, and a pre-event drone workshop.</p>
<p>Leading up to the tournament, Tafuna hosted a scrimmage and a Drone Workshop to help all participating teams across the island become more familiar with the Time Warp game, safety procedures, and tournament expectations. These efforts helped ensure that every team arrived ready to compete at a high level and that the event was both competitive and educational.</p>
<p><strong>SPONSORS AND VOLUNTEERS MAKE IT POSSIBLE</strong></p>
<p>The success of this inaugural competition depended on strong community partnerships and sponsorship.</p>
<ul>
<li>       ASTCA – Special thanks to CEO Folasaitu Thomas and her team for providing high-speed, robust internet connectivity for the event. Their support made it possible to run the RECF Tournament Manager system and transmit real-time results to the Robotics Education &amp; Competition Foundation throughout the day.</li>
<li>       McDonald’s and ASTCA – Both organizations helped present awards and have been long-time supporters of Tafuna JROTC’s off-island STEM and robotics competitions.</li>
<li>       OceaniaCDN – Provided tablets used by scorekeeper referees and the event tech coordinator, helping the tournament run smoothly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organizers also extend heartfelt thanks to the volunteers whose “heart of service” for the youth of American Samoa made the competition possible:</p>
<p>Dr. Reupena Lesa, Isalei Liaiga, Ladenia Lavata’i, Claire Baucus, Maricel Balbuena, Patricia Su’esu’e, Fiafia Sunia, Fa’amasino Galoia, Jody Osterbrink, Jordanna Maga, Agnes Tipi, and Judy Tuna.</p>
<p>These community members served as referees, scorekeepers, judges, and event tech coordinators, giving cadets a professional, well-run first experience in aerial drone competition.</p>
<p>To recognize this service, the Director of Army Instruction, COL John Tulifua, presented each volunteer with an American Samoa Multiple School Unit coin in appreciation for their time and support of this landmark event.</p>
<p><strong>SCHOOL AND JROTC LEADERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>The competition also highlighted the vision and support of educational leaders who continue to push STEM opportunities forward in the territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Principal Tutuila Togilau of Tafuna High School was recognized for her ongoing support of all JROTC initiatives, not only for THS cadets but also for providing a platform that serves every JROTC program in American Samoa.</li>
<li>       Tafuna’s JROTC instructor team, MAJ Siimoa Galoia, MSG Acania Puletasi, and SFC Lei Solaita, were thanked for pioneering and expanding STEM pathways, from VEX robotics to aerial drones, and for working tirelessly to secure competition opportunities off-island for cadets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This first Aerial Drone Competition marks an important step for American Samoa’s youth as they explore STEM, aviation, and technology careers through hands-on learning and friendly competition. With strong community support and dedicated cadet leaders, the future of drone STEM education in the territory is off to a powerful start.</p>

<p>Despite millions and billions of kina poured into the education department over the years, most schools particularly in rural areas across the country do not receive enough funding support and are still struggling with limited facilities and poor academic resources.</p>
<p>Bubia Primary School Principal James Timping has raised strong concerns that schools across Papua New Guinea are not receiving the money they need because most of the national budget funding is being eaten up by administrative costs before it reaches classrooms.</p>

<p>Independent Commission Against Corruption, Acting Commissioner, Thomas Eluh, has issued one of his strongest warnings yet, declaring that corruption has become a “well-oiled system” that is crippling Papua New Guinea’s development and future.</p>

He said corruption has evolved into a sophisticated network affecting every level of government, from Parliament to commodity boards and district authorities.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>James Kneubuhl, ASCC Press Officer</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa Community College (ASCC) will hold its 83rd Commencement Ceremony on Friday, December 12th, beginning at 10 a.m. at the Kanana Fou Gymnasium. At press time, 121 ASCC students are slated to receive their degrees and certificates from the College, although the final number will subject to examination results. The presiding pastor for the ceremony will be Reverend Peter Schuster, Synod Leader of the Tutuila Methodist Church. The keynote speech will be given by Ammon Fepulea’i, an ASCC alumnus and former faculty member who currently serves as Executive Director for the American Samoa Council on Arts, Culture, &amp; Humanities.</p>
<p>As an educator, artist, and community leader Fepulea’i’s work has significantly shaped the artistic and academic landscape of American Samoa. Born to Ali‘itasi and Paulo Fepulea‘i, Ammon is a proud alumnus of Samoana High School, graduating with the Class of 2005. He continued his academic journey at ASCC, where he earned his Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts in 2007. With a growing passion for mathematics, he pursued further studies at the University of Wyoming, graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. His commitment to education later led him to the University of Hawai‘i, where he completed a Master of Education in Curriculum Studies in 2019.</p>
<p>Fepulea’i began his professional career as a mathematics teacher at Samoana High School, serving from 2010 to 2020. His dedication to student learning and academic excellence then brought him back to ASCC, where he served as a mathematics instructor from fall 2020 through fall 2024. During his time at the College, he also played a vital role as an advisor to the House of Flying Daggers Club, a dynamic student group known for producing creative and influential musical productions in American Samoa. Fepulea’i continues to support and collaborate with these students, fostering artistic expression and community engagement.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2025, Fepulea’i was appointed Executive Director for the American Samoa Council on Arts, Culture, &amp; Humanities, a position in which he continues to expand opportunities, resources, and visibility for artists throughout the islands. He also serves as the President of the Agency for Better Living Endeavors (ABLE) and as the lead for Moso‘oi, two organizations dedicated to community enrichment and creative advancement</p>
<p>Through his leadership, artistry, and unwavering dedication to service, Fepulea‘i remains a driving force in cultivating a thriving and vibrant artistic future for American Samoa. A multidisciplinary artist, Ammon has contributed countless artworks across the territory, using his talents to celebrate culture, uplift communities, and empower young creators. His advocacy for youth development and his commitment to learning from and collaborating with local artists have solidified his reputation as a champion for the arts.</p>
<p>“ASCC is proud to see our alumnus and colleague Ammon leading the effort to promote and facilitate artistic expression here in the Territory,” said ASCC Dean of Student Services Dr. Emilia Le’i. “We look forward to him sharing his story and his insights with our fall 2025 graduating class.” For more information on the Fall 2025 ASCC Commencement Ceremony, contact the Division of Student Services at 699-9155, extension 0004.</p>

<p>NCDC Alcohol Licensing Board and Moresby-Northeast MP John Kaupa says authorities will launch a major crackdown on the production, sale and consumption of homebrew across the city, warning that the illegal alcohol trade has continued to be one of the city’s biggest law-and-order challenge.</p>
<p>Mr Kaupa said homebrew is still illegal and poses significant risks to public safety, yet many communities continue to brew and sell it openly, particularly at hotspot areas like Hanuabada, Erima, 8-Mile and 9-Mile.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — White House border czar Tom Homan on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, saying the state is home to a large illegal Somali community despite local officials’ comments that the vast majority of Somalis in the U.S. are American citizens. Homan denied, however, that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had stepped up its deportation campaign in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in response to Trump’s comments last week about Somali immigrants, whom the president called “garbage” that should be removed from the country. Homan also said ICE agents are not targeting people based on their appearance.</p>

<p>The National Doctors Association (NDA) of Papua New Guinea has issued a strong public appeal to the government, calling on Prime Minister James Marape and Health Minister Elias Kapavore to urgently appoint a permanent Secretary for the Department of Health. The position has remained vacant for over a year, creating a significant leadership gap.</p>
<p>In a letter released from their Boroko office, the NDA noted that the Department of Health has operated without a confirmed leader for 13 to 14 months. The tenure of the current acting Secretary, Mr Ken Wai, whom the NDA describes as a &quot;seasoned Health Administrator&quot; who has &quot;performed very well&quot;, expired on November 11, 2025, leaving the department without a gazetted acting head for 27 days as of the letter’s issue.</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority (ICSA) has announced two major initiatives designed to modernize passport services and improve convenience for citizens following the recent passage of the Passport Bill 2025 by Parliament.</p>
<p>The first innovation, the Passport Status Online Tracker, allows applicants to check the progress of their passport applications from the comfort of their homes. By visiting the official website at <a href="http://www.ica.gov.pg">www.ica.gov.pg</a> or directly accessing status.ica.gov.pg, citizens can enter their application receipt number to view updates. Status information becomes available within 24 hours of lodging an application. Once the tracker indicates readiness, applicants may collect their passports at the Passport Office.</p>

<p>The National Court in Kokopo has imposed a four-year jail sentence—wholly suspended—on a 40-year-old woman who was convicted of sexually touching a 13-year-old boy at Tabuna Plantation in Bitapaka, East New Britain Province.</p>
<p>Mathilda Peter, from Sarakolok village in West New Britain, was convicted after trial on August 4 this year for sexual touching under Section 229B(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. She was initially charged with the more serious offence of sexual touching with aggravating circumstances but was instead found guilty of the lesser charge.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Justin Siliva</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Back home in American Samoa, Christmas is more than a holiday. It’s the heart of the year and a season that brings families, churches, and whole villages together. The music, the laughter, the faith, and the smell of food cooking from early morning all make the island come alive.</p>
<p>This will be my third Christmas away from home since starting college. School will be on break, but I have to stay in Hawaii for work. Even after doing it twice before, it still feels strange spending the holidays somewhere else. Each year I spend the holidays away, I find myself holding onto the memories of Christmas back home more tightly. I miss the joy, the noise, and that feeling you can only get when your own people surround you.</p>
<p>When I am home, December feels alive. Here, it feels quiet. Most days, I stay in my room or go to work if I am scheduled. Some Christmas mornings feel like any other day. There is no choir practice, no neighbors dropping by, and no kids playing outside. The feeling reminds me that I am very far away from home.</p>
<p>I am 100 percent sure that other students and islanders spend Christmas away from home, too. Some of us work during the holidays or stay where we are because traveling back home is too “expensive.” We try to keep our island spirit alive wherever we go, but it never feels the same. The quiet days remind us how much family, faith, and home really mean.</p>
<p>Being away has shown me what Christmas is really about. It’s not the lights, gifts, or even the break from school. It is the love, faith, and togetherness that make the season real. When those things are missing, the holiday feels empty, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>Growing up, Christmas was all about community. Every church came alive in the evenings as families gathered to rehearse dances and choir songs for the Christmas Day service. The sound of voices and instruments carried through the villages, blending with laughter, music, and the spirit of joy that filled every neighborhood.</p>
<p>Even government offices, local businesses, and churches join in. They rehearse songs and dances for the government’s annual Christmas Music Festival at a center in the town of Utulei, with a population of less than 500 people. People from all over the island gather to share music, faith, and laughter in the lead-up to Christmas Day. It’s one of the biggest celebrations of the season, showcasing the island’s strong sense of community.</p>
<p>American Samoa’s traditions are rooted in faith and community, and those values shape the way my people celebrate. The island’s customs, from music to family gatherings, reflect a culture centered on connection and respect. <a href="https://www.visitamericansamoa.org/our-culture">Visit American Samoa’s</a> page on our culture, shows how these traditions continue to guide daily life across the island.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.polynesia.com/christmas-traditions%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Umu,%20a%20traditional%20Samoan%20ground,other%20delicious%20local%20Samoan%20food.">Polynesian Cultural Center</a>, Christmas in American Samoa combines faith, food, and family into a single, extended celebration. For many Samoans, it’s a season built on giving, not getting, and a time when the island spirit truly shines.</p>
<p>Christmas morning back home starts early. Families prepare the “umu,” the traditional ground oven used to cook breadfruit, taro, bananas, chicken, and often an “umu pua’a”(Pig Roast). Some make “oka,” which is raw fish mixed with coconut milk, or “palusami,” a dish of coconut milk wrapped in taro leaves. Others cook fai’ai fe’e, octopus simmered in coconut milk, or barbecue in their yards while that island reggae music plays in the background.</p>
<p>The smell of smoke and food fills the air, spreading from house to house. No one cooks just for themselves. Families share with their neighbors and the whole village. The joy comes from good food, good company, and giving back. Even without snow, it still feels like Christmas. The island’s heat doesn’t stop anyone from decorating homes, churches, and palm trees with colorful lights.</p>
<p>Being away from that feels different. December in college feels quiet and distant compared to home. The lights and songs are still there, but the “spirit” behind them is missing. I miss the choirs, the rehearsals, and the laughter that always came with family and food. Calls and video chats help for a moment, but they’ll never match the feeling of being home with my family.</p>
<p>Spending Christmas alone has taught me a lot about what truly matters. It made me realize how much I took those moments for granted. Back home, I never gave much thought to the long evenings of dance practice or the hours spent helping in the kitchen. Now I see how much those traditions shaped me. They continue to guide me, whether I’m home or somewhere else.</p>

<p><em>Justin’s home during the Christmas season back in American Samoa. [photo: Justin Siliva]</em></p>
<p>Christmas away from American Samoa will always feel different. But it reminds me that the real meaning of the holiday is not about where you are. It’s about love, faith, and people who make you feel at home. Even when I am far away, I carry that island vibe with me, and that’s what keeps my Christmas alive.</p>

      <h1>Are Americans drinking less? New data says yes, but not by much</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Americans say they are drinking less alcohol than ever before. But new data shows the number of drinks U.S. adults have per week has in fact not changed by much for decades. The data from drinks market research firm IWSR, shared exclusively with Reuters, shows that the number of weekly drinks per U.S. adult has hovered between 10 and 12 since 1975. While it is currently at its lowest since 1995, this reflects a decline of around 1.1 servings per person per week from a recent peak of 11.5 drinks in 2021. Surveys indicating a historic shift away from drinking, steep declines in alcohol sales, and falling drinking rates among young people have all fed a debate in recent years about whether drinking might be in long-term decline, especially in the key U.S. market. Possible drivers include a trend towards healthier lifestyles.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>LONDON — Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018, in a “reckless” display of power that led to the death of an innocent woman, a UK public inquiry concluded on Thursday. Skripal was found along with his daughter Yulia slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March 2018 after Novichok was applied to the front door handle of his nearby home. About four months later, mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died from exposure to the poison after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which Russian spies had used to smuggle the military-grade nerve agent into the country, the inquiry said.</p>

<p>Former Kandep MP Don Polye has taken an extraordinary stance following his arrest, publicly welcoming the charges laid against him and declaring he is ready to defend himself as the case involving more than K1.7 million in public funds moves through the courts.</p>
<p>Polye, who was arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on 30 November 30, 2025, said he embraced the process because he was instrumental in establishing ICAC more than two decades ago.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A 'ta’alolo,' or a traditional Samoan ceremony where food, fine mats (ʻie toga), and other gifts are formally presented was performed by the Government of Samoa, as a gesture of high honor highlighting the significance of this milestone, during the dedication of the Maota Fono.</p>
<p>The ta‘alolo began from within Tedi’s Square, the procession advanced in stately fashion, passing the newly dedicated Fono building before continuing on to the Malaeoletalu malae and toward the Pavilion, where honored guests were enjoying their luncheon.</p>
<p>With the Royal Samoa Police Band setting the rhythm and filling the air with Samoan music, the daughter of Samoa’s Head of State led the ta‘alolo, resplendent in traditional taupou attire. She was followed by dancing sogaimiti — young men proudly bearing their tattoos—and other taupou who moved gracefully as the procession made its way onto the Malaeoletalu.</p>
<p>The young tattooed men and women, along with most of the participants in the ta‘alolo, were Samoa nationals employed at StarKist and others residing on-island, who came forward to support the Government of Samoa’s initiative. Their presence embodied both cultural pride and communal solidarity, reinforcing the deep ties that unite Samoans across the islands.</p>
<p>Bringing up the rear were young men proudly bearing massive ‘ie toga, treasured fine mats used only in events of this magnitude, which had been fastened to long poles and lifted high for all to see.</p>
<p>These massive ‘ie toga were presented to honor each of the traditional districts of American Samoa, while suas were bestowed upon local leaders and the servants of God who officiated. In addition, the Government of Samoa offered $10,000 in U.S. currency, along with carcasses of beef, coolers of fish, sausages, sacks of taro, and Samoan koko, a gesture rich in both material and cultural significance.</p>
<p>The Fono reciprocated by presenting more than 50 suas, which included monetary gifts to Rev. Saifoloi, Bishop Kolio, the visiting delegation from Samoa, as well as local leaders, former governors and lieutenant governors, leaders of various churches, and former Speakers and Senate Presidents.</p>
<p>A sum of $100,000 was presented in acknowledgment of the ta‘alolo performed by Samoa, accompanied by cases of chicken, corned beef, and wahoo.</p>
<p>Altogether, the <span class="math inline">\(100,000 and the additional suas announced that day amounted to an estimated \)</span>200,000, illustrating the depth of respect and reciprocity shared between the two Samoas.</p>

Trump has repeatedly complained that ending Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War Two has been one of the elusive foreign policy aims of his presidency. The U.S. president has at times scolded both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> In part two of this exclusive interview following the press conference held by Punialava‘a, one of Samoa’s most iconic family bands who were in the territory to bring awareness to Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month, Executive Director of the Samoan Language Commission of American Samoa, Elisapeta Tupo Alaimaleata reiterated the importance of the group’s contribution, emphasizing that their work not only sustains the language but also deepens cultural understanding across generations.</p>
<p>She explained that within the community, Alzheimer’s disease is currently referred to in several ways: some transliterate the English term as 'Alisaima'; others describe it as “ma‘i o le mafaufau” (the sickness of the mind); while still others use “fa‘ama‘i o le loto galo” (the disease of forgetfulness).</p>
<p>Alaimaleata observed that this matches terminology used in Tonga, where the condition is likewise transliterated as 'Alisaima.' In addition, Tongans use similar descriptive phrases such as 'pōpōaki ‘o e loto ngalongalo' or 'pōpōaki ‘o e loto fakangalo,' meaning 'sickness of forgetfulness' or 'sickness of the forgetting heart/mind.'</p>
<p>A passionate advocate for the preservation of Gagana Samoa, Alaimaleata commended Punialava‘a for coining the word “Mananoa” as a culturally resonant translation for Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>She announced her intention to raise the matter with her counterpart in Independent Samoa, with the goal of having the term formally recognized. She further explained that the Samoan Language Commission of Samoa has already allocated a seat for a representative from the American Samoa Commission at its monthly meetings, ensuring collaboration and unity in safeguarding the language.</p>
<p>At last week Monday’s press conference, local media representatives and community members became the first in the Territory to experience Punialava‘a’s newest composition for Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month.</p>
<p>The track, &quot;Manatua le Mananoa,&quot; resonated deeply as it played on the sound system, and the audience embraced the tune, humming along to the melody while listening intently to the powerful message woven into its lyrics.</p>
<p>The composer, Rev. Lale Peteru, spoke with the confidence of more than 50 years of experience in crafting songs that nearly every Samoan — both in Samoa and across the diaspora — can recognize and sing along to. He explained that the art of songwriting is much like the making of coconut oil: one gathers fragrant flowers to infuse the oil with sweetness, just as a composer gathers life experiences to enrich a song’s meaning.</p>
<p>“When writing the lyrics of Manatua le Mananoa, I reflected on life experiences that could illustrate the theme and make it resonate, just like gathering sweet-smelling flowers to make the oil fragrant,” Rev. Peteru shared.</p>
<p>He recalled a trip to Alaska during winter, where the biting cold and endless ice reminded him of the North Pole. “And then there was the magical Aurora — the Northern Lights — painting the sky with dazzling beauty and splendor. I used those majestic sights as metaphors to describe Alzheimer’s.”</p>
<p>He explained how the imagery shaped the song: “The first line mentions 'mananoa,' meaning forgetting or the state of memory void, and 'maofaofa,' which means astonishing or surprising. 'Leai ni auga ae ogaoga,' describes how there are no visible symptoms, yet it is a serious condition. 'Pei o le pole e to‘a ai le kiona,' likens it to the pole where snow settles, and 'ma aputia i le aurora,' portrays being covered in the radiant lights of the aurora — the Northern Lights.”</p>
<p>Samoan (original):</p>
<p>Le mananoa e maofaofa,</p>
<p>Leai ni auga ae ogaoga,</p>
<p>Pei o le pole e to‘a ai le kiona,</p>
<p>Ma aputia i le aurora.</p>
<p>English (translation):</p>
<p>The forgetting is astonishing,</p>
<p>Like the pole where snow settles,’</p>
<p>And is covered in the lights of aurora.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A session continued with podcaster Taupau Tauileave Toluono of Talatala le Ta‘ui asking Punialava'a how they saw music playing a role in raising awareness and bringing the community together around importance health issues like Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>One of the members, Nanai Vielanni Peteru explained that music is not only a medium for delivering information but also a powerful force for stirring emotions. He pointed to the song “Ta‘elega i Petesa” — written and recorded by Punialava‘a in 1981, at a time when awareness of disability in Samoa was beginning to grow. During that period, many families faced stigma, and people with disabilities were often marginalized.</p>
<p>The song was composed to challenge those attitudes and to encourage compassion, dignity, and inclusion. Drawing on the biblical story of the Pool of Bethesda, it used scripture as a metaphor for God’s mercy and healing power.</p>
<p>The lyrics were written from the perspective of a cripple who longed for a place like the Pool of Bethesda, where an angel would occasionally stir the waters and the first person to enter afterward would be healed. Through this imagery, Punialava‘a gave voice to the hopes of those living with disability, affirming their worth and reminding communities that true healing comes from faith and love.</p>
<p>The song quickly became popular, striking a deep chord with listeners and awakening feelings of empathy for the plight of people living with disabilities. For some, it was the first time they were introduced to the biblical story of the Pool of Bethesda — where the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed gathered in hope, waiting for the stirring of the waters and the promise of healing.</p>
<p>Nanai also reflected on the unifying effect of Punialava‘a’s music, noting how their songs often spark meaningful conversations between generations. He explained that many of their lyrics are written in formal Samoan, layered with deep cultural and historical significance.</p>
<p>“Some young Samoans born and raised overseas sing along to our songs without fully understanding the meaning of the words,” Nanai said. “So they turn to their parents for explanations. Often, those lyrics are rooted in important events, and as parents share the stories behind them, the conversations grow and expand.</p>
<p>“Some parents have even reached out to us, saying their children have asked about the meaning of certain lyrics. Yet, many of them admit they don’t fully understand either. So we take the time to share and explain the words and the message behind the songs. In this way, the music becomes a bridge — linking Punialava‘a to the parents, who then connect with their children and remind them of their heritage. Through this exchange, family bonds are strengthened and cultural identity is passed on.”</p>
<p>Punialava‘a founder Rev. Lale Peteru commented that he has been working on translating the lyrics of their songs into English to support younger generations. His goal is to ensure that Samoan youth, especially those raised overseas, cannot only sing along but also understand the meaning of the words they are articulating.</p>
<p>As an example, Rev. Peteru read aloud a verse from one of their songs in Samoan, followed by its English translation.</p>
<p>Samoan (original)</p>
<p>Pe ana avea a'u ma fetu o le lagi,</p>
<p>E nofo ita mamao atu ma matagi,</p>
<p>Ia manino la'u faalogo i pesega,</p>
<p>A i latou ua ola faafualeva.</p>
<p>English (translation)</p>
<p>If I had been a star in the sky,</p>
<p>I would stay far away from the storms,</p>
<p>So I may hear with clarity the singing,</p>
<p>Of those who live in eternity.</p>
<p>Responding to a question from V103 news anchor and translator Doug Avauli about his process of lyric composition and arrangement, Rev. Lale Peteru explained that each lyricist has their own unique approach.</p>
<p>The veteran composer shared that his method always begins with identifying the central theme of the project. From there, he gathers relevant experiences and information that can help illustrate and highlight that theme. Once the foundation is set, he carefully works on the wording and the arrangement of verses and the chorus to ensure the message is carried clearly throughout the song.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I begin with the first verse,” Rev. Peteru noted, “but when I start arranging the song, I realize that the information in that verse is actually the main thrust of the message. In those cases, I move it to the chorus, so that after each verse, the chorus reinforces and emphasizes the theme.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the chorus of the new song “Manatua le Mananoa,” recorded for this year’s Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Week, as an example. Originally written as the opening verse, it was later elevated to the chorus because it contained the song’s central message — ensuring that the theme of memory and forgetting would resonate powerfully throughout the piece.</p>
<p>Samoan (original)</p>
<p>Pe a aulia le tau o puaoa,</p>
<p>E galo nimo ma le mautinoa,</p>
<p>Pei o le masina pe a popo loloa,</p>
<p>Ia manatua le mananoa.</p>
<p>English (translation):</p>
<p>When the season of fog arrives,</p>
<p>Memories fade and certainty is lost,</p>
<p>Like the moon when long concealed,</p>
<p>Remember the forgetting — the mananoa.</p>
<p>“As I was writing those lines, the Samoan proverb ‘Eā oe nei, ae ā a‘u taeao’ — which translates to ‘It is you now, it will be me tomorrow’ — came to mind,” Rev. Lale shared.</p>
<p>“In that moment, I realized how easily I too could one day be afflicted by Alzheimer’s. This thought weighed heavily on me, but it also strengthened my resolve. My hope is that this song will raise awareness among our people and inspire them to respond with empathy, understanding, and love for those already living with the condition.”</p>

      <h1>Savaii youth engage with Samoa Support Systems on mental health solutions</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/samoa_support_systems.jpeg?itok=P_zuBAbd"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/samoa_support_systems.jpeg?itok=dCJ9Ka0a" alt="Samoa Support Group"></a></p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> (November 24, 2025) More than 60 youth participants from Savaii communities gathered at the Jet Over Hotel last week Friday for a ‘Talanoa session’ on mental health. SVSG Youth led the outreach program for young people in Samoa, and last week’s Savaii Talanoa session was the second event following the Upolu Talanoa in October.</p>
<p>Funded by UNESCO and SEVENTEEN, SVSG continues to empower youth to be aware of the social issues that surround them. Mental health issues especially affect young people when drug abuse is involved. These issues can lead to violence within families and communities, so young people must be empowered to advocate for safer communities through their roles.</p>
<p>The ‘Talanoa’ ensures that safe spaces are created for young people to share their insights about social issues, while at the same time being empowered to resolve these issues and design strategies for the problems they face. The ‘Talanoa’ not only provides relevant information about social issues but also allows participants to brainstorm how best to respond and address these challenges, helping to minimize mental health concerns.</p>
<p>The role of youth is very important in their families and village communities. Therefore, this ‘Talanoa’ not only brought young people together and created safe spaces for them to discuss their social challenges and reflect on effective strategies, but also allowed them to explore ways to help their families and communities. Participants are encouraged to advocate for a society free from violence resulting from mental health issues and to embrace their roles as future leaders, promoting peace, love, and safer communities.</p>
<p>SVSG President Siliniu Lina Chang extended her heartfelt fa’afetai to the village and church community leaders who accompanied their youth groups and participated in the ‘Talanoa’ session. This is a positive sign of strong community support for youth empowerment programmes, helping to build a brighter future for these future leaders and advocating for safer families and communities.</p>
<p>Participants expressed hope to see more opportunities and programs like these continue for the young people and youth of Savaii every year.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa Powerlifting Federation (ASPF) recently etched its name into history with its first official team entry at the prestigious Oceania Regional Powerlifting Championships.</p>
<p>Facing off against the region’s strongest contenders, the team competed with courage and determination, emerging not only with national records and personal bests but also with hard‑earned medals that signaled American Samoa’s arrival on the regional stage.</p>
<p>The 2025 Oceania Regional Powerlifting Championships took center stage in Christchurch, New Zealand, bringing together more than 100 elite lifters from 12 nations across the Pacific, each representing the strength and spirit of their homelands. Among them, American Samoa stood tall, proudly making its inaugural appearance on this prestigious regional stage and marking a new chapter in the territory’s sporting journey.</p>
<p>The competition unfolded at the Black Box Theater in Christchurch, where the atmosphere pulsed with intensity and pride. Amid the roar of the crowd and the clang of iron, Team American Samoa shook the venue with a performance that left fans, referees, and fellow lifters in awe of their grit, strength, and spirit.</p>
<p>The American Samoa delegation was led by ASPF President Ed Imo and Secretary General Jade Pedro, who offered a compelling explanation of the sport and its place on the international stage.</p>
<p>“Powerlifting is simple in concept but demanding in execution,” she noted. “Athletes compete in three lifts — the squat, the bench press, and the deadlift — each testing a different dimension of strength. Every attempt must meet strict technical standards and is judged by three referees. The combined total of the heaviest successful squat, bench, and deadlift determines the athlete’s final score.</p>
<p>“But beyond the numbers, powerlifting is a battle of courage, discipline, and composure. Seconds can decide victory or defeat. A single mis‑timed command can erase months of preparation. And yet, every powerlifter steps forward, unafraid, to lift what many believe impossible.”</p>
<p>And step up they did.</p>
<p>One by one, each lifter rose to the challenge, proving that they could hold their own on the international stage. Their performances were not only a testament to physical strength but also to the courage, discipline, and composure demanded by a competition of this magnitude.</p>
<p>One by one, each lifter stepped off the platform carrying an achievement — from personal bests to national records, and, to the delight of supporters, hard‑earned medals. The crowd roared for the underdogs of the competition, who had fought through David‑and‑Goliath battles against Oceania’s elite, proving that determination and pride could lift iron as heavy as any powerhouse.</p>
<p>The first lifter to take the platform was Frank Asi Tuisalega, competing in the 83kg class. A former professional bodybuilder who had only recently transitioned into powerlifting, the soft‑spoken rookie proved relentless under the bar. With the poise of a seasoned competitor, Tuisalega set the tone for Team American Samoa by establishing a new national record with a commanding 572.5kg total — highlighted by a 197.5kg squat, 135kg bench press, and 240kg deadlift. His breakthrough performance electrified the crowd and ignited the momentum that carried the team forward, showing that even in his debut, he could stand shoulder to shoulder with Oceania’s elite.</p>
<p>Next came Lesmarie Purcell Ioane, the lone female lifter on Team American Samoa, whose performance in the women’s 83+kg division became one of the most inspiring displays of the Championships. Though she appeared at first as a quiet, devoted supporter of her husband, John Ioane — himself competing in the 120+kg division — Lesmarie quickly shattered expectations. She stormed through a 162.5kg squat, followed by a commanding 110kg bench press that earned her silver, and capped her effort with a 215kg deadlift for bronze. Her combined 487.5kg total secured an overall bronze medal, elevating her into the ranks of Oceania’s premier female lifters and proving that strength, resilience, and determination can defy every stereotype.</p>
<p>In the junior 120+kg division, the young giant Emau Siaosi revealed the raw, uncut potential of an emerging force in Oceania powerlifting. Though he missed all of his bench press attempts after an early rack command, Siaosi refused to be deterred. He stormed back with personal bests in both the squat (295kg) and deadlift (287.5kg), lifting with grit and determination that drew admiration from the crowd. His resilience in the face of adversity highlighted his promise as a rising contender, marking him as one to watch in future international competitions.</p>
<p>Veteran lifter John Ioane delivered what many considered one of the most technically refined performances of the entire competition. Completing a flawless nine-for-nine series — a rarity in the sport — Ioane recorded personal bests across the board with a 285kg squat, 197.5kg bench press, 310kg deadlift with the impressive total of 792.5kg. His discipline, composure, and unwavering confidence made him one of the standout athletes of the entire competition.</p>
<p>The event’s dramatic finale unfolded in the men’s 120+kg division, where Justin Pedro squared off against New Zealand’s reigning national champion in a high‑stakes heavyweight showdown. Pedro seized gold in the squat with a towering 380kg lift, and came agonizingly close to breaking the 400kg barrier before a jury reversal. His attempt initially earned two white lights and a “good lift” call from the referees, but the jury overturned the decision, citing a “half‑inch downward movement</p>
<p>Undeterred, Pedro pressed on. He added silver in the bench press with 237.5kg, and had to settle for the deadlift bronze due to further jury controversies. Twice — at 330kg and 337.5kg — referees awarded him “good lifts,” only for the jury to overturn them again. Either lift would have secured him the overall title. Even so, his combined 937.5kg total (over 2,067 pounds) earned him silver in the division and cemented his place among Oceania’s strongest.</p>
<p>The cheers for Team American Samoa, which had grown louder as every member poured heart and strength into their categories, were at fever pitch by the time Justin Pedro stepped into his dramatic tug‑of‑war showdown with New Zealand’s reigning national champion.</p>
<p>The Black Box Theater shook with thunderous applause that nearly brought down the house. It was clear that the crowd had chosen its hero: every time Pedro approached the bar, the stands erupted, rallying behind the underdog from American Samoa with a roar that echoed long after the final lift. It became one of the most talked‑about battles of the entire competition.</p>
<p>But through triumphs and setbacks, he remained humble — never complaining, never arguing, never letting frustration speak for him. Instead, reflecting afterward, he offered a simple declaration of faith: “All the glory is to God and God alone.”</p>
<p>While history was being written on the platform that night, ASPF President Ed Imo and Ben Imo were also making history beyond it, completing the IPF Level 2 Coaching Certification — the highest coaching qualification in the International Powerlifting Federation. In doing so, they became the first-ever certified Level 2 instructors for American Samoa, paving the way for the future growth and development of the sport on island.</p>
<p>Following the team’s historic performance in Aotearoa, the Land of the Long White Cloud, ASPF Secretary General Jade Pedro announced that the federation’s focus now shifts to the upcoming American Samoa National Championships in 2026 and the 2026 Oceania Regional Powerlifting Championships in Fiji.</p>
<p>Pedro emphasized the excitement within the team, noting that the athletes recognize they have etched their names into American Samoa’s powerlifting history through unwavering commitment to training and preparation. But more than that, she added, they now carry something even greater — belief. Belief that they can stand shoulder to shoulder with giants, that no obstacle is too great and that with faith in themselves and full dedication to their preparations, they are capable of achieving the impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;What American Samoa accomplished in Christchurch was more than medals and numbers,&quot; she declared. &quot;It was a statement. A declaration that our athletes belong on the world stage. A reminder that strength is not just physical, it is spiritual, cultural, and deeply rooted in who we are as Samoan people. And a promise that we will return. Stronger. Smarter. Hungrier. Oceania has heard our name, and next year, in Fiji, they will see our fire burn even brighter.&quot;</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday defended a U.S. admiral’s decision to conduct multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling vessel in September, saying he had Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s authorization, even as critics questioned the legality of a strike on survivors.</p>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Luigi Mangione told a prison guard he had a 3D-printed gun in his backpack after his arrest for allegedly gunning down a UnitedHealthcare executive, according to testimony at a court hearing to determine whether prosecutors can use these statements and other evidence at his murder trial. Mangione, 27, was arrested in December 2024 and charged with fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan. Mangione became a folk hero to some critics of steep U.S. healthcare costs. Public officials condemned the assassination.</p>

      <p>DANVILLE, Pa. — The residents came in camouflage hats and red shirts signaling unity, more than 300 of them packing into a rural Pennsylvania planning commission meeting to protest a proposed data center they feared would carve up their farmland and upend the quiet rhythms of their valley. Most were loyal supporters of President Donald Trump, who carried their home of Montour County by 20 percentage points in the 2024 election. But they bristled at Washington’s push to fast-track artificial intelligence infrastructure, which has driven data-center growth in rural areas around the U.S. where land is cheap.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> An extreme doodling art project in the middle of the USA will have a touch of American Samoa in it.</p>
<p>Harmony Faoa-Danielson, 12, seventh grade, moved to Oklahoma from her native American Samoa last November. The art project in Lawton, Oklahoma teacher Deborah McNally’s class was the right opportunity for Faoa-Danielson to make a visual reminder of her home.</p>
<p>The doodling project is really a study in color theory where students learn about precision of lines, shapes, color and texture, McNally said.</p>
<p>“It hits all the bases and it’s not intimidating. It gets them out of their comfort zone and using their imagination,” McNally said.</p>
<p>For the extreme doodling project, a roll of paper several feet long is spread out and each student is assigned two sections to work on. They initially use Sharpies to draw lines and shapes and then they add color to their section.</p>

<p><strong><em>A roll of paper several feet long is spread out for the project, and each student is assigned two sections to work on. They initially use Sharpies to draw lines and shapes and then they add color to their section. [photo supplied</em></strong>]</p>
<p>“They can incorporate things they know into the pattern. They can pull from their life and reinvent it into patterns,” McNally said. “Doodling is a great introduction to drawing.”</p>
<p>Which is how the project got a touch of American Samoa.</p>
<p>Faoa-Danielson said she was drawing some mountains that remind her of home.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about home. We have a lot of mountains. I live on an island. I’m trying to draw an image of the mountains,” she said. “It makes me miss home.”</p>
<p>Once Faoa-Danielson drew the mountains, she planned to color them blue and green.</p>
<p>“The blue is like the sky and the green is like the mountains,” she said.</p>
<p>Faoa-Danielson said she has always enjoyed art projects, but has never done extreme doodling. She said her favorite things to draw are people and shapes.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how you mess up. It matters how hard you work on it. You give it your best. The lines matter. The little things matter,” she said of the doodling project.</p>
<p>Lillie Spencer, 11, also was drawing something she could relate to: mushrooms. The sixth grader said she was drawing them because, “they are good and I like to eat them.” She also said she was drawing a lot of different designs.</p>
<p>“I’m just thinking of random things I want to draw,” she said, adding she likes to make bracelets and key chains.</p>
<p>When the project is done, McNally will cut out each section so students can take their section home, which will remind Faoa-Danielson of her native island.</p>

      <p>Nurses have been accused of failing to provide 'life preserving services' but the union says a plan for dedicated on-call staff to cover gaps during strike action was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Punialava‘a, one of Samoa’s most iconic family bands, has added a new chapter to its remarkable legacy.</p>
<p>Known for more than 50 years of Samoan music that blends gospel, love songs, and cultural pride, using eloquent oratorical lyrics rich in cultural and spiritual meaning. Now, they have made history by coining the Samoan word “Mananoa” as another translation for Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
<p>The band is currently in American Samoa by special invitation, performing as part of Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month. Their music is being used not only to entertain but also to educate, spreading awareness through song and storytelling.</p>
<p>The annual awareness campaign is coordinated by the Agency for Better Living Endeavors (ABLE), a local non‑profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for residents through cultural, educational, and community programs.</p>
<p>ABLE’s partnership with Punialava‘a highlights the power of music as a cultural bridge for awareness and understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease, a condition that continues to affect a growing number of families each year.</p>
<p>At a press conference held at the DDW Restaurant in Utulei last week Monday, local media and members of the public were formally introduced to the first four members of Punialava‘a to arrive on island. Leading the group was band founder and leader Rev. Lale Peteru, accompanied by his wife Vini Peteru, their eldest child Nanai Vielani Peteru, and their youngest, Melody Peteru.</p>
<p>Mrs. Peteru confirmed that the third eldest sibling, Punialava‘a Peteru, is expected to arrive later in the week, while the second eldest, Vanya Peteru, was unable to make the trip.</p>
<p>Expounding on the meaning of Alzheimer’s, Vini Peteru explained that when people hear the word, they immediately think of memory and mental capacity. She noted that in the past, those afflicted with the disease were often stigmatized and dismissed as suffering from a mental impairment.</p>
<p>“However, we see this as an inter‑generational matter, and we are obligated to spread awareness that Alzheimer’s is not simply about impairment — it is about our memories, or our Mana,” Vini said. “In Polynesian and Māori belief, Mana is an impersonal supernatural power that can be transmitted or inherited, and we all carry our own Mana.”</p>
<p>She went on to explain that in Samoan, Mana is synonymous with the words Mauli and Tamāli‘iaga. “When that fades from us, the challenge becomes: who carries on the Mana? Who carries on the Mana of those who have lost their memories or have forgotten their Mana?”</p>
<p>“It’s us!” she declared. “That is the awareness we want to promote this month. Alzheimer’s is inter‑generational because we all relate to the Mana of our forefathers, of those who have gone before us. We carry it forward.”</p>
<p>Vini further emphasized the importance of remembrance through the Samoan word manatua. “‘Mana’ refers to the supernatural power to remember, while ‘tua’ means back or past. So manatua is, in essence, the supernatural power to remember the past.”</p>
<p>She concluded: “We must manatua those who are mananoa — those whose supernatural power to remember has become noa, or void. The Samoan phrase 'Manatua le Mananoa' translates to ‘Remember those who have forgotten,’ or ‘Remember those whose supernatural power to remember is now void.’”</p>
<p>The audience, listening intently, applauded with appreciation — acknowledging the informative, empowering, and culturally resonant explanation of the origins of the newly coined term Mananoa.</p>
<p>The floor was then opened for questions. Talatala le Ta‘ui Podcaster and former Samoa News reporter Taupau Tauileave Toluono began the Q&amp;A session by requesting a Samoan‑language explanation of Mananoa, for the benefit of elderly viewers of his podcast.</p>
<p>Rev. Lale Peteru responded by first recognizing the invaluable work of the LMS missionaries who brought the Gospel to Samoa and, for the first time, produced a written version of the Samoan language.</p>
<p>“They constructed many new words that appear in the Samoan translation of the Bible,” Rev. Peteru explained. “These words were not originally Samoan but were carefully constructed by the missionaries. If future Bible translations omit them, there is a danger that these words will be lost.”</p>
<p>He emphasized that Samoans today have acquired the linguistic and contextual knowledge necessary to master the art of word construction, enabling them to create terms that can name and describe anything.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that the situation has changed in modern times, with many people relying on transliteration — directly adapting foreign words based on sound. He stated that this practice has cheapened the Samoan language.</p>
<p>He cited examples: the English word 'cousin' often transliterated as 'kaseni,' though Samoan already has words such as 'tausoga' or 'tei;' and the word 'camera' translated as 'kamela,' when traditional Samoan terms like 'mea pu‘eata' or 'masini pu‘eata' exist.</p>
<p>“When we set out to construct a Samoan word for Alzheimer’s, we knew the building blocks had to share a contextual connection with the disease,” Rev. Peteru said. “As Vini explained, the cognitive power of the mind to remember and store information is called the Mana of a person in Polynesia. When that power to remember is diminished by Alzheimer’s, it becomes Noa — void. Hence, the new word: Mananoa.”</p>
<p>Executive Director of the Samoan Language Commission of American Samoa, Elisapeta Tupo Alaimaleata, opened her remarks by expressing heartfelt gratitude for the vital role that Punialava‘a continues to play in preserving and advancing the Samoan language.</p>
<p>She asked the Punialava'a members how they had chosen the words used to construct the new term Mananoa, noting that there were many possible options. Specifically, Alaimaleata inquired about the process behind selecting the two words Mana and Noa.</p>
<p>Responding to the question, Mrs. Vini Peteru first reflected on the word Mana, explaining that when it is spoken, it often refers to God’s Mana — His almighty power.</p>
<p>“Then Lale and I focused on the word 'Tamāli‘iaga' — the dignity and honor of a human being worthy of respect, created by God Almighty,” she shared. “Our thought process followed this path because of the way people afflicted with Alzheimer’s are often unjustly perceived. Too often they are ridiculed, stigmatized, and falsely labeled as ‘crazy’ by those who do not understand the disease.”</p>
<p>She emphasized that this was why they agreed to use Mana as the root word: “It reflects the power of the human mind to process, store, and remember information. And we affirm that this power itself was created by a higher power — God, the Creator of the Universe.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Peteru went on to connect this to the word manatua, which calls on us to remember those who have lost the ability to remember, reminding us that they too were created by God. “Manatua le Mananoa,” she concluded — Remember those who have forgotten.</p>
<p>The legendary Punialava‘a Family Band took to the stage last week  at the &quot;Manatua le Mananoa Aiga Concert&quot; at the Veterans Memorial Stadium, Tafuna.</p>
<p>This special event was coordinated by ABLE and was free of charge and open to the entire community.</p>
<p>Joining Punialava‘a were other outstanding Samoan musical acts:</p>
<p>• Ozki – the rising Samoan duo of brothers Gaberiel and AJ Paese Si‘a, whose fresh sound bridges traditional Samoan roots with modern pop.</p>
<p>• Marina Davis – the internationally renowned Samoan Diva, often hailed as the “Voice of the Pacific,” celebrated for her powerhouse soprano and her role in shaping modern Polynesian music. The concert begins at 6pm sharp. Come early, bring your family, and be part of this unforgettable evening of music, culture, and community pride.</p>
<p>Samoa News will report this on an exclusive interview following the press conference with Executive Director of the Samoan Language Commission of American Samoa Alaimaleata reiterating the importance of Punialava’a’s contribution to the Samoan language as well as deepening cultural understanding across generations.</p>

      <p>From the passenger seat of a sky blue Prius, Amy Oba craned her neck to get a look at the federal detention center, a hulking tower surrounded by a black chain-link fence and laced with barbed wire. On a recent evening, she was on patrol, part of a group of Japanese Americans who are keeping a watchful eye on the actions of immigration agents in Los Angeles.</p>

      <h1>Tropical storm deaths top 600 in Southeast Asia, over 4 million affected</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>JAKARTA/BANGKOK — The death toll mounted to over 600 from floods and landslides caused by torrential rains across three countries in Southeast Asia, officials said on Sunday, as relief efforts for tens of thousands of displaced people continued over the weekend. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand faced large-scale devastation after a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait fuelling heavy rains and wind gusts for a week. There were 435 dead in Indonesia, 170 in Thailand, and three deaths reported in Malaysia. Rescue and relief officials in the Southeast Asian countries were still trying to get access to many flood-hit areas on Sunday even as flood waters receded and tens of thousands of people were evacuated across the three countries. Over 4 million people have been affected — nearly 3 million in southern Thailand and 1.1 million in western Indonesia, according to official statistics. Separately, across the Bay of Bengal, another 153 people were killed by a cyclone in the island nation of Sri Lanka, authorities said, with 191 others missing and more than half a million affected nationwide.</p>

<p>Addressing Parliament yesterday, PM Marape said the Marape-Rosso Government is committed to ensuring a “strongly defined” agreement, using the New Porgera deal — which guarantees 55 percent total benefits to PNG — as the benchmark for all future resource negotiations.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape has announced that the PNG Reset@50 Roadmap provides the nation’s strongest governance Reform agenda since Independence, aimed at restoring Constitutional balance, strengthening Parliament, and safeguarding Public wealth.</p>
<p>“The Roadmap tells us one truth: to build a prosperous and united PNG over the next 20 years, we must restore the 1975 spirit of our Constitution—its integrity, its checks and balances, and its vision of a people centred State,” PM Marape said.</p>

The major increases include functional grants rising by 44 per cent over two years from K535.0 million to K770.0 million, and Goods and Services Tax (GST) and bookmakers tax distributions increasing from K980.0 million in 2024 to K1.274 billion in 2026.

<p>After some delay, the 2026 Appropriation Bill has been tabled and we have a whopping K30 billion budget on our hands. If former prime minister, Peter O’Niell is correct, the delay may be due to the K2 billion hole in the 2025 budget.</p>
<p>If that is so, Treasurer, Ian Ling-Stuckey and his economic advisors will by now realise that they got the 2025 budget wrong by overestimating revenue and underestimating expenditure, he is going to look at what other animals there are in the farmyard to slaughter.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Captain Katy Manning</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Australian Army vocalist Musician Miella Sartori sang in Samoa with US and Canadian musicians during Exercise Pacific Partnership 2025.</p>
<p>A Townsville native, she usually sings with the band of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR).</p>
<p>For Pacific Partnership 2025, she joined a multinational band in Samoa, sharing music across schools, local communities and at the National University of Samoa, where crowds sang and danced along to every song.</p>
<p>“Our days here are really beautiful,” Musician Sartori said.</p>
<p>“We get to do lots of community engagements, and people are so warm and welcoming.”</p>
<p>She described the mission as not just performing but connecting with people and collaborating with international partners.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to see how music brings everyone together, no matter where you are,” Musician Sartori said.</p>
<p>“Working alongside American and Canadian musicians, sharing songs with local communities and seeing people join in really shows the power of music and how that connects us.</p>
<p>“My highlight here supporting Pacific Partnership was performing for the Samoa Victim Support Group at the Campus of Hope.”</p>
<p>The children’s joy and energy left a lasting impression, showing how music can lift spirits and bring people together.</p>
<p>She said learning a few Samoan songs made those moments even more special, as audiences would light up and join in.</p>
<p>“It’s not just performing – it’s about connecting. You give energy and it comes right back to you. That’s what makes it so special.”</p>
<p>Musician Sartori said she was proud to represent Australia while sharing music and seeing the difference the mission makes.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s really incredible to be part of this,” she said.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Health leaders from 16 Pacific countries gathered in Honiara earlier this month for a workshop on Aedes mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes carry dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya.</p>
<p>PMN reports the training was part of the Pacific Mosquito Surveillance Strengthening for Impact program.</p>
<p>Participants did field work, lab analysis, and strategy planning so they could return home better prepared.</p>
<p>A long-term goal of the workshop is to build up regional health security, by sharing data on mosquito populations and how they respond to insecticides.</p>
<p>Dr Nemia Bainivalu from the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health says mosquito-borne diseases are re-emerging threats, intensified by climate change, rapid urbanization, and increased human mobility.</p>
<p>Multiple people have died from dengue fever in the region this year.</p>
<p><strong>CNMI MOURNS PASSING</strong></p>
<p>A long-serving lawmaker of the Northern Marianas, Diego Tenorio Benavente, has died aged 66.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with acute leukemia about three months ago.</p>
<p>Pacific Daily News reported Benavente was first elected into office in 1989 as a member of the CNMI House of Representatives.</p>
<p>He served for six consecutive terms — three of those as House speaker.</p>
<p>Benavente was elected lieutenant governor in 2001.</p>
<p>The CNMI's delegate to Congress, Kimberlyn King-Hinds, said Benavente was an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>She said they remember &quot;a pioneer whose strength, vision, and heart shaped our community for the better&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI PM SHIFTS GOVT</strong></p>
<p>Fiji's Prime Minister says it's his prerogative to choose who stands in for him while he is overseas.</p>
<p>Sitiveni Rabuka was responding to questions from the Fiji Times about why the deputy prime minister, Viliame Gavoka, was not chosen as acting PM while Rabuka was in Japan.</p>
<p>Rabuka's nephew, Filimoni Vosarogo, the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, was acting Prime Minister instead.</p>
<p>The query follows recent shifts in the coalition government leadership, leaving Gavoka as the sole deputy prime minister.</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA PM DEFENDS OBSERVER BAN</strong></p>
<p>Samoa's prime minister has defended the decision to ban the Samoa Observer from press conferences in response to a joint letter from two media organisations.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands News Association and the Pacific Freedom Forum have urged La'aulialemalietoa Polataivao Schmidt to reverse the ban.</p>
<p>A statement from the office of the Prime Minister acknowledged concerns raised by the media watchdogs.</p>
<p>It said the criticism was 'respected and understood' but urged them &quot;to seek full information before forming conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>It said &quot;this is not a ban on media freedom — it is a response to persistent unprofessional and unethical conduct.&quot;</p>
<p>It added that the action taken relates solely to the Samoa Observer.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>by Pokere Paewai, RNZ Maori issues reporter</p>
<p>November 19, 2025 — A collective of indigenous chefs are using WIPCE as a springboard for cultural connection through kai.</p>
<p>The group includes Māori chefs Kārena and Kasey Bird, Joe McLeod and Kia Kanuta, as well as Hawaiian Kealoha Domingo, Native American Crystal Wahpepah and Samoan Henry Onesemo.</p>
<p>Nearly 4000 delegates from indigenous nations around the world have descended on Auckland for the education conference held once every three years.</p>
<p>Chef Joe McLeod told RNZ the idea to collaborate was born at a food festival in Hawai'i where the Hawaiian chefs suggested showcasing their kai [food] together at WIPCE.</p>
<p>&quot;So, it's a partnership between New Zealand, Hawai'i, Canada, Australia, Samoa, Tonga... There's only a handful of us for now, so we're kick-starting this group to hopefully expand it out over time as we progress moving forward. But the whole purpose of the kaupapa is to show off the best of our cultural food. Our culinary cultural identity.&quot;</p>
<p>The events the collective is running at WIPCE include an exclusive dinner where international chefs were paired with Māori chefs to create dishes like Kangaroo Laab, roasted turkey and Hapuka Hinu-kōhue.</p>
<p>The dinner was sold out but McLeod said in &quot;typical Māori&quot; fashion he added an extra four seats for his whānau.</p>
<p>It hasn't all gone to plan as well with some of the suitcases not making it on to the plane, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So, it's been a real dog's breakfast of a nightmare trying to sort it out. So, I don't think we're going to get the food that's part of their luggage that was supposed to come over yesterday with our guests coming over from Hawaii.&quot;</p>
<p>McLeod said meeting for WIPCE was the first time the collective had all met each other, so he thanked the conference for kick starting the journey.</p>
<p>It's just the start of the initiative and he is hopeful it will continue to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been in the industry almost 56 years, so this is not new to me, but to our young ones coming through, oh mate, it's stunning to watch them get all excited like how I used to 50 years ago. But my role now is mainly kaumātua rangatira, leader, and someone who can open a lot of doors for the next generation.&quot;</p>
<p>McLeod said that is his gift to the next generation of Māori chefs, to open doors for them once they decide where their vision lies.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Chef Kealoha Domingo told RNZ it's &quot;been nothing short of amazing&quot; to connect with the other chefs.</p>
<p>Domingo said he is fortunate to have fallen into the role of reconnecting indigenous people in Hawai'i with their traditional foods.</p>
<p>&quot;It's motivating me to continue the work and to connect with other people who are doing the same, to just build the bonds and build the strength and, you know, increase everything exponentially as the network grows.&quot;</p>
<p>The Chefs also had the chance to visit Velskov native forest farm in the Waitākere Ranges, ostensibly to relax amongst the hustle of WIPCE but also a chance for the international chefs to forage for native plants.</p>
<p>Head of Tourism at Tātaki Auckland Unlimited Karen Thompson-Smith said Velskov is a fantastic new venture that allows tourists to learn a little bit more about kai Māori.</p>
<p>It's fantastic to see indigenous chefs from around the world visit Auckland and be able to utilise local produce, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland is a melting pot. We have so many different cultures that make up Auckland. So we've got this incredible, different cuisine that's been built on the back of our indigenous people being the Māori people and how they prepare their food.</p>
<p>&quot;There's this real cross-pollination coming through. And what we're seeing in our food scene here in Auckland is just this development of different food offerings.&quot;</p>

      <h1>Happy Thanksgiving!</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/amata_happy_thanksgiving_graphic.jpg?itok=B7_H-ZZh"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/amata_happy_thanksgiving_graphic.jpg?itok=W041K-EI" alt="THANKSGIVING GRAPHIC"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Tomorrow, American Samoa joins the rest of the United States and Americans around the world in celebration of Thanksgiving Day — a federal and public holiday. Like the rest of the nation, many local residents will mark Thanksgiving with prayers and celebrations through gatherings with families and friends, as well as religious traditions.</p>
<p>Sons and daughters of American Samoa serving in the US Armed Forces around the world will also be in the minds and hearts of their families and loved ones at home as they gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, which, according to historians, was first celebrated by early Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in 1621. It was a three-day feast. George Washington proclaimed the first National Day of Thanksgiving in 1789, and Abraham Lincoln revived the tradition during the Civil War.</p>
<p>For American Samoa, a special 4-day weekend is on the table.</p>
<p>Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula released a general memorandum, dated November 25, 2025, announcing the two holidays in the territory —  Thanksgiving Day on Nov 27th, and the following day, Friday, Nov. 28th, in honor and observance of the official opening ceremony of the American Samoa Maota Fono.</p>
<p>For both days, all government offices will be closed and all normal operations will be suspended on both days.</p>
<p>Of note: While federal agencies/ offices are closed in observance of Thanksgiving Day, Friday is not a federal holiday — meaning the US Postal Office should be open on that day. Samoa News has also been informed that the Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) will be open on Friday, Nov. 28th.</p>
<p>The governor’s memo notes that ASG will resume normal business hours on Monday, December 1, 2025,</p>
<p>Governor Pulaali’i wishes “everyone a safe and restful holiday with family and loved ones.”</p>
<p>Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata released the following statement in celebration of Thanksgiving Day 2025:</p>
<p>Colossians 3:15-17 (NKJV) ~ <em>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</em></p>
<p>The Holy Bible has no shortage of thanksgiving verses, reminding us to live with gratitude and be mindful of our blessings, and God as their source. We are a thankful people, and these verses stood out to me this year, because they highlight singing, and our people dearly love to sing. I personally love to hear our various congregations or school groups as they follow our wonderful island tradition of enjoying music to the fullest.</p>
<p>A special thank you to those protecting us in the military, who can’t be home, or serving as medical professionals and first responders on call to keep us safe during our time off.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is a welcome but brief pause in the Washington, D.C., busy schedule. Congress must promptly complete the remaining appropriations bills, or renew a government funding extension after January for some federal departments and agencies. I also expect we will very soon finalize the yearly NDAA Defense bill which authorizes all Pentagon efforts and the pay increase for our military, and a Coast Guard authorization that directs growing attention to the Pacific and boosts the cutter fleet. I will keep you informed of these priorities.</p>
<p>In The Territory:</p>
<p>Several local restaurants are offering Thanksgiving specials tomorrow, which will take the burden off those who don’t want to cook and clean up but instead, enjoy each other’s company over food and drinks. It will also not be unusual to see the parks/ beaches full with families and people celebrating Thanksgiving on Thursday.</p>
<p>A few stores are also offering ready cooked turkey feasts and the Thanksgiving holiday heading into the weekend is another busy time for inter Samoa travel. Because of the holidays, police presence will increase island-wide and motorists are reminded not to drink and drive.</p>
<p>In observation of Thanksgiving Day 2025, Samoa News will not publish tomorrow and Friday, but will return on Monday, Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Samoa News reminds all — to please celebrate the 4-day weekend safely and peacefully. And, please be kind to one another.</p>
<p>We wish you all a joyful time and delicious meals this Thanksgiving with family and dear friends. Have a blessed and thankful holiday!</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape says his government will not remain silent on human rights concerns affecting Melanesians, including the people of West Papua, and has consistently raised these matters with Indonesia.</p>
<p>Mr Marape said PNG’s foreign policy “is not being overshadowed or manipulated by Indonesia” and that concerns over alleged human rights abuses in West Papua have been communicated in multiple bilateral and regional meetings over the years.</p>

      <p>AEDES MOSQUITOES WORKSHOPS</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Health leaders from 16 Pacific countries gathered in Honiara earlier this month for a workshop on Aedes mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes carry dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya.</p>
<p>PMN reports the training was part of the Pacific Mosquito Surveillance Strengthening for Impact program.</p>
<p>Participants did field work, lab analysis, and strategy planning so they could return home better prepared.</p>
<p>A long-term goal of the workshop is to build up regional health security, by sharing data on mosquito populations and how they respond to insecticides.</p>
<p>Dr Nemia Bainivalu from the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health says mosquito-borne diseases are re-emerging threats, intensified by climate change, rapid urbanization, and increased human mobility.</p>
<p>Multiple people have died from dengue fever in the region this year.</p>
<p><strong>CNMI MOURNS PASSING</strong></p>
<p>A long-serving lawmaker of the Northern Marianas, Diego Tenorio Benavente, has died aged 66.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with acute leukemia about three months ago.</p>
<p>Pacific Daily News reported Benavente was first elected into office in 1989 as a member of the CNMI House of Representatives.</p>
<p>He served for six consecutive terms — three of those as House speaker.</p>
<p>Benavente was elected lieutenant governor in 2001.</p>
<p>The CNMI's delegate to Congress, Kimberlyn King-Hinds, said Benavente was an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>She said they remember &quot;a pioneer whose strength, vision, and heart shaped our community for the better&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Fiji PM SHIFTS GOVT</strong></p>
<p>Fiji's Prime Minister says it's his prerogative to choose who stands in for him while he is overseas.</p>
<p>Sitiveni Rabuka was responding to questions from the Fiji Times about why the deputy prime minister, Viliame Gavoka, was not chosen as acting PM while Rabuka was in Japan.</p>
<p>Rabuka's nephew, Filimoni Vosarogo, the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, was acting Prime Minister instead.</p>
<p>The query follows recent shifts in the coalition government leadership, leaving Gavoka as the sole deputy prime minister.</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA PM DEFENDS OBSERVER BAN</strong></p>
<p>Samoa's prime minister has defended the decision to ban the Samoa Observer from press conferences in response to a joint letter from two media organisations.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands News Association and the Pacific Freedom Forum have urged La'aulialemalietoa Polataivao Schmidt to reverse the ban.</p>
<p>A statement from the office of the Prime Minister acknowledged concerns raised by the media watchdogs.</p>
<p>It said the criticism was 'respected and understood' but urged them &quot;to seek full information before forming conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>It said &quot;this is not a ban on media freedom - it is a response to persistent unprofessional and unethical conduct.&quot;</p>
<p>It added that the action taken relates solely to the Samoa Observer.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> In a press release, dated November 19, 2025, the American Samoa Government (ASG) announced that the ASG Customs Division is auctioning “for export only” the 47 vehicles imported from China which were seized for failing to meet the US Transportation and safety regulations. The bid auction will in all probability finally conclude the public saga of the ‘illegal imported’ vehicles that has been the focus of Senate and House hearings, as well as concern in the business community.</p>
<p>The bid auction was held yesterday, Monday, November 24, 2025.</p>
<p>The vehicle bid auction caveat — “for export only” — means that it will only sell to persons/ entities that will export the vehicles as “the vehicles do not comply with the U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which apply in American Samoa as a U.S. federally funded jurisdiction, they cannot be operated, registered, or used on American Samoa roads or any roadway within the U.S.”</p>
<p>The ASG press release cites the American Samoa Code, as providing the legal base for the vehicle bid auction — “…if the consignee fails to file a claim in the High Court, under ASCA § 27.1042(c) the vehicle will be deemed forfeited and ownership transferred to the American Samoa Government.”</p>
<p>The press release continues, “the seized vehicles are available for public viewing at the Customs Warehouse in Tafuna until November 24 (yesterday) at 12:00 p.m. (noon). The auction is taking place on the field between the Customs Warehouse building and the main road in Tafuna.”</p>
<p>It was “a sealed-bid auction, and all bids must be submitted to the Office of Property Management by 12:00pm on November 24, 2025.</p>
<p>Successful bidders were required to make a 10 percent payment upon notification, with the remaining balance paid in full before vehicles are exported.</p>
<p>It further notes that “as this auction is designated for export only, all vehicles purchased must be shipped off-island to destinations outside U.S. jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“Because these vehicles do not meet federal safety standards, they cannot be registered or driven in American Samoa or anywhere within the United States.</p>
<p>Following the auction, all vehicles will remain with Customs.</p>
<p>“Buyers are responsible for arranging direct shipping, and vehicles will be released solely from Customs to the authorized vessel for export.”</p>
<p>The press release states that “this procedure ensures transparency and upholds the integrity of the export-only requirement.”</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>In July of this year, the Customs Division of Treasury issued notices of seizures to the consignees of vehicles imported directly from China. The consignees or importers were given 30 calendar days to file a complaint or appeal with the High Court of American Samoa if they wanted to contest the seizure.</p>
<p>All costs related to re-exportation of the vehicles are the sole responsibility of the importers, and public funds would not be used to subsidize the removal or return of the non-compliant vehicles, according to information provided by then Treasurer Donald Kruse to the media concerning the vehicles from China.</p>
<p>At the time, Kruse stated that federal regulatory frameworks are being used for enforcement in the absence of specific territorial provisions, as pursuant to the American Samoa Code Annotated. He noted that “these requirements have long existed under federal and territorial law,” with any prior non action reflecting a lapse in execution, not in legal authority.</p>
<p>Kruse pointed out that the imports of the vehicles correspond with rising Asian-own commercial activity (car rentals, as well as retail stores) within the territory.</p>
<p>The former Treasurer, repeated his explanation in a Senate hearing held in September this year, when he and the head of Customs were called to testify in a hearing about concerns the senators had about these ‘illegal imported’ vehicles.</p>

<p>During the delivery of the 2026 Budget in Parliament today, Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey pointedly attributed the inherited budget deficit to former Prime Minister Peter O’Neill.</p>
<p>Treasurer Stuckey highlighted that, despite record levels of revenue and relatively low budget expenditures, the country faces a budget deficit of K1,607 million.</p>
<p>He explained that the government is still spending about K150 more per person than the country’s revenue.</p>
<p>Stuckey acknowledged that opposition critics believe this deficit is too high but emphasized that it has improved significantly compared to the inherited situation.</p>
<p>“This K150 per person deficit is better than the K520 per person deficit inherited from the Other Guy,” referring to O’Neill.</p>
<p>He further noted that the deficit per person under O’Neill was 250% higher than in the 2026 Budget.</p>
<p>The Treasurer confirmed that this high deficit figure was verified through thorough work, including assessments by international partners such as the IMF, which uncovered discrepancies in previous budgets.</p>
<p>Stuckey also criticized the previous administration for misusing the expected benefits of the PNG LNG project, which came online in 2014.</p>
<p>He accused O’Neill’s government of wasting this resource’s potential, citing the 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) as evidence.</p>

      <p>HAWAIIAN VAKA MAKES HISTORIC RETURN TO NZ</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Hawaiian vaka was on display for people to see at Mangonui's main wharf in Northland this past Sunday.</p>
<p>Hikianalia is accompanying vaka Hōkūleʻa to take part in celebrations to mark 40 years since Hōkūleʻa visited.</p>
<p>It sparked the revival of building ocean-going vaka and traditional navigation, led by <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2018820446/sir-hek-busby-he-was-the-bridge-builder-of-oceania">the late Sir Hek Busby</a>.</p>
<p>Hikianalia was on display until 2pm, and then headed to a dry dock in Auckland for maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>CRITICAL ASSESSMENT UNDERWAY FOR PNG'S CONJOINED TWINS</strong></p>
<p>A medical team from Australia is in Papua New Guinea assessing tiny conjoined twins who are fighting for survival.</p>
<p>The parents of six-week-old Tom and Sawong are desperate for their boys to be surgically separated, despite previous medical advice against it.</p>
<p>The twins, whose combined weight is only 2.9kg, were born in Morobe province on 9 October, joined at the abdomen.</p>
<p>They were flown by helicopter to Port Moresby General Hospital, where they received basic care in the neo-natal unit for five weeks.</p>
<p>Doctors had explored the possibility of flying them to Sydney for specialist care, but various plans fell through.</p>
<p>The hospital then did a u-turn earlier this month and advised the parents to stay in PNG, or risk one of both of them dying.</p>
<p>The family launched a global appeal for help and a week ago, the twins were moved to an intensive care unit at Paradise Private Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>PUBLIC REMINDED TO WEAR SEAT BELTS</strong></p>
<p>Drivers are being urged to wear their seat belts after car crashes that took the lives of two women and nearly killed another.</p>
<p>None of them were buckled up during the incidents on Oahu and Maui over the past week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Co%20%22https:/www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Kyra Anne Tyquiengco, 29, was killed on the H-3 Freeway</a> Thursday evening, after a 19-year-old driver rear-ended her.</p>
<p>Tyquiengco became Oahu’s 75th traffic death of the year, compared to 43 at the same time last year. She was not wearing a seat belt during the time of the collision.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate, especially this time of year. It happens, but it doesn’t have to happen as long as you take the proper safety precautions. Cars nowadays have tremendous safety features that are built in, but they don’t work if you don’t use them,” retired Maui Police Department traffic commander Lt. William Hankins said.</p>
<p>In light of Tyquiengco’s death, Hankins is reminding drivers to keep themselves and others safe.</p>
<p>“Simple things as far as buckling up your seat belt, staying off your phone, staying sober when you’re driving, following the speed limit,” Hankins added. “The basic things that you’re supposed to do will help keep you alive.”</p>
<p>On Maui last Saturday, <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/17/woman-dies-after-single-vehicle-crash-maui/%22%20%5Co%20%22https:/www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/17/woman-dies-after-single-vehicle-crash-maui/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Hilalia Villanueva-Langi, 21, lost her life in a rollover crash</a> in Kula.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Co%20%22https:/www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">on Friday in the same district, an 84-year-old woman</a> had life-threatening injuries in yet another rollover collision.</p>
<p>Neither of the drivers was wearing a seat belt.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest things that people need to be aware of with crashes and not wearing your seat belt is the likelihood, and especially in a rollover, of you getting thrown out the vehicle is extremely high,” Hankins said.</p>
<p>Hankins also explained that wearing a seat belt could be particularly crucial in a rollover, when someone could be ejected.</p>

<p><strong>PROBE LAUNCHED INTO POLICE BRIBE VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>A video circulating on social media showing a Samoa police officer receiving money from a driver at a roadside checkpoint has sparked debate in Samoa and prompted the Acting Police Commissioner to order an investigation.</p>
<p>The footage has been widely shared across Facebook and TikTok, with some users claiming the exchange reflects a “common practice” in Samoa, while others argue the driver, not the officer, is at fault.</p>
<p>Acting Police Commissioner Leiataua Samuelu Afamasaga confirmed the video had been brought to his attention but said investigators are still trying to determine key details, including when and where it was filmed.</p>
<p>“People sent it to me (the video), asking if I know this incident. That type of behaviour is unacceptable,” he said. “But if you look closely, it’s also an allegation against the person who tried to give the money to the police officer.” The video shows a driver handing $10 to a uniformed officer.</p>
<p>Leiataua said he had seen the video online and had no confirmed information on when or where it was recorded. “We don’t know if this is yesterday, today, last year, or even 10 years ago,” he said.</p>
<p>Leiataua confirmed that accepting money in this manner is improper. “But the police officer accepted that money, which he should not have accepted,” he said.</p>
<p>Leiataua also noted that identifying the people in the video is difficult. “There’s no clear face of the driver or our officer. They never show his face. People post it online to generate negative opinions about our service,” he said.</p>
<p>The commissioner said the investigation would determine whether the act constitutes bribery or misconduct. “If the investigation comes back and he did accept it and it’s bribery, then we file a criminal charge,” Leiataua explained. “If I’m not satisfied with the evidence for a criminal charge, then we charge him with misconduct.”</p>
<p>The video has been widely shared across social media this week, attracting significant attention. Some viewers have described it as a “common practice in Samoa,” while others have defended the police, suggesting the &quot;driver is at fault.&quot;</p>
<p>Leiataua did not confirm the location of the checkpoint or whether he is familiar with the area shown in the video.</p>

<p><em>Honolulu, HAWAII —</em> The 205th meeting of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council will convene by web conference on December 16-17, 2025.</p>
<p>Host sites for Webex include 1164 Bishop St., Ste. 1400, Honolulu, HI; Tedi of Samoa Bldg., Ste. 208B, Fagatogo Village, AS; BRI Bldg., Ste. 205, Kopa Di Oru St., Garapan, Saipan, CNMI; Cliff Pointe, 304 W. O'Brien Dr., Hagatfia, Guam.</p>
<p>The Webex link is <a href="https://tinyurl.com/205Counci1Mtg">https://tinyurl.com/205Counci1Mtg</a> (if prompted, enter event number: 2864 005 8179; password: CM205mtg).</p>
<p>Specific information on joining the meeting, instructions for connecting to the Webex and providing oral public comments during the meeting will be posted on the Council website at: <a href="http://www.wpcouncil.org/event/205th-council-meeting-virtual-2">www.wpcouncil.org/event/205th-council-meeting-virtual-2</a>.</p>
<p>The Council will consider and may take action on the issues summarized below, including any public comments on them. Written public comments on final action items should be received by the Council's executive director by 5 p.m. (HST), Thursday, December 11, 2025, via postal mail, fax or email as indicated at end of the end of the article.</p>
<p>Summary of Action Items at the 205th Council Meeting</p>
<p>1. ACL Specifications for CNMI BMUS for 2026 to 2029 (Final Action)</p>
<p>At its 203rd meeting in June 2025, the Council received the 2025 Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) bottomfish management unit species (BMUS) stock  assessment update (Bohaboy and Matthews 2025) that found the fishery was not overfished or  experiencing overfishing. The stock assessment was updated with boat-based creel survey  interviews from 2018 to 2023. The Council accepted it as the best scientific information  available on the status of the fishery and directed staff to develop potential acceptable biological  catches (ABCs) and annual catch limits (ACLs) for initial action at the 204 t h  meeting.</p>
<p>The current ACL and annual catch target (ACT) for fishing years 2024 to 2025 were  specified at a 39% and 34% risk of overfishing, respectively. This accounts for the assessment  information, uncertainty characterization, stock status, productivity and susceptibility and the  social, economic, ecological and management uncertainties related to the CNMI BMUS fishery.  The catch associated with the ACL and ACT is 82,000 pounds and 75,000 pounds, respectively.  The average catch from the commercial and non-commercial sectors in fishing years 2021 to 2023 was 44,054 pounds, which is 54% of the ACL.</p>
<p>At its 205th meeting, the Council will consider taking final action on an alternative to specify ACLs and accountability measures (AMs) for the CNMI BMUS fishery for fishing years  2026 to 2029.  The Council will consider the following  alternatives:</p>
<p>No Action, do not specify ACLs and AMs</p>
<p>2.        Status quo, specify an ACL and ACT of 82,000 lbs and 74,000 lbs (Langseth et  al. 2019)</p>
<p>3.        Specify ACL (72,000 lbs) and ACT (66,000 lbs) based on the revised P* and  SEEM scores (P*=40% and 35%) (  Preliminary Preferred  )</p>
<p>4.        Specify ACL (&lt;72,000 lbs) and ACT (&lt;66,000 lbs) below the revised P* and  SEEM scores (P*&lt;40% and 35%)</p>
<p>Recommendations for Commercial Fishing Regulations in the Pacific Islands Heritage</p>
<p>On April 17, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Presidential Proclamation 10918,</p>
<p>“Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific,” in which the President found that</p>
<p>“managed commercial fishing would not put objects of scientific and historic interest within the  PRIMNM at risk” and that “a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time, necessary for  the proper care and management of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument</p>
<p>(PRIMNM, since changed to Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument via  Presidential Memorandum January 2, 2025) or the objects of historic or scientific interest  therein.” The Proclamation states that the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial fishing within 50-200 nm of the boundaries of the monument.  It also directs the Secretary of Commerce, through NOAA, to expeditiously publish new proposed rules in the  Federal Register  to amend or repeal all burdensome regulations that restrict commercial fishing in the PRIMNM.</p>
<p>In order to meet the Proclamation, NOAA will need to publish new proposed rules regarding commercial fishing in the expanded areas of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine  National Monument (PIHMNM) including Wake and Johnston Atolls and Jarvis Island.  Fishing  regulations are promulgated through the process described in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act, and therefore the Council may provide recommendations on RAMNM, PMNM, and MTMNM in order to expedite the process.  The Council will review options that may include:</p>
<p>1. No Action - Do not remove commercial fishing prohibitions;</p>
<p>2. Restore commercial fishing by removing existing prohibitions;</p>
<p>3. Revising existing fisheries management measures to restore commercial fishing and include new or additional measures.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa Customs officers have intercepted 1.4 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken, after a targeted operation on Saturday uncovered the illicit shipment arriving from American Samoa.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Ministry of Customs and Revenue confirmed the discovery was made on Saturday and described the concealment method as another example of the tactics used by organized criminal groups.</p>
<p>“The concealment method demonstrates the continued attempts by criminal syndicates to smuggle dangerous drugs into Samoa through seemingly ordinary goods,” the Ministry said.</p>
<p>Customs officers secured the shipment immediately and followed standard enforcement procedures. The man who imported the consignment was detained and later handed over to the Ministry of Police, Prisons and Corrections Service together with the seized drugs “for further investigation and prosecution,” according to the Ministry.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Samoa News should point out that local lawmakers have recently been upset about Samoa’s stance that American Samoa is one of the main routes/ or suppliers of meth to Samoa. They have asked for proof or an apology.]</em></p>

      <p>Sunny, out-of-the-way Languedoc, in southwest France, is overlooked by many. Stretching from the Mediterranean to the Pyrenees, it shares a balmy climate, winter wind, grapevines, and the sea with the better-known neighboring region of Provence. But Languedoc has its own character — more “France in the rough” — and several stops worth your while.</p>

<p>Among the three villages, Keapara and Karawa have access to land where they cultivate crops for their community’s sustenance.</p>

<p>Minister for Energy and Member for Kairuku, Peter Namea Isoaimo, has issued an urgent call to the Ministry of Works to immediately intervene in a road emergency along the Hiritano Highway at Tubu in the Nara area of Kairuku District.</p>
<p>The Minister said the situation is now critical, with the damaged section posing an imminent risk of cutting off the people of Kerema, Kairuku, and Goilala from essential travel, trade, and services.</p>
<p>Minister Isoaimo's appeal is directly to Minister for Works, Solon Mirisin, urging him to instruct Secretary David Holemba and relevant technical teams to immediately assess and respond to the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>“This is an emergency. Our people will now be completely cut off if Works does not intervene quickly,” Minister Isoaimo stressed, adding that continuous rainfall has worsened the deterioration of the affected road segment.</p>
<p>He said restoring accessibility on this vital national highway is crucial to avoid disruptions in the movement of goods, government services, and emergency response operations.</p>
<p>The Minister also called for a coordinated approach involving provincial and district authorities to ensure swift mobilisation of machinery and resources.</p>
<p>“We must act now to prevent a total shutdown of the route. The lives and livelihoods of thousands depend on it,” Minister Isoaimo said.</p>

<p>THE people of Dapera village, who were once forcefully displaced by the Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) and Rio Tinto, have celebrated the 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>8th July 1975 is a date Dapera people will never forget when they were forcefully removed from their homes, leaving behind. When the mine expanded, these were the first people affected physically, and it's in their expense and in their suffering and sacrifice that PNG gained independence in 1975, and yet nothing has been done to appreciate and compensate them.</p>

      <h1>Samoa welcomes first electric fire trucks as part of green transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/samoas_electric_firetruck.jpeg?itok=eGL0Iusn"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/samoas_electric_firetruck.jpeg?itok=meEVyboV" alt="electric firetrucks"></a></p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> The Government of Samoa and Japan and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) celebrated a major national milestone with the launch last week of Samoa’s first fully electric fire fighting vehicles, and the handover of new, specialized rescue emergency equipment under the Climate Action Pathways for Island Transport (CAP-IT) Project.</p>
<p>This landmark achievement reflects the strength of the tripartite partnership and Samoa’s ongoing commitment to advancing climate-resilient, low-emission technologies while significantly enhancing the nation’s emergency response capacity.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led and blessed by Reverend Semikueva Fa’atoafe of the EFKS Moata’a, who encouraged the nation to view these new assets as symbols of peace, service, and protection for all communities in Samoa.</p>
<p>The Minister for Fire and Emergency Services, Seve Te’i Fuimaono, commended the collaboration behind this historic development.</p>
<p>“Today marks a historic step forward for Samoa’s resilience and emergency readiness. The introduction of these electric firefighting vehicles and specialised equipment demonstrates how innovation, sustainability, and strong partnerships can directly improve the safety of our people. We thank Japan and UNDP for their steadfast support in modernizing SFESA and advancing our green transformation.”</p>
<p>Funded through a grant from the Government of Japan and implemented by UNDP in close partnership with the Government of Samoa, the CAP-IT Project has enabled the conversion of two fully electric Ford F-150 Lightning into first-responder fire trucks in a world-first adaptation of electric vehicle technology for island emergency services.</p>
<p>In addition to the vehicles, Japan has provided over USD 100,000 in specialized fire fighting rescue equipment, including Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), heavy-duty cutting and spreading tools, a positive pressure ventilation fan, as well as additional equipment arriving in December, such as thermal imaging cameras and lifting and stabilization tools.</p>
<p>The Ambassador of Japan to Samoa reaffirmed Japan’s commitment to sustainable development and safety in the Pacific:</p>
<p>“Japan is honored to partner with Samoa and UNDP through CAP-IT to deliver innovative, low-carbon solutions that strengthen emergency services. These electric fire trucks are not only climate-friendly but also represent ground-breaking technology for small island states. Our partnership reflects Japan’s commitment to supporting Samoa’s national decarbonization goals and building safer, more resilient communities.”</p>
<p>UNDP Resident Representative, Aliona Niculita, further emphasized that:</p>
<p>“By deploying clean technology in essential public services, Samoa is showing the world that climate innovation can directly improve lives — protecting families, homes, and communities while contributing to national emission reduction goals.”</p>
<p>SFESA Commissioner, Tanuvasa Oloapu Petone Mauga, expressed gratitude for the support, and emphasized its impact on frontline readiness:</p>
<p>“This investment directly supports the safety of our fire-fighters and the communities we serve. Our teams respond to emergencies every day, and having reliable, modern tools including EV-based fire trucks strengthens our readiness and ensures we can protect lives with greater effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Chairperson of the SFESA Board of Directors, Aiono Meresaini Siaosi, who officiated the ribbon cutting ceremony, underscored the long-term significance of the partnership:</p>
<p>“This partnership demonstrates what is possible when nations and development partners work together with shared purpose. These vehicles and equipment represent progress, protection, and hope for our people. On behalf of the Board, we extend our sincere gratitude to Japan, UNDP, and the Government of Samoa.”</p>
<p>The fully electric fire fighting vehicles and specialised equipment will now be deployed to support SFESA’s operational duties nationwide, strengthening Samoa’s capacity in fire suppression, rescue operations, and hazardous incident response.</p>
<p>This joint achievement reinforces the shared commitment of Samoa, Japan, and UNDP to advancing green technology, protecting communities, and building a safer, more climate-resilient future for Samoa.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Margot Staunton, RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's opposition leader claims the Prime Minister is too sick to lead the country and should resign.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/575223/tuilaepa-sa-ilele-malielegaoi-samoa-s-longest-serving-leader-reflects-on-political-career">Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi</a> hit out at La'aulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Schmidt after he <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579054/samoan-pm-back-home-as-reporter-alleges-assault-outside-his-residence">returned from a two month absence in New Zealand</a>.</p>
<p>In September, La'auli was medivacced from Apia to Auckland just days after being sworn in as <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573201/laaulialemalietoa-schmidt-sworn-in-as-samoa-s-8th-prime-minister-third-leader-from-savai-i">Samoa's eighth prime minister</a>.</p>
<p>La'auli <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579168/samoan-pm-bans-nation-s-only-newspaper-from-government-access">banned</a> the nation's only newspaper from government access on his return home.</p>
<p>He barred the <em>Samoa Observer</em> from all ministerial press conferences on Monday, just days after returning on a private jet from New Zealand.</p>
<p>He also stopped his Cabinet ministers from talking to the newspaper, following an ugly scene outside his house on Saturday.</p>
<p>Journalists from the <em>Observer</em> and the <em>BBC</em> claim they <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579330/samoa-editor-responds-as-pm-la-aulialemalietoa-bans-newspaper-over-coverage">did not enter</a> the Prime Minister's compound, but were accused of trespassing by his security guards.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa said the incident outside the PM's house and the media ban that ensued were &quot;inappropriate&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it is telling the world, that the present government in Samoa is hiding things that they should have disclosed. It's a govenrment that does not recognise the rule of law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa claims the government is covering up the true nature of La'auli's illness.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumours are that he should have both legs cut (amputated), he had an accident, a fall, and his legs are absolutely useless, that's what I am told,&quot; he said.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Waves</em> has attempted to contact the Prime Minister repeatedly for a response.</p>
<p>In a text message on Thursday, La'auli said: &quot;Don't worry about Tuilaepa, I have far more better duties to serve Samoa.&quot;</p>
<p>In a social media video message while in Auckland, he said that his leg was injured while campaigning for the election in August, and that the &quot;trip for treatment was long overdue&quot;.</p>
<p>He said it was &quot;not something the country should be worried about&quot;.</p>
<p>However, Tuilaepa claims that most Samoans know the Prime Minister is unwell.</p>
<p>&quot;It is well known to all Samoans, 100 percent, although those who support the Prime Minister prefer not to know,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In our constitution, when a prime minister is unable to run the country, he ought to resign. That's where we are now, he is very sick.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573087/watch-i-ll-be-staying-on-for-the-next-five-years-fiame-naomi-mata-afa">former Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa</a> believes the media ban was &quot;reactionary&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think its an unwise position to take to have a ban, I don't think it serves the government well or the public for that matter. Especially since the <em>Observer</em> is the only print media that we have,&quot; Fiame said.</p>
<p>She said the optics for the government are not good.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now getting comments from outside sources condemning the actions taken, so I think the external scrutiny will be there for our government and that's not a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She believes there was a definite lack of transparency while the Prime Minister was on medical leave.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought the government would have been a lot more 'onto it', and kept the public informed, given the timing of the trip and the length of time he was away,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I had thought that they had a better media sense, all it really required was for a spokesperson to keep people updated. I mean if he's unwell, he's unwell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All they (the PM's team) needed to say was that he had arrived safely, that he needed to rest and that he would meet the media at a designated time.&quot;</p>
<p>Fiame admitted that while she had her own squirmishes with the newspaper while Prime Minister, she never sought to ban it.</p>

      <h1>Labubu and ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ to dazzle at Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)

<p><em>NEW YORK (AP) —</em> Two things that made massive cultural splashes this year — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/labubu-viral-plushy-influencers-2de46ecf0b2101a16ef6df4e46f4bc48">Labubu</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-summer-smash-surprise-b1f1a0390c303fb46959f6cf6e77b5ff">“KPop Demon Hunters”</a> — will fill the sky and streets of New York when the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off this year.</p>
<p>The Nov. 27 parade begins rain or shine on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances. It will feature 34 balloons, four mini-balloons, 28 floats, 33 clown groups and 11 marching bands — all leading the way for Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Here’s key things to know about the parade and how to watch it.</p>
<p>It starts at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and airs at that time in all time zones.</p>
<p>What channel is the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on?</p>
<p>It will be on NBC, available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers.</p>
<p>What if I want to stream it?</p>
<p>For cord cutters, the parade is being simulcast on Peacock and an encore telecast begins at 2 p.m. EST/PST. A Spanish language simulcast will also be on Telemundo.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/macys-thanksgiving-parade-jennifer-hudson-billy-porter-56d790dadc0485add54148d71c82f0fe">Last year,</a> more than 31 million people tuned in on NBC and Peacock, up 10% from the previous year and marking the biggest audience ever for the parade.</p>
<p>What’s the weather going to be like?</p>
<p>The Weather Channel predicts a high of 52 degrees and a partly cloudy day, with winds up to 10 mph. AccuWeather also predicts 52 degrees with intervals of clouds and sunshine and a passing shower and winds at 6 mph. New York City law prohibits Macy’s from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 23 mph or wind gusts are over 35 mph.</p>

<p>Broadway will be represented by cast members from “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Just in Time” and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lincoln-center-ragtime-4f44f7c418c7643e8a572d66652481f3">“Ragtime,”</a> while the Radio City Rockettes will be there and some serious athletes — three-time U.S. national champion figure skater Ilia Malinin and U.S Paralympian Jack Wallace. Alumni and students at LaGuardia High School in New York City — the school featured in the movie and TV series “Fame” — will help celebrate the 50th anniversary of “A Chorus Line.”</p>

On Telemundo, the hosts will be Andrea Meza, Aleyda Ortiz and Clovis Nienow.</p>
<p>What are the new balloons?</p>
<p>This year, four new featured character balloons will debut, including Buzz Lightyear, Pac-Man, Mario from Super Mario Brothers and a 32-foot-tall (9.8-meter) balloon onion carriage featuring eight characters from the world of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-8232980005">“Shrek.”</a> “KPop Demon Hunters” will also be represented in the sky with the characters Derpy Tiger and Sussie.</p>
<p>What about new floats?</p>
<p>Several new floats will debut this year, including the first Pop Mart float, with Labubu, Skullpanda, Peach Riot, Dimoo, Molly, Duckoo and Mokoko.

      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — U.S. employment growth accelerated in September, but the labor market remained sluggish and failed to keep pace with new job-seekers as employers dealt with fallout from import tariffs and integrated artificial intelligence into some positions. The jobless rate rose to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, from 4.3% in August, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Thursday. The August payrolls data was revised to show employers shedding jobs for the second time this year, underscoring the labor market softness.</p>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>A federal judge on Thursday moved to halt President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., a temporary legal setback to Trump’s efforts to send the military to American cities over objections of local leaders. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to enforce the law in the nation’s capital without approval from its mayor. However, she paused her ruling until Dec. 11 to allow the administration to appeal. The legal fight is playing out alongside several others across the country as Trump presses against longstanding but rarely tested constraints on presidents using troops to enforce domestic law.</p>

      <p>NEW YORK — President Donald Trump on Thursday removed his 40% tariffs on Brazilian food products, including beef, coffee, cocoa and fruits that were imposed in July to punish Brazil over the prosecution of its former president, Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. The move follows a similar order by the administration last Friday to remove tariffs on several agricultural products as the White House makes a U-turn on some tariffs that have increased the cost of food in the United States.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape has told Parliament that no mining activity will proceed on Goodenough Island in Milne Bay without strict adherence to the law, proper landowner consultation, and full engagement with provincial and district authorities.</p>
<p>His remarks followed a strong warning from Opposition Leader and Kiriwina–Goodenough MP Douglas Tomuriesa, who raised concerns about secretive mining wardens’ visits, illegal foreign incursions, and reports of exceptionally rich gold deposits beneath the island.</p>

      <h1>Pasifika smoking rate is still twice the national average in NZ</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/smoking_image_copy.jpg?itok=0fgBdz7W"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/smoking_image_copy.jpg?itok=Dvu3jLNh" alt="Image of man smoking"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>Kaya Selby, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A health leader has labelled the latest Pasifika smoking rates &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, despite the New Zealand government celebrating them.</p>
<p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said in a press release that, over the last six years, the Pacific peoples smoking rate has halved.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the survey data shows a continuation of the great progress that's been made in the last few years — especially with falling numbers of Pacific peoples' smokers and very low rates of youth smoking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Auckland University professor Sir Collin Tukuitonga said Costello was being &quot;very generous&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's dropped, no question, but it's still twice the rate as the rest of New Zealand. In other words, it's unacceptable that we have significant inequities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To claim that it's halved in the last six years is, I think, a bit generous with the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>The data that the minister referred to — from the latest New Zealand Health Survey — showed that between the 2019- 20 and 2024- 25 fiscal years, the Pasifika daily smoking rate decreased from 18 to 10.3 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Further, &quot;heavy smokers&quot; as part of the daily smoker population among Pasifika increased in that time, from 4.6 to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>Costello's office clarified to RNZ Pacific that they meant the 2018/ 19 fiscal year, which showed a drop of slightly more than half from 21 percent.</p>
<p>Pasifika smoking rates did see slight decreases from the last fiscal year in current and daily smoking rates.</p>
<p>While it showed an improvement, Sir Collin said it falls within a broader trend, and still falls well above the general population.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a long term trend downwards as a result of successive governments, not just this government policy, but educational programs and efforts by Pacific providers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So it's been a long term decline. It's just that the rate of decline is very slow compared with the rest of New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Costello said the latest results showed &quot;great progress&quot; across the whole of Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has made some of the best progress in reducing smoking rates in the world — these latest survey results show adult daily smoking has halved in the last decade,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Conversely, daily vaping rates have increased more than threefold from 3.5 percent in 2019-20 to 11.7 percent in 2024-25 for the general population.</p>
<p>For Pasifika, daily vaping has increased by more than five times during that same period, from 3.9 to 20 percent.</p>
<p>Other key indicators for Pasifika health, such as mental health and obesity, have worsened over the last six years.</p>
<p>Rates of high or very high psychological distress have more than doubled from 9.7 to 23.8 percent, while 16.2 percent of Pasifika report unmet needs for mental health and addiction care.</p>
<p>Alongside a 5.6 percent decrease in physical activity, obesity has increased from 63.8 percent to 69.5 percent, while Pasifika living with high blood pressure and high cholesterol have increased slightly.</p>
<p>The rate of ischaemic heart disease (or coronary heart disease) among Pasifika has more than doubled to 5.7 percent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hazardous drinking has seen an improvement, declining from 25.1 to 17.5 percent, and weekly heavy episodic drinking halving from 14.7 to 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Fewer Pasifika are smoking cannabis (-3.1 to 12.7 percent), while more are using cocaine (+1 to 1.7 percent) and sedatives or sleeping pills (+1.3 to 1.8 percent).</p>

      <p>HEALTH EATING FOR DIABETES</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/healthy_eating.jpeg?itok=KDnVT_Um"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/healthy_eating.jpeg?itok=tFcsy2aT" alt="Reduce sugar intake and stay active"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><strong>DIABETES CRISIS</strong></p>
<p>Deputy Minister for Public Health Minister Rennier Gadabu says diabetes is a national crisis in the country.</p>
<p>The government paper reported Rennier Gadabu attended the World Diabetes Day earlier this month.</p>
<p>Gadabu said diabetes weakens Nauru's workforce and drains its health system.</p>
<p>He said Nauru has one of the highest diabetes rates in the world, with more than one in five adults living with the disease.</p>
<p>The minister urged citizens to choose healthier meals, reduce sugar intake and stay active.</p>
<p>He also called on the government to increase and dedicate funding for non-communicable diseases, saying it is an investment in Nauru's future.</p>
<p><strong>UNITED STATES VISAS</strong></p>
<p>The United States is strengthening health screenings for immigrant visas, including for conditions like obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>The US Embassy in Wellington said they are doing strict vetting to prevent immigration of those who cannot cover their own living expenses, including medical costs.</p>
<p>NPR reported a new directive to embassies, which expands the criteria by which a visa may be denied to include more health issues and age.</p>
<p>The embassy said each application will continue to be subject to individual review from consular officers.</p>
<p><strong>PACIFIC CLIMATE</strong></p>
<p>Climate Minister Simon Watts has called on other states to back a Pacific COP hosted by Australia next year.</p>
<p>It is still unknown who will host COP31 in 2026, with both Australia and Turkey wanting to host.</p>
<p>Watts said climate change in the Pacific is not a distant threat but a lived reality.</p>
<p>He said having the climate meeting in Australia will be an opportunity to deliver global climate solutions.</p>
<p><strong>WWII MEDALS</strong></p>
<p>Families of Cook Islanders who served in the Cook Islands Local Defense Force (CILDF) but never received their Second World War medals can now apply for them.</p>
<p>While more than half the CILDF personnel were issued medals in the early 1950s, others were deemed ineligible, largely due to being discharged from service before the end of the war for minor disciplinary infractions.</p>
<p>After reviewing past medal-issuing processes, the New Zealand Defence Force has confirmed that these veterans, or their next of kin, should be eligible.</p>
<p>Researchers identified 85 Cook Islanders who qualify for medals, including the War Medal 1939-1945, the New Zealand War Service medal, and for some cases, the Defence Medal.</p>
<p>Surviving CILDF members or their families can request an application form, and families must agree on who will claim each medal and provide the required documentation.</p>
<p><strong>VANUATU NEGOTIATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Vanuatu government is preparing for the first round of formal negotiations with France on sovereignty over Umaenupne and Umaeneg, otherwise known as Matthew and Hunter Islands.</p>
<p>Permanent maritime boundaries between Vanuatu and New Caledonia are also set to be raised.</p>
<p>Local media reported Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat has appointed the Deputy PM Johnny Koanapo Rasou as lead negotiator.</p>
<p>A delegation from France, led by Special Envoy Director Benoît Guidée arrived in Port Vila on Wednesday for two days of talks.</p>
<p>This first round of negotiations follows a working visit to Paris by Prime Minister Napat in July to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>The government has appointed DLA Piper to represent Vanuatu's legal interests as it pursues sovereignty over the islands and its permanent maritime boundaries.</p>
<p>As part of the visit, the Government will host a formal dinner to welcome the French delegation.</p>
<p><strong>TUVALU  TREATY</strong></p>
<p>Tuvalu has signed a new treaty with Taiwan, elevating their bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Local media reported the Kaitasi Treaty makes it more difficult for both parties to unilaterally exit the relationship.</p>
<p>On his first state visit to Taiwan, Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Teo said it's a significant historical moment.</p>
<p>He said it sets a relationship of cooperation between Tuvalu and Taiwan for the first time, with a legal platform giving rise to legal commitments instead of mere political commitments.</p>
<p>Tuvalu and Taiwan also signed two other agreements in an effort to enhance sport and fisheries.</p>
<p><strong>NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS MINING</strong></p>
<p>Discussions over potential seabed mining in the Northern Marianas are intensifying.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's governor is urging residents to weigh in as the United States advances early steps toward possible deep-ocean mineral exploration in the region.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has released a 'request for information and interest' on mineral leasing across the CNMI's Outer Continental Shelf - which is seen as the starting point for any future commercial activity.</p>
<p>Marianas governor David Apatang is calling on the community to respond, saying broad participation is critical as Washington considers how to handle the issue.</p>
<p><strong>SOLOMON ISLANDS ECOSYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>A new initiative in Solomon Islands aims to help businesses grow in ways that protect coral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overfishing, coastal development, and land-based pollution continue to threaten reefs.</p>
<p>The 'reef-positive finance' pilot is supported by multiple organisations including the World Wildlife Fund, the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the Global Fund for Coral Reefs.</p>
<p>Susan Gardner, from the Global Fund for Coral Reefs' executive board, said this project will help local businesses grow in ways that protect reefs and strengthen community resilience in the face of the climate crisis.</p>
<p>New Zealand High Commissioner to Solomon Islands Jonathan Curr said Solomon Islanders depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods, cultures and for resilience.</p>
<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS REGISTRY</strong></p>
<p>Maritime Cook Islands has reiterated that its ship registry complies with international sanctions.</p>
<p>The ship registry has come under increased scrutiny of late, after Cook Islands-flagged tanker Eagle S was seized by Finnish authorities about a year ago on suspicion of ripping up sub sea cables.</p>
<p>The ship was also thought to be part of Russia's shadow fleet used to avoid international oil sanctions.</p>
<p>A Maritime Cook Islands spokesperson said vessels under the nation's flag comply with all UN sanctions and are prohibited from trading in Russian, Iranian, or Venezuelan petroleum products.</p>

      <h1>Amata highlights NTIA’s approval of American Samoa’s proposal for BEAD broadband funds</h1>

<p>Source: Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata’s D.C. staff</p>
<p><em>Washington, D.C. —</em> Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata is highlighting the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announcement of the approval of the Final Proposals from 15 states and three territories, including American Samoa, to deliver universal broadband access through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. This is the next major step in the process toward upcoming disbursement of American Samoa’s federal BEAD funding, established at over <span class="math inline">\(37.5 million (\)</span>37,564,827.53).</p>
<p>Congress secured funding for the BEAD Program in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which Congresswoman Amata supported publicly throughout its consideration by Congress. She initially <a href="https://radewagen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/amata-highlights-375-million-broadband-funding-bipartisan">welcomed</a> the beginning of this BEAD funding effort in 2023.</p>
<p>“I strongly supported this infrastructure funding and the bipartisan law that created this program, and initially announced the beginning of this funding process in 2023,” said Congresswoman Amata. “It’s great to see another major step in place to invest in our islands’ broadband and infrastructure. Congratulations to our entire American Samoa Government team and thank you to the administration of Governor Pulaali’i and Lt. Governor Pulumataala for ensuring successful completion of the requirements expected by the Trump administration. These technology and infrastructure projects will boost our American Samoa economy and our young people’s education opportunities.”</p>
<p>The BEAD program is a $42.45 billion federal grant program that aims to connect every American to high-speed internet by funding partnerships to build infrastructure. In June 2023, NTIA announced allocation amounts for all 50 states, five territories and the District of Columbia. States and territories then developed their proposals to use their allocated funds for eligible purposes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning for the deployment of high-speed internet, including conducting research, collecting data, outreach, and training</li>
<li>Deploying or upgrading internet infrastructure in unserved or underserved areas, or improving service to community anchor institutions</li>
<li>Installing internet and Wi-Fi service in multi-unit residential buildings</li>
<li>Internet access, adoption and use programs</li>
<li>Workforce readiness programs to meet the needs of the infrastructure programs</li>
<li>Other activities that increase meaningful use of constructed infrastructure, at the discretion of the Assistant Secretary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Announced Tuesday, the States and Territories approved by NTIA include Louisiana, Wyoming, Iowa, American Samoa, Georgia, Arkansas, Delaware, Guam, Maine, New Hampshire, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Dakota, Hawaii, Montana, Rhode Island, and Virginia. And, one state, Louisiana, has signed its award amendment, allowing the state to access BEAD funds to begin delivering broadband to its constituents.</p>
<p>In June, NTIA issued the BEAD Restructuring Policy Notice (RPN), which removed extralegal regulatory burdens and implemented critical reforms to lower costs, speed up deployment, and ensure all technology solutions were considered. States and other Eligible Entities had until Sept. 4, 2025, to comply with the RPN and conduct an additional subgrantee selection round that delivered the Benefit of the Bargain for American taxpayers. NTIA then committed to reviewing these proposals and approving them within 90 days. Currently, 53 of the 56 states and territories have submitted Final Proposals.</p>
<p>“We are delivering the Benefit of the Bargain through the BEAD program that best serves the interests of the American people,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. “After stripping away burdensome rules and regulations and wasteful requirements, taxpayers will save billions in unnecessary costs while connecting those in need to high-speed broadband through the full spectrum of broadband technologies.”</p>
<p>“The Trump Administration is on track to deliver universal connectivity in the United States once and for all, with huge cost savings for the American people,” said Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator Arielle Roth. “The Final Proposals approved today show that the Benefit of the Bargain reforms are working and that our focus on results and strong oversight is paying dividends for communities across the country.”</p>
<p>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the Executive Branch agency that advises the President on telecommunications and information policy issues. NTIA’s programs and policymaking focus on expanding broadband internet access in America, maximizing the use of spectrum by all users, advancing public safety communications, and ensuring that the internet remains an engine for innovation and economic growth.</p>

      <h1>Little Tips, Big Purpose — Cosmetology student uses tips to support local youth athletes</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Abcde Tupa'i, a young woman from the villages of Pago Pago and Mapusaga Fou is making a meaningful difference far beyond her salon chair. Now living in the US, Tupa'i is both a cosmetology and an undergraduate student, saving every tip she earns from clients at her cosmetology school to support a group of student athletes.</p>
<p>According to Ms Tupa’i, these athletes, young boys from American Samoa, have been selected to play high school football in Santa Barbara, California, a life-changing move that, like Tupa'i's own journey, requires courage, sacrifice, and leaving behind everything familiar.</p>
<p>She told Samoa News, via email, that understanding these struggles firsthand, compelled her to support them in some way.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not easy to leave home, especially a place as comfortable as Samoa, for somewhere that demands so much of you. I know how it feels to step into the unknown to chase your dreams, and I know many of our people can relate to that too,&quot; she said</p>
<p>Inspired by the stories of these athletes and their families, Tupa'i wrote that she decided to set aside all her client tips to make a meaningful contribution. But she also acknowledged that this effort was never hers alone.</p>
<p>Support poured in from other families, friends, and especially from the boys' live-in guardian, Lele Malaki, whose daily dedication, guidance, and care have helped make the boys' transition smoother and their dreams possible.</p>
<p>The tips were used to create custom football training shirts, a small reminder that they are seen, supported, and celebrated.</p>
<p>&quot;It might not be a lot,&quot; Tupa'i says, &quot;but my motivation comes from the Samoan proverb: 'O le tele o sulu e maua ai figota, e mama se avega pe a ta amo fa'atasi,' meaning 'My strength does not come from me alone, but from many.&quot;</p>
<p>She added, &quot;We often wait to cheer for our people once they've made it. But we need to support them from the very beginning, all the way until they succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Tupa'i believes it is essential for leaders in our communities to invest in youth early on, not just after they've found success.</p>
<p>&quot;The dream was always to come to the U.S., learn all I can, and give back to American Samoa one day. But I've learned that I don't have to wait, I can start giving back now,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She encourages young Samoans to dream boldly and without limitation: &quot;You don't have to choose just one path. You can do many things at once if you work hard. And if you're intimidated by the thought that you're the only Samoan in your field, remember that you're not alone, you're the first. Be proud of that!&quot;</p>
<p>Tupa'i applauds the young athletes for daring to dream big and stepping out of their comfort zone in pursuit of their goals. She also deeply admires their families, whose prayers and love continue to nurture the boys' journey from afar and at home.</p>
<p>It's not easy to be apart from the people and places you love, but their collective sacrifice speaks volumes. She wants to give these boys the recognition they truly deserve, reminding them that they are not alone on this journey. There is a whole community behind them, proud of their courage, inspired by their determination, and cheering them on every step of the way.</p>
<p>In her quiet, determined way, Abcde Tupa'i is proving that small acts rooted in love, culture, and purpose can carry a big message: “Real change begins when we show up for each other, one tip at a time”.</p>

<p>Yesterday ASTCA personnel, in coordination with Shorelink Divers and Engineers, guided the Manu’a BLAST cable out to sea. The cable is secured within yellow cable floats, providing controlled buoyancy and visibility during marine deployment. The successful execution of this phase marks a significant step toward restoring high‑capacity connectivity to the Manu’a Islands. [courtesy photo]</p>

      <h1>US shoppers find Thanksgiving relief on turkey, but feel the pinch on pricier side dishes</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Deep discounting by U.S. retailers on turkeys pushed the cost of the traditional Thanksgiving dinner lower for a third straight year, while costs for side dishes highlighted the country’s nagging debate over the cost of living. The overall decline put the price of the meal at $55.18, 5% down from 2024, the lowest since 2021, driven lower by a 16.3% decline that shoppers found in what retailers were charging for a 16-pound turkey, the American Farm Bureau Federation reported in its annual survey of holiday meal prices.</p>
