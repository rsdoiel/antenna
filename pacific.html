Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C. FDD describes
itself as “a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) research institute focusing on
national security and foreign policy.” FDD said it does not accept
donations from any foreign governments. Others say FDD is

<p>AS June comes to a close, so does Men’s Mental Health Awareness
Month. This month has reminded us of the unique challenges men face in
maintaining mental wellness and the need to address these issues openly.
However, even as this dedicated month wraps up, our awareness and
efforts should continue throughout the year. Breaking the stigma around
men’s mental health, promoting open discussions, and encouraging men to
seek help must remain ongoing priorities.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;During the most active portion of their life cycle, called the shield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes erupt frequently and mostly produce a rock type called basalt. Basaltic lava flows formed during the shield stage make up the majority of the rock of the Hawaiian Islands. Kilauea, one of the world&amp;#8217;s most active volcanoes, is a modern example of a volcano in the shield-building stage.&lt;/p&gt;
