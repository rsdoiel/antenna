Truth 57: If it Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It — KISS!!!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is the fact that WE (the CNMI) have done all
we can now do about China and it’s time to “pivot” away our focus to
things that NEED to be FIXED!  I do want to commend what I see as a real
partnership between MVA Managing Director Mr. Conception and the
Governor who are obviously working hard together to revive our Tourism
Industry. It is also obvious Mr. Conception knows the industry and knows
what he is talking about, but even with that said the Governor and MVA
need HELP to turn things around. There is all this talk about China when
WE KNOW the casino is dead and America’s relationship with China is
on-the-ropes and the last I heard, the CNMI is part of America. Instead
of working on things like the casino &amp; China that ain’t broke but
indeed “dead &amp; even DONE.” WE need to fix the things we can and
control it using the KISS Methodology with our Economy Ambrose M.
Bennett — for TRUE, so make sure you read my next Op ed on fixing the
broken CC &amp; Hotel.</p>

I suppose it depends on your motive and what you do with it.  Imagine a
mutiny on board a ship, the criminals sail away, then several of the
crew mutiny a second time and return the ship to its rightful owner.  In
the process nearly everyone ends up dead.  This is the bloody tale of

President!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is President Joe Biden had one bad night on
the debate stage that drew demands for him to step down and yet when
Trump was convicted the first &amp; second time there were no calls for
him to step down even when he is still facing 54 more felony charges.
Why is Trump being held to a much lower standard by those who support
him and even some media outlets? Media outlets have used the
sensationalism around Trump to be out-front on the news, but the TRUTH
is being lost to “Trump’s reality TV show tactics.” If Biden needs to
step down for a bad debate, then what should Trump do, given his
