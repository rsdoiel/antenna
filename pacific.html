<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System, or NVEWS, was first authorized by congress in 2019 to be established within the United States Geological Survey. NVEWS serves as a critical framework for how the USGS monitors volcanic activities across the nation so as to provide timely warnings and protect citizens from potential hazards associated with volcanic eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

While view restaurants often come with a steep price tag, I&amp;#8217;ve learned to find scenic places to eat where the food is delicious, affordable, and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
