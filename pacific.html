<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;You will not be surprised to learn that the San Francisco Giants have more games scoring five runs or fewer than any team in baseball. You will not be surprised to learn that they have fewer games scoring six runs or more than any team in baseball. Even when the Giants have an outstanding all-around game, like they did in Tuesday&amp;#8217;s 5-0 win against the Colorado Rockies, it&amp;#8217;s hard to ignore that the bulk of those runs wouldn&amp;#8217;t have scored without back-to-back swinging bunts. Hitting the ball three feet in front of the plate at a minus-45-degree angle isn&amp;#8217;t a typical path to success. &lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia and once a nearly desolate ghost town, is one of Europe&amp;#8217;s great urban success stories. Its compact old town bursts with colorfully restored facades, lively outdoor caf&amp;#0233;s, and swanky boutiques. Its ramshackle industrial quarter, just east of the center, is rapidly being redeveloped into a forest of skyscrapers. The hilltop castle gleams. And even the glum communist-era suburb of Petr&amp;#0382;alka, right across the Danube, has undergone a Technicolor makeover. It&amp;#8217;s arguably the fastest-changing city in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
