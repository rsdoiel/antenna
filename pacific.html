<p>date: 2024-10-23, updated: 2024-10-24, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE Truth of the matter is malfeasant behavior still prevails in our
government when WE were PROMISED by the Governor “TRUST” — for TRUE! Why
this behavior continues is mind-boggling, as it seems to be acceptable
in the absence of any protest. The Governor just declared MORE austerity
after two years in office, as it is clear NOTHING has been done to
create NEW revenue sources after two years other than the continuous
dependency upon the Feds to save us. WHY do our politicians play “safe
politics” their entire term and save Bills for election season is the
only planning I see on the Hill — WHY!  WHY our politicians flat out
REFUSE to even consider the plethora of ideas and recommendation I’ve
offered, as it can only be fear of GOP reprisal, bigotry towards
outsiders, and/or just don’t care as long as they are sitting, as locals
say!</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-21, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE recent malfeasant behavior and attacks by Joe Palacios are not a
cure for our Cannabis Industry and have nothing to do with our economy,
just invoking that WE the People should be satisfied with losing money
every year on a Cannabis Commission that WE don’t need. First you assert
the “race card” when I have only referred to myself as an “outsider”
when you are an outsider too Joe having come to the CNMI from Guam, duh.
Next you assert that your IQ is magically 144, which I believe is a
bold-face LIE and I dare you prove me wrong, as my 139 IQ was certified
by the State of Tenn &amp; 2 different Phycologists. You didn’t even
know anything about our Cannabis Industry when you arrived from Guam, as
you only asserted “problems with the wording in the Law” that you
read-up on before being first appointed. Joe, you haven’t done anything
that would even hint to you being a genius and the dysfunctional state
of the Cannabis Commission is PROOF you are NOT a genius, given this is
you second term and NOTHING has changed. Joe, you are only preying on
“nepotism,” and it seems to be working. I just pray the Governor is not
going to run again if he is going to let people like YOU &amp; Clyde
manipulate him against HIS People.</p>
