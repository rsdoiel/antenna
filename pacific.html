<p>“NO good deed goes unpunished.” This idiom conveys the idea even when
we do something with the best of intentions, it doesn’t always guarantee
that the outcome will be positive. Despite initial efforts to do good
the recipients of the good intentions may find themselves facing
unanticipated challenges, resentment or ingratitude. This is certainly
true of the disaster grants awarded to the CNMI by the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Economic Development Administration, Seattle Regional
Office.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The phrase, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t waste a crisis,&amp;#8221; has almost become a cliche, and we use it in reference to many things, especially economic crises. Indeed, when we experience a crisis, we should always learn what we can from it in the hopes of not experiencing it again. Experiencing a medical crisis often leads us to pay greater attention to our health. An economic crisis may lead us to make better decisions about spending and saving.&lt;/p&gt;
