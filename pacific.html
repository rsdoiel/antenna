				<p>The parents of a teen who died by suicide after ChatGPT coached him on methods of self harm sued OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman on Tuesday, saying the company knowingly put profit above safety when it launched the GPT-4o version of its artificial intelligence chatbot last year. Adam Raine, 16, died on April 11 after discussing suicide with ChatGPT for months, according to the lawsuit that Raine&#8217;s parents filed in San Francisco state court.</p>

      (BPT) - Ever wonder what kind of food Superman grew up on? Wonder no more. Continuing a Kent Family tradition, Martha has put together an heirloom cookbook full of Clark's favorite dishes, with help from his friends and colleagues. Together, they've recreated the beef bourguignon and ketchup from Lois and Clark's first date, Cyborg's lucky game day potato skins and J'onn's Chocos. Martha even recreated Plurb, which she hears is wonderfully awful. She wasn't quite ready to taste that one herself.

      <p>
      A draft plan to award a grant to a competing company to create high-speed internet access across the CNMI has drawn criticism from Docomo Pacific, which claims it not only violates revisions to the program’s criteria but also costs a “staggering” $29 million over its own plan.
