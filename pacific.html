ǀ The United States is our evil stepmother; we can’t be Cinderella
anymore</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, updated: 2024-04-29, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE classic tale of Cinderella is a familiar story to many
individuals: Cinderella wants to go to the ball, but her evil stepmother
forbids it; she magically turns into a princess, and in the end, she
gets the prince. It’s cute, really. I just wished it didn’t ironically
mirror the situation in the CNMI. And no, we have not obtained the
prince. We were never meant to, and if we continue to be oblivious to
this reality, the greater our islands’ socioeconomic status will suffer,
and youth will be left unaware. Escape the fairytale, reject the
fable.</p>

<p>A WORK colleague recently struck up a conversation with a stranger at
a Texas airport.  Come to find out, the man had visited Saipan about 20
years when serving in the military. What did he remember most, my friend
had asked.  The food, he said.  Specifically, the island barbecue, and
even more specifically, the sauce.</p>
