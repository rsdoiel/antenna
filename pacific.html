      <p>
      (BPT) - In this era of instant communication and hyperconnected social media, you might think everyone feels connected to everyone else. Unfortunately, that's not the case. According to a new global study from LG on social connection, 68% of people find it harder to make real friends, and 1/3 reported having one or fewer meaningful connections in the past month — with 8% experiencing none at all. In the survey, 9 in 10 respondents also believe meaningful connections lead to a more optimistic outlook on life.

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; When President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki in 2018, the pair alarmed allies with a friendly encounter where Trump sided with the Russian leader over his own intelligence agencies on election interference. Trump flies to a meeting in Alaska with Putin today in a different public mood - impatient with the Russian&#8217;s unwillingness to negotiate an end to his war in Ukraine and angry over missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. The world is waiting to see if it will be this tougher version of Trump who shows up in Anchorage or if it will be the former real estate tycoon who has sought to ingratiate himself with the wily former KGB agent in the past.</p>

      ALTHOUGH the Japanese government had tendered their offer to surrender on Aug. 10, according to the Potsdam Declaration, the terms were not satisfactory to the American leadership.  The Japanese offer had accepted Unconditional Surrender, but “with the understanding that said declaration does not comprise any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler.”  This appeared, at first, to contradict the concept of Unconditional Surrender.
