<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;Year of the Woman&amp;#8221; label is too often thrown around when women break a barrier that should often be the norm. In 1992, it was used when five women were elected to the U.S. Senate. It was used in 2016 when Democrat Hillary Clinton became the first woman to lead a ticket for a major political party. We heard it again in 2018 during the so-called &amp;#8220;pink wave,&amp;#8221; when more than 100 women were elected to the U.S. House. There will likely be temptations to dub 2024 the Year of the Woman, especially if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
