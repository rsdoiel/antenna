<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Belgium&amp;#8217;s capital, Brussels, is undeniably a great place to get a feel for modern-day Europe. But as the capital of the EU it&amp;#8217;s an international hub that doesn&amp;#8217;t give you a sense of Belgium per se. My favorite place to feel the pulse of modern Belgium is Antwerp, the port city north of Brussels. It&amp;#8217;s an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place with a true sense of local identity.&lt;/p&gt;
