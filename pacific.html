      <h1>US Senate unanimously approves military helicopter safety legislation</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to toughen military helicopter safety rules and rescind a provision in the annual defense bill that critics said would have weakened aviation safety. Republican Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz on Wednesday won unanimous consent to approve a revised version of legislation that would require aircraft operators by the end of 2031 to equip their fleets with an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system, also known as ADS-B. The bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, also boosts oversight of commercial jet and helicopter traffic and flight routes near commercial airports. Aviation safety in the Washington area has come under scrutiny after the January 29 collision near Reagan Washington National Airport of an American Airlines regional jet and Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people. Cruz said the bill will save lives and “be a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Jack Smith, the former U.S. Justice Department special counsel who brought two now-dropped criminal cases against President Donald Trump, defended his investigation before a House of Representatives panel on Wednesday, telling lawmakers that the basis for the prosecutions “rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.” Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the Justice Department and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s probe and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system. Smith and his team secured indictments in 2023, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents following his first term in office and plotting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Smith dropped both cases after Trump won the 2024 election, citing a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p>It has been an inspiring and rewarding journey over the past 50 days as we connected with you through our 50 Days of Integrity campaign.

As we wrap up this series, it’s worth pausing to reflect on a key question at the heart of our discussions: What exactly is “corrupt conduct,” and when does ICAC have the authority to act?</p>

<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em>(December 15, 2025) A combined total of 6.173 kilograms of methamphetamine, smuggled from American Samoa, was intercepted by Samoa Customs officials in two separate operations at the independent state’s international air and sea ports over the weekend.</p>
<p>In a joint press release issued by the Ministry of Customs and Revenue and the Samoa Police, it was revealed that the first incident involved a targeted operation in which Customs officials identified a suspect upon arrival on the final flight from American Samoa on Friday, December 12, 2025.</p>
<p>A body search was initiated under the legal provisions of the Customs Act, with police assistance required due to the suspect’s reluctance to cooperate. During the search, officers discovered a small bag concealed inside the suspect’s underwear containing five packages. All packages subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine, with a combined weight of 141 grams.</p>

<p>Authorities noted that the successful interception highlights the determination of criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa using any concealment method, including hiding substances in private areas.</p>
<p>The suspect, a 32‑year‑old male from Vaitele and Nu’u, has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of methamphetamine carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The second incident occurred on Saturday morning, December 13, 2025, when Customs officials intercepted 6.032 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken at Matautu Wharf. The shipment, which originated from American Samoa, had been flagged for inspection based on intelligence.</p>
<p>During the search, officers uncovered two vacuum‑packed packages of methamphetamine hidden within the frozen chicken. Authorities noted that this concealment method reflects the continued attempts by criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa disguised as ordinary goods.</p>
<p>A 59‑year‑old male from To’omatagi has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of Class A narcotics carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>These two cases represent the seventh methamphetamine interception at Samoa’s borders this year, following the historic seizure of 9.4 kilograms of methamphetamine in January.</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of Customs and the Commissioner of Police jointly expressed deep concern over the continued attempts to smuggle methamphetamine into Samoa. They emphasized the devastating impact of the drug on families, particularly young people, noting that addiction is escalating and can result in severe harm and even fatalities.</p>
<p>Both leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to protecting Samoa’s borders and safeguarding the well-being of its people.</p>
<p>“Customs and Police remain steadfast in our determination to identify and dismantle drug networks,” they declared in the joint press release. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all those responsible face justice, and to secure a safe, secure, and prosperous Samoa.”</p>
<p>They cautioned individuals involved in illicit drug activities to desist from bringing narcotics into the country, warning that anyone who persists will face severe penalties, including lengthy prison terms.</p>
<p>These operations underscore the importance of close interagency collaboration in combating transnational crime, as highlighted in the joint campaign “Say No to Illegal Drugs / Tete’e atu i Fuala’au Fa’asaina.”</p>
<p>Both leaders commended the professionalism and vigilance demonstrated by all officers involved, noting that the successful operations reflect the continued effectiveness of Samoa’s joint border security efforts.</p>
<p>Of the seven methamphetamine interceptions recorded by Samoan authorities in 2025, four were linked to shipments from American Samoa, while the others originated from the United States.</p>
<p>November 27, 2025: 10 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a can of milk powder (Coffee Mate) were discovered in a shipment from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
<p>November 28, 2025: 99 grams of methamphetamine were intercepted during a routine cargo inspection of goods from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
<p>The other two American Samoa cases — the 141 grams concealed in underwear and the 6.032 kilograms hidden in frozen chicken — are detailed earlier in this article.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that methamphetamine smuggling into Samoa from the Territory had been occurring for some time before the first official interception on November 27, 2025.</p>
<p>This speculation may have prompted then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo to remark to the media in July this year, that American Samoa was the most common route for methamphetamine entering the country. However, he did not provide specific details or evidence to substantiate his claims.</p>
<p>The remarks by Samoa’s former Police Commissioner did not sit well with Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, who argued that the government should investigate the matter thoroughly. He emphasized that such claims reflect poorly on American Samoa and must not go unchallenged.</p>
<p>The issue was also raised in the House of Representatives, prompting the Chairman of the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Avagafono Vaimaga Maiava, to write to Samoa’s then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo. In his letter, Rep. Avagafono stressed that “such claims are serious and, unless supported by concrete evidence, are highly damaging to the reputation of American Samoa, a United States territory that upholds strict drug enforcement policies and border control procedures.”</p>
<p>Rep. Avagafono, himself a former Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, noted in his August 11 letter that the Commissioner’s “comments unfortunately appear to be baseless and not grounded in verifiable facts.” He informed Samoa’s Police leadership that the Legislature had convened a hearing to investigate the claims, during which testimony was received from relevant government departments, including Customs, Public Safety, and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“It was clearly stated that American Samoa is neither a producer of methamphetamine nor a known point of origin for its export to Samoa or any other country,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Despite his criticism, Rep. Avagafono urged cooperation rather than division between the two Samoas in tackling the drug problem.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we believe this shared issue of transnational drug trafficking requires deeper cooperation, not division, between the two Samoas. We encourage the establishment of structured and regular consultations between our respective law enforcement and customs agencies. Collaboration, intelligence sharing, and joint task force efforts are far more effective than unilateral public statements.”</p>
<p>“The fight against drugs is a mutual responsibility that requires trust, open dialogue, and coordinated action. We hope this matter can serve as an opportunity to strengthen our working relationship, rather than weaken it,” Rep. Avagafono concluded.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will replace the fully electric F-150 Lightning with a new extended-range electric model that uses a gas-powered engine to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.</p>

      <p>The oil and gas industry must be legally bound to cut methane emissions. With climate tipping points approaching, time is running out</p>
<p>• Mia Mottley is the prime minister of Barbados</p>
<p>The timing is brutal. Just as the world celebrates the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary">10th anniversary</a> of the adoption of the Paris climate agreement this month, new evidence shows that the world is crashing through the main defence that was constructed against climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>The three-year temperature average is – for the first time – set to exceed the Paris guardrail of 1.5C above preindustrial levels. According to the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record">Copernicus Climate Change Service</a>, 2025 will join 2023 and 2024 as the three warmest since the Industrial Revolution, reflecting the accelerating pace of the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — (December 12, 2025) The American Samoa Department of Health (DOH) proudly celebrated the official re-opening of the Amouli Community Health Center after an extensive period of renovations and upgrades. The ceremony marked a significant milestone for healthcare access on the east side, honoring the clinic’s deep-rooted history dating back to the early 1920s.</p>
<p>Master of Ceremonies, Deputy Director of Health Talalelei Vesi Fautanu welcomed honored guests, including representatives from ASG departments, American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), LBJ Tropical Medical Center, Hollister General Services, and community partners. The opening prayer was delivered by Reverend Catechist Toni Tavite Lolesio of the Amouli Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr. delivered special remarks emphasizing the vital role the Amouli Clinic has served in the community for generations. In particular, he pointed out that the clinic stands as a physical promise to the people of the east side, guaranteeing that healthcare services remain accessible, dependable, and within reach of every family. He expressed sincere appreciation for the doctors, nurses and healthcare providers who travel daily to ensure consistent care for the community.</p>
<p>Project contractor Mr. William Hollister, CEO of Hollister General Services, spoke of his gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to a modernized facility for the east side. The upgrades include a new guard rail and triage room, expanded trauma and prenatal areas, a renovated dental clinic, and numerous interior enhancements. Exterior improvements included critical structural repairs and the addition of a generator shelter for emergency backup power.</p>
<p>DOH Director Dr. Saipale Fuimaono acknowledged the many individuals and agencies whose work made the renovation project possible. He confirmed that this project is one among several initiatives the DOH will complete to ensure equitable access to healthcare resources throughout American Samoa.</p>
<p>The ceremony featured a ribbon cutting led by House Representative Dr. Va’asā Uluiva Simanu, followed by a celebratory cake cutting with Miss American Samoa, Tofoipūpū Unutoa.</p>
<p>Appreciation and acknowledgement was given for all who contributed to the project and a clear indication of the Department of Health’s ongoing commitment to expanding resources and strengthening healthcare services for communities throughout American Samoa.</p>

<p>THE Papua New Guinea Defence Force continues to play a vital role in the country’s security and the Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara reminded the force to remain healthy and fit last Friday during the Chief of Defence Force end of year parade at Murray Barracks, Port Moresby.</p>
<p>“As I always emphasise, stay healthy and fit, eat well and get plenty of rest. Our line of work is demanding and I expect you all to maintain your health and fitness,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that every year the government tasks the PNGDF to support security efforts particularly in the highlands and staying fit and healthy is vital in the force.</p>

      <h1>’tis the Season! ASG Christmas Caroling officially opens</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> ASG’s annual public Christmas celebration kicked off on Wednesday this week at the pavilion in Fagatogo. Officially called “Christmas Caroling” — the program is a 3- day-evening event of choirs composed of employees from different government departments and agencies singing Christmas songs in Samoan and English.</p>
<p>In previous years, there were ‘international’ community choirs that were invited to perform as part of the celebration, however this year it’s government only.</p>
<p>The official lighting of the Territory’s Christmas Tree is still very much a part of the annual celebration — and this year, First Lady Dr. Lois Pula did the honors, on opening night, Wednesday, Dec. 10th.</p>
<p>Each night Caroling begins at 6 pm.</p>
<p>For Wednesday, Welcoming remarks from Lealaisalanoa Alofaga Salanoa, who is the Master of Ceremonies throughout the 3-night program, was followed by the opening hymn performed by the TAOA Choir. Both Invocation &amp; Benediction were offered by Fagatogo CCCAS Rev. Iasepi Ulu.</p>
<p>After the Christmas tree was officially lit by the First Lady, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula gave opening remarks.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s program included 5 choirs comprising 16 different government entities —  Samoan Affairs &amp; Feleti Barstow Public Library; Procurement, Property Management, Public Defender, ALJ &amp; Legal Affairs; DBAS, DMWR, Port Admin &amp; Visitor’s Bureau; DHS &amp; ASCC; and, DPS, Dept of Corrections &amp; Search &amp; Rescue.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful aspects of the annual celebration is the costumes worn by each choir — highlighting the Samoan culture’s love of color and style presented as a unique uniform — puletasi for the women and i’e faitaga &amp; aloha-type shirts for the men — with each choir/ group having their own — becoming a part of the living pulse of the community at that moment.</p>
<p>Of note, the nightly event is a ‘must-attend’ for government department and agency heads or their deputies, as outlined in a memorandum sent out from the Governor’s Office, December 5th. The public often chooses to enjoy the program from home, as usually KVZK-TV streams it live.</p>
<p>Thursday’s Caroling program had 7 choirs: Fono; LBJ &amp; Office of Protection &amp; Advocacy; Administrative Services &amp; DPW; ASTA, Election Office &amp; TEO; DOA, Parks &amp; Rec &amp; Retirement Office; and, Treasury &amp; the Shipyard.</p>
<p>Invocation and Benediction were offered by Father (Patele) Pio Afu of the Amanve Parish.</p>
<p>Friday, tonight is the last night of the ASG Christmas Caroling program and will feature 6 choirs: Office of the Governor &amp; All Line Agencies; DHSS &amp; ASEPA; Dept of Commerce, KVZK &amp; Planning &amp; Budget Office; DHR &amp; DYWA; DoH; and, DOE.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks will be given by a Fono representative (not yet announced).</p>
<p>Invocation and Benediction are to be offered by Rev. Tagiilima Lavilavi of the Methodist- Nuuuli.</p>
<p>Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, American Samoa — May you be Safe and Kind to one another during these festive holidays.</p>

      <p>BOSTON — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unlawfully terminated a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program designed to protect states and communities against natural disasters before they occur. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston sided with 20 mostly Democratic-led states in finding that the Republican president’s administration lacked authority to end the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program and use money Congress approved to support it for other purposes.</p>

<p>“For years, we have struggled to bring our coffee to quality markets in Lae. Most villages are in remote areas without proper roads, which limits how far our coffee can reach. Despite this, we continue to contribute to the national economy through coffee production,” he said.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> “Our elders are the pillars upon which our island stands,” Gov. Pulaali'i Tuiteleleapaga Nikolao Pula declared as he and Lt. Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr. and the American Samoa Government hosted the annual TAOA Christmas Celebration, on Tuesday, December 9, 2025 — a gathering dedicated to honoring the wisdom, prayers, and enduring leadership of American Samoa’s senior citizens.</p>
<p>“Their wisdom lights the path for future generations, and their prayers sustain the strength of our people.”</p>
<p>The celebration began with an invocation and spiritual guidance from Penaia Faali’i, whose words carried the weight of faith and tradition, reminding all present that the elders are the living vessels of prayer and strength who we all seek as a community.</p>
<p>Governor Pulaali’i, in his opening remarks, commended the elders for their devotion, recognizing them as the very leaders whom the government and people alike seek for guidance. “Our elders are the pillars upon which our island stands,” he declared. “Their wisdom lights the path for future generations, and their prayers sustain the strength of our people.”</p>
<p>Distinguished guests included President of the Senate Tuaolo Manaia Fruean and his wife, and Speaker of the House Savali Talavou Ale and his wife, who joined in honoring the elders.</p>
<p>Adding to the event were beautiful hymns performed by the Department of Human and Social Services. Cabinet members joined the Governor and Lt. Governor in serving the festive meal.</p>
<p>Closing remarks were delivered by the Lt. Governor who thanked the elders for their continued devotion to families, villages, and churches, reminding all that their presence is both a gift and a guiding light.</p>
<p>Special recognition was given to elders aged 90 to 101 years old, with a highlight on Mrs. Pouiva Reid, the oldest elder in American Samoa, celebrated for reaching a remarkable milestone.</p>
<p>Pouiva Tauoa Reid- 101 years old</p>
<p>Solialofi Vaili- 94 years old</p>
<p>Pisavale Tialavea Tauai- 92 years old</p>
<p>Pagofie Aloe- 90 years old</p>
<p>Teuaililo Bird- 90 years old</p>
<p>Senator Si’i Noaese- 90 years old</p>
<p>Shang Shung- 90 years old</p>
<p>As the event drew to a close, the Governor, Lt. Governor, and cabinet members presented each elder with a gift, a heartfelt gesture of gratitude that echoed the important value that honoring our elders is honoring the very foundation of our island.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa National Women’s Team has just completed the most successful international season in its history, triumphing in both matches of the recent FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 Oceania Round One Qualifiers in the Cook Islands and advancing for the first time beyond the opening stage.</p>
<p>From November 28 to December 01, 2025, the CIFA Academy in Rarotonga hosted Round One of the qualifiers, where the four lowest‑ranked Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) nations — American Samoa, Cook Islands, Tahiti, and Tonga — battled for the coveted spot in Round Two.</p>
<p>For a team that had never scored a single goal in five previous World Cup qualifying campaigns dating back to 1998, this new‑look American Samoa side — built largely around off‑island based talent — delivered a stunning breakthrough. In just two matches, they netted seven goals without conceding, rewriting their footballing story.</p>
<p>Their historic run began with a commanding 3–0 victory over Tonga, before sealing the title with a resounding 4–0 win against tournament hosts Cook Islands — the largest victory ever recorded by the American Samoa women’s team on the international stage.</p>
<p>In their first match against Tonga, American Samoa finally broke through history, recording their first-ever goals in a FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifier since debuting in 1998. Forward Cassidy Pamela Drago delivered both strikes, etching her name into the record books and igniting a new era for the team.</p>
<p>Drago, a California native of Samoan descent, plays her club soccer in Temecula, California. She is part of a new generation of American Samoa players, many based off-island, who are elevating the team’s competitive profile from low-ranked mediocrity to a revitalized squad that now carries itself with confidence and ambition, proving they are capable of far greater things on the international stage.</p>
<p>American Samoa’s third goal against Tonga came from Aaliyah Tu‘ua, a California‑born midfielder of Samoan descent, who surged forward from the middle of the park to strike decisively in stoppage time. Her late finish not only sealed the 3–0 victory but also etched her name into history, as it confirmed American Samoa’s first-ever win in a FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>With confidence and composure, American Samoa powered past the Cook Islands with a commanding 4–0 victory at the CIFA Academy in Rarotonga, securing progression to the second stage of OFC qualifying. Three of their four goals came in the opening half, setting the tone for a dominant performance in which they pressed the hosts relentlessly and controlled the contest from start to finish.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came from Morgan Patea, a California‑raised forward of Samoan descent. The 23‑year‑old from Anaheim represents American Samoa through her father, Robert Patea, who was born and raised in Vatia before moving to Los Angeles.  Patea had already caught attention at the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament Oceania Qualifier in Apia last year, where despite the team’s struggles she stood out with her pace, technical ability, and attacking flair. OFC media hailed her as a “football star in the making,” recognizing her capacity to shine even in a team that was outclassed.</p>
<p>Team captain Alma Mana’o doubled the advantage just 15 minutes later, unleashing a long‑range strike into the bottom‑left corner. The Woodinville, Washington‑born midfielder — who followed her sisters Ava and Ina in representing American Samoa — debuted in 2011 and has since become the team’s most capped player.</p>
<p>With her longevity and experience, Mana’o is regarded as the heartbeat of the squad, providing leadership, organization, and stability in midfield. Her goal symbolized not only her enduring influence but also the resilience of a team finally breaking through decades of struggle.</p>
<p>Alayna Fuamatu‑Ma‘afala struck just before halftime, adding American Samoa’s third goal in the dying minutes of the first half. The dynamic forward — celebrated for her sharp attacking instincts and clinical finishing — is an alumna of Sacramento State University, where she honed her skills competing in NCAA Division I women’s soccer.</p>
<p>The momentum carried into the second half, as Mattyn Summers delivered the fourth and final blow only four minutes after the restart. Summers capitalized brilliantly on a perfectly placed header from Cassidy Pamela Drago, timing her run to perfection and slotting home inside the penalty area.</p>
<p>American Samoa now advances to join Group A of FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 OFC Round Two Qualifying in February 2026, alongside New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa.</p>

<p>The PNG Investment Conference in Sydney, Australia ended yesterday. Is this yet another talkfest?</p>
<p>We are informed a huge PNG delegation, including government officials and ministers were in Sydney for the four-day conference. This should cost the PNG tax payers some money.</p>
<p>Last year, another huge delegation was also in Sydney, for a similar conference. In fact, every year, the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy organise these conferences and hosted between PNG and Australia.</p>

<p>As Papua New Guinea celebrates its 50th Independence Golden Jubilee, New Porgera Limited (NPL), operator of the Porgera Mine in Enga Province, is marking the milestone by investing in the next generation of leaders in the global mining sector.</p>
<p>One of those emerging leaders is Mining Engineer Naomi Gamoga, who earlier this year began a secondment at the Valedero Mine in Argentina through the Barrick Secondment Program. The initiative, driven by Barrick Corporation—operator of the Porgera Mine—aims to elevate Papua New Guinean professionals across its worldwide operations.</p>

      <h1>Divided Fed lowers rates, signals pause and one 2026 cut as growth rebounds</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday in another divided vote, but signaled it will likely pause further reductions in borrowing costs as the U.S. central bank looks for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that “remains somewhat elevated.” New projections issued after the Fed’s two-day meeting showed the median policymaker sees just one quarter-percentage-point cut in 2026, the same outlook as in September, with inflation expected to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%. “In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,” the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions — an outlook at odds with market expectations, which remained locked into two rate cuts next year even after the Fed issued its statement.</p>

      <h1>Am Samoa secures landmark victory, securing long-term future of the albacore fishery</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/22nd_regular_session_fisheries.png?itok=oFI0sBWW"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/22nd_regular_session_fisheries.png?itok=vryGzAh4" alt="participants at the 2nd Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission"></a></p>
<p><em>MANILA, Philippines —</em> (December 9, 2025) The 22nd Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC22) meeting concluded this past Friday with a unanimous decision securing the long-term future of the South Pacific albacore fishery, a major gain for the American Samoa longline fishery managed by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council.</p>
<p>By consensus, WCPFC members adopted a new management procedure (MP) that could reduce overall South Pacific albacore catch by about 10-12% from recent years to approximately 56,000 metric tons in commission waters. The decision is expected to ease oversupply and improve market conditions for small island fleets, including American Samoa, which saw some of the worst economic conditions on record in 2024.</p>
<p>It also meets a key requirement to maintain Marine Stewardship Council certification that allows the American Samoa longline fishery to sell albacore to the local StarKist cannery at a premium price.</p>
<p>“This management procedure has been nearly a decade in the making, and the U.S. Pacific territories took it over the top with their steadfast support,” said Kitty Simonds, Council executive director. “It is a critical step to stabilize the albacore fishery and the island economies and food security that depend on it.”</p>
<p>Council member Nathan Ilaoa, director of the American Samoa Department of Marine and Wildlife Resources, championed a more conservative approach during negotiations. “When operational costs are high and catch rates are low, the only fleets that can continue to operate are those receiving substantial subsidies,” Ilaoa said. “That creates a critical inequity for the American Samoa longline fleet and other small island domestic fleets.”</p>
<p>Representatives from Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands supported American Samoa and other Pacific Island delegations. “These positions are consistent with protecting island food security and economies,” said Council member Chelsa Muña, director of Guam’s Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Next year, WCPFC members will negotiate an implementing measure and catch allocations to fully operationalize the new albacore MP.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation, led by NOAA’s Drew Lawler, advanced priorities for Council-managed fisheries, including work toward a bigeye tuna management procedure that considers purse seine as well as longline impacts, and a commitment to adopt a conservation and management measure on electronic monitoring in 2026.</p>
<p>“Members of the U.S. and territorial delegations viewed his leadership as a vast improvement over previous years and said this year’s delegation presented a much stronger unified front,” Simonds said.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Tafuna JROTC staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Tafuna High School Army JROTC program made history by hosting American Samoa’s first-ever Aerial Drone Competition, bringing together cadet drone teams from Manu’a, Faga’itua, Samoana, Tafuna, and Leone High Schools. The inaugural event was held at the Mafutaga Tina CCCAS Hall in Kanana Fou under the Robotics Education &amp; Competition Foundation (RECF) Aerial Drone Competition program.</p>
<p>Ten teams, two from each high school, with five cadets per team, took on this season’s game, Time Warp. The game features four missions that challenge different aspects of drone STEM skills: Teamwork Mission (alliance match play), Piloting Skills Mission (individual piloting), Autonomous Flight Mission (coding and sensor-based flight), and Communications Mission (logbook and interview).</p>
<p><strong>TAFUNA’S TOA DRONES CROWNED ALL AROUND CHAMPION</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna High School’s Team 96799A – TOA DRONES – Army JROTC earned the tournament’s top honor as All Around Champion. This award recognizes a team that demonstrates excellence both in judged categories and on-field performance, including strong communications, professionalism, and sportsmanship. Toa Drones is made up of the following members:</p>
<p>Team Captain and Programmer- Loraine Steckert</p>
<p>Co-Captain and Teamwork Mission Pilot- Everett Painter</p>
<p>Co-Pilot for Teamwork Mission- Atonio Miller</p>
<p>Pilot for Piloting Skills Mission- Taylor Lemo</p>
<p>Visual Observer for Skills and Teamwork Mission- Schoemacher Puletasi</p>
<p>As All-Around Champion, Team 96799A has qualified for the All-Services Aerial Drone Championship in Fort Benning, Georgia, where they will compete against JROTC teams from across the United States and from all service branches, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. This will be the team’s second appearance at the All-Services Championship. At last year’s event in Batesville, Mississippi, 96799A brought home the Coding Award from a field of more than 100 JROTC teams.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER MISSION AWARDS AND SPECIAL RECOGNITION</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna’s two TOA Drone teams and Samoana’s cadets led the way in the mission-based and judged awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>       Teamwork Mission Champion – Alliance of</li>
</ul>
<p>96799A – TOA DRONES</p>
<p>96799B – TOA DRONES II</p>
<p>Both from Tafuna High School Army JROTC in Pago Pago. The Teamwork Mission Champion title is awarded to the two-team alliance that finishes first after the finals matches.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Skills Missions Champion –</li>
</ul>
<p>96799B – TOA DRONES II – Tafuna High School. This award goes to the team with the highest combined score in Piloting Skills and Autonomous Flight Missions, highlighting both a steady pilot and strong coding.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Communications Mission Champion –</li>
</ul>
<p>1946B – Samoana High School. This award honors a team whose logbook and team interview demonstrate clear, organized, and professional communication, along with positive conduct and sportsmanship.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Judges Award –</li>
</ul>
<p>96799B – TOA DRONES II – Army JROTC, Tafuna High School. The Judges Award is presented to a team that stands out for its perseverance, effort, and accomplishments throughout the season and at the event.</p>
<p>CLOSE BATTLES ON THE FIELD</p>
<p>All five high schools brought their “A game” to the Time Warp field, resulting in exciting alliance selections and close scores throughout the playoffs.</p>
<p>Teams advancing to the semi-finals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>      Tafuna High School: 96799A and 96799B, who chose each other as alliance partners.</li>
<li>       Leone High School: 2811A, who allied with Manu’a’s 63729Z – Matasaua Drones.</li>
<li>       Samoana High School: 1946A and 1946B, who formed a Samoana alliance.</li>
<li>       Faga’itua High School: 1684V, who partnered with Manu’a’s second team 63729C.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, two alliances reached the finals: Tafuna’s alliance of 96799A and 96799B, and the alliance between 2811A (Leone) and 63729Z (Manu’a). The championship match came down to just two points, with Tafuna taking the Tournament Championship 190–188, a finish that kept cadets, instructors, and spectators on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p><strong>MONTHS OF PREPARATION AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna High School JROTC spent months preparing to host this first island-wide Aerial Drone Competition. The staff coordinated with community volunteers who contributed an estimated 15 hours each, six hours of online training to serve as head referee and judge advisors, 7.5 hours during the competition itself, plus additional time in meetings, scrimmages, and a pre-event drone workshop.</p>
<p>Leading up to the tournament, Tafuna hosted a scrimmage and a Drone Workshop to help all participating teams across the island become more familiar with the Time Warp game, safety procedures, and tournament expectations. These efforts helped ensure that every team arrived ready to compete at a high level and that the event was both competitive and educational.</p>
<p><strong>SPONSORS AND VOLUNTEERS MAKE IT POSSIBLE</strong></p>
<p>The success of this inaugural competition depended on strong community partnerships and sponsorship.</p>
<ul>
<li>       ASTCA – Special thanks to CEO Folasaitu Thomas and her team for providing high-speed, robust internet connectivity for the event. Their support made it possible to run the RECF Tournament Manager system and transmit real-time results to the Robotics Education &amp; Competition Foundation throughout the day.</li>
<li>       McDonald’s and ASTCA – Both organizations helped present awards and have been long-time supporters of Tafuna JROTC’s off-island STEM and robotics competitions.</li>
<li>       OceaniaCDN – Provided tablets used by scorekeeper referees and the event tech coordinator, helping the tournament run smoothly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organizers also extend heartfelt thanks to the volunteers whose “heart of service” for the youth of American Samoa made the competition possible:</p>
<p>Dr. Reupena Lesa, Isalei Liaiga, Ladenia Lavata’i, Claire Baucus, Maricel Balbuena, Patricia Su’esu’e, Fiafia Sunia, Fa’amasino Galoia, Jody Osterbrink, Jordanna Maga, Agnes Tipi, and Judy Tuna.</p>
<p>These community members served as referees, scorekeepers, judges, and event tech coordinators, giving cadets a professional, well-run first experience in aerial drone competition.</p>
<p>To recognize this service, the Director of Army Instruction, COL John Tulifua, presented each volunteer with an American Samoa Multiple School Unit coin in appreciation for their time and support of this landmark event.</p>
<p><strong>SCHOOL AND JROTC LEADERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>The competition also highlighted the vision and support of educational leaders who continue to push STEM opportunities forward in the territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Principal Tutuila Togilau of Tafuna High School was recognized for her ongoing support of all JROTC initiatives, not only for THS cadets but also for providing a platform that serves every JROTC program in American Samoa.</li>
<li>       Tafuna’s JROTC instructor team, MAJ Siimoa Galoia, MSG Acania Puletasi, and SFC Lei Solaita, were thanked for pioneering and expanding STEM pathways, from VEX robotics to aerial drones, and for working tirelessly to secure competition opportunities off-island for cadets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This first Aerial Drone Competition marks an important step for American Samoa’s youth as they explore STEM, aviation, and technology careers through hands-on learning and friendly competition. With strong community support and dedicated cadet leaders, the future of drone STEM education in the territory is off to a powerful start.</p>

<p>Despite millions and billions of kina poured into the education department over the years, most schools particularly in rural areas across the country do not receive enough funding support and are still struggling with limited facilities and poor academic resources.</p>
<p>Bubia Primary School Principal James Timping has raised strong concerns that schools across Papua New Guinea are not receiving the money they need because most of the national budget funding is being eaten up by administrative costs before it reaches classrooms.</p>

<p>Independent Commission Against Corruption, Acting Commissioner, Thomas Eluh, has issued one of his strongest warnings yet, declaring that corruption has become a “well-oiled system” that is crippling Papua New Guinea’s development and future.</p>

He said corruption has evolved into a sophisticated network affecting every level of government, from Parliament to commodity boards and district authorities.</p>

<p>James Kneubuhl, ASCC Press Officer</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa Community College (ASCC) will hold its 83rd Commencement Ceremony on Friday, December 12th, beginning at 10 a.m. at the Kanana Fou Gymnasium. At press time, 121 ASCC students are slated to receive their degrees and certificates from the College, although the final number will subject to examination results. The presiding pastor for the ceremony will be Reverend Peter Schuster, Synod Leader of the Tutuila Methodist Church. The keynote speech will be given by Ammon Fepulea’i, an ASCC alumnus and former faculty member who currently serves as Executive Director for the American Samoa Council on Arts, Culture, &amp; Humanities.</p>
<p>As an educator, artist, and community leader Fepulea’i’s work has significantly shaped the artistic and academic landscape of American Samoa. Born to Ali‘itasi and Paulo Fepulea‘i, Ammon is a proud alumnus of Samoana High School, graduating with the Class of 2005. He continued his academic journey at ASCC, where he earned his Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts in 2007. With a growing passion for mathematics, he pursued further studies at the University of Wyoming, graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. His commitment to education later led him to the University of Hawai‘i, where he completed a Master of Education in Curriculum Studies in 2019.</p>
<p>Fepulea’i began his professional career as a mathematics teacher at Samoana High School, serving from 2010 to 2020. His dedication to student learning and academic excellence then brought him back to ASCC, where he served as a mathematics instructor from fall 2020 through fall 2024. During his time at the College, he also played a vital role as an advisor to the House of Flying Daggers Club, a dynamic student group known for producing creative and influential musical productions in American Samoa. Fepulea’i continues to support and collaborate with these students, fostering artistic expression and community engagement.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2025, Fepulea’i was appointed Executive Director for the American Samoa Council on Arts, Culture, &amp; Humanities, a position in which he continues to expand opportunities, resources, and visibility for artists throughout the islands. He also serves as the President of the Agency for Better Living Endeavors (ABLE) and as the lead for Moso‘oi, two organizations dedicated to community enrichment and creative advancement</p>
<p>Through his leadership, artistry, and unwavering dedication to service, Fepulea‘i remains a driving force in cultivating a thriving and vibrant artistic future for American Samoa. A multidisciplinary artist, Ammon has contributed countless artworks across the territory, using his talents to celebrate culture, uplift communities, and empower young creators. His advocacy for youth development and his commitment to learning from and collaborating with local artists have solidified his reputation as a champion for the arts.</p>
<p>“ASCC is proud to see our alumnus and colleague Ammon leading the effort to promote and facilitate artistic expression here in the Territory,” said ASCC Dean of Student Services Dr. Emilia Le’i. “We look forward to him sharing his story and his insights with our fall 2025 graduating class.” For more information on the Fall 2025 ASCC Commencement Ceremony, contact the Division of Student Services at 699-9155, extension 0004.</p>

<p>NCDC Alcohol Licensing Board and Moresby-Northeast MP John Kaupa says authorities will launch a major crackdown on the production, sale and consumption of homebrew across the city, warning that the illegal alcohol trade has continued to be one of the city’s biggest law-and-order challenge.</p>
<p>Mr Kaupa said homebrew is still illegal and poses significant risks to public safety, yet many communities continue to brew and sell it openly, particularly at hotspot areas like Hanuabada, Erima, 8-Mile and 9-Mile.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — White House border czar Tom Homan on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, saying the state is home to a large illegal Somali community despite local officials’ comments that the vast majority of Somalis in the U.S. are American citizens. Homan denied, however, that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had stepped up its deportation campaign in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in response to Trump’s comments last week about Somali immigrants, whom the president called “garbage” that should be removed from the country. Homan also said ICE agents are not targeting people based on their appearance.</p>

<p>The National Doctors Association (NDA) of Papua New Guinea has issued a strong public appeal to the government, calling on Prime Minister James Marape and Health Minister Elias Kapavore to urgently appoint a permanent Secretary for the Department of Health. The position has remained vacant for over a year, creating a significant leadership gap.</p>
<p>In a letter released from their Boroko office, the NDA noted that the Department of Health has operated without a confirmed leader for 13 to 14 months. The tenure of the current acting Secretary, Mr Ken Wai, whom the NDA describes as a &quot;seasoned Health Administrator&quot; who has &quot;performed very well&quot;, expired on November 11, 2025, leaving the department without a gazetted acting head for 27 days as of the letter’s issue.</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority (ICSA) has announced two major initiatives designed to modernize passport services and improve convenience for citizens following the recent passage of the Passport Bill 2025 by Parliament.</p>
<p>The first innovation, the Passport Status Online Tracker, allows applicants to check the progress of their passport applications from the comfort of their homes. By visiting the official website at <a href="http://www.ica.gov.pg">www.ica.gov.pg</a> or directly accessing status.ica.gov.pg, citizens can enter their application receipt number to view updates. Status information becomes available within 24 hours of lodging an application. Once the tracker indicates readiness, applicants may collect their passports at the Passport Office.</p>

<p>The National Court in Kokopo has imposed a four-year jail sentence—wholly suspended—on a 40-year-old woman who was convicted of sexually touching a 13-year-old boy at Tabuna Plantation in Bitapaka, East New Britain Province.</p>
<p>Mathilda Peter, from Sarakolok village in West New Britain, was convicted after trial on August 4 this year for sexual touching under Section 229B(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. She was initially charged with the more serious offence of sexual touching with aggravating circumstances but was instead found guilty of the lesser charge.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Justin Siliva</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Back home in American Samoa, Christmas is more than a holiday. It’s the heart of the year and a season that brings families, churches, and whole villages together. The music, the laughter, the faith, and the smell of food cooking from early morning all make the island come alive.</p>
<p>This will be my third Christmas away from home since starting college. School will be on break, but I have to stay in Hawaii for work. Even after doing it twice before, it still feels strange spending the holidays somewhere else. Each year I spend the holidays away, I find myself holding onto the memories of Christmas back home more tightly. I miss the joy, the noise, and that feeling you can only get when your own people surround you.</p>
<p>When I am home, December feels alive. Here, it feels quiet. Most days, I stay in my room or go to work if I am scheduled. Some Christmas mornings feel like any other day. There is no choir practice, no neighbors dropping by, and no kids playing outside. The feeling reminds me that I am very far away from home.</p>
<p>I am 100 percent sure that other students and islanders spend Christmas away from home, too. Some of us work during the holidays or stay where we are because traveling back home is too “expensive.” We try to keep our island spirit alive wherever we go, but it never feels the same. The quiet days remind us how much family, faith, and home really mean.</p>
<p>Being away has shown me what Christmas is really about. It’s not the lights, gifts, or even the break from school. It is the love, faith, and togetherness that make the season real. When those things are missing, the holiday feels empty, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>Growing up, Christmas was all about community. Every church came alive in the evenings as families gathered to rehearse dances and choir songs for the Christmas Day service. The sound of voices and instruments carried through the villages, blending with laughter, music, and the spirit of joy that filled every neighborhood.</p>
<p>Even government offices, local businesses, and churches join in. They rehearse songs and dances for the government’s annual Christmas Music Festival at a center in the town of Utulei, with a population of less than 500 people. People from all over the island gather to share music, faith, and laughter in the lead-up to Christmas Day. It’s one of the biggest celebrations of the season, showcasing the island’s strong sense of community.</p>
<p>American Samoa’s traditions are rooted in faith and community, and those values shape the way my people celebrate. The island’s customs, from music to family gatherings, reflect a culture centered on connection and respect. <a href="https://www.visitamericansamoa.org/our-culture">Visit American Samoa’s</a> page on our culture, shows how these traditions continue to guide daily life across the island.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.polynesia.com/christmas-traditions%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Umu,%20a%20traditional%20Samoan%20ground,other%20delicious%20local%20Samoan%20food.">Polynesian Cultural Center</a>, Christmas in American Samoa combines faith, food, and family into a single, extended celebration. For many Samoans, it’s a season built on giving, not getting, and a time when the island spirit truly shines.</p>
<p>Christmas morning back home starts early. Families prepare the “umu,” the traditional ground oven used to cook breadfruit, taro, bananas, chicken, and often an “umu pua’a”(Pig Roast). Some make “oka,” which is raw fish mixed with coconut milk, or “palusami,” a dish of coconut milk wrapped in taro leaves. Others cook fai’ai fe’e, octopus simmered in coconut milk, or barbecue in their yards while that island reggae music plays in the background.</p>
<p>The smell of smoke and food fills the air, spreading from house to house. No one cooks just for themselves. Families share with their neighbors and the whole village. The joy comes from good food, good company, and giving back. Even without snow, it still feels like Christmas. The island’s heat doesn’t stop anyone from decorating homes, churches, and palm trees with colorful lights.</p>
<p>Being away from that feels different. December in college feels quiet and distant compared to home. The lights and songs are still there, but the “spirit” behind them is missing. I miss the choirs, the rehearsals, and the laughter that always came with family and food. Calls and video chats help for a moment, but they’ll never match the feeling of being home with my family.</p>
<p>Spending Christmas alone has taught me a lot about what truly matters. It made me realize how much I took those moments for granted. Back home, I never gave much thought to the long evenings of dance practice or the hours spent helping in the kitchen. Now I see how much those traditions shaped me. They continue to guide me, whether I’m home or somewhere else.</p>

<p><em>Justin’s home during the Christmas season back in American Samoa. [photo: Justin Siliva]</em></p>
<p>Christmas away from American Samoa will always feel different. But it reminds me that the real meaning of the holiday is not about where you are. It’s about love, faith, and people who make you feel at home. Even when I am far away, I carry that island vibe with me, and that’s what keeps my Christmas alive.</p>

      <h1>Are Americans drinking less? New data says yes, but not by much</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Americans say they are drinking less alcohol than ever before. But new data shows the number of drinks U.S. adults have per week has in fact not changed by much for decades. The data from drinks market research firm IWSR, shared exclusively with Reuters, shows that the number of weekly drinks per U.S. adult has hovered between 10 and 12 since 1975. While it is currently at its lowest since 1995, this reflects a decline of around 1.1 servings per person per week from a recent peak of 11.5 drinks in 2021. Surveys indicating a historic shift away from drinking, steep declines in alcohol sales, and falling drinking rates among young people have all fed a debate in recent years about whether drinking might be in long-term decline, especially in the key U.S. market. Possible drivers include a trend towards healthier lifestyles.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>LONDON — Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018, in a “reckless” display of power that led to the death of an innocent woman, a UK public inquiry concluded on Thursday. Skripal was found along with his daughter Yulia slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March 2018 after Novichok was applied to the front door handle of his nearby home. About four months later, mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died from exposure to the poison after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which Russian spies had used to smuggle the military-grade nerve agent into the country, the inquiry said.</p>

<p>Former Kandep MP Don Polye has taken an extraordinary stance following his arrest, publicly welcoming the charges laid against him and declaring he is ready to defend himself as the case involving more than K1.7 million in public funds moves through the courts.</p>
<p>Polye, who was arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on 30 November 30, 2025, said he embraced the process because he was instrumental in establishing ICAC more than two decades ago.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A 'ta’alolo,' or a traditional Samoan ceremony where food, fine mats (ʻie toga), and other gifts are formally presented was performed by the Government of Samoa, as a gesture of high honor highlighting the significance of this milestone, during the dedication of the Maota Fono.</p>
<p>The ta‘alolo began from within Tedi’s Square, the procession advanced in stately fashion, passing the newly dedicated Fono building before continuing on to the Malaeoletalu malae and toward the Pavilion, where honored guests were enjoying their luncheon.</p>
<p>With the Royal Samoa Police Band setting the rhythm and filling the air with Samoan music, the daughter of Samoa’s Head of State led the ta‘alolo, resplendent in traditional taupou attire. She was followed by dancing sogaimiti — young men proudly bearing their tattoos—and other taupou who moved gracefully as the procession made its way onto the Malaeoletalu.</p>
<p>The young tattooed men and women, along with most of the participants in the ta‘alolo, were Samoa nationals employed at StarKist and others residing on-island, who came forward to support the Government of Samoa’s initiative. Their presence embodied both cultural pride and communal solidarity, reinforcing the deep ties that unite Samoans across the islands.</p>
<p>Bringing up the rear were young men proudly bearing massive ‘ie toga, treasured fine mats used only in events of this magnitude, which had been fastened to long poles and lifted high for all to see.</p>
<p>These massive ‘ie toga were presented to honor each of the traditional districts of American Samoa, while suas were bestowed upon local leaders and the servants of God who officiated. In addition, the Government of Samoa offered $10,000 in U.S. currency, along with carcasses of beef, coolers of fish, sausages, sacks of taro, and Samoan koko, a gesture rich in both material and cultural significance.</p>
<p>The Fono reciprocated by presenting more than 50 suas, which included monetary gifts to Rev. Saifoloi, Bishop Kolio, the visiting delegation from Samoa, as well as local leaders, former governors and lieutenant governors, leaders of various churches, and former Speakers and Senate Presidents.</p>
<p>A sum of $100,000 was presented in acknowledgment of the ta‘alolo performed by Samoa, accompanied by cases of chicken, corned beef, and wahoo.</p>
<p>Altogether, the <span class="math inline">\(100,000 and the additional suas announced that day amounted to an estimated \)</span>200,000, illustrating the depth of respect and reciprocity shared between the two Samoas.</p>

Trump has repeatedly complained that ending Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War Two has been one of the elusive foreign policy aims of his presidency. The U.S. president has at times scolded both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> In part two of this exclusive interview following the press conference held by Punialava‘a, one of Samoa’s most iconic family bands who were in the territory to bring awareness to Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month, Executive Director of the Samoan Language Commission of American Samoa, Elisapeta Tupo Alaimaleata reiterated the importance of the group’s contribution, emphasizing that their work not only sustains the language but also deepens cultural understanding across generations.</p>
<p>She explained that within the community, Alzheimer’s disease is currently referred to in several ways: some transliterate the English term as 'Alisaima'; others describe it as “ma‘i o le mafaufau” (the sickness of the mind); while still others use “fa‘ama‘i o le loto galo” (the disease of forgetfulness).</p>
<p>Alaimaleata observed that this matches terminology used in Tonga, where the condition is likewise transliterated as 'Alisaima.' In addition, Tongans use similar descriptive phrases such as 'pōpōaki ‘o e loto ngalongalo' or 'pōpōaki ‘o e loto fakangalo,' meaning 'sickness of forgetfulness' or 'sickness of the forgetting heart/mind.'</p>
<p>A passionate advocate for the preservation of Gagana Samoa, Alaimaleata commended Punialava‘a for coining the word “Mananoa” as a culturally resonant translation for Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>She announced her intention to raise the matter with her counterpart in Independent Samoa, with the goal of having the term formally recognized. She further explained that the Samoan Language Commission of Samoa has already allocated a seat for a representative from the American Samoa Commission at its monthly meetings, ensuring collaboration and unity in safeguarding the language.</p>
<p>At last week Monday’s press conference, local media representatives and community members became the first in the Territory to experience Punialava‘a’s newest composition for Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month.</p>
<p>The track, &quot;Manatua le Mananoa,&quot; resonated deeply as it played on the sound system, and the audience embraced the tune, humming along to the melody while listening intently to the powerful message woven into its lyrics.</p>
<p>The composer, Rev. Lale Peteru, spoke with the confidence of more than 50 years of experience in crafting songs that nearly every Samoan — both in Samoa and across the diaspora — can recognize and sing along to. He explained that the art of songwriting is much like the making of coconut oil: one gathers fragrant flowers to infuse the oil with sweetness, just as a composer gathers life experiences to enrich a song’s meaning.</p>
<p>“When writing the lyrics of Manatua le Mananoa, I reflected on life experiences that could illustrate the theme and make it resonate, just like gathering sweet-smelling flowers to make the oil fragrant,” Rev. Peteru shared.</p>
<p>He recalled a trip to Alaska during winter, where the biting cold and endless ice reminded him of the North Pole. “And then there was the magical Aurora — the Northern Lights — painting the sky with dazzling beauty and splendor. I used those majestic sights as metaphors to describe Alzheimer’s.”</p>
<p>He explained how the imagery shaped the song: “The first line mentions 'mananoa,' meaning forgetting or the state of memory void, and 'maofaofa,' which means astonishing or surprising. 'Leai ni auga ae ogaoga,' describes how there are no visible symptoms, yet it is a serious condition. 'Pei o le pole e to‘a ai le kiona,' likens it to the pole where snow settles, and 'ma aputia i le aurora,' portrays being covered in the radiant lights of the aurora — the Northern Lights.”</p>
<p>Samoan (original):</p>
<p>Le mananoa e maofaofa,</p>
<p>Leai ni auga ae ogaoga,</p>
<p>Pei o le pole e to‘a ai le kiona,</p>
<p>Ma aputia i le aurora.</p>
<p>English (translation):</p>
<p>The forgetting is astonishing,</p>
<p>Like the pole where snow settles,’</p>
<p>And is covered in the lights of aurora.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A session continued with podcaster Taupau Tauileave Toluono of Talatala le Ta‘ui asking Punialava'a how they saw music playing a role in raising awareness and bringing the community together around importance health issues like Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>One of the members, Nanai Vielanni Peteru explained that music is not only a medium for delivering information but also a powerful force for stirring emotions. He pointed to the song “Ta‘elega i Petesa” — written and recorded by Punialava‘a in 1981, at a time when awareness of disability in Samoa was beginning to grow. During that period, many families faced stigma, and people with disabilities were often marginalized.</p>
<p>The song was composed to challenge those attitudes and to encourage compassion, dignity, and inclusion. Drawing on the biblical story of the Pool of Bethesda, it used scripture as a metaphor for God’s mercy and healing power.</p>
<p>The lyrics were written from the perspective of a cripple who longed for a place like the Pool of Bethesda, where an angel would occasionally stir the waters and the first person to enter afterward would be healed. Through this imagery, Punialava‘a gave voice to the hopes of those living with disability, affirming their worth and reminding communities that true healing comes from faith and love.</p>
<p>The song quickly became popular, striking a deep chord with listeners and awakening feelings of empathy for the plight of people living with disabilities. For some, it was the first time they were introduced to the biblical story of the Pool of Bethesda — where the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed gathered in hope, waiting for the stirring of the waters and the promise of healing.</p>
<p>Nanai also reflected on the unifying effect of Punialava‘a’s music, noting how their songs often spark meaningful conversations between generations. He explained that many of their lyrics are written in formal Samoan, layered with deep cultural and historical significance.</p>
<p>“Some young Samoans born and raised overseas sing along to our songs without fully understanding the meaning of the words,” Nanai said. “So they turn to their parents for explanations. Often, those lyrics are rooted in important events, and as parents share the stories behind them, the conversations grow and expand.</p>
<p>“Some parents have even reached out to us, saying their children have asked about the meaning of certain lyrics. Yet, many of them admit they don’t fully understand either. So we take the time to share and explain the words and the message behind the songs. In this way, the music becomes a bridge — linking Punialava‘a to the parents, who then connect with their children and remind them of their heritage. Through this exchange, family bonds are strengthened and cultural identity is passed on.”</p>
<p>Punialava‘a founder Rev. Lale Peteru commented that he has been working on translating the lyrics of their songs into English to support younger generations. His goal is to ensure that Samoan youth, especially those raised overseas, cannot only sing along but also understand the meaning of the words they are articulating.</p>
<p>As an example, Rev. Peteru read aloud a verse from one of their songs in Samoan, followed by its English translation.</p>
<p>Samoan (original)</p>
<p>Pe ana avea a'u ma fetu o le lagi,</p>
<p>E nofo ita mamao atu ma matagi,</p>
<p>Ia manino la'u faalogo i pesega,</p>
<p>A i latou ua ola faafualeva.</p>
<p>English (translation)</p>
<p>If I had been a star in the sky,</p>
<p>I would stay far away from the storms,</p>
<p>So I may hear with clarity the singing,</p>
<p>Of those who live in eternity.</p>
<p>Responding to a question from V103 news anchor and translator Doug Avauli about his process of lyric composition and arrangement, Rev. Lale Peteru explained that each lyricist has their own unique approach.</p>
<p>The veteran composer shared that his method always begins with identifying the central theme of the project. From there, he gathers relevant experiences and information that can help illustrate and highlight that theme. Once the foundation is set, he carefully works on the wording and the arrangement of verses and the chorus to ensure the message is carried clearly throughout the song.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I begin with the first verse,” Rev. Peteru noted, “but when I start arranging the song, I realize that the information in that verse is actually the main thrust of the message. In those cases, I move it to the chorus, so that after each verse, the chorus reinforces and emphasizes the theme.”</p>
<p>He pointed to the chorus of the new song “Manatua le Mananoa,” recorded for this year’s Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Week, as an example. Originally written as the opening verse, it was later elevated to the chorus because it contained the song’s central message — ensuring that the theme of memory and forgetting would resonate powerfully throughout the piece.</p>
<p>Samoan (original)</p>
<p>Pe a aulia le tau o puaoa,</p>
<p>E galo nimo ma le mautinoa,</p>
<p>Pei o le masina pe a popo loloa,</p>
<p>Ia manatua le mananoa.</p>
<p>English (translation):</p>
<p>When the season of fog arrives,</p>
<p>Memories fade and certainty is lost,</p>
<p>Like the moon when long concealed,</p>
<p>Remember the forgetting — the mananoa.</p>
<p>“As I was writing those lines, the Samoan proverb ‘Eā oe nei, ae ā a‘u taeao’ — which translates to ‘It is you now, it will be me tomorrow’ — came to mind,” Rev. Lale shared.</p>
<p>“In that moment, I realized how easily I too could one day be afflicted by Alzheimer’s. This thought weighed heavily on me, but it also strengthened my resolve. My hope is that this song will raise awareness among our people and inspire them to respond with empathy, understanding, and love for those already living with the condition.”</p>

      <h1>Savaii youth engage with Samoa Support Systems on mental health solutions</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/samoa_support_systems.jpeg?itok=P_zuBAbd"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/samoa_support_systems.jpeg?itok=dCJ9Ka0a" alt="Samoa Support Group"></a></p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> (November 24, 2025) More than 60 youth participants from Savaii communities gathered at the Jet Over Hotel last week Friday for a ‘Talanoa session’ on mental health. SVSG Youth led the outreach program for young people in Samoa, and last week’s Savaii Talanoa session was the second event following the Upolu Talanoa in October.</p>
<p>Funded by UNESCO and SEVENTEEN, SVSG continues to empower youth to be aware of the social issues that surround them. Mental health issues especially affect young people when drug abuse is involved. These issues can lead to violence within families and communities, so young people must be empowered to advocate for safer communities through their roles.</p>
<p>The ‘Talanoa’ ensures that safe spaces are created for young people to share their insights about social issues, while at the same time being empowered to resolve these issues and design strategies for the problems they face. The ‘Talanoa’ not only provides relevant information about social issues but also allows participants to brainstorm how best to respond and address these challenges, helping to minimize mental health concerns.</p>
<p>The role of youth is very important in their families and village communities. Therefore, this ‘Talanoa’ not only brought young people together and created safe spaces for them to discuss their social challenges and reflect on effective strategies, but also allowed them to explore ways to help their families and communities. Participants are encouraged to advocate for a society free from violence resulting from mental health issues and to embrace their roles as future leaders, promoting peace, love, and safer communities.</p>
<p>SVSG President Siliniu Lina Chang extended her heartfelt fa’afetai to the village and church community leaders who accompanied their youth groups and participated in the ‘Talanoa’ session. This is a positive sign of strong community support for youth empowerment programmes, helping to build a brighter future for these future leaders and advocating for safer families and communities.</p>
<p>Participants expressed hope to see more opportunities and programs like these continue for the young people and youth of Savaii every year.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa Powerlifting Federation (ASPF) recently etched its name into history with its first official team entry at the prestigious Oceania Regional Powerlifting Championships.</p>
<p>Facing off against the region’s strongest contenders, the team competed with courage and determination, emerging not only with national records and personal bests but also with hard‑earned medals that signaled American Samoa’s arrival on the regional stage.</p>
<p>The 2025 Oceania Regional Powerlifting Championships took center stage in Christchurch, New Zealand, bringing together more than 100 elite lifters from 12 nations across the Pacific, each representing the strength and spirit of their homelands. Among them, American Samoa stood tall, proudly making its inaugural appearance on this prestigious regional stage and marking a new chapter in the territory’s sporting journey.</p>
<p>The competition unfolded at the Black Box Theater in Christchurch, where the atmosphere pulsed with intensity and pride. Amid the roar of the crowd and the clang of iron, Team American Samoa shook the venue with a performance that left fans, referees, and fellow lifters in awe of their grit, strength, and spirit.</p>
<p>The American Samoa delegation was led by ASPF President Ed Imo and Secretary General Jade Pedro, who offered a compelling explanation of the sport and its place on the international stage.</p>
<p>“Powerlifting is simple in concept but demanding in execution,” she noted. “Athletes compete in three lifts — the squat, the bench press, and the deadlift — each testing a different dimension of strength. Every attempt must meet strict technical standards and is judged by three referees. The combined total of the heaviest successful squat, bench, and deadlift determines the athlete’s final score.</p>
<p>“But beyond the numbers, powerlifting is a battle of courage, discipline, and composure. Seconds can decide victory or defeat. A single mis‑timed command can erase months of preparation. And yet, every powerlifter steps forward, unafraid, to lift what many believe impossible.”</p>
<p>And step up they did.</p>
<p>One by one, each lifter rose to the challenge, proving that they could hold their own on the international stage. Their performances were not only a testament to physical strength but also to the courage, discipline, and composure demanded by a competition of this magnitude.</p>
<p>One by one, each lifter stepped off the platform carrying an achievement — from personal bests to national records, and, to the delight of supporters, hard‑earned medals. The crowd roared for the underdogs of the competition, who had fought through David‑and‑Goliath battles against Oceania’s elite, proving that determination and pride could lift iron as heavy as any powerhouse.</p>
<p>The first lifter to take the platform was Frank Asi Tuisalega, competing in the 83kg class. A former professional bodybuilder who had only recently transitioned into powerlifting, the soft‑spoken rookie proved relentless under the bar. With the poise of a seasoned competitor, Tuisalega set the tone for Team American Samoa by establishing a new national record with a commanding 572.5kg total — highlighted by a 197.5kg squat, 135kg bench press, and 240kg deadlift. His breakthrough performance electrified the crowd and ignited the momentum that carried the team forward, showing that even in his debut, he could stand shoulder to shoulder with Oceania’s elite.</p>
<p>Next came Lesmarie Purcell Ioane, the lone female lifter on Team American Samoa, whose performance in the women’s 83+kg division became one of the most inspiring displays of the Championships. Though she appeared at first as a quiet, devoted supporter of her husband, John Ioane — himself competing in the 120+kg division — Lesmarie quickly shattered expectations. She stormed through a 162.5kg squat, followed by a commanding 110kg bench press that earned her silver, and capped her effort with a 215kg deadlift for bronze. Her combined 487.5kg total secured an overall bronze medal, elevating her into the ranks of Oceania’s premier female lifters and proving that strength, resilience, and determination can defy every stereotype.</p>
<p>In the junior 120+kg division, the young giant Emau Siaosi revealed the raw, uncut potential of an emerging force in Oceania powerlifting. Though he missed all of his bench press attempts after an early rack command, Siaosi refused to be deterred. He stormed back with personal bests in both the squat (295kg) and deadlift (287.5kg), lifting with grit and determination that drew admiration from the crowd. His resilience in the face of adversity highlighted his promise as a rising contender, marking him as one to watch in future international competitions.</p>
<p>Veteran lifter John Ioane delivered what many considered one of the most technically refined performances of the entire competition. Completing a flawless nine-for-nine series — a rarity in the sport — Ioane recorded personal bests across the board with a 285kg squat, 197.5kg bench press, 310kg deadlift with the impressive total of 792.5kg. His discipline, composure, and unwavering confidence made him one of the standout athletes of the entire competition.</p>
<p>The event’s dramatic finale unfolded in the men’s 120+kg division, where Justin Pedro squared off against New Zealand’s reigning national champion in a high‑stakes heavyweight showdown. Pedro seized gold in the squat with a towering 380kg lift, and came agonizingly close to breaking the 400kg barrier before a jury reversal. His attempt initially earned two white lights and a “good lift” call from the referees, but the jury overturned the decision, citing a “half‑inch downward movement</p>
<p>Undeterred, Pedro pressed on. He added silver in the bench press with 237.5kg, and had to settle for the deadlift bronze due to further jury controversies. Twice — at 330kg and 337.5kg — referees awarded him “good lifts,” only for the jury to overturn them again. Either lift would have secured him the overall title. Even so, his combined 937.5kg total (over 2,067 pounds) earned him silver in the division and cemented his place among Oceania’s strongest.</p>
<p>The cheers for Team American Samoa, which had grown louder as every member poured heart and strength into their categories, were at fever pitch by the time Justin Pedro stepped into his dramatic tug‑of‑war showdown with New Zealand’s reigning national champion.</p>
<p>The Black Box Theater shook with thunderous applause that nearly brought down the house. It was clear that the crowd had chosen its hero: every time Pedro approached the bar, the stands erupted, rallying behind the underdog from American Samoa with a roar that echoed long after the final lift. It became one of the most talked‑about battles of the entire competition.</p>
<p>But through triumphs and setbacks, he remained humble — never complaining, never arguing, never letting frustration speak for him. Instead, reflecting afterward, he offered a simple declaration of faith: “All the glory is to God and God alone.”</p>
<p>While history was being written on the platform that night, ASPF President Ed Imo and Ben Imo were also making history beyond it, completing the IPF Level 2 Coaching Certification — the highest coaching qualification in the International Powerlifting Federation. In doing so, they became the first-ever certified Level 2 instructors for American Samoa, paving the way for the future growth and development of the sport on island.</p>
<p>Following the team’s historic performance in Aotearoa, the Land of the Long White Cloud, ASPF Secretary General Jade Pedro announced that the federation’s focus now shifts to the upcoming American Samoa National Championships in 2026 and the 2026 Oceania Regional Powerlifting Championships in Fiji.</p>
<p>Pedro emphasized the excitement within the team, noting that the athletes recognize they have etched their names into American Samoa’s powerlifting history through unwavering commitment to training and preparation. But more than that, she added, they now carry something even greater — belief. Belief that they can stand shoulder to shoulder with giants, that no obstacle is too great and that with faith in themselves and full dedication to their preparations, they are capable of achieving the impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;What American Samoa accomplished in Christchurch was more than medals and numbers,&quot; she declared. &quot;It was a statement. A declaration that our athletes belong on the world stage. A reminder that strength is not just physical, it is spiritual, cultural, and deeply rooted in who we are as Samoan people. And a promise that we will return. Stronger. Smarter. Hungrier. Oceania has heard our name, and next year, in Fiji, they will see our fire burn even brighter.&quot;</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — The White House on Monday defended a U.S. admiral’s decision to conduct multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling vessel in September, saying he had Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s authorization, even as critics questioned the legality of a strike on survivors.</p>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Luigi Mangione told a prison guard he had a 3D-printed gun in his backpack after his arrest for allegedly gunning down a UnitedHealthcare executive, according to testimony at a court hearing to determine whether prosecutors can use these statements and other evidence at his murder trial. Mangione, 27, was arrested in December 2024 and charged with fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan. Mangione became a folk hero to some critics of steep U.S. healthcare costs. Public officials condemned the assassination.</p>

      <p>DANVILLE, Pa. — The residents came in camouflage hats and red shirts signaling unity, more than 300 of them packing into a rural Pennsylvania planning commission meeting to protest a proposed data center they feared would carve up their farmland and upend the quiet rhythms of their valley. Most were loyal supporters of President Donald Trump, who carried their home of Montour County by 20 percentage points in the 2024 election. But they bristled at Washington’s push to fast-track artificial intelligence infrastructure, which has driven data-center growth in rural areas around the U.S. where land is cheap.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> An extreme doodling art project in the middle of the USA will have a touch of American Samoa in it.</p>
<p>Harmony Faoa-Danielson, 12, seventh grade, moved to Oklahoma from her native American Samoa last November. The art project in Lawton, Oklahoma teacher Deborah McNally’s class was the right opportunity for Faoa-Danielson to make a visual reminder of her home.</p>
<p>The doodling project is really a study in color theory where students learn about precision of lines, shapes, color and texture, McNally said.</p>
<p>“It hits all the bases and it’s not intimidating. It gets them out of their comfort zone and using their imagination,” McNally said.</p>
<p>For the extreme doodling project, a roll of paper several feet long is spread out and each student is assigned two sections to work on. They initially use Sharpies to draw lines and shapes and then they add color to their section.</p>

<p><strong><em>A roll of paper several feet long is spread out for the project, and each student is assigned two sections to work on. They initially use Sharpies to draw lines and shapes and then they add color to their section. [photo supplied</em></strong>]</p>
<p>“They can incorporate things they know into the pattern. They can pull from their life and reinvent it into patterns,” McNally said. “Doodling is a great introduction to drawing.”</p>
<p>Which is how the project got a touch of American Samoa.</p>
<p>Faoa-Danielson said she was drawing some mountains that remind her of home.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about home. We have a lot of mountains. I live on an island. I’m trying to draw an image of the mountains,” she said. “It makes me miss home.”</p>
<p>Once Faoa-Danielson drew the mountains, she planned to color them blue and green.</p>
<p>“The blue is like the sky and the green is like the mountains,” she said.</p>
<p>Faoa-Danielson said she has always enjoyed art projects, but has never done extreme doodling. She said her favorite things to draw are people and shapes.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how you mess up. It matters how hard you work on it. You give it your best. The lines matter. The little things matter,” she said of the doodling project.</p>
<p>Lillie Spencer, 11, also was drawing something she could relate to: mushrooms. The sixth grader said she was drawing them because, “they are good and I like to eat them.” She also said she was drawing a lot of different designs.</p>
<p>“I’m just thinking of random things I want to draw,” she said, adding she likes to make bracelets and key chains.</p>
<p>When the project is done, McNally will cut out each section so students can take their section home, which will remind Faoa-Danielson of her native island.</p>

      <p>Nurses have been accused of failing to provide 'life preserving services' but the union says a plan for dedicated on-call staff to cover gaps during strike action was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Punialava‘a, one of Samoa’s most iconic family bands, has added a new chapter to its remarkable legacy.</p>
<p>Known for more than 50 years of Samoan music that blends gospel, love songs, and cultural pride, using eloquent oratorical lyrics rich in cultural and spiritual meaning. Now, they have made history by coining the Samoan word “Mananoa” as another translation for Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
<p>The band is currently in American Samoa by special invitation, performing as part of Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month. Their music is being used not only to entertain but also to educate, spreading awareness through song and storytelling.</p>
<p>The annual awareness campaign is coordinated by the Agency for Better Living Endeavors (ABLE), a local non‑profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for residents through cultural, educational, and community programs.</p>
<p>ABLE’s partnership with Punialava‘a highlights the power of music as a cultural bridge for awareness and understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease, a condition that continues to affect a growing number of families each year.</p>
<p>At a press conference held at the DDW Restaurant in Utulei last week Monday, local media and members of the public were formally introduced to the first four members of Punialava‘a to arrive on island. Leading the group was band founder and leader Rev. Lale Peteru, accompanied by his wife Vini Peteru, their eldest child Nanai Vielani Peteru, and their youngest, Melody Peteru.</p>
<p>Mrs. Peteru confirmed that the third eldest sibling, Punialava‘a Peteru, is expected to arrive later in the week, while the second eldest, Vanya Peteru, was unable to make the trip.</p>
<p>Expounding on the meaning of Alzheimer’s, Vini Peteru explained that when people hear the word, they immediately think of memory and mental capacity. She noted that in the past, those afflicted with the disease were often stigmatized and dismissed as suffering from a mental impairment.</p>
<p>“However, we see this as an inter‑generational matter, and we are obligated to spread awareness that Alzheimer’s is not simply about impairment — it is about our memories, or our Mana,” Vini said. “In Polynesian and Māori belief, Mana is an impersonal supernatural power that can be transmitted or inherited, and we all carry our own Mana.”</p>
<p>She went on to explain that in Samoan, Mana is synonymous with the words Mauli and Tamāli‘iaga. “When that fades from us, the challenge becomes: who carries on the Mana? Who carries on the Mana of those who have lost their memories or have forgotten their Mana?”</p>
<p>“It’s us!” she declared. “That is the awareness we want to promote this month. Alzheimer’s is inter‑generational because we all relate to the Mana of our forefathers, of those who have gone before us. We carry it forward.”</p>
<p>Vini further emphasized the importance of remembrance through the Samoan word manatua. “‘Mana’ refers to the supernatural power to remember, while ‘tua’ means back or past. So manatua is, in essence, the supernatural power to remember the past.”</p>
<p>She concluded: “We must manatua those who are mananoa — those whose supernatural power to remember has become noa, or void. The Samoan phrase 'Manatua le Mananoa' translates to ‘Remember those who have forgotten,’ or ‘Remember those whose supernatural power to remember is now void.’”</p>
<p>The audience, listening intently, applauded with appreciation — acknowledging the informative, empowering, and culturally resonant explanation of the origins of the newly coined term Mananoa.</p>
<p>The floor was then opened for questions. Talatala le Ta‘ui Podcaster and former Samoa News reporter Taupau Tauileave Toluono began the Q&amp;A session by requesting a Samoan‑language explanation of Mananoa, for the benefit of elderly viewers of his podcast.</p>
<p>Rev. Lale Peteru responded by first recognizing the invaluable work of the LMS missionaries who brought the Gospel to Samoa and, for the first time, produced a written version of the Samoan language.</p>
<p>“They constructed many new words that appear in the Samoan translation of the Bible,” Rev. Peteru explained. “These words were not originally Samoan but were carefully constructed by the missionaries. If future Bible translations omit them, there is a danger that these words will be lost.”</p>
<p>He emphasized that Samoans today have acquired the linguistic and contextual knowledge necessary to master the art of word construction, enabling them to create terms that can name and describe anything.</p>
<p>However, he cautioned that the situation has changed in modern times, with many people relying on transliteration — directly adapting foreign words based on sound. He stated that this practice has cheapened the Samoan language.</p>
<p>He cited examples: the English word 'cousin' often transliterated as 'kaseni,' though Samoan already has words such as 'tausoga' or 'tei;' and the word 'camera' translated as 'kamela,' when traditional Samoan terms like 'mea pu‘eata' or 'masini pu‘eata' exist.</p>
<p>“When we set out to construct a Samoan word for Alzheimer’s, we knew the building blocks had to share a contextual connection with the disease,” Rev. Peteru said. “As Vini explained, the cognitive power of the mind to remember and store information is called the Mana of a person in Polynesia. When that power to remember is diminished by Alzheimer’s, it becomes Noa — void. Hence, the new word: Mananoa.”</p>
<p>Executive Director of the Samoan Language Commission of American Samoa, Elisapeta Tupo Alaimaleata, opened her remarks by expressing heartfelt gratitude for the vital role that Punialava‘a continues to play in preserving and advancing the Samoan language.</p>
<p>She asked the Punialava'a members how they had chosen the words used to construct the new term Mananoa, noting that there were many possible options. Specifically, Alaimaleata inquired about the process behind selecting the two words Mana and Noa.</p>
<p>Responding to the question, Mrs. Vini Peteru first reflected on the word Mana, explaining that when it is spoken, it often refers to God’s Mana — His almighty power.</p>
<p>“Then Lale and I focused on the word 'Tamāli‘iaga' — the dignity and honor of a human being worthy of respect, created by God Almighty,” she shared. “Our thought process followed this path because of the way people afflicted with Alzheimer’s are often unjustly perceived. Too often they are ridiculed, stigmatized, and falsely labeled as ‘crazy’ by those who do not understand the disease.”</p>
<p>She emphasized that this was why they agreed to use Mana as the root word: “It reflects the power of the human mind to process, store, and remember information. And we affirm that this power itself was created by a higher power — God, the Creator of the Universe.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Peteru went on to connect this to the word manatua, which calls on us to remember those who have lost the ability to remember, reminding us that they too were created by God. “Manatua le Mananoa,” she concluded — Remember those who have forgotten.</p>
<p>The legendary Punialava‘a Family Band took to the stage last week  at the &quot;Manatua le Mananoa Aiga Concert&quot; at the Veterans Memorial Stadium, Tafuna.</p>
<p>This special event was coordinated by ABLE and was free of charge and open to the entire community.</p>
<p>Joining Punialava‘a were other outstanding Samoan musical acts:</p>
<p>• Ozki – the rising Samoan duo of brothers Gaberiel and AJ Paese Si‘a, whose fresh sound bridges traditional Samoan roots with modern pop.</p>
<p>• Marina Davis – the internationally renowned Samoan Diva, often hailed as the “Voice of the Pacific,” celebrated for her powerhouse soprano and her role in shaping modern Polynesian music. The concert begins at 6pm sharp. Come early, bring your family, and be part of this unforgettable evening of music, culture, and community pride.</p>
<p>Samoa News will report this on an exclusive interview following the press conference with Executive Director of the Samoan Language Commission of American Samoa Alaimaleata reiterating the importance of Punialava’a’s contribution to the Samoan language as well as deepening cultural understanding across generations.</p>

      <p>From the passenger seat of a sky blue Prius, Amy Oba craned her neck to get a look at the federal detention center, a hulking tower surrounded by a black chain-link fence and laced with barbed wire. On a recent evening, she was on patrol, part of a group of Japanese Americans who are keeping a watchful eye on the actions of immigration agents in Los Angeles.</p>

      <h1>Tropical storm deaths top 600 in Southeast Asia, over 4 million affected</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>JAKARTA/BANGKOK — The death toll mounted to over 600 from floods and landslides caused by torrential rains across three countries in Southeast Asia, officials said on Sunday, as relief efforts for tens of thousands of displaced people continued over the weekend. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand faced large-scale devastation after a rare tropical storm formed in the Malacca Strait fuelling heavy rains and wind gusts for a week. There were 435 dead in Indonesia, 170 in Thailand, and three deaths reported in Malaysia. Rescue and relief officials in the Southeast Asian countries were still trying to get access to many flood-hit areas on Sunday even as flood waters receded and tens of thousands of people were evacuated across the three countries. Over 4 million people have been affected — nearly 3 million in southern Thailand and 1.1 million in western Indonesia, according to official statistics. Separately, across the Bay of Bengal, another 153 people were killed by a cyclone in the island nation of Sri Lanka, authorities said, with 191 others missing and more than half a million affected nationwide.</p>

<p>Addressing Parliament yesterday, PM Marape said the Marape-Rosso Government is committed to ensuring a “strongly defined” agreement, using the New Porgera deal — which guarantees 55 percent total benefits to PNG — as the benchmark for all future resource negotiations.</p>
