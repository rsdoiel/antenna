Truth 26: A disconnected people — our $$$ &amp; tourism</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, updated: 2023-11-30, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is the people of the CNMI are extremely
disconnected from the actual activities and ownership in our government,
as things are just being left-up to the powers that be without any form
of input or protest BY the People. There was a time when Public Hearings
really meant something in the CNMI but ever-since the Casino was forced
down our throats without any form of Public Accountability, it has now
become a common practice to avoid all public Hearings that has created
an extremely dangerous and detrimental practice for creating legislation
in which the People PAY-the-COST. The people really no longer have a
real say in the important issues that WE the People are facing that
adversely affect our quality of life. The legislature is trying to raise
money that adversely affects the People without giving the People any
say, other than the public comment section that virtually no-one knows
about in time before the Bill is passed into law.</p>
