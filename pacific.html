Springfield, Ohio, threats leave Haitian residents shaken</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;SPRINGFIELD, Ohio &amp;#8212; After a week that saw schools, businesses and City Hall closed in Springfield, Ohio, by bomb threats, this weekend began with two of the city&amp;#8217;s hospitals going on lockdown. A sweep of both facilities Saturday morning turned up nothing, but the new threats only added to the unease hanging over the city since former President Donald Trump dragged it into the race for the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

And the Appian Way, begun in 312 BC, was the engineering wonder of its day. It connected Rome with Capua (near Naples), ignoring natural contours and running in a straight line for much of the way. Eventually it stretched 430 miles to Brindisi &amp;#8212; gateway to the East &amp;#8212; where Roman ships sailed for Greece and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

ǀ To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN
system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, updated: 2024-09-12, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>TAIWAN is an indispensable partner in global supply chains, producing
more than 90 % of the world’s high-end semiconductors and a significant
portion of the advanced chips that are driving the AI revolution.
Moreover, half of the world’s seaborne trade passes through the Taiwan
Strait, making it a key international waterway. Yet even though large
parts of the world — and billions of people — have enjoyed great
prosperity thanks to the peace and stability that prevails across the
strait, the People’s Republic of China continues to intensify its
aggressive actions against Taiwan. Beijing’s attempts to change the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait and expand authoritarianism
throughout the Indo-Pacific region are a profound threat to peace and
security all around the world.</p>

Fast forward a century, and webcams are scattered across the island, snapping images of the volcanoes 24/7 in 4K resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
