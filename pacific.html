<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Ilove the knack Croatians have for taking a humble stretch of craggy shoreline and turning it into a wildly romantic bar or caf&amp;#0233;. In the coastal town of Rovinj, several bars and restaurants offer tables atop the town&amp;#8217;s rocky seawall, and some provide you with a pillow &amp;#8212; an invitation to find your own nook in the rocks overlooking the bay. As the sunset fades and the flames from tealight candles seem to brighten, you realize just how easy it is to enjoy a luxurious moment on the Adriatic coast.&lt;/p&gt;
