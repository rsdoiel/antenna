<p>Speaking at Government House after the swearing-in of Kompiam-Ambum MP Sir John Pundari, Tewai-Siassi MP Dr Kobby Bomareo and Menyamya MP Solen Loifa as Ministers of State, Prime Minister Marape said the appointments were both a recognition of political balance in the coalition and a strategic move to strengthen government delivery in 2026.</p>

The heavens will have to come down fix this bad road. To make matters worse there is one State Minister and another two MPs that live in the same area, that includes the current Opposition leader. As we said, there needs to be divine intervention here, as even the car dodging the potholes are clearly captured from space all over the place. We thought it was a three-lane road!</p>

      <p>
      <p>U.S. banks and financial institutions on Monday pushed back against President Donald Trump’s proposed cap on credit card interest rates, citing new data that showed it would result in millions of American households and small businesses losing access to credit. Trump, who is ‍under pressure to address voter concerns over the cost of living, on Friday called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10% starting on January 20. He did not provide details on how such a ban would be imposed, and some industry experts said it would require congressional action.</p>

<p>In a major boost for healthcare in Central Bougainville, Lloyds Metals and Energy Ltd (LMEL) has donated a critical consignment of medical supplies to Arawa District Hospital (ADH), addressing a chronic drug shortage that has plagued the facility for years.</p>
<p>The donation comes at a time when the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (AROB) health sector is facing significant logistical challenges. For many patients at Arawa Hospital, a lack of basic medicine has meant receiving prescriptions only to be forced to buy them at expensive private pharmacies, with some even traveling as far as Buka to find essential drugs.</p>

<p>Source: Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata’s D.C. staff</p>
<p><em>Washington, D.C. —</em>(January 9, 2026) Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata is reminding U.S. nationals from American Samoa that under current U.S. and state laws they absolutely cannot vote in elections outside of American Samoa unless they personally become U.S. citizens before voting.</p>
<p>“It’s incredibly important to not become confused over this: U.S. nationals cannot vote outside our elections in American Samoa. Even if the poll workers do not stop you from voting, and you have a state driver’s license, it’s still not allowed, and can lead to huge legal problems,” said Congresswoman Amata. “If you want to vote in the United States, you must become a citizen first, even if you’ve lived in a U.S. community for many years.”</p>
<p>“Until we are certain that we have widespread 100 percent awareness of this fact, it’s helpful to have a reminder to be sure the word is out, and protect friends and family from a legal nightmare. It’s very important to make sure your graduating high schoolers who are still U.S. nationals know this clearly when they turn 18 and potentially go away to jobs and college,” Aumua Amata continued. “For those choosing citizenship, I have a bill to help that process for U.S. nationals, but nationals risk prosecution by voting in any state that requires U.S. citizenship to be eligible to vote, unless state law were to expressly provide that U.S. nationals also may vote in that state’s elections.”</p>
<p>Amata has introduced the American Samoa Statutory Nationality and Citizenship Act (H.R. 6158) to help individual U.S. nationals more readily transfer into U.S. citizenship as a personal choice, while not affecting American Samoa’s current status, which for over 125 years has protected the family land and chiefly (matai) systems within the traditional fa’a Samoa (Samoan way).</p>
<p>The bill protects both collective self-determination for American Samoa and the individual rights of U.S. nationals, by enabling elective United States citizenship for individuals, and she will be posting more information about the bill in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“I am saddened by the voting case in Alaska, and I hope the wonderful people of Alaska, where I’ve visited many times, will be forgiving of this mistake by the local U.S. nationals in their community,” Amata concluded. “Rather, I hope that this can become an educational moment, that the Lord can ‘work together for good’ by preventing future problems through public awareness while restoring our people in Alaska with compassion.”</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> As the federal government considers opening U.S. territorial waters to deep sea mining, Pacific Island communities and territorial governments are going on record to oppose the imposition of these activities, warning of irreversible harm to ocean ecosystems, cultural lifeways, and the democratic rights of island peoples.</p>
<p>Just hours before the comment period closes this week, Right to Democracy, in partnership with the America the Beautiful for All Coalition, will host a virtual panel examining the federal call to open the waters of the Marianas to deep sea mining and its implications for island communities, ocean ecosystems, and self-determination.</p>
<p>The panel will feature Andra Samoa, Maria Hernández, and Sheila Babauta, all of whom are Right to Democracy Environment &amp; Democracy Fellows, and will be co-moderated by Neil Weare, Co-Director of Right to Democracy, and Angelo Villagomez, Ocean Co-Lead for the America the Beautiful for All Coalition.</p>
<p>Local and national civil society organizations will announce the results of their respective outreach efforts and successes in submitting petitions, letters, and comments to the federal register.</p>
<p>Special guests include Lt. Governor Joshua Tenorio, Speaker Frank Blas, Jr., and others.</p>
<p>The Virtual Panel Will Take Place:</p>
<ul>
<li>          Monday, January 12th at 5:00pm EST, 6:00pm AST, 11:00 am SST (American Samoa)</li>
<li>          Tuesday, January 13th at 8:00am ChST (Guam / Northern Mariana Islands)</li>

It didn’t take long for the busy city atmosphere to fade behind us as the open road welcomed the promise of sea breeze and quiet moments.</p>

      <p>
      <p>MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. — Tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis on Saturday to decry the fatal shooting of a woman ‌by a U.S. immigration agent, part of more than 1,000 rallies planned nationwide this weekend against the federal government’s deportation drive. The massive turnout in Minneapolis despite a whipping, cold wind underscores how the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforce-ment officer on Wednesday has struck a chord, fueling protests in major cities and some towns. Minnesota’s Democratic leaders and the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, have offered starkly different accounts of the incident.</p>

<p>The project, which will be coordinated from NARI Keravat, will be rolled out across all four districts of the province. SHEP, or Smallholder Horticulture Empowerment Project, is designed to transform smallholder farming by shifting practices from the traditional “grow and sell” approach to a more market-oriented “grow to sell” strategy.</p>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Venezuela’s main opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, has vowed to return home quickly, praising U.S. President Donald Trump for toppling ‌her enemy Nicolas Maduro and declaring her movement ready to win a free election. Trump appears, however, to hope for now to work with interim President Delcy Rodriguez and other senior officials from Maduro’s government, disappointing the opposition and contributing to nervousness in Venezuela. Venezuelan and U.S. officials are discussing the export of Venezuelan crude to U.S. refiners, five government, industry and shipping sources told Reuters. “I’m planning to go back to Venezuela as soon as possible,” said Machado, 58, who escaped from Venezuela in disguise in October to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which she dedicated to Trump.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape has commended Papua New Guineans across the country for maintaining relative peace and order during the 2025 Christmas and New Year festive period, describing the overall national conduct as “better than most years” and an encouraging start to the nation’s next 50 years.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said reports received at the start of the working year indicated that, aside from a small number of alcohol-fuelled incidents and isolated New Year disturbances, the festive season had been largely calm across all provinces, including the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Customers of the Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) have been actively voicing their concerns on social media about a troubling cash-trapping scheme reported at the bank's Automated Teller Machine (ATM) located within the Laufou Shopping Center in Nuʻuuli.</p>
<p>Several social media accounts have surfaced, detailing allegations that certain individuals have strategically applied tape to the ATM’s cash dispenser. This disturbing tactic is designed to misappropriate customer withdrawals. One account described a troubling incident in which a customer attempted to withdraw funds from an ATM. Although he received a receipt indicating that the transaction was successful, he was shocked to find that no physical cash was dispensed. Upon closer inspection of the cash dispenser, he discovered tape blocking the exit, with the cash he had attempted to withdraw stuck to it.</p>
<p>This alarming incident has since been reported to TBAS management. Cash-trapping scams have become a troubling trend, reported in communities across the United States and internationally. These schemes typically involve placing a device or obstruction over the cash dispenser slot to prevent the release of funds. In these scenarios, the customer’s account is debited, yet no cash is dispensed. Victims often assume the ATM is malfunctioning and leave, allowing the perpetrator to return, remove the obstruction, and claim the trapped cash.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, TBAS President and Chief Executive Officer Owen Perry addressed local media, confirming the bank's awareness of the troubling reports. He indicated that TBAS is actively investigating the situation, which appears to be limited to this ATM location for now. “Upon learning about the issue, the bank quickly contacted the Department of Public Safety and is cooperating fully while conducting an internal review,” Perry stated.</p>
<p>Perry further emphasized, “Our ATMs undergo regular monitoring and inspections, and we are continually evaluating and enhancing our security protocols across all locations.” TBAS strongly encourages any customer who experiences difficulties at a TBAS ATM or notices any anomalies to contact the bank immediately, enabling a swift response and resolution.</p>
<p>Due to the ongoing investigation, Perry noted that the bank cannot share specific details about the incidents at this time. “Our top priority is to ensure the safety of our customers while maintaining the integrity of our banking services,” he remarked.</p>

      <p>Lagpas dalawampung taon nang nakatira at naghahanap buhay sa Ingglatera bilang edukadór si Edison David. Tubong-Tarlac siya kaya nabagabag siya nang mabasa niyang nangungulelat sa ‘reading comprehension’ ang mga batang Pinoy. Kaso dinedma ng mga taga-Pilipinas ang mga suggestion niya.</p>

<p>The Central Provincial Government (CPG), led by Deputy Governor and Chairman for Law &amp; Order, Desmond Baira, is initiating high-level meetings to address the systemic harassment of rural producers supplying the National Capital District (NCD).</p>
<p>Farmers, fishermen, and betelnut growers from Central Province report growing intimidation and extortion when transporting goods to major NCD hubs, including Gordons, Boroko, and Koki. A primary concern is the predatory behaviour of &quot;middlemen&quot; who demand unauthorised &quot;carrying fees.&quot;</p>

<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Governor’s Office has officially given notice that parking and driving on the Malae o le Talu will no longer be tolerated. However, there is “no teeth” to the notice, as no fines for the offense are posted and the question of enforcement arises, as the Department of Public Safety has been seen as one of the worst offenders — using the Malae as a parking zone for their vehicles.</p>
<p>In the notice posted on the Office of the Governor’s webpage and addressed to the Secretary of Samoan Affairs, CEOs, Presidents and Executive Directors of Authorities, Directors. Agency and Office Heads — it says in part, “This prohibition applies to all ASG employees, contractors, and agents operating government vehicles, regardless of purpose or duration.”</p>
<p>Effective immediately, the following measures are hereby implemented:</p>
<p>a)      All American Samoa Government (ASG) vehicles and privately owned and operated vehicles are strictly prohibited from driving or parking on the Malae. This prohibition applies to all ASG employees, contractors, and agents operating government vehicles, regardless of purpose or duration.</p>
<p>b)      The Department of Parks and Recreation shall provide technical assistance, resources, and operational support to the village Pulenu’u and Leoleo Nuu in their efforts to protect the Malae.</p>
<p>c)      All ASG personnel and privately owned vehicles must utilize designated or alternate parking areas in proximity to the Malae.</p>
<p>Emergency vehicles responding to actual emergencies may access the Malae only to the extent absolutely necessary to address the emergency situations.</p>
<p>All agency heads, directors, and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that employees under their supervision are informed of and comply with this directive.</p>
<p>Preserving the cultural, historical, and recreational use of the Malae is a matter of territorial significance and requires the full cooperation of all ASG personnel.</p>
<p>A memo, dated December 23, 2025, and signed by Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula notes that “the Malae o le Talu (Malae) has been a central gathering place of profound historical, cultural, and ceremonial significance to the people of American Samoa for over 125 years, hosting village events, governmental functions, and community recreation.</p>
<p>“Vehicular traffic has severely damaged the Malae, compacting soil, destroying grass, and creating unsafe divots, hindering full use and enjoyment of this communal gathering place.”</p>
<p>Samoa News has published photos of the “No Parking” signs on the Malae, especially when the Governor’s Office moved into their new location at the newly renovated old ASB-ANZ Bank building — the Malae o le Talu is located directly across the street. Photos published also included the Department of Public Safety parking their vehicles on the Malae.</p>

<p>Seems PNG still will be walking into 2026 with more power blackouts, and water cuts. To add more value to our richness on this front,  now we also look largely blacked out on the satellite internet provider, Starlink’s, availability Map when we checked. There we are, the biggest blackest dot shaded in the region. All our teeny tiny neighbours in the Pacific shining bright like diamonds are part of more than 150 countries moving forward while we take a different path we anticipate with this.</p>

<p>“May God especially bless and each of them and these families, with ‘many happy returns’ to our island home. This Christmas, we keep our Toa o Samoa especially in our prayers – thank you to each one for your service and sacrifice!

<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> In observance of the New Year holiday, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula has announced that the government will officially take two days off — Thursday, January 1, 2026 and Friday, January 2nd. However, Wednesday, while not a holiday, will be a half day, with an early release from work at 12p.m.</p>
<p>As per usual on a government holiday all government offices will be closed, and normal operations will be suspended. Employees of the American Samoa Government who are not required to perform essential services shall be excused from duty. Those employees whose duties are essential and are required to work on these holidays shall receive holiday compensation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>“Government operations shall resume under normal business hours on Monday, January 5th 2026.</p>
<p>“The New Year marks a time of renewal, reflection, and hope as we look ahead to new opportunities and responsibilities. It is also a moment to give thanks for God’s guidance and blessings throughout the past year. Employees are encouraged to spend this time with family and loved ones, reflect on the yer past, and prepare for the year ahead with renewed purpose, unity, and commitment in serving our community.”</p>
<p>Governor Puaali’i extends his sincere appreciation for their continued service and dedication to the people of the Territory. “May the New Year bring you good health, success, and prosperity.</p>
<p>Samoa News should note that the governor is currently off island, with no return date currently announced.</p>
<p>The US Post Office Service will be closed New Year’s Day, returning on Friday, Jan. 2nd, as per normal federal holiday.</p>
<p>The Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) will close early at 12 pm, on Wednesday, December 31, 2025; on Thursday, Jan 1, 2026 it will be closed; and, it will be open on Friday, Jan. 2nd for full service.</p>
<p>Don’t forget American Samoa is the last “inhabited” country to ring in the New Year — if you want to see the last sunset of 2025 in the Territory, take a ride out to Poloa. On the other hand, if you want to experience the first New Year celebration in the world, you need to fly to Samoa, with the holidays experiencing some of the the busiest flight times for the inter-island airlines.</p>
<p>For StarKist Samoa its cannery shutdown continues for the Christmas and New Year holidays. The shutdown allows for major maintenance work and prepares the cannery for the new year, with the company slated to begin production of pet food in 2026.</p>
<p>With more than 80% of the cannery workforce of more than 2,000 being from Samoa, they have headed home for the holidays. The cannery did arrange for a charter of the Lady Samoa ferry to take its employees to Samoa during Christmas week. It’s unknown if a return-trip ferry has been chartered.</p>
<p>The company’s first day of production for 2026 is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 5th.</p>
<p>Usually New Year in the Territory highlights its NY Eve’s church services before the bars begin to fill to ring in the brand new year.</p>
<p>On New Year Day, look for family or company barbecues at the public beaches and parks. Most grocery stores will be open, with specialty stores and companies usually closing on that day, with all returning to full service on Friday.</p>
<p>According to the National Weather Service- Pago Pago, the weather forecast for New Year’s Day is partly cloudy, isolated showers, highs in the upper 80s, and variable winds up to 10 mph. It looks like mostly a sunny day.</p>
<p>From Thursday night through to Friday, its still partly cloudy however, scattered showers are forecast.</p>
<p>Friday night through Sunday, the weather is mostly cloudy with numerous showers — definitely expect rain throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>For the public’s safety, the police are continuing their Enforcement initiative that began about 2 weeks ago, marking the beginning of a focused effort to enhance road safety during the busy festive season.</p>
<p>Commissioner of Public Safety Taaga Saite Moliga announced the Enforcement initiative noting the deployment of strategically placed roadblocks throughout the community to identify and evaluate drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He noted these roadblocks would be strategically placed in response to real-time traffic patterns, focusing on high-traffic areas during peak travel periods to maximize visibility and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The DPS is maintaining its Holiday Enforcement program, through Saturday, January 3, 2026.</p>
<p>Samoa News will have an issue tomorrow, December 31st, New Year’s eve day and will be off on Thursday, Jan 1st and Friday, Jan. 2nd, returning on Monday, Jan 5th, 2026.</p>
<p>Happy New Year — American Samoa. Be safe, and with God’s grace may we ring in the New Year remembering to be kind to one another.</p>

<p>An Australian tourist says her visit to Papua New Guinea was memorable but ended earlier than planned after the cruise vessel Coral Adventurer ran aground off the Finschhafen coast.</p>
<p>“We visited some remote islands in Papua New Guinea and found everyone extremely friendly and welcoming,” the tourist said. “We loved visiting the villages, meeting the children, and seeing the schools. The snorkelling was amazing, with beautiful reefs and fish. Unfortunately, our adventure ended due to the vessel incident.”</p>

      <h1>Washington pipe bomb suspect has confessed, prosecutors say</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The man ‌accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack confessed to the FBI and told investigators he thought the 2020 election had been “tampered with,” according to ‍a court filing from federal prosecutors. Brian Cole, 30, of Virginia admitted to planting the devices, neither of which exploded, outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees following his arrest ​earlier this month, according to the filing, which ​was made public on Sunday.</p>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>This Thursday is New Year’s Day, filled with ritual and tradition for most of Japanese ancestry. The house has to be cleaned of all the old dust from the old year and all debts must be paid off before the year’s end — which is impossible if you have a car loan or a mortgage.</p>

      <p>
      <p>It’s a funny time of year to be writing to you about fast and simple cooking. Is this not the moment for luxury, pageantry and scale, for projects like tamales or lumpia that require a gathering of home cooks and many hands; or Caribbean black cake, with its jeweled dried and candied fruit soaked for up to a year; or a perfect prime rib roast, a grand and true statement piece?</p>

      <h1>Judge grants injunction blocking US from detaining British anti-disinformation activist</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from detaining British anti-disinformation campaigner Imran Ahmed, after the U.S. permanent resident sued officials over an entry ban for his role in what Washington argues is online censorship. Washington imposed visa bans on Tuesday on Ahmed and four Europeans, including French ‍former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accuses them of working to censor freedom of speech or unfairly target U.S. tech giants with burdensome regulation. Ahmed lives in Washington and is believed to be the only of the five currently in the country. The move sparked an outcry from European governments ​who argue regulations and the work of monitoring groups made the internet safer by ​highlighting false information and compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.</p>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — ‌The White House has ordered U.S. military forces to focus almost exclusively on enforcing a “quarantine” of Venezuelan oil for at least the next two months, a U.S. official told Reuters, indicating Washington is currently more interested in using economic rather than military means to pressure Caracas. “While military options still exist, the ‍focus is to first use economic pressure by enforcing sanctions to reach the outcome the White House is looking (for),” the official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. While President Donald Trump has been publicly coy about his precise aims regarding Venezuela, he has privately pressured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to ​flee the nation, Reuters has reported. Trump said on Monday it would be ​smart for Maduro to leave power.</p>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Packaged food makers and fast-food restaurants may ‌be forced to overhaul more of their products next year as newly approved, appetite-suppressing GLP-1 pills become available in January, analysts say. More Americans are expected to try the drugs as a pill rather than as a shot because the medication will be cheaper and many patients are hesitant to inject themselves. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy GLP-1 pill on ‍Monday, sending shares of food companies down on Tuesday.

<p>Samoa News Correspondent</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Son of American Samoa – Francis Mauigoa from the village of Ili’ili, continues to wreak havoc on the football field with the University of Miami “Hurricanes” (No.10), who defeated the Texas A&amp;M (No.7) in a historic 10 - 3 victory this past weekend. They are now scheduled to face the Ohio State ‘Buckeyes’ (No.2) in the Cotton Bowl that is set to kick off on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2025.</p>
<p>Mauigoa was named Consensus All-American, by the NCAA last Friday. The 6’6, 335lbs anchors a 11-2 Miami Hurricanes team who have much improved from their 10-3 record from last season.</p>
<p>To be named a Consensus All-American, a student-athlete must receive First Team All-America honors from at least three of the five NCAA-recognized selectors: the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.</p>
<p>According to the University of Florida’s recent media release, Mauigoa, received First Team honors from The Sporting News, the Associated Press and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. He anchored an offensive line that powered one of the ACC’s most productive rushing attacks, as Miami totaled 2,456 rushing yards while averaging 188.9 yards per game and 5.7 yards per carry. The Hurricanes also scored 30 rushing touchdowns and limited negative plays, allowing just 203 yards lost on the ground throughout the season.</p>
<p>Francis graduated earlier this month with his Bachelor of Science degree in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s in just three years. Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive.</p>

<p><strong><em>University of Miami graduate Francis Mauigoa, posing with his parent Fa’alialia and Telesia Mauigoa, during his graduation earlier this month, (December 11, 2025). Francis graduated with his Bachelor’s of Science in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s degree in three years – Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive. [photo: courtesy]</em></strong></p>
<p>Mauigoa who is rumored to be a first round draft pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, is the son of Telesia and Fa’alialia Mauigoa of Ili’ili. His older brother and former teammate, Francisco Mauigoa currently plays linebacker for the New York Jets Football Team.</p>

<p>Adding to the significant changes within the University of Miami football program is another Son of Samoa, Keiki Misipeka. Misipeka works in recruiting and personnel and has been part of the program for nearly a year.</p>
<p>During his career, Misipeka has helped and assisted numerous student-athletes from American Samoa, guiding them to Division I and junior college football opportunities. He previously served as the General Manager of Football at the University of Hawaiʻi, taking over the role for the Rainbow Warriors in 2024 after spending two seasons as the running backs coach.</p>
<p>Prior to his time coaching in the Mountain West Conference, Misipeka served as an NFL International Scout for the International Player Pathway (IPP) Program, where he was responsible for scouting the Pacific region, including American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Misipeka is the son of the late Kelemete and Iolani Misipeka of Fagatogo.</p>

<p>IT was the night before Christmas, when of all the places to speed around a bend from, this driver decided to speed into the drain just outside our office. An alcohol fuelled mishap that caused him to skid into our drain ready for our cameras on Christmas coverage operations. Only thing going for him this Christmas was the cops eventually letting him off the hook to recover what looked like a very brand new slick ride now wrecked beyond recognition. We hope the cops are not as forgiving of other naughty motorists tonight.</p>

<p>Community leaders in Gerehu 3A are sounding the alarm on a sophisticated new tactic being used by car thieves, even as local volunteer efforts successfully drive down overall crime rates. According to community leader Penny Son, criminals have moved away from traditional methods and are now using hired taxis to infiltrate the neighborhood undetected.</p>
<p>These suspects reportedly use the cabs to scout for target vehicles and execute thefts, attempting to blend in with normal traffic to bypass security.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s AI hiring campaign draws interest from 25,000 hopefuls</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Roughly 25,000 people have ​expressed ‌interest in joining the ‌Trump administration’s cadre of engineers known as Tech Force, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, as the ‍U.S. government looks to install staff with artificial intelligence expertise in federal roles. The Trump administration will use that ​list to recruit software and ​data engineers, in addition to other tech roles, said Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of ‍Personnel Management, in a post on X. ​Reuters could not independently verify the 25,000 figure. The interested candidates will compete for 1,000 spots in the first Tech Force cohort. The recruits will spend two years working on technology projects inside federal agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, among other government offices, Kupor said previously.</p>

<p>In his Christmas message to the people of Papua New Guinea and Wau-Waria District, Mr Narewec described 2025 as one of the most challenging years for the infant district, with law and order remaining its biggest obstacle to development.</p>
