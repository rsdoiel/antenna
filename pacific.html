papers to the entire internet! It’s easy to spend most of your time
searching and not enough time actually learning the most important
information. However, you don’t have to tackle this challenge on your
own. Let a generative AI assistant help you study smarter and learn more
of what matters.</p>

living rooms due to the popularity of shows highlighting the western
lifestyle, and with Climate Week piquing interest in sustainability,
it’s a good time to raise awareness about how farmers and ranchers — and
their cattle — do a lot more for the country and environment than just
being the backdrop of a popular western drama series.</p>

<p>IT isn’t often that I get to participate in a debate between
candidates for a seat in U.S. Congress; in fact, I’ve only ever done it
once and that was just recently (a little over a week ago) in the U.S.
Delegate Debate hosted by the Saipan Chamber of Commerce.  Overall, I
think the audience got what one might expect from a highly publicized
exercise in rigid speed-dating with bachelors and bachelorettes (numbers
one through five) trying to win the hearts and minds of the CNMI people
through a series of timed responses meant to gauge our respective hearts
and minds for the people of the CNMI.</p>

Marines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Friday was a bad day for bad guys, as Hezbollah terrorists had two of its top gangsters offed in a targeted Israeli airstrike in Beirut that also took out more than a dozen other Hezbollah cutthroats. Now dead is Ibrahim Aqil, wanted for killing Americans. As U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said, &amp;#8220;Any time a terrorist who has murdered Americans is brought to justice, we believe that that is a good outcome.&amp;#8221; Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

review: Kathy Bates stars, but this is not your grandparents’ legal
drama</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The original &amp;#8220;Matlock,&amp;#8221; which aired from 1986 to 1995, was a reimagining of the long-running &amp;#8220;Perry Mason&amp;#8221; legal drama. But instead of a hardnosed attorney at the center of its case-of-the-week format, &amp;#8220;Matlock&amp;#8221; leveraged star Andy Griffith&amp;#8217;s ability to play deceptively unthreatening, and then, in a climatic courtroom showdown, remarkably effective, even lacerating. With the new version of &amp;#8220;Matlock&amp;#8221; on CBS, it&amp;#8217;s best to go into it understanding that it&amp;#8217;s not a reboot so much as a show with a tenuous connection to the intellectual property of its title. But nothing gets green-lit today unless it&amp;#8217;s IP, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
