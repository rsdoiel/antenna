<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK &amp;#8212; The family of deceased Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre is urging President Donald Trump not to grant clemency to Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein abuse underage girls. Giuffre&amp;#8217;s family also said it was &amp;#8220;shocking&amp;#8221; to hear Trump say earlier this week that Epstein had poached Giuffre from Trump&amp;#8217;s Mar-a-Lago club, where she worked at the spa in 2000. The family said Trump&amp;#8217;s comment raised questions about whether Trump was aware of Epstein&amp;#8217;s sexual abuse at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;CHICAGO &amp;#8212; The Trump administration has terminated more than half of all federal funding for gun violence prevention programs in the U.S., cutting $158 million in grants that had been directed to groups in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, DC, and Baltimore. Of the 145 community violence intervention (CVI) grants totaling more than $300 million awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice, 69 grants were abruptly terminated in April, according to government data analyzed by Reuters. The elimination of CVI programs is part of a broader rollback at the department&amp;#8217;s grant-issuing Office of Justice Programs, which terminated 365 grants valued at $811 million in April, impacting a range of public safety and victim services programs.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="enjoy-the-best-wings-for-national-chicken-wing-day">Enjoy the
‘Best’ wings for National Chicken Wing Day</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-29, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>IT’S National Chicken Wing Day! All over America, today is the day to
celebrate the lunch time, happy hour, and dinner dish that’s a favorite
of people who love crunch and flavor.Here in the CNMI we have absolutely
no shortage of ways to savor the flavor of crispy, juicy, saucy chicken
wings.At Marianas Variety, whenever the question of what to eat crops
up, we reach for our Best of the Marianas list the way a traveler
reaches for GPS. Today is no different, and we made sure our wallets
were full and stomachs empty as we went around the island to celebrate
the food holiday.Zoom CafeStarting off our lunchtime journey, we took a
trip to the gold medal winner in the Best Fried Chicken category: Zoom
Chicken in Susupe.Marianas Variety readers don’t need to be sold on how
good the place is, as they voted it to the top spot.But just in case you
need a refresher: over at Zoom, you can order a plethora of wings in a
variety of sauces, including the herb fried chicken, sweet and sour
chicken, soy sauce chicken, and hot and spicy. A large order is $24,
with regular orders coming in at $14. By the way, you can do a
“half-half” order with two sauces for $25.We spoke with restaurant
supervisor Joernilyn Madiao, who says that soy sauce chicken and sweet
and sour are the sauce bosses for local customers.”I think they really
like the sauce from the soy sauce chicken, especially the kids,” she
said. “For sweet and sour they really like sweetness and the little bit
of spiciness.”Of course, here on Saipan the hot and spicy wings get
their fair share of attention, according to Madiao.“Some of the local
people like that too,” she said of the pika wings. “Sometimes they ask
if they can buy just the sauce. We make it here.”But delicious fried
chicken isn’t the only thing available at Zoom Cafe.Madiao says the
kimchee fried rice, spicy bulgogi, barbecued short ribs, and more are
all worth a consideration and are very popular with their
regulars.Thunder ChickenIn Chalan Laulau, Thunder Chicken, the bronze
medal winner in this year’s contest, is the go-to choice if you’re in
the mood for some Korean-style fried chicken.The restaurant serves
original Crispy Fried Chicken or full-flavored sauced orders like the
Sweet and Sour Chicken, Sweet and Spicy Chicken, Sweet Soy Sauce, Sweet
Garlic, Onion or Chili. Full-sized orders are $25, with half-orders
coming in at $13. Like at Zoom, customers can also order a half and half
chicken, combining two different styles together.JC CafeNow, let’s say
you’re REALLY in the mood for some of the best fried chicken in the
Marianas. You’re going to have to travel just a little bit over to JC
Cafe, smack dab in the heart of Tinian, to see how the winner of
Tinian’s Best Restaurant category serves up fried chicken.Island
residents order the buttered fried chicken routinely, and that’s because
it’s simply amazing. We think the Marianas Visitor’s Authority needs to
market it the same way they do Unai Taga and the San Jose Fiesta.Store
manager Lot Bunao says the buttered fried chicken also comes with a Pika
Pika version, which of course means customers can expect to have fresh
Tinian hot peppers mixed with the butter sauce on top of the crispy
fried chicken.So there you have it! We hope you’re ready for lunch,
dinner, happy hour or whatever hour. Enjoy National Chicken Wing Day
from Marianas Variety!</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;KYIV, Ukraine &amp;#8212; President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&amp;#8217;s anti-corruption policies have provoked Ukraine&amp;#8217;s first anti-government protests since the Russian invasion in 2022. Now, it seems, they may cost the country a portion of its foreign aid from the European Union, in a clear rebuke from the bloc, once a staunch ally.&lt;/p&gt;
