ǀ Truth 36: China or bust &amp; new tourism advertisement
methodology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, updated: 2024-01-28, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is Ambrose M. Bennett is going to
“tell-it-like-it-tis” as we say in my culture and the truth is that it
seems the CNMI is now committed to China, America’s rival and even foe,
over Japan which is our ally. I can see a lot of students, who are now
adults, who didn’t master their academic history lessons in world
history class on China &amp; Japan.  But only time will tell the story’s
ending. I will be the first to say, “I pray we (CNMI) will be successful
with this China venture.” HOWEVER, there are still some very serious
questions yet to be answered and there are too many variables to predict
a definitive outcome. For one, what will be the response of the Chinese
Government for their citizens coming to the CNMI. Need I remind that the
Chinese Government clearly stated “they are not going to allow their
citizens to come to the CNMI to gamble” and we are about to put
E-gambling in all the hotels, duh! Secondly, there is the very uncertain
&amp; unstable geopolitical arena of America’s &amp; China’s
relationship that can change at the drop of a hat literally. And third
and finally, WHAT is the strategy for getting the full return of the
Japanese that wasn’t even mentioned, which leads me to believe that it’s
now China or Bust (NOTHING New). Now the very foundation that
established our Tourism Industry is in peril — the Japanese market of
our ally, which is sad for me to see as an economist.</p>
