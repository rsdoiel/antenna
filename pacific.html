<p>By</p>
<p>Talaia Mika, Cook Islands News</p>
<p>Source: RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The United States research vessel E/V Nautilus was officially welcomed at Avatiu Wharf on Wednesday local time with a traditional ceremony celebrating a new era of ocean exploration and scientific partnership in the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA), the launch brought together government leaders, scientists and representatives from the Ocean Exploration Trust, the US Embassy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>SBMA commissioner Beverly Stacey Ataera said the arrival of Nautilus and its crew marked the successful completion of a groundbreaking three-week expedition that deepened the country's understanding of its marine environment.</p>
<p>&quot;This voyage was about understanding, and over three weeks, meticulous mapping, imaging and documentation have deepened our view of the seafloor,&quot; Ataera said.</p>
<p>She said the research had helped scientists see what lies beneath our marae moana, &quot;a fascinating space with some truly cute, fascinating creatures&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;To our partners from NOAA and the Ocean Exploration Trust and the US Embassy, meitaki maata, the gift you have given us is knowledge, freely shared, and now you are part of our nation's story,&quot; Ataera said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mark Brown, who is also the Minister responsible for seabed minerals, said the expedition had strengthened scientific collaboration and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to a &quot;science-led path&quot; in exploring its vast ocean territory.</p>
<p>&quot;To our partners, from the government of the United States, and also our representative from NOAA, Dr Eric Noble, welcome,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd also like to acknowledge the Ocean Exploration Trust. Thank you very much for the work that you've done with our Seabed Minerals Authority and also with our scientists over the last few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said the voyage had added to the country's knowledge of the deep and reminded Cook Islanders of their responsibility as &quot;guardians of our moana&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;So this voyage has helped us to see more of our ocean home,&quot; he said. &quot;It's added to our understanding of the deep and has reminded us of the responsibility that we carry as guardians of our moana. We are a people of the ocean. It shapes our culture, our identity and who we are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I spoke with our team on board during the expedition, what stood out was the pride in their voices,&quot; Brown added. &quot;Cook Islanders leading and contributing and being part of world-class science - this is what partnership is all about.&quot;</p>
<p>Ataera praised the enthusiasm of local scientists who worked alongside international experts during the expedition.</p>
<p>&quot;They have lit up with curiosity and are completely absorbed by the work. They have been proudly nerding out, as I say, over tiny fauna, delicate sponges and loudly squealing at times, discussing and celebrating each new image that came through,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ataera described a special moment when Brown spoke directly to Cook Islands scientists onboard the vessel.</p>
<p>&quot;That simple exchange captured for me what this voyage was truly about, partnership in action, science in service of our people and knowledge guiding our future,&quot; Ataera said. &quot;Understanding the deep is not just a luxury, it is essential.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said the collaboration with the United States was a milestone, the first of its kind in years, and reflected the Cook Islands' growing leadership in marine science.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a long time since we've had a significant collaboration of this nature with the United States. So welcome back,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every discovery helps us to make better decisions, decisions based on evidence, transparency and care for our people and our environment.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nautilus expedition, titled Deep-Sea Habitats of the Cook Islands, spent three weeks mapping and documenting the seafloor within the Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<p>The mission aimed to gather new scientific data to inform government decisions on ocean management, including the exploration phase of seabed minerals.</p>
<p>Ataera said the research would strengthen the country's ability to protect its marine environment while guiding policy and planning for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ocean is not our limit, it is our legacy, and we will continue to explore it with courage, humility and care,&quot; she said.</p>

      <h1>OP ED: The Shriners in American Samoa – A Legacy of Compassion and Care</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>By</p>
<p>Archie Soliai.</p>
<p>For over half a century, the Shriners have been a beacon of hope in American Samoa, embodying a mission of selflessness and service to children in need. Since establishing their presence more than 50 years ago, the Shriners have worked tirelessly to support the Shriners Hospitals for Children, a network dedicated to providing specialized medical care to children with orthopedic conditions, burns, spinal cord injuries, and other complex needs — regardless of a family’s ability to pay.</p>
<p>Their enduring commitment has transformed countless lives in American Samoa and beyond, creating a legacy of compassion that continues to thrive.</p>
<p>The Shriners’ work in American Samoa is a testament to their dedication. Through annual, and sometimes biannual, visits, they identify children with specialty medical needs and facilitate their treatment, both locally and at Shriners Hospitals across the United States.</p>
<p>Remarkably, their generosity extends beyond American Samoa’s borders, covering the costs of care for children from Independent Samoa as well. This commitment ensures that children, who might otherwise lack access to advanced medical treatment, receive world-class care that can change the trajectory of their lives.</p>
<p>Fundraising has always been at the heart of the Shriners’ efforts in American Samoa. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the local Shriners captured the community’s imagination with vibrant bed races — lively events that brought people together to raise funds for the Shriners Hospitals. Over the past few decades, these efforts have evolved into the annual golf tournament and raffles, which have become cornerstone events for the organization.</p>
<p>This year, on Saturday, October 25, 2025, the American Samoa Shriners will host their 31st Annual Golf Tournament, a cherished tradition that rallies the community to support this vital cause.</p>
<p>The funds raised through this event directly support the medical care and transportation costs for children, ensuring that no child is left behind due to financial barriers.</p>
<p>The impact of the Shriners’ work is profound. For families in American Samoa, a small territory with limited access to specialized pediatric care, the Shriners provide a lifeline. Children with conditions requiring advanced treatment — whether orthopedic, neurological, spinal, burns or otherwise — receive expert care at no cost to their families. This alleviates not only the financial burden but also the emotional weight of navigating complex medical challenges.</p>
<p>The Shriners’ holistic approach, which includes arranging travel and accommodations for families, reflects their deep understanding of the challenges faced by those in remote communities.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, the Shriners in American Samoa invite the community to join their mission. Volunteers and supporters are always needed to sustain this critical work. Whether through participating in the upcoming golf tournament, purchasing raffle tickets, or offering your time and talents, every contribution makes a difference.</p>
<p>If you’re inspired to help ensure that children in American Samoa and beyond continue to receive life-changing care, reach out to the local Shriners to learn how you can get involved.</p>
<p>The Shriners’ more than 50-year legacy in American Samoa is one of unwavering dedication to children and families. Their mission, rooted in compassion and executed with tireless effort, reminds us of the power of collective action.</p>
<p>As we approach the 31st Annual Golf Tournament, let us rally behind this noble cause, celebrating the Shriners’ impact and ensuring that their work continues to shine brightly for generations to come.</p>
<p>For those interested in volunteering or supporting the Shriners’ mission, please contact the American Samoa Shriners to learn how you can contribute to this vital cause at (684)258-2770.</p>

<p>Right to Democracy staff,</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Right to Democracy (RtD) will host a virtual dialogue “Effects of Militarization in U.S. Territories,” bringing together leading scholars to examine how the rapid expansion of joint exercises, base build-outs, and live-fire training across the Pacific and Caribbean is reshaping life in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Panelists will offer historical context, assess the effects of current escalation of activities, and discuss how these dynamics interact with the territories’ democratic deficits and the enduring colonial legal framework under which they are governed.</p>
<p>Moderated by RtD Co-Founder Adi Martínez-Román and RtD Solidarity Director and Cross-territorial Fellow Hadiya Sewer, this panel will bring expert voices and a cross-territorial perspective to the phenomenon of militarization in the Territories, and the unique problems Territories face.</p>
<p>The dialogue will include the contribution of the following participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>          Guam: Dr. Kenneth Gofigan Kuper, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Guam’s Micronesian Area Research Center; Director, Pacific Center for Island Security, providing independent foreign-policy analysis for the Asia-Pacific.</li>
<li>          Northern Mariana Islands: Dr. Theresa “Isa” Arriola, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, Concordia University; Chair, Our Common Wealth 670 (OCW 670) on Saipan, a community advocacy group dedicated to research, education, and public awareness regarding military impacts in the Marianas.</li>
<li>          Puerto Rico: Dr. Melody Fonseca Santos, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Puerto Rico –Mayagüez. Her research and teaching focus on International Relations Critical Theory, U.S. foreign policy toward the Caribbean, and feminist and gender studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Communities in the territories have lived for generations with decisions made about our lands, waters, and futures without our consent and with “U.S. national security” interests in mind,” said Dr. Adi Martínez-Román, Co-Director and Co-Founder of Right to Democracy and event co-moderator.</p>
<p>“This conversation connects the expertise of scholars from our archipelagos to uncover shared challenges — and to underscore why understanding the intersection between militarization and colonial rule is not optional but urgent.”</p>
<p>“Militarization is never just about bases or training schedules,” added Hadiya Sewer, RtD’s Solidarity Director and National Environment &amp; Democracy Fellow, and event co-moderator.</p>
<p>“It’s about environmental risk, cultural survival, public health, and the everyday ability of people—who lack full democratic voice—to shape what happens to their homelands. This panel explores the effects of militarization when the legal structure itself enables vulnerability.”</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the convicted founder of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, the White House said Thursday, in the latest move by Trump to boost the crypto industry and expunge its past misdeeds. Zhao, a billionaire known as “CZ” who is one of the most influential figures in crypto, quit in 2023 as Binance chief after the company pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and paid a penalty of $4.3 billion. Zhao was prosecuted by the Biden administration “in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>For the second consecutive year, the Sugu Peace Basketball Association is preparing to host a major event aimed at cementing reconciliation in a region previously torn by violence. The 2nd Edition Christmas Peace Basketball Tournament is scheduled to run for five days, from December 20th to December 24th, at Katiloma Village in Sugu Valley.</p>
<p>The return of the tournament underscores the success of last year’s inaugural event and the commitment of local youth to sustain a culture of harmony. The basketball games are far more than a holiday celebration; they serve as an official, highly anticipated association tournament designed to attract teams from neighbouring districts and provinces, extending the reach of the peace message.</p>

      <h1>U.S. Pacific territories chart path to Universal Broadband Coverage</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>Territories’ BEAD plans emphasize buried fiber, resiliency, and disaster readiness</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/broadband_logo.png?itok=Ovl5zQk0"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/broadband_logo.png?itok=x0kMHqiv" alt="BEAD LOGO"></a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Three U.S. territories – Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa – have finalized plans to close vast Internet coverage gaps under the federal Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program.</p>
<p>If approved, the plans would be transformational for the Pacific islands, delivering robust, resilient Internet connections to regions where as much as 80 to 100 percent of locations remain underserved.</p>
<p>In American Samoa, BEAD funding would be used to deploy broadband connections to 80 percent, or 7,653 of the territory’s 9,535 total locations. In the Northern Mariana Islands, it would connect every one of the island’s 9,568 locations to hardened, end-to-end fiber, marking the first time the islands would achieve universal broadband coverage.</p>
<p>Each of the territories' proposals underscores the distinct challenges facing island communities in their efforts to expand broadband. Typhoons and earthquakes are constant threats, limited infrastructure hampers progress, and network resiliency takes on new meaning.</p>
<p>Guam’s submission prioritizes hardening networks and new undersea fiber cabling, while the Northern Mariana Islands requires subgrantees to prepare risk management plans for natural disasters. American Samoa, meanwhile, points to geographic isolation and high deployment costs as its biggest barriers to broadband expansion.</p>
<p>American Samoa To Utilize Fiber, Wireless, And Satellites</p>
<p>American Samoa’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RqCsaL01ort4BoTWfXMVAJvPkteSwEiB/edit?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com">final BEAD plan</a> calls for use of its $37 million BEAD allocation to overcome the territory’s persistent connectivity barriers through strategic investments in fiber and fixed wireless, while also supporting workforce development and digital equity initiatives.</p>
<p>“This funding is critical for the Territory, where geographic isolation, high deployment costs, and infrastructure challenges have historically limited broadband availability,” the Office of Broadband Coordination, Opportunities, Development and Deployment said.</p>
<p>Similar to Guam, two terrestrial providers and one satellite provider were selected to deliver universal coverage across the territory’s 17 project-funded areas.</p>
<p>The American Samoa Telecommunications Authority will lead the largest share of construction, deploying buried fiber to roughly 6,900 locations.</p>
<p>AST Telecom LLC, operating as Bluesky Communications, will extend a fiber and licensed fixed wireless hybrid network to about 300 sites, across five project areas. And, SpaceX’s Starlink service will connect around 430 of the most remote locations.</p>
<p>Together, these projects will connect all 7,653 broadband-serviceable locations and 41 community anchor institutions on the island.</p>
<p>The three U.S. territories are among the <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/states-20-billion-under-budget-for-bead-so-far/">49 U.S. states</a> and <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/washington-d-c-finalizes-plan-for-100m-in-federal-broadband-funding/">the District of Columbia</a> in publicizing their final BEAD proposals. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have not yet released their proposals.</p>
<p>The program’s administrator, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, has yet to approve any plans under its <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/ntia-rewrites-rules-for-bead-forcing-states-to-rebid-broadband-projects/">revised rules</a>.</p>

      <p>The 60,000 men and women responsible for keeping American skies safe have gone unpaid throughout the government shutdown. Without a funding agreement soon, many will be forced to dip into savings, rack up credit-card debt, or take on part-time jobs to make ends meet, several federal employees said. The shutdown is now three weeks old, and rapidly approaching the time when the tens of thousands of government employees who keep security lines moving and air traffic safe will miss a full paycheck. Those workers last received paychecks in mid-October, and those checks were missing up to two days’ worth of pay.</p>

      <p>NEW YORK — North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a new congressional map on Wednesday aimed at securing the party another seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, expanding President Donald Trump’s campaign to use partisan redistricting to help Republicans keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. The state’s previous map, approved by Republicans only two years ago, was already heavily skewed, allowing Republicans to win 10 of 14 U.S. House seats in 2024 despite North Carolina’s status as a closely divided swing state.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Your phone buzzes at 6 a.m. It’s ChatGPT: “I see you’re traveling to New York this week. Based on your preferences, I’ve found three restaurants near your hotel. Would you like me to make a reservation?” You didn’t ask for this. The AI simply knew your plans from scanning your calendar and email and decided to help. Later, you mention to the chatbot needing flowers for your wife’s birthday. Within seconds, beautiful arrangements appear in the chat. You tap one: “Buy now.” Done. The flowers are ordered.</p>
<p>This isn’t science fiction. On Sept. 29, 2025, OpenAI and payment processor <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> launched the <a href="https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/">Agentic Commerce Protocol</a>. This technology lets you buy things instantly from Etsy within ChatGPT conversations. ChatGPT users are scheduled to gain access to over 1 million other Shopify merchants, from major household brand names to small shops as well.</p>

Most people have no idea it’s happening.</p>

<p><strong>FROM SEARCHING TO BEING SERVED</strong></p>
<p>For three decades, the internet has worked the same way: You want something, you Google it, you compare options, you decide, you buy. You’re in control.</p>
<p>That era is ending.</p>
<p>AI shopping assistants are evolving through three phases. First came “on-demand AI.” You ask ChatGPT a question, it answers. That’s where most people are today.</p>
<p>Now we’re entering “ambient AI,” where <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/">AI suggests things before you ask</a>. ChatGPT monitors your calendar, reads your emails and offers recommendations without being asked.</p>
<p>Soon comes “autopilot AI,” where AI makes purchases for you with minimal input from you. “Order flowers for my anniversary next week.” ChatGPT checks your calendar, remembers preferences, processes payment and confirms delivery.</p>
<p>Each phase adds convenience but gives you less control.</p>
<p><strong>THE MANIPULATION PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>AI’s responses create what researchers call an “advice illusion.” When ChatGPT suggests three hotels, you don’t see them as ads. They feel like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend. But you don’t know whether those hotels paid for placement or whether better options exist that ChatGPT didn’t show you.</p>
<p>Traditional advertising is something most people have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/13522751211191973">learned to recognize and dismiss</a>. But AI recommendations feel objective even when they’re not. With one-tap purchasing, the entire process happens so smoothly that you might not pause to compare options.</p>
<p>OpenAI isn’t alone in this race. In the same month, Google announced its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2025/09/22/the-google-ap2-payment-protocol-will-trigger-interesting-innovation/">competing protocol, AP2</a>. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are building similar systems. Whoever wins will be in position to control how billions of people buy things, potentially capturing a percentage of trillions of dollars in annual transactions.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE’RE GIVING UP</strong></p>
<p>This convenience comes with costs most people haven’t thought about.</p>
<p>Privacy: For AI to suggest restaurants, it needs to read your calendar and emails. For it to buy flowers, it needs your purchase history. People will be trading total surveillance for convenience.</p>
<p>Choice: Right now, you see multiple options when you search. With AI as the middleman, you might see only three options ChatGPT chooses. Entire businesses could become invisible if AI chooses to ignore them.</p>
<p>Power of comparing: When ChatGPT suggests products with one-tap checkout, the friction that made you pause and compare disappears.</p>
<p><strong>IT’S HAPPENING FASTER THAN YOU THINK</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT reached <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/">800 million weekly users</a> by September 2025, growing four times faster than social media platforms did. Major retailers began using OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol within days of its launch.</p>
<p>History shows people consistently underestimate how quickly they adapt to convenient technologies. Not long ago most people wouldn’t think of getting in a stranger’s car. Uber now has <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4826/uber-technologies/?srsltid=AfmBOooEKiBOI80u7bBcAdQJQTq2lJTLYQL0ENr1L6dZKtwCuxbagoxs%22%20%5Cl%20%22editorsPicks">150 million users</a>.</p>
<p>Convenience always wins. The question isn’t whether AI shopping will become mainstream. It’s whether people will keep any real control over what they buy and why.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></p>
<p>The open internet gave people a world of information and choice at their fingertips. The AI revolution could take that away. Not by forcing people, but by making it so easy to let the algorithm decide that they forget what it’s like to truly choose for themselves. Buying things is becoming as thoughtless as sending a text.</p>
<p>In addition, a single company could become the gatekeeper for all digital shopping, with the potential for monopolization beyond even Amazon’s current dominance in e-commerce. We believe that it’s important to at least have a vigorous public conversation about whether this is the future people actually want.</p>
<p>Here are some steps you can take to resist the lure of convenience:</p>
<p>Question AI suggestions. When ChatGPT suggests products, recognize you’re seeing hand-picked choices, not all your options. Before one-tap purchases, pause and ask: Would I buy this if I had to visit five websites and compare prices?</p>
<p>Review your privacy settings carefully. Understand what you’re trading for convenience.</p>
<p>Talk about this with friends and family. The shift to AI shopping is happening without public awareness. The time to have conversations about acceptable limits is now, before one-tap purchasing becomes so normal that questioning it seems strange.</p>
<p><strong>THE INVISIBLE PRICE TAG</strong></p>
<p>AI will learn what you want, maybe even before you want it. Every time you tap “Buy now” you’re training it – teaching it your patterns, your weaknesses, what time of day you impulse buy.</p>
<p>Our warning isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about recognizing the trade-offs. Every convenience has a cost. Every tap is data. The companies building these systems are betting you won’t notice, and in most cases they’re probably right.</p>

      <h1>"ASEDA’S NEW BONDS: ADDING WEIGHT TO A SINKING BOAT"</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p><em><strong>Dear Editor:</strong></em></p>
<p>The American Samoa Economic Development Authority (ASEDA) has announced its intent to issue two new bond series — the 2025A and 2025B — with a combined value of up to <span class="math inline">\(65 million. The first, a refinancing bond of \)</span>50 million, is meant to retire the 2015A bonds; the second, $15 million, is to finance the completion of the Fono building, a new correctional facility, and ASTCA’s internet capacity and redundancy.</p>
<p>The announcement comes only three months after the Territorial Audit Office released its FY 2025 Local Budget Audit (Report 25-01, July 2025) — a sobering assessment that projects a 25 percent shortfall in local revenues, or roughly $42 million below budget. The audit warns that under Section 3 of the Budget Code (A.S.C.A. § 10.0503, Budget Execution and Control), this magnitude of deficit requires the Governor to notify the Fono and submit a corrective plan. Yet no such plan has been presented publicly.</p>
<p>When revenues are falling and expenditures already exceed income by $24 million, the government’s focus should be on stabilization and reform, not on expanding liabilities. ASEDA’s bonds are secured by “100 percent of pledged taxes,” meaning that every dollar of future tax revenue already underperforming expectations is now further pledged to debt service. Refinancing may make sense if it lowers interest costs or shortens maturities — but without public disclosure of savings calculations, debt-service schedules, or interest-rate assumptions, taxpayers cannot tell whether this deal lightens the load or simply reshuffles it.</p>
<p>The new-money Series 2025B is even harder to justify. Financing furniture, fixtures, and internet infrastructure through long-term debt contradicts the audit’s warnings about blurred boundaries between operating and capital spending. Without a detailed repayment plan, new borrowing secured by the same underperforming tax base risks deepening fiscal imbalance and undermining legislative appropriation authority.</p>
<p>ASEDA’s enabling law allows flexibility to leverage local revenues for development, but that flexibility carries a fiduciary duty. The agency’s credibility — and by extension, the government’s — depends on strict transparency, disciplined debt management, and compliance with the audit’s recommendations. Public confidence will erode if deficit financing proceeds while legal safeguards and reporting requirements remain unmet.</p>
<p>Before any bond sale closes, the people of American Samoa deserve clarity on five points: (1) the net savings, if any, from the 2015A refunding; (2) the repayment source and coverage ratio for the 2025B bonds; (3) the effect on annual debt service relative to the General Fund; (4) the government’s plan to correct the revenue shortfall identified by the audit; and (5) confirmation that future capital spending will follow lawful appropriations.</p>
<p>Borrowing, in itself, is not the enemy of progress — but borrowing without balance, transparency, or accountability is. Until the deficit plan required by law is in place and the numbers prove these bonds reduce rather than increase the burden, American Samoa should pause and ask: Are we financing growth, or postponing reckoning?</p>

      <h1>OpenAI launches AI browser Atlas in latest challenge to Google</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>OpenAI on Tuesday unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, a long-anticipated artificial intelligence-powered web browser built around its popular chatbot, in a direct challenge to Google Chrome’s dominance. The launch marks OpenAI’s latest move to capitalize on 800 million weekly active ChatGPT users, as it expands into more aspects of users’ online lives by collecting data about consumers’ browser behavior. It could accelerate a broader shift toward AI-driven search, as users increasingly turn to conversational tools that synthesize information instead of relying on traditional keyword-based results from Google — intensifying competition between OpenAI and Google.</p>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>LONDON — A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Britain’s Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her as a teenager, went on sale in London on Tuesday, days after the disgraced prince gave up his Duke of York title. Much of the contents of the book were reported before its release, triggering renewed scrutiny on Andrew — King Charles’ brother — whose conduct and connections with the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have long been criticised. Andrew, 65, has always denied Giuffre’s account.</p>

      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — A group of hundreds of former U.S. national security officials on Tuesday urged lawmakers to examine an internal government group that has been coordinating President Donald Trump’s retribution drive against his perceived enemies. The Steady State, a rule-of-law advocacy group, issued its call for congressional inquiries into the Interagency Weaponization Working Group in a letter to the top Republicans and Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and armed services committees. The letter came a day after Reuters disclosed that a review of government records showed that the interagency group drew dozens of officials from the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Justice Department, the FBI and other departments.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to easing the burden of living costs on Papua New Guineans through a series of bold, people-centred economic measures, including the removal of GST from basic food items, the lifting of the non-taxable income threshold, and the recent increase in the national minimum wage.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Marape said his government remains focused on supporting ordinary working-class Papua New Guineans, families, and small wage earners who continue to feel the pressure of global economic challenges.</p>

      <p>OVER 40% OF SAMOAN HOUSEHOLDS CAN’T AFFORD HEALTHY DIETS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/apia_waterfront_wall.jpeg?itok=ysX1-mU6"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/apia_waterfront_wall.jpeg?itok=vJyevc2J" alt="Apia residents sitting on the sea wall"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Many Samoans face serious health risks due to poor nutrition, which is partly attributed to the high cost and limited availability of healthy food in the country, a diet analysis report has found.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/cost-diet-analysis-samoa-august-2025">Cost of the Diet Analysis</a> report published by Samoa's Ministry of Agriculture and the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) reveals the nation is facing a &quot;nutrition crisis&quot;, which is made worse by &quot;a shift from traditional diets to imported, ultra-processed foods&quot;.</p>
<p>The analysis used food price data from the Samoa Bureau of Statistics and WFP's Enhance linear optimization tool to model the lowest-cost food baskets that could meet the nutritional needs of a six-person household.</p>
<p>The report found that, while food may be abundant in calories, it is often deficient in the nutrients essential for health, growth and resilience.</p>
<p>According to the analysis, a nutritious diet in Samoa — which provides both energy and nutrients — costs more than four times than what a basic energy diet costs. As a result, more than 40 percent of Samoan households cannot afford healthy food.</p>
<p>The report also notes that nearly 80 percent of Samoan women are classified as obese, and that over 70 percent of deaths in the country are linked to non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</p>
<p>Samoa Ministry of Agriculture chief executive Dr Seuseu Joseph Tauati and WFP's Pacific Office country director Alpha Bah said: &quot;Findings from the Cost of the Diet Analysis report state that for an average six-member household in Samoa, a nutritious diet that meets the energy and nutritional needs of the household (including foods such as vegetables, coconut, fish, beef, milk, taro and rice) costs WST50 (US$18) per day. This is four times more than the cost of a basic, energy-only diet (such as wheat, coconut and oil).&quot;</p>
<p>They added: &quot;Furthermore, a comparison of diet costs of individual household members highlights the nutritional vulnerability of adolescent girls and breastfeeding women, who face the highest costs for nutritious diets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of this high cost for nutritious diets, many households in Samoa (over 40 percent) cannot afford a healthy diet that contributes to a healthy and productive life.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Seuseu and Bah said the report provides a roadmap for evidence-based, collaborative action.</p>
<p>&quot;First, make nutritious food more affordable and accessible.</p>
<p>“Second, leverage schools and communities.</p>
<p>“Finally, community-based solutions are essential.</p>
<p>“Nutrition is a whole-of-nation responsibility. Simply establishing basic community gardens can increase the supply of local produce not only for families but also to local markets, connecting producers to consumers.</p>
<p>“Something as simple as starting a home garden to grow staples, vegetables and herbs and sharing it with neighbors can go a long way in reducing the cost of healthy diets and adding value to home-cooked meals.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>RNZ AIMS TO STRENGTHEN PACIFIC DEFENSE TIES</strong></p>
<p>Associate Defense Minister Chris Penk says New Zealand is looking to improve regional cooperation and address shared security challenges at this week's South Pacific Defence Ministers' Meeting (SPDMM) in Chile.</p>
<p>The annual gathering brings together defense ministers and senior officials from across the Pacific, including representatives from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Australia, and France, to discuss collective security, humanitarian assistance, and defense cooperation.</p>
<p>Now in its 12th year, the meeting also includes representatives from the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and observers from the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan.</p>
<p>Speaking with William Terite on Pacific Mornings, Penk says he looks forward to the important discussions ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a really important forum for us and for the whole Pacific,&quot; he says. &quot;With friends and partners across the area, we know that there are a lot of interesting engagements that we need to have with fellow ministers, but also senior officials. It's a crucial region for the world and for New Zealand, it's right on our back step.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite ongoing deployments and humanitarian efforts, Penk says New Zealand remains committed to its Pacific obligations.</p>

<p><strong>FBI ISSUES WARNING TO SENIORS</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning seniors about a scam that has cost South Carolinians nearly $10 million this year.</p>
<p>“We know there are multiple people in the Upstate that have experienced this or people who have attempted to scam them out of their hard-earned money,” FBI Public Affairs Specialist, Kevin Wheeler said.</p>
<p>Michael and Roxanne Chrisman are two of the victims of a very advanced and in-depth tech scam.</p>
<p>Six months ago their life turned upside down when they were instructed to withdraw their life savings and turn it into gold.</p>
<p>It all started with a pop-up message on Michael Chrisman’s computer. The notice said the computer was locked and all of his information had been compromised. It gave him a phone number to call, and when he did, the person on the other end identified himself as someone who worked for a large tech company. And of course he was not.</p>
<p>“It was identified as a Microsoft number, so I was comfortable because I have a Microsoft system …”</p>
<p>The FBI also wants to prevent it from happening again. “If someone is asking you to move your money from to one account into another in order to protect it, it’s likely a scam,” FBI Public Affairs Specialist, Kevin Wheeler said.</p>
<p>The FBI gives these tips to help you protect yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>•        Do not click on unsolicited popups, text message or email links.</li>
<li>•        Never give unknown individuals access to your computer.</li>
<li>•        Do not download software at the request of unknown individuals.</li>
<li>•        Do not meet with unknown individuals to deliver cash or precious metals.</li>
<li>•        U.S. Government agencies will never tell you to wire money, send precious metals or purchase gift cards.</li>

<p><strong>RAROTONGA STRUCK BY 'WAVE OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS'</strong></p>
<p>An influx of patients with severe respiratory and flu-like symptoms, including loss of taste and smell, is overwhelming Rarotonga's clinics, as the Ministry of Health monitors the seasonal virus surge and advises the public on proper care and prevention measures.</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, the Rarotonga Hospital and Tupapa Primary Health Clinic have been flooded with people reporting similar symptoms such as loss of taste and smell, shortness of breath, severe headaches and most recently, stomach aches.</p>
<p>Long queues of waiting patients have been seen outside the centre, with many concerned residents reportedly being struck multiple times by the same mysterious illness.</p>
<p>Responding to questions from Cook Islands News, Secretary of Health Bob Williams confirmed that the symptoms being reported are consistent with a wave of acute respiratory infections currently circulating on the island.</p>
<p>Williams revealed that there were about 200 cases recorded in August and 130 cases in September, with the majority in Rarotonga.</p>

<p><strong>SAMOA PM LAAULI HOLD TALKS WITH NZ FOREIGN MINISTER</strong></p>
<p>Samoa's Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Fosi Schmidt held talks with the New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters on Sunday.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Samoa government said Laauli and Peters met at the Samoan Consulate in Mangere in Auckland.</p>
<p>It said the two leaders discussed several issues, including the priorities of the new Samoa government, border security to tackle drug trafficking, the development of private enterprises in Samoa, and the New Zealand Recognized Seasonal Employer scheme.</p>
<p>Laauli jetted out of Apia on 21 September, just days after being sworn in as the country's eighth prime minister, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573963/samoan-pm-s-treatment-in-nz-nothing-surprising-but-highlights-domestic-healthcare-gaps-expert">for medical treatment</a> in New Zealand. He said the check-ups for a leg injury — which he had to put on hold due to campaigning for the 29 August elections — were &quot;long overdue&quot;.</p>
<p>He was expected to return to Samoa within a week, but he has had to extend his stay because he is not able to stand, Samoa's Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo confirmed to the Samoa Observer on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Laaulialemalietoa has now been in New Zealand for four weeks. He left five days after being sworn in as the Prime Minister on a private jet. His exact medical condition has not been declared,&quot; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not been confirmed if Laaulialemalietoa will be in the country when the 2025/ 2026 budget is voted on.&quot;</p>

      <p>BOGOTA — Colombia said on Monday it has recalled its ambassador from Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on the South American nation and stop all payments to it, intensifying a feud stemming from U.S. military strikes on vessels allegedly transporting drugs. Trump also called Colombian’s leftist President Gustavo Petro an “illegal drug leader” on Sunday, which Petro’s government described as offensive. Colombia’s currency fell 1.4% to 3,889 pesos per U.S. dollar in early trading on Monday. “Daniel Garcia-Pena, Ambassador of Colombia in the United States of America, has been recalled for consultations by President Gustavo Petro and is now in Bogota,” Colombia’s foreign ministry said. “In the coming hours the national government will inform of the decisions taken.”</p>

Trump said on Sunday that he was considering imports to reduce U.S. beef prices that have climbed to record highs. His administration earlier extended a $20 billion currency swap lifeline to Argentina, which the president considers an ally.</p>

<p>Oaks will inherit leadership of a religious institution that is both deeply American and increasingly global – diversity at odds with the way it’s typically represented in mainstream media, from “ <a href="https://time.com/7018258/the-secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-hulu-explained/">The Secret Life of Mormon Wives</a>” to <a href="https://bookofmormonbroadway.com/">“The Book of Mormon” Broadway musical</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=M3owt_AAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">a cultural anthropologist and ethnographer</a>, I research Latter-day Saints communities across the United States, particularly <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2813777758?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">Latina immigrants</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00027642241285018">young adults</a>. When presenting my research, I’ve noticed that many people still closely associate the church with Utah, where its headquarters are located.</p>
<p>The church has played a pivotal role in Utah’s history and culture. Today, though, only <a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/2589742x-bja10019">42% of its residents are members</a>. The stereotype of Latter-day Saints as mostly white, conservative Americans is just one of many <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-michigan-church-shooting-sits-within-a-long-history-of-hatred-against-mormons-in-america-266481">long-standing misconceptions</a> about LDS communities and beliefs.</p>
<p>Many people are surprised to learn there are vibrant congregations far from the American West’s “ <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-is-the-mormon-corridor.html">Mormon Corridor</a>.” There are devout Latter-day Saints everywhere from <a href="https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/from-freeze-to-fire">Ghana</a> and the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20221212-uae-mormons-to-have-first-temple-in-the-middle-east/">United Arab Emirates</a> to <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/02/26/russian-mormons-search-for-identity-and-acceptance-in-an-american-church-a64574">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2025/07/04/lds-branches-shut-down-beijing/">mainland China</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL GROWTH</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Smith founded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York in 1830 and immediately <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-missionary-work-in-the-church">sent missionaries</a> to preach along the frontier. The first overseas missionaries traveled to England in 1837.</p>
<p>Shortly after World War II, church leaders <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/chapter-forty-two?lang=eng">overhauled their missionary approach</a> to increase the number of international missions. This strategy led to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52616-0_4">growth across the globe</a>, especially in <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8900/">Central America</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5406/dialjmormthou.46.3.0045">South America</a> and the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724233515?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">Pacific Islands</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the church has over <a href="https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics">17.5 million members</a>, according to church records. A majority <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/facts-statistics?lang=eng">live outside the U.S.</a>, spread across <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/01/news-of-the-church/church-growing-in-more-than-160-countries?lang=eng">more than 160 countries</a>.</p>
<p>One way the church and researchers track this global growth is <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/members/2024/06/08/charts-growth-church-jesus-christ-latter-day-saints-1830-2023-member-temples-wards-stakes/">by construction of new temples</a>. These buildings, used not for weekly worship but <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/temples">special ceremonies</a> like weddings, were once almost exclusively located in the United States. Today, they exist <a href="https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/statistics/locations/">in dozens of countries</a>, from Argentina to Tonga.</p>
<p>During Nelson’s presidency, which began in 2018, he announced <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/temples/2025/04/10/by-the-numbers-look-200-temples-announced-president-nelson-7-years/">200 new temples</a>, more than any of his predecessors. Temples are a physical and symbolic representation of the church’s commitment to being a global religion, although cultural tensions remain.</p>
<p>Among U.S. members, demographics are also shifting. Seventy-two percent of American members are white, down from 85% in 2007, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/latter-day-saint-mormon/?utm_source=Pew+Research+Center&amp;utm_campaign=74f329890a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_09_30_06_50&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-74f329890a-401090902&amp;dialogId=dialog_race-and-ethnicity&amp;activeChartId=30c34b3d90d4d76aebac7aaeb8c917d7">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/future-mormon-church-it-s-latino-n570621">Growing numbers of Latinos</a> – 12% of U.S. members – have played a significant role sustaining congregations across the country.</p>
<p>There are congregations in every U.S. state, including the small community of Grand Blanc, Michigan, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/10/03/michigan-church-shooting-victims-grand-blanc-township-lds/86498026007/">site of the tragic shooting</a>. Suspect <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/28/us/thomas-sanford-michigan-shooting-suspect">Thomas Jacob Sanford</a>, who was fatally shot by police, had gone on a recent <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/09/29/alleged-grand-blanc-attacker-thomas-sanford-said-mormons-were-the-antichrist-burton-man-kris-johns/86424379007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=false&amp;gca-epti=z115144p115550c115550u002844e001300v115144&amp;gca-ft=35&amp;gca-ds=sophi">tirade against Latter-day Saints</a> during a conversation with a local political candidate.</p>
<p>In the following days, an American member of the church raised <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/michigan-latter-day-saints-church-congregant-fundraiser-mass-shooter/">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> for Sanford’s family.</p>
<p><strong>GROWING PAINS</strong></p>
<p>Despite the church’s diversity, its institutional foundations remain <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/01/the-most-american-religion/617263/">firmly rooted</a> in the United States. The top leadership bodies are still composed almost entirely of <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/quorum-of-the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng">white men</a>, and most are American-born.</p>
<p>As the church continues to grow, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5325/jworlchri.13.1.0026">questions arise</a> about how well the norms of a Utah-based church fit the realities of members in Manila or Mexico City, Bangalore or Berlin. How much room is there, even in U.S. congregations, for local cultural expressions of faith?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2813777758?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">Latino Latter-day Saints</a> and members in Latin America, for example, have faced pushback against cultural traditions that were seen as distinctly “not LDS,” such as making altars and giving offerings during <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/what-is-dia-de-los-muertos-an-expert-explains-the-holiday-celebrating-loved-ones-who-have-died">Dia de los Muertos</a>. In 2021, the church launched a <a href="https://www.veniracristo.org/dia-de-los-muertos-2021">Spanish-language campaign</a> using Day of the Dead imagery to increase interest among Latinos. Many members were happy to see this representation. Still, some women I spoke with said that an emphasis on whiteness and American nationalism, as well as <a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/jmh/article-abstract/50/3/121/388041/Latina-Mormons-Remember-SB1070-and-Other-Anti?redirectedFrom=fulltext">anti-immigrant rhetoric</a> they’d heard from other members, deterred them from fully celebrating their cultures.</p>
<p>Even aesthetic details, like musical styles, often reflect a distinctly American model. The standardized hymnal, for example, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/collections/hymns?lang=eng">contains patriotic songs</a> like “America the Beautiful.” This emphasis on American culture can feel especially out of sync in places in countries with <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/30-countries-with-the-most-latter-day-saints">high membership rates</a> that have histories of U.S. <a href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/zoltan/wp-content/uploads/sites/358/2024/04/InterventionsList2024.pdf">military</a> or <a href="https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/04/01/understand-the-us-participation-in-the-military-coup-of-1964-in-brazil-and-what-may-still-be-revealed/">political</a> interventions.</p>
<p>Expectations about clothing and physical appearance, too, have prompted questions about representation, belonging and authority. It was only in 2024, for instance, that the church offered members in humid areas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/nx-s1-5484938/mormon-women-can-wear-new-sacred-undergarments-some-wonder-why-now">sleeveless versions</a> of the sacred garments Latter-day Saints wear under clothing as a reminder of their faith.</p>
<p>Historically, the church <a href="https://faq.churchofjesuschrist.org/can-mormons-have-tattoos">viewed tattoos as taboo</a> – a <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/great-shall-be-the-peace-of-thy-children?lang=eng">violation of the sanctity of the body</a>. Many parts of the world have thousands of years of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/in-polynesia-tattoos-are-more-than-skin-deep">sacred tattooing traditions</a> – including Oceania, which has <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/06/02/the-most-mormon-country-in-the-world-its-tonga/">high rates of church membership</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGE AHEAD?</strong></p>
<p>Among many challenges, the next president of the church will navigate how to lead a global church from its American headquarters – a church that continues to be misunderstood and stereotyped, sometimes to the point of violence.</p>
<p>The number of Latter-day Saints continues to grow in many parts of the world, but this growth brings a greater need for cultural sensitivity. The church, historically very uniform in its <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/746479054?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">efforts to standardize</a> Latter-day Saints history, art and teachings, is finding that harder to maintain when congregations span dozens of countries, languages, customs and histories.</p>
<p>Organizing the church like a corporation, with a top-down decision-making process, can also make it difficult to address <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/mormons-grapple-with-church-s-history-of-discrimination-amid-wider-racial-reckoning">painful racial histories</a> and the needs of marginalized groups, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/mormon-transgender-restrictions-lds-church-rcna167582">like LGBTQ+ members</a>.</p>
<p>The transition in leadership offers an opportunity not only for the church but for the broader public to better understand the multifaceted, global nature of Latter-day Saints’ lives today.</p>

      <h1>Samoa villagers begin talks with government on sharing Manawanui compensation fund</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>By Renate Rivers, Pacific Morning News</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa’s government recently met with Safata villagers to discuss how to disburse the ST$10 million <em>HMNZS Manawanui</em> payment from the New Zealand Government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.samoaobserver.ws/category/samoa/116498?fbclid=IwY2xjawNc5xlleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHgoo48XzeIpwDpfk7Mccm18WlqrAg6QxugzQs6IoSyqgNbmZVtb7bjEikofq_aem_bitoHGJK73lR-ziFpl20bw%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Samoa Observer</a> reports that a meeting was held on Wednesday, with representatives from the district, government officials, and members of the New Zealand government. They discussed how to allocate the funds among the affected communities.</p>
<p>The Samoa government will oversee the allocation process, which includes establishing criteria, inviting applications from potential recipients, reviewing applicants based on their impact from the ship's grounding and sinking, and distributing funds accordingly.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s representative in Samoa, Sialei Van Toor, apologized for the naval disaster, highlighting the long-standing relationship between the two countries. “We deeply regret the impact this incident had on your community. For better or worse, the <em>Manawanui</em> is now a part of our shared history.”</p>
<p>The funding plan will prioritize recovery, environmental restoration, and sustainable development. Additional programs are earmarked to clean up marine and coastal waste. The plan will also include training to improve the protection of conservation areas and support for small-scale economic initiatives such as eco-tourism ventures. No decision has been made about whether the sunken ship will be turned into a local attraction or removed entirely.</p>
<p>As reported, proposals for fund disbursement include going through the district, the government, or a consultancy service, all aimed at providing direct aid to families and communities whose livelihoods depend on tourism and fishing.</p>
<p>Last week, Finance Minister <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1478507393781097&amp;set=a.596609185304260%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Mulipola Anarosa Ale-Molioo</a> announced that Parliament will enable fund disbursement once the delayed 2025/ 2026 central budget is passed.</p>
<p>Mulipola also told local media that New Zealand has pledged an additional ST<span class="math inline">\(14million (NZ\)</span>8.8m). This money will be directed towards coral reef restoration and addressing other environmental damage caused by the grounding and sinking of the Manawanui, which is valued at $100m. A prohibition zone spanning a two-kilometer radius remains in place around the site of the sunken ship.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nzdf.mil.nz/media-centre/news/statement-on-the-marking-of-one-year-since-the-sinking-of-hmnzs-manawanui/?fbclid=IwY2xjawNdHG9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFtYW5yeWcyY3ppd1dLUzY3AR53UTCivT4piJerQkTO-UrLNXFv8keLJvQ4LNnCiWQAkfKpPc14S3tosSkenA_aem_5v-U8zzQAuumoAle0jbj_g%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Captain Roger Ward</a>, who is heading the Manawanui Response, says that “further work is required” despite efforts over the last 12 months to minimise the effects of the sinking and investigate the causes. “Fallen shipping containers have been removed. Fuel, oil, other pollutants, equipment, weapons, ammunition, and debris have been recovered, and the wreck has been made as safe as possible.”</p>
<p>The Safata meeting was held over a week after Foreign Affairs Minister Vaovasamanaia Winston Peters announced the payment on the first anniversary of the wreck. Vaovasa says the payment followed a request from the Samoan government: “We recognize the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nzdf.mil.nz/navy/navy-news/final-court-of-inquiry-into-hmnzs-manawanui-grounding-and-sinking-in-samoa-released/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Court of Inquiry</a> report released in March on the loss of the ship showed weaknesses in training, supervision, and personnel levels within the New Zealand Navy. This included a high number of missing or unqualified personnel aboard during the mission.</p>
<p>The report concluded that leadership and procedural failures led to the grounding. However, it recognised the courage and discipline shown during the evacuation, with local Samoan responders and villagers supporting the crew to prevent a greater tragedy.</p>

<p>The start of the national Grade 8 examinations in Papua New Guinea has underscored the stark logistical divide between urban and remote schools. While students in cities begin their tests with ease, educators in the country's rugged interior are enduring a perilous, multi-day trek to ensure their students get a fair chance.</p>
<p>The challenges are dramatically illustrated by the journey to Rumara Primary School in the remote Kokoda Local Level Government (LLG) of Northern (Oro) Province. Here, the national examination papers are on an arduous two-day voyage, crossing rivers and scaling steep mountains to meet the scheduled start time.</p>

<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Hundreds of patients at Samoa's main hospital, the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital in the capital, Apia, went without meals after kitchen staff failed to show up for work in protest over unpaid wages.</p>
<p>The inpatient capacity of the national hospital is around 200 beds. According to local media reports, this is the first time such an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>Dr Tito Kamu, a senior doctor at the hospital, told TV1 Samoa that the hospital chefs did not show up for work on Thursday due to 11 weeks of unpaid overtime.</p>
<p>Patients admitted across all wards and the emergency unit did not receive any breakfast, he said.</p>
<p>Dr Kamu said kitchen staff at the hospital earned around WST<span class="math inline">\(8,000 per year (approximately NZ\)</span>5000) — roughly WST<span class="math inline">\(150 (NZ\)</span>92) per week.</p>
<p>The Samoa Observer reported that private companies had stepped in to provide meals for patients.</p>
<p>&quot;By 6pm Thursday, a Ministry of Health van was seen delivering pre-packed meals to the hospital, assisted by staff members who helped unload the food,&quot; the report stated.</p>
<p>Tagaloa Dr Robert Thomsen, the country's acting director-general for health, confirmed that two catering companies had been called in to provide meals for patients, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>According to Tagaloa, the issue regarding overtime pay arose due to &quot;miscommunication&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue has been resolved, and they will return to work tomorrow,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the Samoa Observer.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> As the world watches the unfolding events in the Middle East, including the emotional reunions between the last of the Israeli hostages and their loved ones, support for the State of Israel continues to resonate in Samoa, thousands of miles away from the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, more than a thousand people from different Christian denominations, including members of Pentecostal and mainline churches, gathered in downtown Apia on Saturday, October 4, 2025, to publicly express their solidarity with Israel.</p>
<p>It was a sight to behold. Israeli flags fluttered proudly alongside Samoan flags as participants dressed in blue and white, the colors of Israel’s flag and Samoa's national colors, assembled along Beach Road, stretching from the Sheraton Hotel to the Apia Protestant Church, for the “March for Israel”. The white banner emblazoned with the blue Star of David, framed by two blue stripes, stood out prominently amid the crowd. The sound of shofars, traditional Hebrew horns, blown by participants in biblical-style attire, echoed over the rhythm of gospel music booming from large speakers, creating a powerful and emotional atmosphere of faith and unity.</p>
<p>It was a drizzly Saturday morning, and by 7am, the crowd, which had begun arriving as early as 5:30am, had swelled to more than a thousand enthusiastic marchers, all eager to show their support for Israel despite the gloomy weather.</p>
<p>Children, youth, and adults lined both sides of Beach Road, many arriving in busloads from villages as far away as Satapuala and Falelatai on the western side of Upolu. A sense of anticipation and excitement filled the air as the crowd prepared for the short march toward the Government Building on Beach Road.</p>
<p>The drizzle turned into a downpour just as the march began with the sounding of the shofar. Yet the rain did little to dampen the spirits of the marchers. Pastors and clergy, young and old alike, led the sea of blue-and-white-clad supporters who marched, sang joyfully, and waved the Samoan and Israeli flags as though it were a sun-kissed morning.</p>
<p>Led by a police vehicle escort, the procession made its way along Beach Road, circling the town clock before continuing toward the Government Building. It was a peaceful, joyful, and deeply spiritual march in support of the State and people of Israel. There were no confrontations, no violence, no angry chants or threats, just the uplifting sound of singing and praise.</p>
<p>The scene stood in stark contrast to many of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations witnessed in Europe, Australia, and the United States, where crowds have chanted slogans such as “Death to Israel,” “Free Palestine,” and “From the river to the sea.”</p>
<p>The resounding blasts of the shofar and uplifting worship music heralded the crowd’s arrival in front of the Government Building. Tents had been set up in advance, and awaiting the procession were Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo, Members of Parliament, senior government officials, and prominent church leaders and clergy.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was electric, almost festive, as drenched marchers sang, danced, and waved their flags with unrestrained joy and excitement, seemingly oblivious to the rain, which by then had mercifully eased. A short service followed, during which the crowd worshipped together, praying for God’s blessing and protection upon His chosen people as they face growing persecution.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe praised the marchers for their steadfast support of Israel, noting that their stand reflects the official position of the Government of Samoa as publicly affirmed by Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt.</p>
<p>There was thunderous cheering and applause as Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe concluded his remarks by reaffirming Prime Minister Laauli’s declaration: “Samoa stands with Israel! God bless Israel! God bless Samoa!” The proclamation captured the spirit of the gathering — a powerful expression of faith, unity, and biblical conviction.</p>
<p>Subsequent speakers echoed his sentiments, delivering strong messages of solidarity with the God of Israel — and the God of Samoa — as they quoted from Scripture and reminded the crowd of the shared spiritual bond between the two nations.</p>
<p>“I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” (Genesis 12:3)</p>
<p>This is part of God’s covenant with Abraham, often interpreted by believers as a divine promise extending to Abraham’s descendants, the people of Israel.</p>
<p>“For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.&quot; (Zechariah 2:8)</p>
<p>“To God be the glory!” declared Pastor Leota Kosi Latu, one of the organizers of the march. “We have made our statement loud and clear, and I want to thank everyone who braved the elements this morning to publicly declare our support for Israel, God’s chosen people.”</p>
<p>Pastor Leota also voiced concern about the number of Samoans who, in his view, have been misled by what he described as biased international media coverage of the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Some of our people, both here in Samoa and abroad, have become what Lenin once called ‘useful idiots’ — joining the thousands around the world taking part in pro-Palestinian protests, chanting death threats, and cursing Israel,” he said.</p>
<p>“It saddens me because they are protesting something they do not truly understand, chanting about a place they have never even seen. They call Israel’s actions ‘genocide,’ when in reality the nation is fighting to rescue its hostages and defend its very existence against hostile Arab neighbors.</p>
<p>“They curse Israel,” he added solemnly, “but they do not realize that in doing so, they bring that curse upon themselves.”</p>
<p>Pastor Leota clarified that their support for Israel is not political, but deeply spiritual.</p>
<p>“However,” he said, “we are witnessing in real time the unfolding of biblical prophecies — events the Scriptures foretold would occur in the ‘end times,’ just before the second coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>“Right now, we are beginning to see the convergence of politics and the spiritual,” he continued. “What was once considered purely political is no longer just that — it has become profoundly spiritual. Heaven and earth are on a collision course, and Samoa must prepare herself for something divine and eternal — blessings from heaven that will endure forever.”</p>

<p>Source: Earth.or</p>
<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —  July 1970. The Cold War is thawing, but far from over; the Nixon government is retreating from Vietnam in the face of an enormous anti-war movement; and a corporation called Deepsea Ventures is conducting the world’s first deep sea mining test on the Blake Plateau, 300 kilometers off the US east coast. There, the sea floor is littered with nuggets of valuable minerals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, some 60,000 of which will be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dredged up</a> from a test area spanning 43 kilometers.</p>
<p>The Deepsea Ventures test and the oil shock of 1973 heralded a <a href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/dreams-optimizing-ocean-1970-deepsea-ventures-mining-test-and-artificial-upwelling%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">flurry of investment</a> in seabed mining through the 1970s, as US <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2156&amp;context=jil%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">fears</a> about dependence on foreign sources of raw materials grew – the CIA even used one test to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77-00432R000100360006-2.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">hide an operation</a> to recover a wrecked Soviet submarine. But by the 1990s, the momentum behind the emerging industry had dissipated. Resource competition was incongruent with the post-Cold War “unipolar moment” of globalization and free trade and minerals were never extracted from the ocean floor on a commercial scale.</p>
<p>Five and a half decades later, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">damage</a> inflicted on Blake Plateau by the Deepsea Ventures test remains. While scientists are still studying the real environmental toll of deep sea mining, available research paints <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">a concerning picture</a>: the release of carbon sequestered in seabeds, permanent ecosystem disruption and fishery contamination are just <a href="https://earth.org/protecting-uncharted-ecosystems-why-we-need-a-deep-seabed-mining-moratorium/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">some of the possible costs</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with demand for critical minerals surging due to their role in <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">digital and renewable energy</a> (not to mention <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_231765.htm%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">military</a>) technologies, in April US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to restart the deep sea mining drive.</p>
<p>Wherever resource extraction might augment US power, the second Trump government seems ruthlessly committed to pursuing it – be it <a href="https://earth.org/trump-to-open-up-59-million-acres-of-national-forest-to-logging-mining/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">opening 60 million acres of national forest for logging and mining</a>, repealing <a href="https://earth.org/100-days-of-trump-how-the-us-overturned-years-of-climate-progress/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">barriers to oil drilling in the Arctic</a> or <a href="https://earth.org/trumps-signs-executive-orders-to-revive-beautiful-clean-coal-in-blow-to-us-emissions-reduction-efforts/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">reinvigorating US coal production</a>. Its determination to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“unleash”</a> deep sea mining is just another expression of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra.</p>
<p>But the geopolitical ambitions behind the move are not restricted to the Republican party. As Columbia University Professor Adam Tooze wrote in his <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“Bidenomics”</a> postmortem last year, a strategy of excluding China from key technology supply chains is now effectively bipartisan policy. In these terms, deep sea mining would be wholly consistent with Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, for instance. Just as the latter aimed to promote US economic independence from China by <a href="https://earth.org/chips-act/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">subsidizing domestic semiconductor production</a>, the Trump government presents deep sea mining as a matter of national security – of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control.”</a> Independent, in other words, of China, which currently <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dominates</a> the global critical mineral supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>The waters of a far-flung US territory in the south Pacific are emerging as a forefront in this new drive to plunder the deep.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Trump’s executive order, California-based firm Impossible Metals in April applied for a commercial mining lease in an <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/BOEM-2025-0035-0001%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">18 million-acre area</a> off the coast of American Samoa. Undaunted by the evidence of environmental risks, the company brands itself as a model of social responsibility. Its website is awash with references to sustainability, fairness and equity. Its number one “ <a href="https://impossiblemetals.com/about/mission-and-culture/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">core value</a>” is “planet comes first: environment and people before profit.” It promises to deliver “seabed harvesting without destroying the habitat.”</p>
<p>In a world where corporate <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-greenwashing/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">greenwashing</a> is rife, however, one would be forgiven for taking the firm’s claims with a pinch of salt – and the people of American Samoa, for one, are not convinced. Since making its application, Impossible Metals <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">has been on the ground</a> in the territory trying to win local support, presenting at public meetings and promising 1% of its profits to the islands.</p>
<p>But the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s call for public comments on Impossible Metals’ application attracted not only an <a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/territories-join-american-samoa-in-fight-against-deep-sea-mining/article_8e6e17b4-4df7-41c2-a3af-fd423ab5ee51.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">overwhelmingly negative response</a> but also a substantial <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">petition of opposition</a>. American Samoa’s political leadership, too, is united in rejecting deep sea mining. In 2024 then-Governor Lemanu Mauga enacted a <a href="https://www.osas.as/_files/ugd/36d1c0_3789f4f26b4f4a41bdab6e87d36a9388.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">moratorium</a> on seabed extraction in American Samoan waters, and this year, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolao Pula, who took office in January, reiterated that opposition in a <a href="https://www.americansamoa.gov/leadershipunited%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">joint-statement</a> with other key leaders.</p>
<p>American Samoans have good reasons to be circumspect of deep sea mining in their corner of the Pacific. As the American Samoa Resilience Office outlines in its <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0103%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">submission</a> on Impossible Metals’ application, the local tuna industry, which employs 5,000 people out of a total population of less than 50,000, “could be severely impacted by sediment plumes, toxins and habitat disruptions.” The material and economic risks are matched by social, cultural and spiritual ones. As another <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0104%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">submitter writes</a>, to Samoans “the ocean isn’t just a resource or commodity; it is our relative, an integral part of our culture, our provider, and our home… To threaten its health is to threaten who we are as Pasefika people.”</p>
<p>But while American Samoans’ opposition seems emphatic, what influence this might have on US government decision-making is less clear. As author Daniel Immerwahr shows in his book <em>How to Hide an Empire</em>, American Samoa and the other US territories exist in an implicitly colonial relationship with Washington. American Samoans cannot vote for President and have no Senator, and their representative in the House is excluded from voting on legislation.</p>
<p>Impossible Metals’ application must now pass a <a href="https://www.boem.gov/marine-minerals/american-samoa-activities%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">government environmental impact assessment</a> but if the Trump government proves resolute in its commitment to extraction, American Samoa may not have the power to stop it. As Immerwahr pithily puts it, “empire might be hard to make out from the mainland, but from the sites of colonial rule themselves, it’s impossible to miss.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Adam Tooze</a>, the “daunting historical significance of the [anti-China] policies that have been enacted under Biden” – and which are being extended under Trump – “is that they mark the definitive and self-conscious end of the globalizing post-Cold War moment.” It is logical, then, that this should be the moment when the prospect of deep sea mining, dormant since the end of US-Soviet competition in the late 1980s, should resurface. Before us is a new abyss of great power politics, threatening to envelop in its callous gravity both the deepest places in nature and the Indigenous people closest to them.</p>

      <h1>Teachers' union proposes 'leather belt' discipline, Fiji government emphasizes child rights</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/8124.jpeg?itok=YqpcmJoG"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/8124.jpeg?itok=o-w63ZxI" alt="students at their desks"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Fijian Teachers Association (FTA) is advocating for &quot;some form&quot; of corporal punishment to enforce discipline in primary and secondary schools, but the government says physical punishment cannot be the solution to indiscipline.</p>
<p>The association's general secretary Paula Manumanunitoga told a forum on corporal punishment in Suva this week that teachers feel threatened in the classroom and parents are not playing their part.</p>
<p>He said teachers were being sworn at, had objects thrown at them, were verbally abused, and had their hair pulled.</p>
<p>He said it is a &quot;serious matter&quot; and the FTA is worried about the country.</p>
<p>&quot;FTA is proposing that there should be some form... we would not want to call it corporal punishment. Some have gone to the extent of calling it violence,&quot; Manumanunitoga said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are suggesting that it be only with the head of school and following the strict conditions of strapping a leather belt. It would be a deterrent for students. I was a primary school teacher, if I lay a belt on my table the students would not make a noise. But when that belt disappears, there's havoc in the classroom.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the country's Education Minister Aseri Radrodro said discipline must always be guided by law, compassion, and respect for the rights and dignity of every child.</p>
<p>Under Fiji's 2013 Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which Fiji ratified in 1993, all forms of inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited.</p>
<p>Radrodro said this was what guided the Education Ministry's approach to discipline and child protection in schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Education maintains a zero-tolerance policy on abuse, neglect, exploitation and corporal punishment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our teachers must adhere to the Student Code of Conduct which promotes respect, safety and engagement and we encourage parents to take the lead as the first teachers in their homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Fiji's permanent secretary for justice and a psychologist Selina Kuruleca said when a child is struck — even lightly — the brain will register danger.</p>
<p>Citing a United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) report, Kuruleca said 81 percent of Fijian children — eight out of 10 — experience violent discipline at home.</p>
<p>She told participants at the national dialogue discipline should not break a child's spirit, it should build it.</p>
<p>A letter published in The Fiji Times on Wednesday questioned the need for such a public dialogue on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Why have a national conversation on corporal punishment when it is common knowledge that classroom behavior had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment?&quot; wrote Wise Muavono from Lautoka.</p>
<p>&quot;It is inevitable that bad classroom behavior has filtered into life outside school. The no smacking rule is turning some children into monsters.&quot;</p>
<p>Another letter writer and teacher Rajnesh Lingam wrote, &quot;Dialogue is a must as we aim to address negative behavior in children.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can't leave this unattended as it will have drastic consequences on teaching and learning in schools, communities and societies,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Unicef Pacific chief of child protection Michael Copeland told ABC Pacific Beat the discussion about how to discipline children is a &quot;difficult&quot; one.</p>
<p>Copeland said calling for a return to hitting children &quot;is a cry for help&quot;.</p>
<p>He said there were other options to discipline children instead of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>These could be school counseling, mental health services for kids who were struggling, capacity building for teachers, and parenting training, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids aren't born bad and disruptive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're coming out in particular environments [and] we've got gaps around more advanced and dedicated services, mental health services, and then alongside that, we've got families who are really struggling.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Conversation on Corporal Punishment was organized by Fiji's Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. The event brought together key voices from the judiciary, education, psychology, faith communities, and development partners.</p>

      <h1>Astronomers observe rings forming around icy celestial body Chiron</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The rings of Saturn are among the wonders of our solar system, with a diameter of roughly 175,000 miles (280,000 kilometers) as they encircle the giant planet. But smaller celestial bodies in the solar system also boast ring systems that are impressive in their own right, even if their scale is not as grand. Scientists said they have observed for the first time a ring system in the process of formation and evolution, consisting of four rings and diffuse material, surrounding a small icy body called Chiron that orbits the sun in the expanse between Saturn and Uranus. Chiron is part of a class of objects called centaurs that populate the outer solar system between Jupiter and Neptune, displaying characteristics of both asteroids and comets. Formally called “(2060) Chiron,” it has a diameter of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and takes about 50 years to complete one orbit around the sun. Centaurs are composed mainly of rock, water ice and complex organic compounds.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Tonga's health ministry has launched its long-awaited National Mental Health Strategy and Policy at Vaiola Hospital.</p>
<p>Health officials have described the move as a milestone in strengthening mental health services and coordination across Tonga.</p>
<p>The nation's head psychiatrist Dr Mapa Puloka said &quot;mental health is everyone's responsibility&quot;.</p>
<p>A national survey released earlier this year found around six percent of Tongans reported notable psychological distress, yet 96 percent of those surveyed had never accessed mental health care.</p>
<p>The study also revealed that none of those identified with depression had previously seen a mental health professional.</p>
<p>Mental health challenges in Tonga are often compounded by stigma and limited service accessibility, especially in outer islands.</p>

<p>Skyline, Honolulu’s rail system, is set to open its second segment and to celebrate, the city is offering riders free fares for one weekend.</p>
<p>The segment, which opens to the public on Thursday, Oct. 16, extends the line from East Kapolei to Middle Street, and adds four stations:</p>

<li>Kahauiki Station at the Kalihi Transit Center</li>
</ul>

<p>To celebrate the grand opening, the city is offering free rides on Skyline, TheBus, and TheHandi-Van from Saturday, Oct. 18, through Sunday, Oct. 19.</p>
<p>Riders must still tap their HOLO cards, but no fare will be deducted.</p>

<p><strong>WHO ON AI</strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization regional director for the Western Pacific says artificial intelligence can be a game-changer for long-burdened health systems — if used ethically.</p>
<p>Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala said if AI is harnessed ethically and equitably, it can help close gaps in healthcare and bring the Western Pacific region closer to universal health coverage.</p>
<p>He said its uses can include generating patient education materials in local languages and supporting overworked health staff with documentation.</p>
<p>Member states will discuss how to scale AI responsibly across health systems at the upcoming 76th WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS MARITIME JURISDICTION</strong></p>
<p>A commission has given its recommendations on the Cook Islands' submission to protect the Manihiki Plateau.</p>
<p>The Manihiki Plateau is a shield-shaped submarine geological formation located within the Cook Islands' Exclusive Economic Zone, which extends out into international waters.</p>
<p>With the Commission's recommendations received, the Cook Islands can move forward and formally define the outer limits of its continental shelf in this area, under international law.</p>
<p>The Government said in practical terms, the successful recognition of the Cook Islands' claim represents an area of approximately 350,000 square kilometres of additional seabed shelf forming part of the Cook Islands' maritime jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency is scaling back its direct lease program for survivors of the 2023 Maui wildfires, recently canceling over $2 million worth of contracts with a private company that had been managing residential units on the island.</p>
<p>At least 14 contracts with Lima Charlie, a California-based company specializing in disaster relief housing and property management, were terminated on Aug. 28. FEMA said it had secured temporary housing for all of the eligible households enrolled in its direct housing program and there were “no remaining unmet needs,” according to agency spokeswoman Nicole Timon-Shipman.</p>
<p>“As families transition out of the FEMA temporary housing program, we will continue to release the units they vacate,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>By September, FEMA had reduced the number of contracts with Lima Charlie that were associated with the direct lease program to 27, according to <a href="http://usaspending.gov/">federal data</a>. The agency had 42 contracts with the company in August and 637 over the course of the last two years.</p>
<p>FEMA has played a pivotal role in Maui’s recovery efforts since the August 2023 wildfires killed at least 102 people, <a href="https://www.mauicounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=12683&amp;ARC=17713">destroyed more than 2,200 structures</a> and displaced more than 12,000 residents. The agency has connected more than 1,300 fire-affected households with temporary housing.</p>

<p><strong>TUVALU PM PRAISES TAIWAN</strong></p>

<p>He also reaffirmed Tuvalu's appreciation for more than four decades of close partnership.</p>
<p>Teo said both Tuvalu and Taiwan face similar challenges as small island nations, including the existential threat of climate change and growing geopolitical pressures.</p>

<p><strong>TONGA ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>Prince Kalaniuvalu Fotofili is an early winner in next month's election after being confirmed as the sole candidate for his noble seat.</p>
<p>Voting day for the country's general election is set for November 20.</p>
<p>Two sets of votes take place to elect 17 People's Representatives and nine noble representatives.</p>
<p>No other candidates are seeking to represent the Niuas islands, so Prince Kalaniuvalu Fotofili returns for another four-year term as the noble representative.</p>

<p>Cancer of all types are claiming lives, however breast and cervical cancers have become the most commonly diagnosed cancers globally and the biggest killers among women in PNG.</p>

<p>The Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) has delivered a forceful blow to rival leagues, today announcing a sweeping new policy that threatens 10-year bans for any NRL player or accredited agent who negotiates with or signs for a competition not recognised by the ARLC.</p>
<p>The decisive sanctions, released following an ARLC meeting on Wednesday, October 15, 2025, come in direct response to the increasing threat posed by rebel competitions—reportedly including the emerging R360 league—which the ARLC accuses of attempting to &quot;exploit&quot; and &quot;pirate&quot; the game's talent for financial gain.</p>

The warning in the Global Tipping Points report by 160 researchers worldwide, which synthesizes groundbreaking science to estimate points of no return, comes just weeks ahead of this year’s COP30 climate summit being held at the edge of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.</p>

(date: 2025-10-12)
      <p>
      <p>Across the country, cities have taken to cracking down on people who lack housing — not by finding them places to live, but by kicking them out of the places they are seeking shelter. These mass encampment evictions owe in part to a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, that allowed cities to enforce bans on public camping even if shelters in the area are full.</p>

<p>Madang Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim has urged social media users to stop spreading unverified information, warning that false posts can harm investigations and create unnecessary fear in the community. He said social media can either strengthen or damage public trust, depending on how it’s used.</p>

<p>The people of Morobe gathered in silence yesterday as the late Governor Luther Akisawa Wenge was laid to rest in his home village of Baindoang — the final chapter in the life of one of Papua New Guinea’s most fearless and principled leaders.</p>
<p>Hundreds of mourners filled the village, their faces heavy with emotion as the casket of the former governor was carried through the crowd. Men, women, and children lined the roadside waving flowers and Lutheran flags, paying their last respects to a man whose voice once echoed across the nation’s political and legal arenas.</p>

      <h1>Samoa govt says Manawanui disaster compensation to be finalized after budget approval</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Grace Tinetali-Fiavaai, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Compensation for communities affected by the grounding of the New Zealand Navy vessel HMNZS Manawanui will be confirmed once the national budget is passed, the Samoan government says.</p>
<p>Monday marked one year since the Manawanui ran aground and sank off the south coast of Upolu.</p>
<p>On the anniversary, New Zealand announced it had responded to a request from Samoa regarding the maritime disaster, with a payment of NZ$6 million — equivalent to around 10 million Samoan talā — to compensate communities in the Safata district, whose livelihoods were affected by the vessel sinking on the Tafitoala Reef.</p>
<p>Since the sinking of the Manawanui, Samoa's Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) has been leading the local government's response and liasing with affected communities.</p>
<p>In an email responding to questions from RNZ Pacific, after New Zealand's funding announcement, MWTI chief executive Fui Tupai Mau Simanu said this work is ongoing.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is for us to meet with the community again. We are planning to have a consultation in mid-October as officials from NZ Navy want to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>He said compensation will be the main topic of discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;Process of compensation has not been decided yet but a couple of options have been suggested. One of the main items on the agenda when meeting the community is to discuss and agree on the process. Once the budget is approved the money will be available for distribution.&quot;</p>
<p>Fui also said the government is working with New Zealand to secure further funding.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government of Samoa is currently in the process of negotiating additional funds from the Government of New Zealand that will focus on the recovery and rehabilitation of the affected ecosystem.&quot;</p>
<p>The ill-fated Manawanui, a hydrographic and diving support vessel, was on deployment in Samoa as part of the security being provided for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last year.</p>
<p>King Charles' accommodation for the international event is situated on the same coastline not far from where the wreck of the Manawanui lies.</p>
<p>All crew were safely evacuated from the doomed vessel, but the incident damaged approximately 5000 square metres of coral reef and spilled around 200,000 litres of diesel into the ocean affecting coastal fishing grounds, and forcing locals to have to travel to nearby districts, such as Siumu, to fish at considerable added expense.</p>
<p>Since then elders of the affected communities have been very vocal, demanding fair compensation and insisting the Manawanui wreck be removed from their reef despite the Samoa government declaring it will remain where it lies.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters says the payment this week was in response to a direct request from the Government of Samoa.</p>
<p>&quot;We have responded to the government of Samoa's request in full and with good faith. We have always said we will do the right thing,&quot; Peters says.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognize the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.&quot;</p>
<p>Peters said New Zealand continues to work with Samoa on decisions around the ship and its future.</p>
<p>Samoa's parliament recently held its first sitting since the general election, during which the first reading of the national budget was tabled.</p>
<p>Samoan Minister for Finance Mulipola Anarosa Molioo Ale thanked the New Zealand government &quot;for this very generous donation and other help yet to come&quot;.</p>
<p>Samoa's parliament is expected to reconvene next week to continue deliberations, including passing the budget that will allocate funds for Manawanui compensation.</p>

<p><em>Radio NZ Pacific —</em> Reubenson and Martin Fugui have been boating around their island village their entire lives, but they'd never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>The cousins were on their usual morning boat run on Saturday to get supplies from a local market when they spotted it.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an object floating [in the water],&quot; Reubenson told the ABC from his village, Fourau, in Solomon Islands' Malaita province.</p>
<p>&quot;We were scared at first, because we'd never seen a vessel [like this] in our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Isolated and in deep water, they were hesitant at first to board the &quot;strange-looking&quot; boat and waited for half an hour for any sign of life before they were convinced it was safe.</p>
<p>As they got closer, they saw its engines were missing, and Reubenson, the older of the two, told Martin to climb aboard to find out what was inside.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a single cabin and it still had its steering wheel,&quot; Martin said.</p>
<p>Other than that, the engines were gone and it was just filled with empty plastic water bottles.</p>
<p>The cousins towed the strange 17m-long vessel back to their village.</p>
<p>Later, on closer inspection, they discovered internal piping for the fuel system.</p>
<p>&quot;They had written on them 'Made in Colombia, 2024,'&quot; Reubenson said.</p>
<p>They didn't know it until they later reported it to police, but they had discovered a narco sub — the third such vessel found in Solomon Islands' waters over the past year.</p>
<p>The Pacific's Growing Drug Problem</p>
<p>Narco subs are ocean-going, semi-submersible or fully-submersible vessels, often custom-built by drug cartels to transfer huge amounts of product across oceans.</p>
<p>The practice has been going on in the Americas for decades, but the newer vessels are often fully submersible in order to reduce detection by authorities' radar or sonar systems.</p>
<p>This month, the Trump administration has started its own war on similar-type boats, bombing vessels it says were filled with drugs bound for the United States.</p>
<p>But in the Pacific and Solomon Islands, these types of discoveries are new.</p>
<p>Last year, a local doctor found the first narco sub in the region near Solomon Islands' isolated Ontong Java Atoll, and has now turned the 25m-long vessel into his personal boat.</p>
<p>Local investigative team In-depth Solomons reported that an Ecuadorian voter ID card was found on board.</p>
<p>And in July, the second narco sub, this one 21m long, was discovered floating in the ocean by a local MP near Ramos Island, which is about 75km north-west of the latest discovery.</p>
<p>All three of the vessels found in Solomon Islands had no drugs on board, with experts saying the vessels are often abandoned after a successful mission.</p>
<p>Local Police say they are investigating all three, and it is unclear whether these vessels drifted the 10,000km from South America, or they transferred the drugs closer to Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>But the discoveries come as the Pacific grapples with a growing drug problem, with a string of recent busts highlighting how cartels are increasingly using the sparse and largely un-policed Pacific Islands as a transit point onto the more lucrative Australian and New Zealand markets — what experts call the &quot;cash cows&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;[These discoveries] definitely show a new trend being used by trans-criminal syndicates in South America and Mexico, to traffic drugs to Australia and New Zealand, the 'cash cows' in the region,&quot; transnational crime expert Jose Sousa-Santos told RNZ.</p>
<p>&quot;These vessels operate through the Pacific Islands or from island to island from a drop-off mothership to, say, the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>&quot;Then a LPV (narco sub) is used to move to another island country to refuel, before moving towards the target markets of Australia and New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>'Power Drug' Hits Solomon Islands</p>
<p>The drug importation issue has become a new and increasing problem in the Pacific Islands, hitting communities in Tonga, Fiji, Samoa and PNG.</p>
<p>Fiji, in particular, is grappling with a spike in HIV on the back of increased meth use in the country, with users sharing needles in what's known as “bluetoothing”.</p>
<p>But in Solomon Islands, it is so new that authorities don't even have legislation to prohibit possession of methamphetamine, which locals are calling &quot;the power drug&quot;.</p>
<p>And local police say the discovery is beyond the current capabilities of law enforcement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele told local media this week that the government was working urgently to address the legal gaps, aiming to modernize outdated laws to ensure stronger measures against those in the production and distribution of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;As we speak the attorney general's chambers, together with other stakeholders including the police, are looking at these gaps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our priority, and we want to quickly bring the necessary amendments to parliament — hopefully by the end of this year, or if not, during the first session next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Local lawyer and prosecutor Steward Tonowane said the discoveries of the narco subs and the lack of legislation in Solomon Islands were a &quot;serious concern&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Reminds me of the saying: when there's smoke, there's fire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be a deliberate orchestrated operation that is happening.</p>
<p>&quot;And we must make amendments and prepare ourselves [so] that we may be able to attend to this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Back in Fourau village, the narco sub has become a major talking point in the community, with everyone in the community coming to check it out.</p>
<p>Yet, local police have warned &quot;the good citizens of Solomon Islands&quot; to call police first in such encounters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is for the police to come and properly check to make sure the boat is safe,&quot; the police told the ABC in a statement.</p>
<p>But for Reubenson, now that the narco sub has been abandoned, it's a matter of finders keepers.</p>
<p>&quot;If I find this thing that no one owns, then obviously it means I'm the new owner.&quot;</p>

<p>The PNG Prime Minister’s XIII will debut Gairo Voro at five-eighth this Sunday, a selection made after veteran Kyle Laybutt was unexpectedly ruled unavailable for his planned farewell match.

<p>Kumuls coach Jason Demetriou confirmed the key change in the spine, noting that the desire for a victory, coupled with the need for preparation ahead of the Rugby League World Cup, has shaped the squad.</p>

<p>The Papua New Guinea Prime Minister's XIII Squad have named a robust 18-man squad for Sunday’s Prime Minister’s XIII match against Australia, with coach Jason Demetriou confirming the selection strategy is primarily focused on World Cup preparation and compensating for a lack of tier-one international fixtures this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason we've picked a stronger side this year for the PM's XIII is that last year we got an opportunity to play against a Tier 1 country [Australia] to lead us into the World Cup and get some experience.</p>

<p>The Papua New Guinea NRL Academy is making a decisive move to accelerate the development of local rugby league talent by significantly increasing its training intensity and expanding its geographical reach. PNG NRL Academy Coaching and Pathways Manager Joe Grima confirm these strategic changes are designed to rapidly close the development gap with nations like Australia and New Zealand ahead of PNG's confirmed NRL entry in 2028.</p>
<p>Under the unified &quot;one house policy,&quot; the NRL franchise, the PNGRFL, and the Hunters have synchronised their development efforts. The academy program, which previously ran for only eight weeks, has been fundamentally restructured.</p>

      <h1>Samoa's longest-serving leader reflects on his political career</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Grace Tinetali-Fiavaai, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's longest-serving leader Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi says his time in parliament is drawing to a close after more than four decades in politics.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my last term, to the end of this term, not necessarily the leadership, but to continue,&quot; he told RNZ Pacific.</p>
<p>A former pupil of St Paul's College in Auckland, Tuilaepa went on to earn a Master's degree in Commerce from the University of Auckland before returning to Samoa to begin his career in government.</p>
<p>He first entered parliament in 1981, representing Lepā and rose through the ranks of the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) becoming prime minister in 1998, a role he held for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>The 80-year-old, who has now lost two consecutive elections at the helm of the HRPP, said he only stayed on to ensure the party continued to enjoy the benefit of his own contribution.</p>
<p>&quot;I have reached that stage where, really, I should retire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa's tenure as prime minister of Samoa from 1998 to 2021 makes him the Pacific's longest-serving democratic leader.</p>
<p>Other Pacific leaders with over a decade in power include the late Sir Michael Somare of Papua New Guinea, Fiji's Frank Bainimarama and the late Albert Henry of the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his political career, Tuilaepa acknowledged both the achievements and the challenges.</p>
<p>Asked about the highlights, he said there were &quot;so many of them&quot; from the delivery of long-term infrastructure projects to introducing policies and legislation to improve gender equality in Samoa.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many other things that we did, like, for instance, lowering the cost of family events, we normally require goods like tinned fish and reduce the sizes from 48 to now about eight, reducing the cost of faalavelave.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't just give one highlight because there were so many of them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>During his tenure Tuilaepa also oversaw some significant changes which drew international attention, including switching the side of the road Samoans drive on from right to left, changing Samoa's timezone to better align with key trading partners in Australia and New Zealand and Samoa's transition to a parliamentary republic in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;Others were the building of high-rise buildings through assistance from our partners.</p>
<p>&quot;As well as the promotion of gender equality, not only through issues relating to the support for women issues in the rite nations, but also passing laws to ensure that not less that's the 10 percent or six women to enter Parliament,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa also spoke about his efforts to improve education, culture and social development in Samoa.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many on top of that; promoting the replating of our fine matts to the perfection that it was in the olden days, not the rubbish that we used to have, as well as education, the setting up of our own university, as well as for government to meet school fees for children in [primary schools]. We also moved to begin from next year, if we were elected, paying for university education fees, as well as paying for the teachers for private schools.&quot;</p>
<p>The HRPP's decades-long hold on power ended in a narrow defeat at the hands of the FAST Party in the 2021 general election.</p>
<p>In 2020, a year before that election, Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Fosi Schmidt, Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Leatinuu Wayne Fong, Olo Vaai fell out with Tuilaepa after breaking ranks to vote against three controversial government bills the Judicature Bill 2020, Lands and Titles Bill 2020, and the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020.</p>
<p>One-by-one each of them left HRPP with Laaulialemalietoa, whose constituency advised him to leave the party, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/417909/former-cabinet-minister-quits-samoa-s-ruling-party">resigning first</a> and announcing he would be forming a new political party in the 2021 election.</p>
<p>Thus the FAST party came into being, consolidating with two existing opposition parties, and one by one all of the other three former HRPP members joined, with Fiame <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/425809/samoa-s-deputy-prime-minister-quits-cabinet-over-controversial-bills">who was deputy prime minister at the time</a> being the last to do so.</p>
<p>From there, FAST went on to win an historic first election with Fiame becoming prime minister.</p>
<p>A split in the party resulted in Fiame's government collapsing with a year still to go in her tenure but the FAST party emerged from the ensuing early election with an even bigger mandate to lead than in 2021 with Laaulialemalietoa now prime minister of Samoa.</p>
<p>When asked about the lowest point in his political career Tuilaepa said there was only the one.</p>
<p>&quot;Losing an election, not so much that I lost the leadership as well, but more for the people that depend so much on us to ensure that we inject the rule of law, that we follow the rule of law and good covenant principles of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>&quot;As it is now we don't have that anymore, &quot; Tuilaepa said.</p>

<p>The 52 duly elected Ward Councillors of Kerowagi District have publicly lodged a formal complaint against the Kerowagi District Development Authority (KDDA), expressing collective &quot;concern and disappointment&quot; over the total lack of financial support for the recent 50th Golden Jubilee of Papua New Guinea's Independence celebrations.</p>
<p>In a strongly worded letter dated September 17, 2025, addressed to KDDA District Administrator Mr Philip Bomal, the councillors claimed that the National Executive Council (NEC) had allocated a substantial K1 million to every district, including Kerowagi under the leadership of its member Francis Kikin Siune and across the nation specifically for the Golden Jubilee.</p>

      <p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar interloper currently zipping through our solar system, cannot easily be observed from Earth right now, because it is on the other side of the solar system. The sun is not directly blocking the view, but trying to make out a dim comet within the daytime glare is nigh impossible.</p>

      <p>FEMALE TURTLE RESCUED</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — French authorities in New Caledonia are investigating after a sea turtle was found tied to a tree.</p>
<p>The female turtle, about 25-30 years-old, was bound in rope in the Koutio mangrove swamp in Dumbéa and rescued on 14 September.</p>
<p>An Aquarium des Lagons spokesperson said she had deep cuts on her right swim leg from being tied up.</p>
<p>Despite this, she is doing well and is now under the care of the aquarium in Noumea.</p>
<p>If she keeps improving, she could be released in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Head of the Aquariology and Maintenance Department at the Aquarium des Lagons told local media that the loggerhead turtle is a protected species, along with the green turtle and the hawksbill turtle.</p>
<p>Unlike the green turtle, it is not eaten locally.</p>
<p>Sylvain Govan said there is no doubt that this is &quot;poaching&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the person who grabbed it and tied it up there, had an idea in the back of his head. Either eat it or sell it to make money,&quot; she told Nouvelle-Calédonie La Première.</p>

<p><strong>DEFENSE AGREEMENT</strong></p>
<p>A newly signed defense agreement between the governments of Fiji and Solomon Islands will allow Fijian troops into Honiara during national emergencies.</p>
<p>This includes general elections, natural disasters and other national emergencies.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed on September 9, and announced by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka at Fiji's parliament last week.</p>
<p>Rabuka has promised to operate on non-political, non-interventionist terms.</p>
<p>(RNZ Pacific)</p>
<p><strong>ONLINE SCAMS</strong></p>
<p>The Consumer Council of Fiji is raising alarm bells that the level of sophistication and complexity of online scams is increasing.</p>
<p>It said the level of awareness is not matching the pace at which it gets more complex.</p>
<p>The Council's Ziyad Parvez told fijivillage.com that fraudsters are not above using the latest technology to execute the scams.</p>
<p>He said in one incident, a person working on a private island transferred about FJ$7000 to an account that seemed to be in Papua New Guinea, but it was actually someone from Fiji using a scrambling technology.</p>

<p><strong>MAN JAILED FOR RAPING DAUGHTER</strong></p>
<p>A man in Samoa was sentenced last week to 17 years' imprisonment after he was convicted of seven incidents of sexual violation by way of rape and one representative charge of five incidents of incest.</p>
<p>The victim is the accused's biological daughter.</p>
<p>The accused, through his counsel, accepted the amended summary of facts dated 21 August 2025.</p>
<p>The accused's sexual abuse of his daughter began sometime between April 01 and May 31, 2021 following the general elections. The victim was 12 years old.</p>
<p>The accused’s sexual abuse of his daughter came to light when an aunt of the victim went to the home to visit the victim and her siblings and found the accused sleeping with the victim “like a couple”. The victim became pregnant but miscarried after a few months.</p>
<p>During sentencing, Justice Leiataualesa Darryl Clarke told the defendant that he was supposed to protect the victim from harm as her biological father.</p>
<p>&quot;No words can ever sufficiently condemn what you did to your daughter. You were duty-bound to protect her from harm, yet you were the perpetrator of the greatest betrayal any daughter could suffer: sexual abuse by her own father.&quot;</p>
<p>(Samoa Observer)</p>
<p><strong>BAN ON IMPORTED SCHOOL FOODS</strong></p>
<p>Vanuatu's livestock and biosecurity minister says he is working on a policy to ban consumption of imported food in schools.</p>
<p>The Vanuatu Daily Post reports Ian Wilson telling the National Commercial Commodity Forum that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for over 70 per cent of all deaths every year in the country.</p>
<p>He said the report shows that unhealthy diets at schools are contributing to the growing NCDs, as children are eating a lot of rice, biscuits, bread, tinned fish, and noodles at schools.</p>
<p>Wilson said a policy banning consumption of imported food, and allocating funds to help schools purchase local food, will create greater demand for local crops.</p>

<p><strong>GUAM BANS MANGO IMPORTS</strong></p>
<p>Guam has temporarily banned mango imports from the Northern Marianas, after an invasive insect was discovered on Saipan.</p>
<p>Researchers confirmed the mango fruit borer at the CNMI's Division of Agriculture compound in Kagman.</p>
<p>Kuam News reports Division of Agriculture director Jack Ogumoro saying the discovery was made earlier this year when visiting scientists sampled infected mangoes.</p>
<p>Invasive species coordinator Natasha Tomakane says the ban is a precautionary measure to protect regional agriculture.</p>
<p>(RNZ Pacific)</p>
<p><strong>PNG SHORTWAVE</strong></p>
<p>The head of Papua New Guinea's national broadcaster is looking for ways to bolster the station's radio broadcast capability.</p>
<p>Kora Nou has been in Aotearoa inspecting Radio New Zealand Pacific's shortwave service.</p>
<p>It broadcasts right across the Pacific, providing lifeline utility support on request when natural disasters strike.</p>
<p>Nou said with a government mandate to have full coverage across PNG, he's looking for the right solution.</p>
<p>&quot;So the shortwave we want to build won't be analogue shortwave but we are thinking of digital shortwave,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of work to be done still but we are happy to come here to New Zealand to work with our friends here, and whatever we decide to build it will be for the good of the staff at NBC and for the good of the people of Papua New Guinea.&quot;</p>
<p>NBC's own shortwave service closed more than 20 years ago.</p>

      <h1>US unemployment claims rise moderately amid labor market freeze</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased marginally during the last week of September, data from Haver Analytics showed, pointing to a still-low level of layoffs even as hiring has stalled. The labor market has stagnated with businesses not firing employees on a large scale, but also reluctant to hire more workers. Economists have blamed the labor market paralysis on President Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies as well as the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, which have combined to reduce demand and labor supply. A U.S. government shutdown, now in its sixth day, has resulted in the suspension of official data collection and publication, complicating decision-making for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, investors and households.</p>

<p>A visit by the Indonesian Ambassador to PNG, His Excellency Andriana Supandy, has solidified a new strategic educational partnership aimed at bolstering the sustainability and long-term growth of Papua New Guinea’s oil palm industry in West New Britain.</p>
<p>Recognising WNB as PNG’s largest oil palm producer and Indonesia as the world’s second-largest, the two nations are integrating education directly with industry development. The core of this collaboration is the Indonesia Bahasa Zoom Training Program, officially launched at Buvussi Junior High School, which will position the Indonesian language as a key tool for future leaders in PNG’s newly established Ministry of Oil Palm Industry.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Giles Dexter, RNZ Political Reporter</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa government has paid $6 million in compensation to Samoa, to mark one year since the grounding and sinking of HMNZS Manawanui.</p>
<p>On 6 October, 2024, the vessel <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/529979/hmnzs-manawanui-what-we-know-about-the-ship-s-sinking">ran aground on a reef off the South Coast of Upolu, and then sank</a>.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the payment - worth 10 million Samoan tālā - followed a request from the Samoan government, and was made in full and in good faith.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said we will do the right thing,&quot; Peters said. &quot;We recognise the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.&quot;</p>
<p>Village elders told RNZ Pacific the once-rich fishing grounds have been destroyed, and they <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/574033/samoa-village-elders-still-seeking-compensation-want-manawanui-wreck-removed">want the wreck removed</a>.</p>
<p>Peters said the two governments continued to work together on decisions around the ship and its future, with the priorities being minimising any possible environmental impacts and supporting the response.</p>
<p>Results of an inquiry released in April found the ship's crew <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/557180/crew-on-manawanui-during-sinking-were-under-trained-ship-not-up-to-task-report">was undertrained and the vessel was not up to the task</a>.</p>
<p>All 75 passengers and crew survived. An investigation into whether there will be any disciplinary proceedings was in its closing stages.</p>
<p>Captain Rodger Ward, lead of the HMNZS Manawanui response, said much work had been carried out in the past 12 months to minimise the effects of the sinking and investigate the causes.</p>
<p>He said fallen shipping containers had been removed, and fuel, pollutants, weapons, ammunition and debris had been recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;Further work is required. That work includes progressing an independent wreck assessment together with environmental studies. This information will be essential in supporting decisions about the future work required,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The priority remains, as it has been throughout, to minimise any environmental impacts of the sinking, and to support the government of Samoa in its response.&quot;</p>
<p>Reflecting on one year since the sinking, Ward said the Defence Force remained eternally grateful no lives were lost, and also recognised the impact the sinking has had on the people of Samoa.</p>

<p>Christina Persico, RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa has recorded more than 14,000 clinically diagnosed dengue cases since January, and its seventh death from the disease.</p>
<p>The latest report, released on September 29, covers the week of September 22- 28.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health said for that period, cases were down 26 percent compared to the previous epidemiological week, with 378 clinically diagnosed dengue cases reported from all health facilities in Upolu and Savai'i.</p>
<p>There have been seven confirmed dengue-related deaths in Samoa.</p>
<p>Seventy-four percent of all cases were reported from Upolu island.</p>
<p>American Samoa's Department of Health said there are 212 confirmed cases of dengue fever in the territory. No deaths are reported.</p>
<p>This figure is as of Monday, Sept. 29.</p>
<p>The local health department said most cases have recovered.</p>
<p>Cases continue to develop in other parts of the Pacific — the UN's ReliefWeb site showed Kiribati has reported 487 confirmed cases, as of 23 September, and another 1416 suspected, as well as one death.</p>
<p>As of Sept. 28, Tuvalu reported 690 suspected cases were tested, with 213 confirmed positive.</p>
<p>The dengue cases are widely distributed along Fongafale and two outer islands, Nanumaga (eight cases) and Nukufetau (10 cases).</p>
<p>There's better news in the Cook Islands, with Secretary of Health Bob Williams saying he believes <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/574847/dengue-nearly-eliminated-as-cases-drop-to-one-in-rarotonga">there was only one case for the last two weeks and none in the outer islands</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;I think with the responses and the clean-ups, the Tutaka programs, I think we are, hopefully, close to eliminating dengue here in Rarotonga,&quot; he said.</p>

      <p>Today’s state of extreme economic inequality is a problem best approached with science — using it to make specific measurements, identify root causes, and develop workable solutions. Archaeology is revealing a broad picture that spans thousands of years of prehistory, challenging some of the pervasive biases about the inevitability of inequality as people form larger communities or advance technologically.</p>

<p>(AP) — Matthew McConaughey playing the real-life bus driver who saved elementary school students during California’s deadliest wildfire are some of the new television, films, music and games <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/the-stream/">headed to a device</a> near you.</p>
<p>Also among the streaming offerings worth your time this week, as selected by The Associated Press’ <a href="https://apnews.com/entertainment">entertainment journalists</a>: The classic children’s story “Charlotte’s Web” by E.B. White turned into an animated series for HBO Max, the documentary “Prime Minister” chronicling the five-year tenure of former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern and some katana-swinging mayhem with the video game Ghost of Yotei.</p>
<p><strong>NEW MOVIES TO STREAM FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— Matthew McConaughey plays the real bus driver who drove 22 elementary school students to safety during 2018’s Camp Fire that engulfed Paradise, California, in the new film “The Lost Bus,” streaming Friday, Oct. 3 on Apple TV+. America Ferrera co-stars as the teacher who went along for the ride, expecting it to be a straightforward drop off at a nearby school. Paul Greengrass directed the film like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/movie-review-lost-bus-18471922ec0515e5e6382b2703e9d720">an old-fashioned disaster movie</a>, I wrote in my review, adding, “it’s impossible to take your eyes off the screen, away from the inferno and the sense of our own smallness and helplessness to ‘battle it.’”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-9632a46e5fb6292b8f903541d6d07660">Cillian Murphy</a> is the headmaster of a reform school in “Steve,” a taut drama about mental health and a broken education system. The film, which hits Netflix on Friday, Oct. 3, is based on Max Porter’s novella “Shy.” “Steve” was directed by Belgian filmmaker Tim Mielants who also directed Murphy in the terrific Claire Keegan adaptation <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cillian-murphy-film-small-things-like-these-842460b018a2c7f37533e2ed088a3f56">“Small Things Like These,”</a> (currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+) which focused on the Magdalene laundries in Ireland. Together they could make for a moving double feature.</p>
<p>— The new documentary “Prime Minister,” streaming on HBO Max on Tuesday, chronicles the five-year tenure of former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern. <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-9387e2bf316b41f5906769cc35bcd340">Just 37 when she took over</a>, and only the second elected world leader to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3c31aac929664754862c4ddd516766de">give birth while holding office</a>, Ardern was praised around the world for her handling of the nation’s worst-ever mass shooting and the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. But she faced mounting political pressures at home and a level of vitriol from some that hadn’t been experienced by previous New Zealand leaders. In 2023, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-new-zealand-government-covid-jacinda-ardern-0e6d8eedd96f94aab07eeb0c37164591">she shocked the world</a> with her announcement that she was stepping down.</p>
<p><strong>NEW MUSIC TO STREAM FROM SEPT. 29- OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— It’s her, hi: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> returns with her highly anticipated 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” out Friday, Oct. 3. The record was completed in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback during the Eras Tour and while details of the album have been limited, Swift did appear on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-new-heights-podcast-e26d4150cd1fa7bf7cea189e48237663">the “New Heights” podcast</a> in August to tease it. Swift promised infectious melodies and vivid lyrics across “The Life of a Showgirl,” an album that will be much more “upbeat” than 2024’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-review-b24d2275df5cf78ffa9069c61b9825ec">“The Tortured Poets Department.”</a></p>
<p>— If cheery-sounding post-punk (or “egg punk” for the very online crowd) is an interest area, look no further than Nashville’s Snooper, a good-time group known for their ebullient live performances and penchant of paper mâché puppetry. Their latest release, “Worldwide,” arrives via <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/jack-white">Jack White’s</a> Third Man Records on Friday, Oct. 3. It’s 12 tracks of catchy fun.</p>
<p><strong>NEW SERIES TO STREAM FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— Superman only had to put on a pair of glasses to disguise himself as Clark Kent but in the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idtWZdPIQhI%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Hulu series “Chad Powers,”</a> Glen Powell wears prosthetics and a wig to masquerade himself — all in the name of football. Powell plays Russ Holliday, a college football quarterback at the top of his game, until he makes an embarrassing mistake that ruins his career. Instead of giving up, Holliday decides to transform himself into an alter ego named Chad Powers, who is a walk-on player at a different school. The show is based on a character created by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nfl-sports-football-ccd23299d289c063eff6bf150aec49f5">Eli Manning for his 2022 ESPN docuseries “Eli’s Places,”</a> where he changed his look to take part in walk-on tryouts at Penn State. It streams beginning Tuesday.</p>
<p>— The classic children’s story <a href="https://apnews.com/ab072d33571b41db8c9cbb078e8901b2">“Charlotte’s Web” by E.B. White</a> is now an animated series for HBO Max. All three episodes drop Friday, Oct. 3. The show’s voice cast includes Amy Adams as Charlotte, Elijah Wood as adult Wilbur, Cynthia Erivo as goose and Jean Smart as the narrator.</p>
<p>— Charlie Hunnam also transforms himself for Netflix’s true crime dramatization called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8FeHSoTHs8%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“Monster: The Ed Gein Story.”</a> Hunnam plays Gein, a convicted murderer and suspected serial killer from the 1950s. Cocreated by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, the “Monster” anthologies tend to illustrate the impact of true crime on pop culture. In this “Monster,” Tom Hollander plays <a href="https://apnews.com/arts-and-entertainment-a2fc34c2afb44087bb77a7dfe2f06b9a">Alfred Hitchcock,</a> whose movie “Psycho” was inspired by Gein. Olivia Williams and Laurie Metcalf also star. It debuts Friday, Oct. 3.</p>
<p>— PBS has two interesting offers for the weekend. On Friday, Oct. 3 it will air “Great Performances: The Magic of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/grace-bumbry-mezzosoprano-57440bbfa65ebafffa5c302f808199cf">Grace Bumbry</a> ” about the real-life opera singer from Missouri who made history as the first Black mezzo-soprano to perform at Germany’s Bayreuth Festival. It also shows her impact on musicians today <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/beyonces-relationship-to-grace-bumbry-gldsal/17197/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">including Beyoncé, who is mentioned in the doc.</a> It premieres on Friday, Oct. 3 on PBS and streams on pbs.org and the PBS App.</p>
<p>— On Sunday, Oct. 5, we’re introduced to Jules Maigret, a detective created by author Georges Simenon. His first Maigret novel was published in 1931 but a new PBS Masterpiece series about the investigator takes place in modern day. Benjamin Wainwright stars as the titular character who — along with his team — use unorthodox methods to solve crimes. “Maigret” will also will be available on pbs.org and the PBS App.</p>
<p>— The second season of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JUNabjeYlw%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">biblical drama “House of David”</a> premieres Sunday, Oct. 5. Available with a Wonder Project subscription on Prime Video, the show details the rise of David, a biblical figure who became the most celebrated king of Israel.</p>

<p><strong>NEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— Atsu, the protagonist of <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Ghost of Yotei</a>, was just a girl when the renegade Lord Saito killed the rest of her family. Sixteen years later, she’s returned to northern Japan to exact vengeance against Saito and his minions. She’s learned some mad samurai skills in the meantime, so expect plenty of katana-swinging mayhem. This new adventure from Sony’s Sucker Punch studio is the follow-up to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, and it builds on that game’s sprawling scope and lush graphics while blending 1600s history with Japanese folklore. Atsu’s mission begins Thursday on PlayStation 5.</p>

      <h1>Jane Goodall, the gentle disrupter whose research on chimpanzees redefined what it meant to be human</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Mireya Mayor, Florida International University</p>
<p>For The Conversation</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — An</em> yone proposing to offer a master class on changing the world for the better, without becoming negative, cynical, angry or narrow-minded in the process, could model their advice on the life and work of pioneering animal behavior scholar <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jane-Goodall">Jane Goodall</a>.</p>
<p>Goodall’s life journey stretches from marveling at the somewhat unremarkable creatures – though she would never call them that – in her English backyard as a wide-eyed little girl in the 1930s to challenging the very definition of what it means to be human through her <a href="https://janegoodall.ca/what-we-do/africa-programs/gombe-stream-research-centre/">research on chimpanzees in Tanzania</a>. From there, she went on to become a global icon and a <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/06/jane-goodall/">United Nations Messenger of Peace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/jane-goodall-obit-78698397851bc7634717206f7eba07b2">Until her death on Oct. 1, 2025 at age 91</a>, Goodall retained a charm, open-mindedness, optimism and wide-eyed wonder that are more typical of children. I know this because I have been fortunate to spend time with her and to share insights from <a href="https://www.mireyamayor.com/">my own scientific career</a>. To the public, she was a world-renowned scientist and icon. To me, she was Jane – my inspiring mentor and friend.</p>
<p>Despite the massive changes Goodall wrought in the world of science, <a href="https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/nat16.sci.lisci.goodall/how-jane-goodall-changed-the-study-of-animal-behavior/">upending the study of animal behavior</a>, she was always cheerful, encouraging and inspiring. I think of her as a gentle disrupter. One of her greatest gifts was her ability to make everyone, at any age, feel that they have the power to change the world.</p>
<p><strong>DISCOVERING TOOL USE IN ANIMALS</strong></p>
<p>In her pioneering studies in the lush rainforest of Tanzania’s Gombe Stream Game Reserve, <a href="https://www.tanzaniaparks.go.tz/national_parks/gombe-national-park">now a national park</a>, Goodall noted that the most successful chimp leaders were gentle, caring and familial. Males that tried to rule by asserting their dominance through violence, tyranny and threat <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2016/11/02/gombe-gets-new-alpha-fall-ferdinand/">did not last</a>.</p>
<p>I also am <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mireya-I-Mayor-78099910">a primatologist</a>, and Goodall’s groundbreaking observations of chimpanzees at Gombe were part of my preliminary studies. She famously recorded chimps taking long pieces of grass and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/2011264a0">inserting them into termite nests</a> to “fish” for the insects to eat, something no one else had previously observed.</p>
<p>It was the first time an animal had been seen using a tool, a discovery that altered how scientists differentiated between humanity and the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Renowned anthropologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Leakey">Louis Leakey</a> chose Goodall to do this work precisely because she was not formally trained. When she turned up in Leakey’s office in Tanzania in 1957, at age 23, Leakey initially hired her as his secretary, but he soon spotted her potential and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees-jane-goodalls-story/1911/">encouraged her to study chimpanzees</a>. Leakey wanted someone with a completely open mind, something he believed most scientists lost over the course of their formal training.</p>
<p>Because chimps are humans’ closest living relatives, Leakey hoped that understanding the animals would <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/">provide insights into early humans</a>. In a predominantly male field, he also thought a woman would be more patient and insightful than a male observer. He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>Six months in, when Goodall wrote up her observations of chimps using tools, Leakey wrote, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine Man, or <a href="https://nhm.org/stories/chimpanzees-redefining-what-it-means-be-human">accept chimpanzees as human</a>.”</p>
<p>Goodall spoke of animals as having emotions and cultures, and in the case of chimps, communities that were almost tribal. She also named the chimps she observed, an unheard-of practice at the time, <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/">garnering ridicule from scientists</a> who had traditionally numbered their research subjects.</p>
<p>One of her most remarkable observations became known as the <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/a-brief-history-of-the-gombe-chimpanzee-war">Gombe Chimp War</a>. It was a four-year-long conflict in which eight adult males from one community killed all six males of another community, taking over their territory, only to lose it to another, bigger community <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2018/07/10/top-bottom-chimpanzee-social-hierarchy-amazing/">with even more males</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENCE IN HER PATH</strong></p>
<p>Goodall was persuasive, powerful and determined, and she often advised me not to succumb to people’s criticisms. Her path to groundbreaking discoveries did not involve stepping on people or elbowing competitors aside.</p>
<p>Rather, her journey to Africa was motivated by her wonder, her love of animals and a powerful imagination. As a little girl, she was entranced by Edgar Rice Burroughs’ 1912 story “ <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/78">Tarzan of the Apes</a>,” and she loved to joke that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cS3BA0GwWM">Tarzan married the wrong Jane</a>.</p>
<p>When I was a 23-year-old <a href="https://usasciencefestival.org/people/dr-mireya-mayor/">former NFL cheerleader</a>, with no scientific background at that time, and looked at Goodall’s work, I imagined that I, too, could be like her. In large part because of her, I became a primatologist, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10764-006-9036-1">co-discovered a new species of lemur in Madagascar</a> and have had an amazing life and career, in science and on TV, as <a href="https://explorer-directory.nationalgeographic.org/mireya-mayor">a National Geographic explorer</a>.</p>
<p>When it came time to write <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/644663116?oclcNum=644663116">my own story</a>, I asked Goodall to contribute the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>STORYTELLER AND TEACHER</strong></p>
<p>Goodall was an incredible storyteller and saw it as the most successful way to help people understand the true nature of animals. With compelling imagery, she shared extraordinary stories about the intelligence of animals, from apes and dolphins to rats and birds, and, of course, the octopus. She inspired me to become a wildlife correspondent for National Geographic so that I could share the stories and plights of endangered animals around the world.</p>
<p>Goodall inspired and advised world leaders, celebrities, scientists and conservationists. She also touched the lives of millions of children.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="https://janegoodall.org/">Jane Goodall Institute</a>, which works to engage people around the world in conservation, she launched <a href="https://janegoodall.org/our-work/our-approach/roots-shoots/">Roots &amp; Shoots</a>, a global youth program that operates in more than 60 countries. The program teaches children about connections between people, animals and the environment, and ways to <a href="https://rootsandshoots.org/our-model/">engage locally to help all three</a>.</p>
<p>Along with Goodall’s warmth, friendship and wonderful stories, I treasure this comment from her: “The greatest danger to our future is our apathy. Each one of us must take responsibility for our own lives, and above all, show respect and love for living things around us, especially each other.”</p>
<p>It’s a radical notion from a one-of-a-kind scientist.</p>

      <h1>Pacific economies will grow in 2025, but turbulence likely ahead</h1>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/adb.png?itok=ggy3pZ2-"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/adb.png?itok=H1QO8-Fx" alt="ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>Kaya Selby, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is offering a sunny outlook on the Pacific economy, but with clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>In its latest forecasts, the Bank puts economic growth at 4.1 percent regionwide, while projecting a dip in inflation.</p>
<p>But the region is expected to slow to 3.4 percent growth in 2026, as the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/565605/what-does-the-us-remittance-tax-mean-for-the-pacific">United States tariffs</a> begin to set in and revenue from tourism, fisheries and other important sectors take a hit.</p>
<p>ADB's lead economist for the Pacific region Aminur Rahman told Pacific Waves the region stands out from the rest of the world for its bump in growth this year.</p>
<p>He said unlike much of the developing world, the Pacific is relatively less reliant on US trade, dampening any direct pressure from the tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect the direct effects of the tariff would be that prominent... but we tend to factor in that because of the tariff on some of the major trading partners of the Pacific countries, there may be indirect effects related to tourism in particular.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If because of the tariff, the growth slows down in some of the countries that are the providers of tourism for the Pacific, the effect could boil down through that channel of indirect effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Rahman said island nations are expected to largely sidestep the US's one percent tax on remittances. Fiji, for example, is seeing remittances increase by 11.5 percent to F$692.6 million in the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that effect also to be quite negligible, because the main destinations where Pacific labor goes are Australia and New Zealand, and obviously, the North Pacific countries have free access to the US.&quot;</p>
<p>It's an upward revision from ADB's April forecasts for 2025, which projected a flatter growth rate of 3.9 percent.</p>
<p>Rahman said this more optimistic forecast can be put down to record mineral and resource output from Papua New Guinea, propping up an otherwise subdued winter economy.</p>
<p>According to the report, PNG's economy is forecast to grow by 4.6 percent in 2025, slowing to 3.6 percent in 2026 as resource output eases.</p>
<p>Minerals, liquefied natural gas and cash crops dominate PNG's economic offering, Rahman said: particularly gold.</p>
<p>According to the report, the Porgera mine had its highest half-year gold output since reopening in 2023, while Lihir, K92 and Ok Tedi have far surpassed expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold price is very high currently, overall in the global market, and that certainly drove the positive outlook of the gold mines,&quot; Rahman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Beside the gold, there is also a growth in LNG production that also contributed to the better-than-initially-estimated growth.&quot;</p>
<p>A supply increase for core PNG exports comes amid a 10 percent tariff from the US, much lower than many of its South-East Asian neighbours, making for a milder-than-expected impact, the report said.</p>
<p>Rahman acknowledged the size of PNG's economy relative to other island nations could obscure economic struggles regionwide.</p>
<p>Samoa, for example, is seeing visitor growth plummet, from 40.9 percent in 2024 to 2.8 percent in 2025.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, drier weather conditions could slow agricultural and fishing output in the South and Central Pacific, leading to greater reliance on imported food products, and weakening their offering for signature goods, like kava.</p>
<p>Less reliable revenue sources for Pacific governments are worsening delays to public infrastructure, with post-disaster reconstruction projects in Vanuatu significantly impacting overall growth rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that, in some of the countries, there are still challenges for growth to pick up or catch up, even coming from recent disasters, project implementation or capacity constraint issues in some of the smaller Pacific countries, and so forth.&quot;</p>

But his honeymoon with conservatives appears over after he unexpectedly took aim at President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, questioning whether they were in line with the Church’s pro-life teachings.</p>
