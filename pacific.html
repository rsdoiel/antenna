      <h1>Astronomers observe rings forming around icy celestial body Chiron</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The rings of Saturn are among the wonders of our solar system, with a diameter of roughly 175,000 miles (280,000 kilometers) as they encircle the giant planet. But smaller celestial bodies in the solar system also boast ring systems that are impressive in their own right, even if their scale is not as grand. Scientists said they have observed for the first time a ring system in the process of formation and evolution, consisting of four rings and diffuse material, surrounding a small icy body called Chiron that orbits the sun in the expanse between Saturn and Uranus. Chiron is part of a class of objects called centaurs that populate the outer solar system between Jupiter and Neptune, displaying characteristics of both asteroids and comets. Formally called “(2060) Chiron,” it has a diameter of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and takes about 50 years to complete one orbit around the sun. Centaurs are composed mainly of rock, water ice and complex organic compounds.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Tonga's health ministry has launched its long-awaited National Mental Health Strategy and Policy at Vaiola Hospital.</p>
<p>Health officials have described the move as a milestone in strengthening mental health services and coordination across Tonga.</p>
<p>The nation's head psychiatrist Dr Mapa Puloka said &quot;mental health is everyone's responsibility&quot;.</p>
<p>A national survey released earlier this year found around six percent of Tongans reported notable psychological distress, yet 96 percent of those surveyed had never accessed mental health care.</p>
<p>The study also revealed that none of those identified with depression had previously seen a mental health professional.</p>
<p>Mental health challenges in Tonga are often compounded by stigma and limited service accessibility, especially in outer islands.</p>

<p><strong>SKYLINE CELEBRATES NEW SEGMENT WITH FREE WEEKEND FARES</strong></p>
<p>Skyline, Honolulu’s rail system, is set to open its second segment and to celebrate, the city is offering riders free fares for one weekend.</p>
<p>The segment, which opens to the public on Thursday, Oct. 16, extends the line from East Kapolei to Middle Street, and adds four stations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makalapa Station at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam</li>
<li>Lelepaua Station at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport</li>
<li>Ahua Station at Lagoon Drive</li>
<li>Kahauiki Station at the Kalihi Transit Center</li>
</ul>
<p>Trains will run daily from 4 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. to accommodate more commuters.</p>
<p>To celebrate the grand opening, the city is offering free rides on Skyline, TheBus, and TheHandi-Van from Saturday, Oct. 18, through Sunday, Oct. 19.</p>
<p>Riders must still tap their HOLO cards, but no fare will be deducted.</p>

<p><strong>WHO ON AI</strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization regional director for the Western Pacific says artificial intelligence can be a game-changer for long-burdened health systems — if used ethically.</p>
<p>Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala said if AI is harnessed ethically and equitably, it can help close gaps in healthcare and bring the Western Pacific region closer to universal health coverage.</p>
<p>He said its uses can include generating patient education materials in local languages and supporting overworked health staff with documentation.</p>
<p>Member states will discuss how to scale AI responsibly across health systems at the upcoming 76th WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS MARITIME JURISDICTION</strong></p>
<p>A commission has given its recommendations on the Cook Islands' submission to protect the Manihiki Plateau.</p>
<p>The Manihiki Plateau is a shield-shaped submarine geological formation located within the Cook Islands' Exclusive Economic Zone, which extends out into international waters.</p>
<p>With the Commission's recommendations received, the Cook Islands can move forward and formally define the outer limits of its continental shelf in this area, under international law.</p>
<p>The Government said in practical terms, the successful recognition of the Cook Islands' claim represents an area of approximately 350,000 square kilometres of additional seabed shelf forming part of the Cook Islands' maritime jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>FEMA SCALES BACK HOUSING FOR MAUI FIRE SURVIVORS</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency is scaling back its direct lease program for survivors of the 2023 Maui wildfires, recently canceling over $2 million worth of contracts with a private company that had been managing residential units on the island.</p>
<p>At least 14 contracts with Lima Charlie, a California-based company specializing in disaster relief housing and property management, were terminated on Aug. 28. FEMA said it had secured temporary housing for all of the eligible households enrolled in its direct housing program and there were “no remaining unmet needs,” according to agency spokeswoman Nicole Timon-Shipman.</p>
<p>“As families transition out of the FEMA temporary housing program, we will continue to release the units they vacate,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>By September, FEMA had reduced the number of contracts with Lima Charlie that were associated with the direct lease program to 27, according to <a href="http://usaspending.gov/">federal data</a>. The agency had 42 contracts with the company in August and 637 over the course of the last two years.</p>
<p>FEMA has played a pivotal role in Maui’s recovery efforts since the August 2023 wildfires killed at least 102 people, <a href="https://www.mauicounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=12683&amp;ARC=17713">destroyed more than 2,200 structures</a> and displaced more than 12,000 residents. The agency has connected more than 1,300 fire-affected households with temporary housing.</p>

<p><strong>TUVALU PM PRAISES TAIWAN</strong></p>

<p>Pac News reported at celebrations marking Taiwan's National Day in Funafuti, Feleti Teo congratulated the Government and people of Taiwan.</p>
<p>He also reaffirmed Tuvalu's appreciation for more than four decades of close partnership.</p>
<p>Teo said both Tuvalu and Taiwan face similar challenges as small island nations, including the existential threat of climate change and growing geopolitical pressures.</p>

<p><strong>TONGA ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>Prince Kalaniuvalu Fotofili is an early winner in next month's election after being confirmed as the sole candidate for his noble seat.</p>
<p>Voting day for the country's general election is set for November 20.</p>
<p>Two sets of votes take place to elect 17 People's Representatives and nine noble representatives.</p>
<p>No other candidates are seeking to represent the Niuas islands, so Prince Kalaniuvalu Fotofili returns for another four-year term as the noble representative.</p>

<p>The Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) has delivered a forceful blow to rival leagues, today announcing a sweeping new policy that threatens 10-year bans for any NRL player or accredited agent who negotiates with or signs for a competition not recognised by the ARLC.</p>
<p>The decisive sanctions, released following an ARLC meeting on Wednesday, October 15, 2025, come in direct response to the increasing threat posed by rebel competitions—reportedly including the emerging R360 league—which the ARLC accuses of attempting to &quot;exploit&quot; and &quot;pirate&quot; the game's talent for financial gain.</p>

      <p>COPENHAGEN — Global warming is crossing dangerous thresholds sooner than expected with the world’s coral reefs now in an almost irreversible die-off, marking what scientists on Monday described as the first “tipping point” in climate-driven ecosystem collapse. The warning in the Global Tipping Points report by 160 researchers worldwide, which synthesizes groundbreaking science to estimate points of no return, comes just weeks ahead of this year’s COP30 climate summit being held at the edge of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.</p>

      <p>So many of us watch the news, see the attacks on our democracy, and wonder what more we can do. We know that protests are critically important, but few of us see the value of going inside and building relationships with elected officials. “Why would I do that?” we might ask. “Why would it matter?” Here’s one example.</p>

      <p>“Portland is burning to the ground,” President Donald Trump warns, and he has helpfully explained that it is a “war-ravaged” hellscape where even the mayor and governor are “petrified for their lives.” Trump purports to be trying to rescue us Oregonians by dispatching National Guard troops to use “full force if necessary” against the “enemy from within.” We asked an intrepid photographer, Rian Dundon, to brave the flames and firefights to capture the mood in this war zone, or what Trump called a “burning hellhole.”</p>

      <p>Diane Keaton, the vibrant, sometimes unconventional, always charmingly self-deprecating actress who won an Oscar for Woody Allen’s comedy “Annie Hall” and appeared in some 100 movie and television roles, an almost equal balance of them in comedies like “Sleeper” and “The First Wives Club” and dramas like “The Godfather” and “Marvin’s Room,” has died.

      <h1>The wrong way to fight homelessness</h1>

(date: 2025-10-12)
      <p>
      <p>Across the country, cities have taken to cracking down on people who lack housing — not by finding them places to live, but by kicking them out of the places they are seeking shelter. These mass encampment evictions owe in part to a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, that allowed cities to enforce bans on public camping even if shelters in the area are full.</p>

<p>Madang Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim has urged social media users to stop spreading unverified information, warning that false posts can harm investigations and create unnecessary fear in the community. He said social media can either strengthen or damage public trust, depending on how it’s used.</p>
<p>Baim said recent online discussions about alleged incidents in Madang had caused confusion and tension. “Before you post, pause and verify. Not everything you see or hear online is true,” he said. “Posts that spread false information can make people panic and even put lives at risk.”</p>

<p>The people of Morobe gathered in silence yesterday as the late Governor Luther Akisawa Wenge was laid to rest in his home village of Baindoang — the final chapter in the life of one of Papua New Guinea’s most fearless and principled leaders.</p>
<p>Hundreds of mourners filled the village, their faces heavy with emotion as the casket of the former governor was carried through the crowd. Men, women, and children lined the roadside waving flowers and Lutheran flags, paying their last respects to a man whose voice once echoed across the nation’s political and legal arenas.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Grace Tinetali-Fiavaai, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Compensation for communities affected by the grounding of the New Zealand Navy vessel HMNZS Manawanui will be confirmed once the national budget is passed, the Samoan government says.</p>
<p>Monday marked one year since the Manawanui ran aground and sank off the south coast of Upolu.</p>
<p>On the anniversary, New Zealand announced it had responded to a request from Samoa regarding the maritime disaster, with a payment of NZ$6 million — equivalent to around 10 million Samoan talā — to compensate communities in the Safata district, whose livelihoods were affected by the vessel sinking on the Tafitoala Reef.</p>
<p>Since the sinking of the Manawanui, Samoa's Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) has been leading the local government's response and liasing with affected communities.</p>
<p>In an email responding to questions from RNZ Pacific, after New Zealand's funding announcement, MWTI chief executive Fui Tupai Mau Simanu said this work is ongoing.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is for us to meet with the community again. We are planning to have a consultation in mid-October as officials from NZ Navy want to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>He said compensation will be the main topic of discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;Process of compensation has not been decided yet but a couple of options have been suggested. One of the main items on the agenda when meeting the community is to discuss and agree on the process. Once the budget is approved the money will be available for distribution.&quot;</p>
<p>Fui also said the government is working with New Zealand to secure further funding.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government of Samoa is currently in the process of negotiating additional funds from the Government of New Zealand that will focus on the recovery and rehabilitation of the affected ecosystem.&quot;</p>
<p>The ill-fated Manawanui, a hydrographic and diving support vessel, was on deployment in Samoa as part of the security being provided for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last year.</p>
<p>King Charles' accommodation for the international event is situated on the same coastline not far from where the wreck of the Manawanui lies.</p>
<p>All crew were safely evacuated from the doomed vessel, but the incident damaged approximately 5000 square metres of coral reef and spilled around 200,000 litres of diesel into the ocean affecting coastal fishing grounds, and forcing locals to have to travel to nearby districts, such as Siumu, to fish at considerable added expense.</p>
<p>Since then elders of the affected communities have been very vocal, demanding fair compensation and insisting the Manawanui wreck be removed from their reef despite the Samoa government declaring it will remain where it lies.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters says the payment this week was in response to a direct request from the Government of Samoa.</p>
<p>&quot;We have responded to the government of Samoa's request in full and with good faith. We have always said we will do the right thing,&quot; Peters says.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognize the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.&quot;</p>
<p>Peters said New Zealand continues to work with Samoa on decisions around the ship and its future.</p>
<p>Samoa's parliament recently held its first sitting since the general election, during which the first reading of the national budget was tabled.</p>
<p>Samoan Minister for Finance Mulipola Anarosa Molioo Ale thanked the New Zealand government &quot;for this very generous donation and other help yet to come&quot;.</p>
<p>Samoa's parliament is expected to reconvene next week to continue deliberations, including passing the budget that will allocate funds for Manawanui compensation.</p>

      <h1>Third narco sub found in Solomon Islands, as cocaine and meth trafficking comes to the Pacific</h1>

(date: 2025-10-09)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/2488_copy.jpg?itok=x4L19qyh"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/2488_copy.jpg?itok=VglCJN-H" alt="The narco sub "></a></p>
<p><em>Radio NZ Pacific —</em> Reubenson and Martin Fugui have been boating around their island village their entire lives, but they'd never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>The cousins were on their usual morning boat run on Saturday to get supplies from a local market when they spotted it.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an object floating [in the water],&quot; Reubenson told the ABC from his village, Fourau, in Solomon Islands' Malaita province.</p>
<p>&quot;We were scared at first, because we'd never seen a vessel [like this] in our lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Isolated and in deep water, they were hesitant at first to board the &quot;strange-looking&quot; boat and waited for half an hour for any sign of life before they were convinced it was safe.</p>
<p>As they got closer, they saw its engines were missing, and Reubenson, the older of the two, told Martin to climb aboard to find out what was inside.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a single cabin and it still had its steering wheel,&quot; Martin said.</p>
<p>Other than that, the engines were gone and it was just filled with empty plastic water bottles.</p>
<p>The cousins towed the strange 17m-long vessel back to their village.</p>
<p>Later, on closer inspection, they discovered internal piping for the fuel system.</p>
<p>&quot;They had written on them 'Made in Colombia, 2024,'&quot; Reubenson said.</p>
<p>They didn't know it until they later reported it to police, but they had discovered a narco sub — the third such vessel found in Solomon Islands' waters over the past year.</p>
<p>The Pacific's Growing Drug Problem</p>
<p>Narco subs are ocean-going, semi-submersible or fully-submersible vessels, often custom-built by drug cartels to transfer huge amounts of product across oceans.</p>
<p>The practice has been going on in the Americas for decades, but the newer vessels are often fully submersible in order to reduce detection by authorities' radar or sonar systems.</p>
<p>This month, the Trump administration has started its own war on similar-type boats, bombing vessels it says were filled with drugs bound for the United States.</p>
<p>But in the Pacific and Solomon Islands, these types of discoveries are new.</p>
<p>Last year, a local doctor found the first narco sub in the region near Solomon Islands' isolated Ontong Java Atoll, and has now turned the 25m-long vessel into his personal boat.</p>
<p>Local investigative team In-depth Solomons reported that an Ecuadorian voter ID card was found on board.</p>
<p>And in July, the second narco sub, this one 21m long, was discovered floating in the ocean by a local MP near Ramos Island, which is about 75km north-west of the latest discovery.</p>
<p>All three of the vessels found in Solomon Islands had no drugs on board, with experts saying the vessels are often abandoned after a successful mission.</p>
<p>Local Police say they are investigating all three, and it is unclear whether these vessels drifted the 10,000km from South America, or they transferred the drugs closer to Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>But the discoveries come as the Pacific grapples with a growing drug problem, with a string of recent busts highlighting how cartels are increasingly using the sparse and largely un-policed Pacific Islands as a transit point onto the more lucrative Australian and New Zealand markets — what experts call the &quot;cash cows&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;[These discoveries] definitely show a new trend being used by trans-criminal syndicates in South America and Mexico, to traffic drugs to Australia and New Zealand, the 'cash cows' in the region,&quot; transnational crime expert Jose Sousa-Santos told RNZ.</p>
<p>&quot;These vessels operate through the Pacific Islands or from island to island from a drop-off mothership to, say, the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>&quot;Then a LPV (narco sub) is used to move to another island country to refuel, before moving towards the target markets of Australia and New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>'Power Drug' Hits Solomon Islands</p>
<p>The drug importation issue has become a new and increasing problem in the Pacific Islands, hitting communities in Tonga, Fiji, Samoa and PNG.</p>
<p>Fiji, in particular, is grappling with a spike in HIV on the back of increased meth use in the country, with users sharing needles in what's known as “bluetoothing”.</p>
<p>But in Solomon Islands, it is so new that authorities don't even have legislation to prohibit possession of methamphetamine, which locals are calling &quot;the power drug&quot;.</p>
<p>And local police say the discovery is beyond the current capabilities of law enforcement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele told local media this week that the government was working urgently to address the legal gaps, aiming to modernize outdated laws to ensure stronger measures against those in the production and distribution of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;As we speak the attorney general's chambers, together with other stakeholders including the police, are looking at these gaps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our priority, and we want to quickly bring the necessary amendments to parliament — hopefully by the end of this year, or if not, during the first session next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Local lawyer and prosecutor Steward Tonowane said the discoveries of the narco subs and the lack of legislation in Solomon Islands were a &quot;serious concern&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Reminds me of the saying: when there's smoke, there's fire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be a deliberate orchestrated operation that is happening.</p>
<p>&quot;And we must make amendments and prepare ourselves [so] that we may be able to attend to this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Back in Fourau village, the narco sub has become a major talking point in the community, with everyone in the community coming to check it out.</p>
<p>Yet, local police have warned &quot;the good citizens of Solomon Islands&quot; to call police first in such encounters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is for the police to come and properly check to make sure the boat is safe,&quot; the police told the ABC in a statement.</p>
<p>But for Reubenson, now that the narco sub has been abandoned, it's a matter of finders keepers.</p>
<p>&quot;If I find this thing that no one owns, then obviously it means I'm the new owner.&quot;</p>

<p>The PNG Prime Minister’s XIII will debut Gairo Voro at five-eighth this Sunday, a selection made after veteran Kyle Laybutt was unexpectedly ruled unavailable for his planned farewell match.

<p>Kumuls coach Jason Demetriou confirmed the key change in the spine, noting that the desire for a victory, coupled with the need for preparation ahead of the Rugby League World Cup, has shaped the squad.</p>

<p>The Papua New Guinea Prime Minister's XIII Squad have named a robust 18-man squad for Sunday’s Prime Minister’s XIII match against Australia, with coach Jason Demetriou confirming the selection strategy is primarily focused on World Cup preparation and compensating for a lack of tier-one international fixtures this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason we've picked a stronger side this year for the PM's XIII is that last year we got an opportunity to play against a Tier 1 country [Australia] to lead us into the World Cup and get some experience.</p>

<p>The Papua New Guinea NRL Academy is making a decisive move to accelerate the development of local rugby league talent by significantly increasing its training intensity and expanding its geographical reach. PNG NRL Academy Coaching and Pathways Manager Joe Grima confirm these strategic changes are designed to rapidly close the development gap with nations like Australia and New Zealand ahead of PNG's confirmed NRL entry in 2028.</p>
<p>Under the unified &quot;one house policy,&quot; the NRL franchise, the PNGRFL, and the Hunters have synchronised their development efforts. The academy program, which previously ran for only eight weeks, has been fundamentally restructured.</p>

<p>The directive is enforceable immediately by the NCD and Central Police Commander Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Benjamin Turi, following a volatile three-week standoff in Moresby South, which saw 17 homes razed and tensions running high between the Enga and Gulf communities.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Grace Tinetali-Fiavaai, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's longest-serving leader Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi says his time in parliament is drawing to a close after more than four decades in politics.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my last term, to the end of this term, not necessarily the leadership, but to continue,&quot; he told RNZ Pacific.</p>
<p>A former pupil of St Paul's College in Auckland, Tuilaepa went on to earn a Master's degree in Commerce from the University of Auckland before returning to Samoa to begin his career in government.</p>
<p>He first entered parliament in 1981, representing Lepā and rose through the ranks of the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) becoming prime minister in 1998, a role he held for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>The 80-year-old, who has now lost two consecutive elections at the helm of the HRPP, said he only stayed on to ensure the party continued to enjoy the benefit of his own contribution.</p>
<p>&quot;I have reached that stage where, really, I should retire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa's tenure as prime minister of Samoa from 1998 to 2021 makes him the Pacific's longest-serving democratic leader.</p>
<p>Other Pacific leaders with over a decade in power include the late Sir Michael Somare of Papua New Guinea, Fiji's Frank Bainimarama and the late Albert Henry of the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his political career, Tuilaepa acknowledged both the achievements and the challenges.</p>
<p>Asked about the highlights, he said there were &quot;so many of them&quot; from the delivery of long-term infrastructure projects to introducing policies and legislation to improve gender equality in Samoa.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many other things that we did, like, for instance, lowering the cost of family events, we normally require goods like tinned fish and reduce the sizes from 48 to now about eight, reducing the cost of faalavelave.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't just give one highlight because there were so many of them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>During his tenure Tuilaepa also oversaw some significant changes which drew international attention, including switching the side of the road Samoans drive on from right to left, changing Samoa's timezone to better align with key trading partners in Australia and New Zealand and Samoa's transition to a parliamentary republic in 2007.</p>
<p>&quot;Others were the building of high-rise buildings through assistance from our partners.</p>
<p>&quot;As well as the promotion of gender equality, not only through issues relating to the support for women issues in the rite nations, but also passing laws to ensure that not less that's the 10 percent or six women to enter Parliament,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa also spoke about his efforts to improve education, culture and social development in Samoa.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many on top of that; promoting the replating of our fine matts to the perfection that it was in the olden days, not the rubbish that we used to have, as well as education, the setting up of our own university, as well as for government to meet school fees for children in [primary schools]. We also moved to begin from next year, if we were elected, paying for university education fees, as well as paying for the teachers for private schools.&quot;</p>
<p>The HRPP's decades-long hold on power ended in a narrow defeat at the hands of the FAST Party in the 2021 general election.</p>
<p>In 2020, a year before that election, Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Fosi Schmidt, Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Leatinuu Wayne Fong, Olo Vaai fell out with Tuilaepa after breaking ranks to vote against three controversial government bills the Judicature Bill 2020, Lands and Titles Bill 2020, and the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020.</p>
<p>One-by-one each of them left HRPP with Laaulialemalietoa, whose constituency advised him to leave the party, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/417909/former-cabinet-minister-quits-samoa-s-ruling-party">resigning first</a> and announcing he would be forming a new political party in the 2021 election.</p>
<p>Thus the FAST party came into being, consolidating with two existing opposition parties, and one by one all of the other three former HRPP members joined, with Fiame <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/425809/samoa-s-deputy-prime-minister-quits-cabinet-over-controversial-bills">who was deputy prime minister at the time</a> being the last to do so.</p>
<p>From there, FAST went on to win an historic first election with Fiame becoming prime minister.</p>
<p>A split in the party resulted in Fiame's government collapsing with a year still to go in her tenure but the FAST party emerged from the ensuing early election with an even bigger mandate to lead than in 2021 with Laaulialemalietoa now prime minister of Samoa.</p>
<p>When asked about the lowest point in his political career Tuilaepa said there was only the one.</p>
<p>&quot;Losing an election, not so much that I lost the leadership as well, but more for the people that depend so much on us to ensure that we inject the rule of law, that we follow the rule of law and good covenant principles of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>&quot;As it is now we don't have that anymore, &quot; Tuilaepa said.</p>

<p>The 52 duly elected Ward Councillors of Kerowagi District have publicly lodged a formal complaint against the Kerowagi District Development Authority (KDDA), expressing collective &quot;concern and disappointment&quot; over the total lack of financial support for the recent 50th Golden Jubilee of Papua New Guinea's Independence celebrations.</p>
<p>In a strongly worded letter dated September 17, 2025, addressed to KDDA District Administrator Mr Philip Bomal, the councillors claimed that the National Executive Council (NEC) had allocated a substantial K1 million to every district, including Kerowagi under the leadership of its member Francis Kikin Siune and across the nation specifically for the Golden Jubilee.</p>

      <p>NEW YORK — The ball hung in the air, and for a moment, Yankee Stadium was a place frozen in time. When it finally clanked high off the left-field foul pole, the Bronx erupted. Aaron Judge’s three-run home run had just tied the game in the fourth inning, the final step in erasing a five-run Toronto Blue Jays advantage over the New York Yankees.</p>

CNMI government revenue, not surprisingly, is also down. The only thing that prevented the Commonwealth’s financial collapse were the ARPA and other federal emergency assistance funds from the Covid days. That funding source is either depleted already or about to be gone. And then what?</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — French authorities in New Caledonia are investigating after a sea turtle was found tied to a tree.</p>
<p>The female turtle, about 25-30 years-old, was bound in rope in the Koutio mangrove swamp in Dumbéa and rescued on 14 September.</p>
<p>An Aquarium des Lagons spokesperson said she had deep cuts on her right swim leg from being tied up.</p>
<p>Despite this, she is doing well and is now under the care of the aquarium in Noumea.</p>
<p>If she keeps improving, she could be released in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Head of the Aquariology and Maintenance Department at the Aquarium des Lagons told local media that the loggerhead turtle is a protected species, along with the green turtle and the hawksbill turtle.</p>
<p>Unlike the green turtle, it is not eaten locally.</p>
<p>Sylvain Govan said there is no doubt that this is &quot;poaching&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the person who grabbed it and tied it up there, had an idea in the back of his head. Either eat it or sell it to make money,&quot; she told Nouvelle-Calédonie La Première.</p>

<p><strong>DEFENSE AGREEMENT</strong></p>
<p>A newly signed defense agreement between the governments of Fiji and Solomon Islands will allow Fijian troops into Honiara during national emergencies.</p>
<p>This includes general elections, natural disasters and other national emergencies.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed on September 9, and announced by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka at Fiji's parliament last week.</p>
<p>Rabuka has promised to operate on non-political, non-interventionist terms.</p>

<p><strong>ONLINE SCAMS</strong></p>
<p>The Consumer Council of Fiji is raising alarm bells that the level of sophistication and complexity of online scams is increasing.</p>
<p>It said the level of awareness is not matching the pace at which it gets more complex.</p>
<p>The Council's Ziyad Parvez told fijivillage.com that fraudsters are not above using the latest technology to execute the scams.</p>
<p>He said in one incident, a person working on a private island transferred about FJ$7000 to an account that seemed to be in Papua New Guinea, but it was actually someone from Fiji using a scrambling technology.</p>

<p><strong>MAN JAILED FOR RAPING DAUGHTER</strong></p>
<p>A man in Samoa was sentenced last week to 17 years' imprisonment after he was convicted of seven incidents of sexual violation by way of rape and one representative charge of five incidents of incest.</p>
<p>The victim is the accused's biological daughter.</p>
<p>The accused, through his counsel, accepted the amended summary of facts dated 21 August 2025.</p>
<p>The accused's sexual abuse of his daughter began sometime between April 01 and May 31, 2021 following the general elections. The victim was 12 years old.</p>
<p>The accused’s sexual abuse of his daughter came to light when an aunt of the victim went to the home to visit the victim and her siblings and found the accused sleeping with the victim “like a couple”. The victim became pregnant but miscarried after a few months.</p>
<p>During sentencing, Justice Leiataualesa Darryl Clarke told the defendant that he was supposed to protect the victim from harm as her biological father.</p>
<p>&quot;No words can ever sufficiently condemn what you did to your daughter. You were duty-bound to protect her from harm, yet you were the perpetrator of the greatest betrayal any daughter could suffer: sexual abuse by her own father.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>BAN ON IMPORTED SCHOOL FOODS</strong></p>
<p>Vanuatu's livestock and biosecurity minister says he is working on a policy to ban consumption of imported food in schools.</p>
<p>The Vanuatu Daily Post reports Ian Wilson telling the National Commercial Commodity Forum that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for over 70 per cent of all deaths every year in the country.</p>
<p>He said the report shows that unhealthy diets at schools are contributing to the growing NCDs, as children are eating a lot of rice, biscuits, bread, tinned fish, and noodles at schools.</p>
<p>Wilson said a policy banning consumption of imported food, and allocating funds to help schools purchase local food, will create greater demand for local crops.</p>

<p><strong>GUAM BANS MANGO IMPORTS</strong></p>
<p>Guam has temporarily banned mango imports from the Northern Marianas, after an invasive insect was discovered on Saipan.</p>
<p>Researchers confirmed the mango fruit borer at the CNMI's Division of Agriculture compound in Kagman.</p>
<p>Kuam News reports Division of Agriculture director Jack Ogumoro saying the discovery was made earlier this year when visiting scientists sampled infected mangoes.</p>
<p>Invasive species coordinator Natasha Tomakane says the ban is a precautionary measure to protect regional agriculture.</p>

<p><strong>PNG SHORTWAVE</strong></p>
<p>The head of Papua New Guinea's national broadcaster is looking for ways to bolster the station's radio broadcast capability.</p>
<p>Kora Nou has been in Aotearoa inspecting Radio New Zealand Pacific's shortwave service.</p>
<p>It broadcasts right across the Pacific, providing lifeline utility support on request when natural disasters strike.</p>
<p>Nou said with a government mandate to have full coverage across PNG, he's looking for the right solution.</p>
<p>&quot;So the shortwave we want to build won't be analogue shortwave but we are thinking of digital shortwave,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of work to be done still but we are happy to come here to New Zealand to work with our friends here, and whatever we decide to build it will be for the good of the staff at NBC and for the good of the people of Papua New Guinea.&quot;</p>
<p>NBC's own shortwave service closed more than 20 years ago.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — With the government shut down for a sixth day, President Donald Trump on Monday briefly dangled the possibility of a negotiation with Democrats, only to pull back several hours later — insisting that Democrats must end the standoff first before he would be willing to make a deal on health care.</p>

      <h1>US unemployment claims rise moderately amid labor market freeze</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased marginally during the last week of September, data from Haver Analytics showed, pointing to a still-low level of layoffs even as hiring has stalled. The labor market has stagnated with businesses not firing employees on a large scale, but also reluctant to hire more workers. Economists have blamed the labor market paralysis on President Donald Trump’s trade and immigration policies as well as the growing popularity of artificial intelligence, which have combined to reduce demand and labor supply. A U.S. government shutdown, now in its sixth day, has resulted in the suspension of official data collection and publication, complicating decision-making for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, investors and households.</p>

<p>A visit by the Indonesian Ambassador to PNG, His Excellency Andriana Supandy, has solidified a new strategic educational partnership aimed at bolstering the sustainability and long-term growth of Papua New Guinea’s oil palm industry in West New Britain.</p>
<p>Recognising WNB as PNG’s largest oil palm producer and Indonesia as the world’s second-largest, the two nations are integrating education directly with industry development. The core of this collaboration is the Indonesia Bahasa Zoom Training Program, officially launched at Buvussi Junior High School, which will position the Indonesian language as a key tool for future leaders in PNG’s newly established Ministry of Oil Palm Industry.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Giles Dexter, RNZ Political Reporter</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa government has paid $6 million in compensation to Samoa, to mark one year since the grounding and sinking of HMNZS Manawanui.</p>
<p>On 6 October, 2024, the vessel <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/529979/hmnzs-manawanui-what-we-know-about-the-ship-s-sinking">ran aground on a reef off the South Coast of Upolu, and then sank</a>.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Winston Peters said the payment - worth 10 million Samoan tālā - followed a request from the Samoan government, and was made in full and in good faith.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said we will do the right thing,&quot; Peters said. &quot;We recognise the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.&quot;</p>
<p>Village elders told RNZ Pacific the once-rich fishing grounds have been destroyed, and they <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/574033/samoa-village-elders-still-seeking-compensation-want-manawanui-wreck-removed">want the wreck removed</a>.</p>
<p>Peters said the two governments continued to work together on decisions around the ship and its future, with the priorities being minimising any possible environmental impacts and supporting the response.</p>
<p>Results of an inquiry released in April found the ship's crew <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/557180/crew-on-manawanui-during-sinking-were-under-trained-ship-not-up-to-task-report">was undertrained and the vessel was not up to the task</a>.</p>
<p>All 75 passengers and crew survived. An investigation into whether there will be any disciplinary proceedings was in its closing stages.</p>
<p>Captain Rodger Ward, lead of the HMNZS Manawanui response, said much work had been carried out in the past 12 months to minimise the effects of the sinking and investigate the causes.</p>
<p>He said fallen shipping containers had been removed, and fuel, pollutants, weapons, ammunition and debris had been recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;Further work is required. That work includes progressing an independent wreck assessment together with environmental studies. This information will be essential in supporting decisions about the future work required,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The priority remains, as it has been throughout, to minimise any environmental impacts of the sinking, and to support the government of Samoa in its response.&quot;</p>
<p>Reflecting on one year since the sinking, Ward said the Defence Force remained eternally grateful no lives were lost, and also recognised the impact the sinking has had on the people of Samoa.</p>

<p>Christina Persico, RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa has recorded more than 14,000 clinically diagnosed dengue cases since January, and its seventh death from the disease.</p>
<p>The latest report, released on September 29, covers the week of September 22- 28.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health said for that period, cases were down 26 percent compared to the previous epidemiological week, with 378 clinically diagnosed dengue cases reported from all health facilities in Upolu and Savai'i.</p>
<p>There have been seven confirmed dengue-related deaths in Samoa.</p>
<p>Seventy-four percent of all cases were reported from Upolu island.</p>
<p>American Samoa's Department of Health said there are 212 confirmed cases of dengue fever in the territory. No deaths are reported.</p>
<p>This figure is as of Monday, Sept. 29.</p>
<p>The local health department said most cases have recovered.</p>
<p>Cases continue to develop in other parts of the Pacific — the UN's ReliefWeb site showed Kiribati has reported 487 confirmed cases, as of 23 September, and another 1416 suspected, as well as one death.</p>
<p>As of Sept. 28, Tuvalu reported 690 suspected cases were tested, with 213 confirmed positive.</p>
<p>The dengue cases are widely distributed along Fongafale and two outer islands, Nanumaga (eight cases) and Nukufetau (10 cases).</p>
<p>There's better news in the Cook Islands, with Secretary of Health Bob Williams saying he believes <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/574847/dengue-nearly-eliminated-as-cases-drop-to-one-in-rarotonga">there was only one case for the last two weeks and none in the outer islands</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;I think with the responses and the clean-ups, the Tutaka programs, I think we are, hopefully, close to eliminating dengue here in Rarotonga,&quot; he said.</p>

      <h1>Senators again block plans to reopen government as shutdown drags on</h1>

(date: 2025-10-04)
      <p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — Rep.

      <p>Today’s state of extreme economic inequality is a problem best approached with science — using it to make specific measurements, identify root causes, and develop workable solutions. Archaeology is revealing a broad picture that spans thousands of years of prehistory, challenging some of the pervasive biases about the inevitability of inequality as people form larger communities or advance technologically.</p>

<p>Also among the streaming offerings worth your time this week, as selected by The Associated Press’ <a href="https://apnews.com/entertainment">entertainment journalists</a>: The classic children’s story “Charlotte’s Web” by E.B. White turned into an animated series for HBO Max, the documentary “Prime Minister” chronicling the five-year tenure of former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern and some katana-swinging mayhem with the video game Ghost of Yotei.</p>
<p><strong>NEW MOVIES TO STREAM FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— Matthew McConaughey plays the real bus driver who drove 22 elementary school students to safety during 2018’s Camp Fire that engulfed Paradise, California, in the new film “The Lost Bus,” streaming Friday, Oct. 3 on Apple TV+. America Ferrera co-stars as the teacher who went along for the ride, expecting it to be a straightforward drop off at a nearby school. Paul Greengrass directed the film like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/movie-review-lost-bus-18471922ec0515e5e6382b2703e9d720">an old-fashioned disaster movie</a>, I wrote in my review, adding, “it’s impossible to take your eyes off the screen, away from the inferno and the sense of our own smallness and helplessness to ‘battle it.’”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-9632a46e5fb6292b8f903541d6d07660">Cillian Murphy</a> is the headmaster of a reform school in “Steve,” a taut drama about mental health and a broken education system. The film, which hits Netflix on Friday, Oct. 3, is based on Max Porter’s novella “Shy.” “Steve” was directed by Belgian filmmaker Tim Mielants who also directed Murphy in the terrific Claire Keegan adaptation <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cillian-murphy-film-small-things-like-these-842460b018a2c7f37533e2ed088a3f56">“Small Things Like These,”</a> (currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+) which focused on the Magdalene laundries in Ireland. Together they could make for a moving double feature.</p>
<p>— The new documentary “Prime Minister,” streaming on HBO Max on Tuesday, chronicles the five-year tenure of former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern. <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-9387e2bf316b41f5906769cc35bcd340">Just 37 when she took over</a>, and only the second elected world leader to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3c31aac929664754862c4ddd516766de">give birth while holding office</a>, Ardern was praised around the world for her handling of the nation’s worst-ever mass shooting and the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. But she faced mounting political pressures at home and a level of vitriol from some that hadn’t been experienced by previous New Zealand leaders. In 2023, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-new-zealand-government-covid-jacinda-ardern-0e6d8eedd96f94aab07eeb0c37164591">she shocked the world</a> with her announcement that she was stepping down.</p>
<p><strong>NEW MUSIC TO STREAM FROM SEPT. 29- OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— It’s her, hi: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> returns with her highly anticipated 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” out Friday, Oct. 3. The record was completed in Sweden with producers Max Martin and Shellback during the Eras Tour and while details of the album have been limited, Swift did appear on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-new-heights-podcast-e26d4150cd1fa7bf7cea189e48237663">the “New Heights” podcast</a> in August to tease it. Swift promised infectious melodies and vivid lyrics across “The Life of a Showgirl,” an album that will be much more “upbeat” than 2024’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-review-b24d2275df5cf78ffa9069c61b9825ec">“The Tortured Poets Department.”</a></p>
<p>— If cheery-sounding post-punk (or “egg punk” for the very online crowd) is an interest area, look no further than Nashville’s Snooper, a good-time group known for their ebullient live performances and penchant of paper mâché puppetry. Their latest release, “Worldwide,” arrives via <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/jack-white">Jack White’s</a> Third Man Records on Friday, Oct. 3. It’s 12 tracks of catchy fun.</p>
<p><strong>NEW SERIES TO STREAM FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— Superman only had to put on a pair of glasses to disguise himself as Clark Kent but in the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idtWZdPIQhI%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Hulu series “Chad Powers,”</a> Glen Powell wears prosthetics and a wig to masquerade himself — all in the name of football. Powell plays Russ Holliday, a college football quarterback at the top of his game, until he makes an embarrassing mistake that ruins his career. Instead of giving up, Holliday decides to transform himself into an alter ego named Chad Powers, who is a walk-on player at a different school. The show is based on a character created by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nfl-sports-football-ccd23299d289c063eff6bf150aec49f5">Eli Manning for his 2022 ESPN docuseries “Eli’s Places,”</a> where he changed his look to take part in walk-on tryouts at Penn State. It streams beginning Tuesday.</p>
<p>— The classic children’s story <a href="https://apnews.com/ab072d33571b41db8c9cbb078e8901b2">“Charlotte’s Web” by E.B. White</a> is now an animated series for HBO Max. All three episodes drop Friday, Oct. 3. The show’s voice cast includes Amy Adams as Charlotte, Elijah Wood as adult Wilbur, Cynthia Erivo as goose and Jean Smart as the narrator.</p>
<p>— Charlie Hunnam also transforms himself for Netflix’s true crime dramatization called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8FeHSoTHs8%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“Monster: The Ed Gein Story.”</a> Hunnam plays Gein, a convicted murderer and suspected serial killer from the 1950s. Cocreated by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, the “Monster” anthologies tend to illustrate the impact of true crime on pop culture. In this “Monster,” Tom Hollander plays <a href="https://apnews.com/arts-and-entertainment-a2fc34c2afb44087bb77a7dfe2f06b9a">Alfred Hitchcock,</a> whose movie “Psycho” was inspired by Gein. Olivia Williams and Laurie Metcalf also star. It debuts Friday, Oct. 3.</p>
<p>— PBS has two interesting offers for the weekend. On Friday, Oct. 3 it will air “Great Performances: The Magic of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/grace-bumbry-mezzosoprano-57440bbfa65ebafffa5c302f808199cf">Grace Bumbry</a> ” about the real-life opera singer from Missouri who made history as the first Black mezzo-soprano to perform at Germany’s Bayreuth Festival. It also shows her impact on musicians today <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/beyonces-relationship-to-grace-bumbry-gldsal/17197/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">including Beyoncé, who is mentioned in the doc.</a> It premieres on Friday, Oct. 3 on PBS and streams on pbs.org and the PBS App.</p>
<p>— On Sunday, Oct. 5, we’re introduced to Jules Maigret, a detective created by author Georges Simenon. His first Maigret novel was published in 1931 but a new PBS Masterpiece series about the investigator takes place in modern day. Benjamin Wainwright stars as the titular character who — along with his team — use unorthodox methods to solve crimes. “Maigret” will also will be available on pbs.org and the PBS App.</p>
<p>— The second season of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JUNabjeYlw%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">biblical drama “House of David”</a> premieres Sunday, Oct. 5.

<p><strong>NEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY FROM SEPT. 29-OCT. 5</strong></p>
<p>— Atsu, the protagonist of <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Ghost of Yotei</a>, was just a girl when the renegade Lord Saito killed the rest of her family. Sixteen years later, she’s returned to northern Japan to exact vengeance against Saito and his minions. She’s learned some mad samurai skills in the meantime, so expect plenty of katana-swinging mayhem. This new adventure from Sony’s Sucker Punch studio is the follow-up to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, and it builds on that game’s sprawling scope and lush graphics while blending 1600s history with Japanese folklore. Atsu’s mission begins Thursday on PlayStation 5.</p>

      <h1>Jane Goodall, the gentle disrupter whose research on chimpanzees redefined what it meant to be human</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Mireya Mayor, Florida International University</p>
<p>For The Conversation</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — An</em> yone proposing to offer a master class on changing the world for the better, without becoming negative, cynical, angry or narrow-minded in the process, could model their advice on the life and work of pioneering animal behavior scholar <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jane-Goodall">Jane Goodall</a>.</p>
<p>Goodall’s life journey stretches from marveling at the somewhat unremarkable creatures – though she would never call them that – in her English backyard as a wide-eyed little girl in the 1930s to challenging the very definition of what it means to be human through her <a href="https://janegoodall.ca/what-we-do/africa-programs/gombe-stream-research-centre/">research on chimpanzees in Tanzania</a>. From there, she went on to become a global icon and a <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/06/jane-goodall/">United Nations Messenger of Peace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/jane-goodall-obit-78698397851bc7634717206f7eba07b2">Until her death on Oct. 1, 2025 at age 91</a>, Goodall retained a charm, open-mindedness, optimism and wide-eyed wonder that are more typical of children. I know this because I have been fortunate to spend time with her and to share insights from <a href="https://www.mireyamayor.com/">my own scientific career</a>. To the public, she was a world-renowned scientist and icon. To me, she was Jane – my inspiring mentor and friend.</p>
<p>Despite the massive changes Goodall wrought in the world of science, <a href="https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/nat16.sci.lisci.goodall/how-jane-goodall-changed-the-study-of-animal-behavior/">upending the study of animal behavior</a>, she was always cheerful, encouraging and inspiring. I think of her as a gentle disrupter. One of her greatest gifts was her ability to make everyone, at any age, feel that they have the power to change the world.</p>
<p><strong>DISCOVERING TOOL USE IN ANIMALS</strong></p>
<p>In her pioneering studies in the lush rainforest of Tanzania’s Gombe Stream Game Reserve, <a href="https://www.tanzaniaparks.go.tz/national_parks/gombe-national-park">now a national park</a>, Goodall noted that the most successful chimp leaders were gentle, caring and familial. Males that tried to rule by asserting their dominance through violence, tyranny and threat <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2016/11/02/gombe-gets-new-alpha-fall-ferdinand/">did not last</a>.</p>
<p>I also am <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mireya-I-Mayor-78099910">a primatologist</a>, and Goodall’s groundbreaking observations of chimpanzees at Gombe were part of my preliminary studies. She famously recorded chimps taking long pieces of grass and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/2011264a0">inserting them into termite nests</a> to “fish” for the insects to eat, something no one else had previously observed.</p>
<p>It was the first time an animal had been seen using a tool, a discovery that altered how scientists differentiated between humanity and the rest of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Renowned anthropologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Leakey">Louis Leakey</a> chose Goodall to do this work precisely because she was not formally trained. When she turned up in Leakey’s office in Tanzania in 1957, at age 23, Leakey initially hired her as his secretary, but he soon spotted her potential and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees-jane-goodalls-story/1911/">encouraged her to study chimpanzees</a>. Leakey wanted someone with a completely open mind, something he believed most scientists lost over the course of their formal training.</p>
<p>Because chimps are humans’ closest living relatives, Leakey hoped that understanding the animals would <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/">provide insights into early humans</a>. In a predominantly male field, he also thought a woman would be more patient and insightful than a male observer. He wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>Six months in, when Goodall wrote up her observations of chimps using tools, Leakey wrote, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine Man, or <a href="https://nhm.org/stories/chimpanzees-redefining-what-it-means-be-human">accept chimpanzees as human</a>.”</p>
<p>Goodall spoke of animals as having emotions and cultures, and in the case of chimps, communities that were almost tribal. She also named the chimps she observed, an unheard-of practice at the time, <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/jane-goodall/">garnering ridicule from scientists</a> who had traditionally numbered their research subjects.</p>
<p>One of her most remarkable observations became known as the <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/a-brief-history-of-the-gombe-chimpanzee-war">Gombe Chimp War</a>. It was a four-year-long conflict in which eight adult males from one community killed all six males of another community, taking over their territory, only to lose it to another, bigger community <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2018/07/10/top-bottom-chimpanzee-social-hierarchy-amazing/">with even more males</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENCE IN HER PATH</strong></p>
<p>Goodall was persuasive, powerful and determined, and she often advised me not to succumb to people’s criticisms. Her path to groundbreaking discoveries did not involve stepping on people or elbowing competitors aside.</p>
<p>Rather, her journey to Africa was motivated by her wonder, her love of animals and a powerful imagination. As a little girl, she was entranced by Edgar Rice Burroughs’ 1912 story “ <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/78">Tarzan of the Apes</a>,” and she loved to joke that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cS3BA0GwWM">Tarzan married the wrong Jane</a>.</p>
<p>When I was a 23-year-old <a href="https://usasciencefestival.org/people/dr-mireya-mayor/">former NFL cheerleader</a>, with no scientific background at that time, and looked at Goodall’s work, I imagined that I, too, could be like her. In large part because of her, I became a primatologist, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10764-006-9036-1">co-discovered a new species of lemur in Madagascar</a> and have had an amazing life and career, in science and on TV, as <a href="https://explorer-directory.nationalgeographic.org/mireya-mayor">a National Geographic explorer</a>.</p>
<p>When it came time to write <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/644663116?oclcNum=644663116">my own story</a>, I asked Goodall to contribute the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>STORYTELLER AND TEACHER</strong></p>
<p>Goodall was an incredible storyteller and saw it as the most successful way to help people understand the true nature of animals. With compelling imagery, she shared extraordinary stories about the intelligence of animals, from apes and dolphins to rats and birds, and, of course, the octopus. She inspired me to become a wildlife correspondent for National Geographic so that I could share the stories and plights of endangered animals around the world.</p>
<p>Goodall inspired and advised world leaders, celebrities, scientists and conservationists. She also touched the lives of millions of children.</p>
<p>Through the <a href="https://janegoodall.org/">Jane Goodall Institute</a>, which works to engage people around the world in conservation, she launched <a href="https://janegoodall.org/our-work/our-approach/roots-shoots/">Roots &amp; Shoots</a>, a global youth program that operates in more than 60 countries. The program teaches children about connections between people, animals and the environment, and ways to <a href="https://rootsandshoots.org/our-model/">engage locally to help all three</a>.</p>
<p>Along with Goodall’s warmth, friendship and wonderful stories, I treasure this comment from her: “The greatest danger to our future is our apathy. Each one of us must take responsibility for our own lives, and above all, show respect and love for living things around us, especially each other.”</p>
<p>It’s a radical notion from a one-of-a-kind scientist.</p>

      <h1>Pacific economies will grow in 2025, but turbulence likely ahead</h1>

(date: 2025-10-03)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/adb.png?itok=ggy3pZ2-"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/adb.png?itok=H1QO8-Fx" alt="ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>Kaya Selby, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is offering a sunny outlook on the Pacific economy, but with clouds on the horizon.</p>
<p>In its latest forecasts, the Bank puts economic growth at 4.1 percent regionwide, while projecting a dip in inflation.</p>
<p>But the region is expected to slow to 3.4 percent growth in 2026, as the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/565605/what-does-the-us-remittance-tax-mean-for-the-pacific">United States tariffs</a> begin to set in and revenue from tourism, fisheries and other important sectors take a hit.</p>
<p>ADB's lead economist for the Pacific region Aminur Rahman told Pacific Waves the region stands out from the rest of the world for its bump in growth this year.</p>
<p>He said unlike much of the developing world, the Pacific is relatively less reliant on US trade, dampening any direct pressure from the tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect the direct effects of the tariff would be that prominent... but we tend to factor in that because of the tariff on some of the major trading partners of the Pacific countries, there may be indirect effects related to tourism in particular.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If because of the tariff, the growth slows down in some of the countries that are the providers of tourism for the Pacific, the effect could boil down through that channel of indirect effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Rahman said island nations are expected to largely sidestep the US's one percent tax on remittances. Fiji, for example, is seeing remittances increase by 11.5 percent to F$692.6 million in the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that effect also to be quite negligible, because the main destinations where Pacific labor goes are Australia and New Zealand, and obviously, the North Pacific countries have free access to the US.&quot;</p>
<p>It's an upward revision from ADB's April forecasts for 2025, which projected a flatter growth rate of 3.9 percent.</p>
<p>Rahman said this more optimistic forecast can be put down to record mineral and resource output from Papua New Guinea, propping up an otherwise subdued winter economy.</p>
<p>According to the report, PNG's economy is forecast to grow by 4.6 percent in 2025, slowing to 3.6 percent in 2026 as resource output eases.</p>
<p>Minerals, liquefied natural gas and cash crops dominate PNG's economic offering, Rahman said: particularly gold.</p>
<p>According to the report, the Porgera mine had its highest half-year gold output since reopening in 2023, while Lihir, K92 and Ok Tedi have far surpassed expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold price is very high currently, overall in the global market, and that certainly drove the positive outlook of the gold mines,&quot; Rahman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Beside the gold, there is also a growth in LNG production that also contributed to the better-than-initially-estimated growth.&quot;</p>
<p>A supply increase for core PNG exports comes amid a 10 percent tariff from the US, much lower than many of its South-East Asian neighbours, making for a milder-than-expected impact, the report said.</p>
<p>Rahman acknowledged the size of PNG's economy relative to other island nations could obscure economic struggles regionwide.</p>
<p>Samoa, for example, is seeing visitor growth plummet, from 40.9 percent in 2024 to 2.8 percent in 2025.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, drier weather conditions could slow agricultural and fishing output in the South and Central Pacific, leading to greater reliance on imported food products, and weakening their offering for signature goods, like kava.</p>
<p>Less reliable revenue sources for Pacific governments are worsening delays to public infrastructure, with post-disaster reconstruction projects in Vanuatu significantly impacting overall growth rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that, in some of the countries, there are still challenges for growth to pick up or catch up, even coming from recent disasters, project implementation or capacity constraint issues in some of the smaller Pacific countries, and so forth.&quot;</p>

But his honeymoon with conservatives appears over after he unexpectedly took aim at President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, questioning whether they were in line with the Church’s pro-life teachings.</p>

      <h1>"HOW THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IMPACTS VA”</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p><em>Dear Amata,</em></p>
<p>I'm not a Dem, but I strongly oppose using Federal monies for veterans to promote the Republican agenda.</p>
<p>Email excerpt I received today from VA:</p>
<p>&quot;How the government shutdown impacts VA</p>
<p>Oct 1 at 8:21 AMAs you may be aware, funding for some government agencies, including portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, expired at midnight this morning.</p>
<p>President Trump opposes a lapse in appropriations, and on September 19, the House of Representatives passed, with the Trump Administration’s support, a clean continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands ....&quot;</p>
<p>There are laws against using Federal money, especially Veteran' monies, to promote a political agenda?</p>
<p>How about &quot;Republicans are refusing to compromise and allow medical care to the low income workforce, and are instead reprogramming the money to the top 0.01%&quot;?</p>
<p>I fought to defend the Constitution and the rule of law, and this person is tearing it all up —  what are you going to do about it?</p>

      <h1>'Delusional religiosity': The Pacific's response to Charlie Kirk's assassination</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/marli_olive_wesley_jpg_copy.jpg?itok=KIW3_IsX"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/marli_olive_wesley_jpg_copy.jpg?itok=pp-xkwro" alt="Marli Olive Wesley"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>by Coco Lance, RNZ Pacific digital journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The public assassination of American conservative commentator Charlie Kirk earlier last month sent shockwaves throughout the United States — and around the world.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old CEO of Turning Point USA was shot in the neck and killed during a debate at Utah Valley University on 10 September.</p>
<p>Reactions were swift and polarized.</p>
<p>Vigils and rallies honored his life, while debate simultaneously erupted over his legacy.</p>
<p>Some hailed him as a martyr for Christian values and free speech, while others saw a divisive figure whose rhetoric sowed seeds of hate.</p>
<p>In Aotearoa, Deputy Prime Minister David Seymour praised Kirk's commitment to &quot;the free exchange of ideas&quot;.</p>
<p>Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki called Kirk a &quot;man executed because he loved Christ&quot; and compared their values.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Labour and Green MPs refused to support a parliamentary motion honoring Kirk.</p>
<p>Among Pacific communities, support surged.</p>
<p>Social media was flooded with tributes hailing Kirk as a &quot;man of God&quot;, &quot;bold Christian&quot; and &quot;defender of truth&quot;.</p>
<p>In the Northern Marianas, leaders called his death &quot;a profound loss in our national conversation&quot;.</p>
<p>Guam's Speaker Frank Blas Jr said Kirk died &quot;doing what he did best... persuading, not dividing&quot;.</p>
<p>At Kirk's Arizona memorial, American-Samoan Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence, said, “Charlie stood in the arena armed with superior arguments, with truth, reason, propelled by love for God, love for others, and love for our great nation... His words were his weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>But as praise poured in, so did criticism.</p>
<p>Prior to Kirk's assassination, he had been criticized for blaming the 2023 Maui wildfires on &quot;pagan Hawaiian culture&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There is blood on the hands of the waterworshipers. Christianity broke us free of Pagan slavery. Maui did not have to burn if they did not believe such whacky, goofy, Pagan stuff,&quot; Kirk had said on the Charlie Kirk show.</p>
<p>In response, popular TikTok user @Hapi_117 said, &quot;He's blaming the Islanders, or native Hawaiians, for causing the Maui fires because they 'worship water..' It has nothing to do with Hawaiian culture.&quot;</p>
<p>“WHEN PASIFIKA WEEP FOR EMPIRE”</p>
<p>Conversations continued when Samoan-Fijian American writer Marli Olive Wesley ignited debate with her Substack essay, When Pasifika Weep for Empire.</p>
<p>She argued that Kirk's conservative views — anti-immigrant, anti-queer, pro-policing, pro-empire — run counter to the values of the Pacific communities now mourning him.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a people who have endured land theft, blackbirding, nuclear testing, deportation, and exile,&quot; Wesley wrote.</p>
<p>“Yet again and again, we align ourselves with those who uphold the very systems that shrink us.”</p>
<p>Wesley suggested the outpouring of grief was not just about faith, but obedience. Obedience &quot;drilled in by mission schools, reinforced in pews, and exported through migration.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to RNZ Pacific, Wesley said she started writing her article well before Kirk's death.</p>
<p>“I’ve been unsettled for a long time by the contradictions I see in our communities... I'd hear people say they stand on Christian values — love, compassion, justice, care for the vulnerable — but then watch their politics align more with American conservative values like exclusion, nationalism, punishment, and individualism,” she told RNZ Pacific.</p>
<p>Wesley said Kirk's death only laid those contradictions bare.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think most Pasifika who mourned him agreed with every policy. What I saw was the reflex of loyalty… to church, to tradition, to a version of Christian authority that tells us who to follow and what to believe.&quot;</p>
<p>Not all backlash has been entirely critical, with Fijian Reverend James Bhagwan calling for nuance.</p>
<p>&quot;A man's life was taken. I will not cheer that... But grief shouldn't become amnesia. We can lament a death without canonizing politics that wounded many.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhagwan urged Pacific communities to reflect rather than react.</p>
<p>&quot;Support for Kirk often stemmed from familiar teachings, promises of order, diaspora longing for security. I don't see those people as enemies — it's a formation task.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pray before posting. Verify before sharing. Guard dignity… especially of those we disagree with.&quot;</p>
<p>Tongan theologian and academic Rev Nāsili Vaka'uta said Wesley's criticism was not only justified, but necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Her essay reveals how colonial Christianity conditions us to mourn power figures…even those who oppose our dignity. We inherit doctrines of love but deploy them selectively.&quot;</p>
<p>He called it &quot;delusional religiosity&quot;, a result of settler-colonial logics that shape how Pasifika read faith, politics, and authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Death doesn't create new problems. It exposes old wounds.&quot;</p>
<p>President Donald Trump called Kirk &quot;a giant of his generation&quot; at his memorial service, saying he was &quot;violently killed because he spoke for freedom and justice&quot;.</p>
<p>Authorities say Kirk's suspected killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was captured after a 33-hour manhunt.</p>
<p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has not ruled out the death penalty.</p>
<p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>

      <p>
      <p>LONDON — Nothing about this feels like it’s the move Browns coach Kevin Stefanski wanted to make, at least not yet. Cleveland is winding through an abnormal week in the middle of a uniquely brutal three-game stretch and searching for offensive answers — multiple — of any kind.</p>

      <h1>More pain for US farmers as government shutdown halts payments</h1>

(date: 2025-10-02)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. federal government shutdown that began Wednesday will halt some payments to farmers and delay access to federal farm loans, the latest blow for producers already facing low crop prices, record-high debts and a trade war at the height of the fall harvest. The shutdown began at midnight after Republican and Democratic lawmakers could not agree on a plan to fund federal government operations. It will last until one party gets enough votes for its funding plan. On Wednesday, the scope of the shutdown’s potential impact to U.S. farmers was beginning to emerge. Even short interruptions in payments could deepen farmers’ economic turmoil.</p>

      <h1>Guarding the Public Purse: Accountability Must Begin at Home</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>Letter to the Fono – Part 3</p>
<p><em>Honorable Leaders and Members of the Fono</em>,</p>
<p>In Letter #1, I warned that the Fund cannot survive without honesty about the $13.9 million debt and the principle of fiduciary duty. In Letter #2, I outlined reforms aimed at restoring fairness and sustainability.</p>
<p>This third letter turns to the heart of governance: the budget process itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE ZERO-SUM REALITY</strong></p>
<p>Every year, as the Fono reviews the Administration’s budget, revenues are allocated across competing needs. But revenues are finite. Every dollar directed to one purpose is a dollar denied to another. When pensions, education, or healthcare are shortchanged, it is not because revenues vanished — it is because choices were made.</p>
<p>In this zero-sum reality, government indulgence is paid for by public sacrifice. When the Fono protects its own allowances, travel, or discretionary spending while insisting others “tighten their belts,” it sends a dangerous message: rules for you, exceptions for us.</p>
<p>This contradiction was on full display in recent hearings. The Attorney General was questioned for receiving taxable housing and utility benefits that were merely intended to restore her previous judicial salary. Yet members of the Fono themselves receive a <span class="math inline">\(65,000 “office allowance” — often without actual offices — which they may treat as non-taxable or convert into pensionable compensation. This means legislators effectively enjoy \)</span>90,000 to $95,000 in income, while criticizing others for far lesser benefits. That is not accountability; it is hypocrisy.</p>
<p><strong>WHO REVIEWS THE FONO’S BUDGET?</strong></p>
<p>As the Fono meticulously questions the Administration’s departments, the question arises: who applies the same scrutiny to the Fono’s own budget? In practice, the Fono reviews itself. This undermines credibility. Oversight that spares itself but spares no one else is not oversight — it is self-dealing.</p>
<p>Consider also the treatment of the Treasurer. When pressed on the $14 million now owed to the Fund, he was faulted for not recommending that the Governor use ARPA interest earnings to repay the debt. Yet the Treasurer correctly noted that ARPA has its own director, who administers ARPA funds per strict federal guidelines. Instead of addressing the real problem — the government’s chronic failure to meet its obligations — the Senate leadership appears to have shifted blame to one individual. The Treasurer has since been removed from his position.</p>
<p>This pattern — criticizing others for practices that pale next to legislative privileges, or shifting blame away from structural failures — is not accountability. It is narrative manipulation: a repetition of claims designed to distract from reality and make the public question what they see plainly before them.</p>
<p><strong>THE PENSION EQUATION IN CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p>As I reminded in Letter #1: C + I = B + E. Contributions plus investments must equal benefits plus expenses. This equation is universal, not optional. When contributions fall short, investments stagnate, or expenses balloon, the balance is disrupted.</p>
<p>The same truth applies to the government budget. Revenues + Grants = Services +</p>
<p>Obligations. Overspending on operations inevitably starves obligations, such as pensions. That is the disease. Political justifications, temporary stimulus, or creative accounting are only symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY IN ACTION</strong></p>
<p>I urge the Fono to act on five fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>         Apply equal scrutiny to itself — review legislative allowances, salaries, and pension treatment with the same rigor demanded of the Administration.</li>
<li>         Integrate actuarial evidence into budget law — let contribution rates be driven by actuarial necessity, not political negotiation.</li>
<li>        Prioritize debt repayment — set aside revenues specifically for retiring the $14 million owed, whether through Enterprise (ASPA, ASTCA, others) surpluses, dedicated tax streams, or phased transfers.</li>
<li>         End the Allowance Loophole — Amend the law so that the <span class="math inline">\(65,000 office allowance is treated as salary. This would result in member salaries of \)</span>90,000 and leadership salaries of $95,000 — transparent, equitable, and fully taxable, like every other government paycheck. 5. Respect the Separation of Powers — The Senate leadership and legal counsel should focus on their legislative duties and step aside from direct roles in ASGERF governance. The Fund must be overseen independently, free from conflicts of interest, so that trustees can act solely in the best interests of active members, retirees, and beneficiaries. Restoring this separation will strengthen both the Senate and the Fund.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SIGNS OF PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p>It is essential to acknowledge that the Fono has taken some constructive steps during recent hearings. In a House Committee on the Retirement Fund hearing, House leadership corrected the Fund’s Executive Director after he tried to shift blame for the contribution rate increase onto the previous Governor, affirming that it was the Fund itself that asked for higher contributions. House leadership also pressed the Fund’s Vice Chair on my removal, reminding both him and the Executive Director that the Board has no legal authority to terminate a trustee — only the Governor does.</p>
<p>During budget hearings, the Fono also displayed diligence in addressing the</p>
<p>Administration’s flawed submission. The proposed budget blurred the lines between established departments, semi-autonomous authorities, and line agencies, with inconsistent salaries and titles. Faced with this confusion, the Fono worked diligently to request clarifications, sort through the confusion, and adjust salaries in a manner it deemed more consistent and justifiable.</p>
<p>In addition, the House demonstrated proper accountability by paying for the expenses of its Retirement Committee Chairman to attend the recent NCPERS conference. This is as it should be: Fund-related travel by Fono members should be covered by the Fono’s own budget, not the Retirement Fund budget. This practice rightly places responsibility with the legislature and avoids burdening the Fund with costs unrelated to its fiduciary obligations. These examples prove the Fono can exercise oversight when it chooses to. The challenge — and the opportunity — is to apply that same rigor to itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE STAKES</strong></p>
<p>Markets rise and fall — but for three straight fiscal years (ending September 30, 2025), the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have delivered double-digit gains. The Fund, which reflects the performance of the financial markets, has posted positive gains over the past three years. Yet despite these gains, the Fund’s net position has been stagnant for over a decade. The threat is not Wall Street — it is Fagatogo and Utulei.</p>
<p>The promise of retirement is not a favor; it is an earned right. If leaders cannot model accountability, how can they expect the public to make sacrifices?</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Letter #1 called out fiduciary breaches. Letter #2 laid out reforms. Letter #3 makes plain: accountability must begin at home.</p>
<p>The Fono must lead by example. Anything less would betray the trust of those who built this government and still depend on it.</p>

      <p>KINSHASA — Former Democratic Republic of Congo president Joseph Kabila was sentenced to death in absentia on Tuesday by a military court that convicted him of war crimes, treason, and crimes against humanity. The case stems from his alleged role in backing the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in Congo’s volatile east. Kabila, who led Congo from 2001 to 2019, has denied wrongdoing and said the judiciary has been politicized.</p>

      <h1>Trump has lost credibility worldwide, at huge cost</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>Credibility, like trust and a good reputation, is hard to earn, easy to lose. It’s also ruinously expensive once it’s gone, especially in international relations. So it is no small matter that Donald Trump, eight months into his second term as U.S. president, has squandered whatever credibility America had left in foreign and security policy.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s sham case against Comey: Phony charges against former FBI director another assault on democracy</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The trumped up criminal indictment of former FBI Director Jim Comey, as expressly ordered by the president, is a legal nullity and hopefully will be dispatched by a federal judge. But the damage is done, as Donald Trump has thoroughly corrupted the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em>(September 30, 2025) A State of Emergency has been declared in Samoa, effective from September 30 to October 29, 2025, to authorize the release of funds from the Treasury to address an ongoing economic emergency.</p>
<p>The proclamation was signed on Sept 26 by the Head of State, His Highness Tuimalealiifano Vaaletoa Sualauvi II, and enacted under Article 105 of the Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa.</p>
<p>The use of an Emergency Budget was approved by Cabinet during its first meeting on Sept 17, 2025, the day after the official opening of the 18th Parliament and formal swearing-in of the Prime Minister and newly elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>Following Cabinet consultation under directive F.K. (25) 36, Samoa’s Head of State has declared a grave economic emergency, citing threats to the nation’s financial stability due to an internal disturbance. The crisis stems from the government’s inability to lawfully access Treasury funds after Parliament failed to pass an Appropriation Bill for the current financial year.</p>
<p>Since the budget’s collapse in May, the caretaker administration has been operating on just 25% of the previous year’s allocation, approximately $250 million tala, leaving critical services and obligations under strain.</p>
<p>Acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mulipola Anarosa Ale Molio’o last Friday revealed that when the new administration assumed office on Sept 16, available funds for public sector salaries were only sufficient to cover one more week, excluding overtime payments that had already been delayed for several months.</p>
<p>In response, the Government advised the Head of State to invoke Article 105 of the Constitution, enabling emergency access to Treasury funds to ensure salaries are paid and essential operations continue. The Ministry of Finance is now preparing an interim budget to be presented to Parliament, aimed at sustaining government functions until the full national budget is introduced in June 2026.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mulipola told reporters that the current State of Emergency is not expected to extend beyond Oct 29, as Parliament is anticipated to pass a new budget before that date.</p>
<p>She outlined the Cabinet’s funding priorities under the Emergency Budget, which include public sector salaries and overtime, pensions for the elderly, disability benefits, overseas medical referrals, ongoing contractual projects, the national scholarship program, pharmaceutical supplies, core government operations, and agricultural initiatives in Atele and Savaii.</p>

      <p>TONGA AIRPORT UPGRADE</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/tonga_airport.jpg?itok=8zWIQh5W"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/tonga_airport.jpg?itok=xK7j4npM" alt="Tonga airport"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Japan is providing Tonga with a US$17.7million airport upgrade.</p>
<p>PMN reported the initial request for the upgrade was made by Tonga in 2022, following a detailed study by Japan. A grant aid of US$17.7m was approved in August for Fua'amotu International Airport in Tongatapu.</p>
<p>The upgrade includes expanding and renovating the passenger terminal building and a passenger boarding air-bridge and elevator.</p>
<p>The international apron will also be expanded.</p>
<p>Japan is also giving Tonga a US$6m e-passport grant.</p>
<p><strong>TAIWAN PROMISE</strong></p>
<p>Taiwan media is reporting a promise to assist Palau in preparing for next year's Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said Taiwan would do so as part of the diplomatic allies prosperity project, to showcase the results of bilateral cooperation to the world.</p>
<p>Lin said Palau is Taiwan's closest diplomatic-ally.</p>
<p>Taiwan has diplomatic relations with 11 UN member states.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Lowy Institute in January, nearly three-quarters of countries supported Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI BRIBERY ARREST</strong></p>
<p>A 41-year-old man has been arrested in Fiji after allegedly trying to bribe a police officer.</p>
<p>The man was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped for a routine check, and is accused of offering FJ$200 to the officer to release the vehicle.</p>
<p>A search resulted in the discovery of dried leaves believed to be marijuana.</p>
<p>The seized substances were sent for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>PALAU ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>Koror State voters in Palau will head to the polls in mid-November to elect members of the state's Legislature and the governor.</p>
<p>The Island Times reported this has been confirmed by the Palau Election Commission</p>
<p>The Legislature is made up of one representative from each hamlet and five at-large seats, totaling 17.</p>
<p>The governor's race will also be on the ballot, with incumbent governor Eyos Rudimch seeking re-election against challenger Alan Marbou, a former contender for the seat.</p>
<p>As of 24 September there were 5,971 registered voters in Koror</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA’S CLIMATE VISION</strong></p>
<p>Samoa has validated its third nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment CEO Lealaisalanoa Frances Brown-Reupena said it's not just a policy exercise but &quot;a shared vision for a resilient, low-carbon Samoa&quot;.</p>
<p>She said Samoa's emissions are less than 0.01 percent of global totals, but by advancing a credible, inclusive, and ambitious NDC, the country strengthens its moral authority in international climate negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>CLIMATE, CONFLICT AND PEACE</strong></p>
<p>Pacific Island leaders took turns addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, speaking on a range of issues — from local to global — that impact their countries.</p>
<p>From stating their positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict to deep sea mining, climate change and plastic pollution, the region's heads of government spoke about the issues that matter most to them and their people.</p>
<p>Samoa Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo said Samoa's geographical isolation and insularity no longer shields or protects it from the increasingly complex and dynamic security challenges.</p>
<p>These challenges include transnational crime especially drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, challenges to sovereignty, growing geopolitical tensions in our region and humanitarian crises.</p>
<p>He said the rules based international system is being bent out of shape.</p>
<p>The deputy prime minister said continuous inaction on climate change means detrimental effects on all aspects of Samoan life.</p>
<p>&quot;Climate change remains the greatest existential threat to Samoa and other Pacific SIDS. Its impacts are more extensively felt by SIDS due to our special circumstances, and the lack of capacity to respond quickly and effectively.&quot;</p>
<p>He said energy is both a driver and accelerator for Samoa's sustainable development ambition.</p>
<p>He noted digital transformation — including AI and data analytics — offer real opportunities to drive an inclusive, just energy transition, particularly through off-grid solutions and smarter energy planning.</p>
<p>&quot;However, Samoa's level of indebtedness, often worsened by natural disasters, remains a pressing challenge.&quot;</p>

      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Leaders of developing countries threatened by climate change told rich nations at the United Nations General Assembly that they are falling far short of promises to fund measures to combat rising sea levels, droughts and deforestation. “It is past time for the rich world to meet its obligations and get money to where it’s needed most,” Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine told the assembly last week. “We’ve heard the promises — but promises don’t reclaim land in atoll nations like mine.” Wealthy countries have struggled to meet climate finance commitments. Their funding reached <span class="math inline">\(100 billion a year, an amount agreed upon in 2009, two years late in 2022. At a U.N. climate summit last year, leaders agreed to provide developing countries \)</span>300 billion a year by 2035. Many developing countries blasted that sum as far too small to meet the need. Experts have estimated that developing countries need at least $1 trillion annually by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>In this country we have a tendency to talk about big things. Matters like the need for public toilets in our cities and towns are not a common topic of conversation, even though we all use the facilities.</p>

      <h1>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in mourning for late president</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/late_pres_of_lds.jpg?itok=o6HDw0Z-"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/late_pres_of_lds.jpg?itok=bkPK9jKM" alt="President Russell M. Nelson and others"></a></p>
<p>Source: Deseret News</p>
<p>Salt Lake City, UTAH — Communities worldwide are mourning the passing of Russell M. Nelson, the 17th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a former world-renowned heart surgeon. President Nelson passed away peacefully at his home in Salt Lake City shortly after 10 p.m. MDT on Saturday at the age of 101, according to the Church.</p>
<p>Nelson became the prophet and leader of the global faith on January 14, 2018, after serving as an Apostle for the Church since April 7, 1984. His time as President was marked by a commitment to global engagement and unprecedented growth.</p>
<p>Before his call to full-time Church service, Dr. Russell M. Nelson was a world-renowned pioneer in cardiothoracic surgery. His distinguished medical career includes performing the first open-heart surgery in Utah in 1955. He was also a key figure in developing a compact artificial heart and lung machine, an advancement that saved untold numbers.</p>
<p>His professional leadership included serving as president of the Society of Vascular Surgery, a director of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery, and chairman of the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery for the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>“I think a surgeon is in a unique position to understand one of God’s greatest creations — the human body,” President Nelson once said, reflecting on his career, linking his medical expertise to his faith.</p>
<p>During his tenure, President Nelson visited 32 countries and U.S. territories, connecting with Latter-day Saints and government and religious figures. He spoke conversationally in 11 languages, underscoring his emphasis on global unity. A key theme of his leadership was the exponential increase in temple construction, with 200 new temples announced worldwide, a historic number for the Church.</p>
<p>His efforts to build relationships extended beyond his own faith. In March 2019, he held a notable meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican, which he described as a “cordial, unforgettable experience.”</p>
<p>“His Holiness, he was most gracious and warm and welcoming,” President Nelson said of his visit with Pope Francis. “What a sweet, wonderful man he is, and how fortunate the Catholic people are to have such a gracious, concerned, loving, and capable leader.”</p>
<p>President Nelson also established a significant relationship with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), meeting with its leaders multiple times, most recently in June 2021, to promote civility and racial harmony.</p>
<p>In a speech to the NAACP’s annual convention in Detroit in July 2019, President Nelson emphasized unity: “We don’t have to be alike or look alike to have love for each other. We don’t even have to agree with each other to love each other.”</p>
<p>Before his call to full-time Church service, Dr. Russell M. Nelson was a world-renowned pioneer in cardiothoracic surgery. His distinguished medical career includes performing the first open-heart surgery in Utah in 1955. He was also a key figure in developing a compact artificial heart and lung machine, an advancement that saved untold numbers.</p>
<p>His professional leadership included serving as president of the Society of Vascular Surgery, a director of the American Board of Thoracic Surgery, and chairman of the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery for the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>“I think a surgeon is in a unique position to understand one of God’s greatest creations — the human body,” President Nelson once said, reflecting on his career, linking his medical expertise to his faith.</p>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks, First Counselor in the First Presidency, who was called as an Apostle on the same day as Nelson in 1984, praised his character: “All of us who have worked with Russell M. Nelson… have marveled at his extraordinary modesty for a man of his great accomplishments… And [we] have marveled at his gentleness. He is just the gentlest and sweetest person you could ever hope to associate with.”</p>
<p>President Nelson is survived by his wife, Wendy, eight of his 10 children, 57 grandchildren, and more than 167 great-grandchildren.</p>

      <h1>“RESPONSE TO DR. ELORA RAYMOND’S OPINION”</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <p><em>Talofa lava,</em></p>
<p>I thank Dr. Elora Raymond for her thoughtful contribution and her vigilance in tracing how powerful legal interests have affected Indigenous peoples across the United States and its territories. Her research offers American Samoa an important reminder: the same lawyers and law firms who undermined Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, CHamoru, and Native American control over their lands are now circling our shores through repeated “voting rights” lawsuits.</p>
<p>Dr. Raymond is right to sound the alarm. These cases are rarely about equality alone; too often, they are doorways to challenge the very foundations of Indigenous land tenure and sovereignty. In American Samoa, we know that fa‘a Samoa and communal lands are the heart of our culture, and we must continue to guard them with the same unity shown by the Fono, our leaders, and our people during the Tuaua and Fitisemanu cases.</p>
<p>But as we recognize these external threats, we must also look inward. Our Constitution, statutes, and the Deeds of Cession give us unique protections that other territories do not have. Article I, Section 3 of our Constitution explicitly empowers the government to safeguard Samoan lands and customs. The Deeds of Cession promise respect for our land rights, and our courts, through decisions like Craddick, have already upheld the half-Samoan blood rule as a compelling state interest. These are strong shields against civil rights lawsuits that would strip away our protections.</p>
<p>Yet, the more pressing challenge we face today is not always from Washington, but from within our own families. Too many disputes arise from our land laws, disagreements over inheritance, misunderstandings of matai authority, and conflicts in communal allocations. These disputes erode unity, create costly litigation, and weaken the very fa‘a Samoa our laws are meant to protect.</p>
<p>If we wish to continue enjoying the protections we have against outside legal intrusion, we must also consider reforming and modernizing how our land laws function among ourselves. This could mean clearer rules for succession and allocation, greater use of mediation before cases reach the Lands &amp; Titles Court, and investments in proper land registration so that families are not left fighting over boundaries and oral histories. Protecting our land must also mean reducing the discord it causes among our people.</p>
<p>Dr. Raymond reminds us that we must remain mataala, alert to outside wolves. But we must also be courageous enough to heal the divisions inside our own fale. Only then can we preserve both our rights under U.S. law and the deeper unity that comes from fa‘a Samoa.</p>

At 4 a.m., I checked out of Balimo Lodge, my home for a week and a half in the heart of the Kabili Lagoon and headed to the departure area at Blue Point, where a 75-horsepower dinghy awaited me.</p>

It&#8217;s the mid-1990s, not a great time to be a young woman in the public eye. The shape of your body, the attractiveness of your face and the relative appeal of your sexuality were all fair game for TV hosts and politicians. </p>

      <p>
      (BPT) - For many patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the first step in treatment is a standard regimen of chemotherapy. This approach cures most patients, but research shows that one in three will see their cancer return — typically within a year following completion of their initial treatment.[1] Today, the current standard of care following initial chemotherapy is to "watch and wait," an approach that monitors the patient for signs of relapse.

<p>But college tuition has risen at roughly <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-tuition-inflation-statistics/">twice the rate of inflation</a> during the past two decades, and federal student debt <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/10-key-facts-about-student-debt-in-the-united-states/">climbed 500%</a> <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2025Q2">to US$1.6 trillion</a> during that same period.</p>
<p>The Biden administration sought to address this problem with plans that <a href="https://www.afscme.org/member-resources/downloadable-asset/FAQ%20-%20SAVE%20plan.pdf">accelerated student loan forgiveness</a> for lower-income borrowers with small balances, allowing debt cancellation after 10 years of repayment, instead of 20 or 25.</p>
<p>However, the courts <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/archives/2025/United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%208th%20Circuit%20Student%20Loan%20Decision_Feb2025.pdf">blocked those efforts</a>, and <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-continues-improve-federal-student-loan-repayment-options-addresses-illegal-biden-administration-actions">the Trump administration</a> has taken a sharply different approach.</p>
<p>Guided by evidence <a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2022/eb_22-32">that higher borrowing limits contribute to tuition increases</a>, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/plaws/publ21/PLAW-119publ21.pdf">tax breaks and spending cuts bill</a> that President Donald Trump signed into law in July 2025 brings changes to the federal financial aid system that prospective higher education students should understand.</p>
<p>The Pell Grant — a need-based higher education grant from the U.S. Department of Education that, unlike a loan, does not need to be repaid – lies at the heart of the federal financial aid system.</p>
<p>While the Trump Administration is slightly expanding people’s eligibility for Pell Grants, the new policies also aim to reduce the national student loan spiral by reducing limits on how much some students can borrow for their educations.</p>
<p><strong>RISING COLLEGE COSTS AND GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The average annual cost of tuition, fees, room and board for a student at a four-year college in the U.S. in the 2022-23 school year <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_330.10.asp?current=yes">was $30,884</a>, according to the latest available Department of Education data.</p>
<p>But the cost of tuition alone varies dramatically between in-state rates for public colleges, which receive state funding, and private nonprofit colleges, which do not.</p>
<p>While the average annual tuition was $9,750 per year for in-state students at public four-year colleges in 2022-23, it reached <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d23/tables/dt23_330.10.asp?current=yes">$38,421 at private nonprofit colleges</a>, even if a student lived at home and did not pay for room and board.</p>
<p>These prices are roughly <a href="https://n26.com/en-eu/the-education-price-index">two to 200 times</a> those of 42 other countries across six continents that have high-quality education data – not including seven countries, including Sweden and Saudi Arabia, that essentially have free tuition.</p>
<p>While many countries around the world <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-06-17-how-countries-make-higher-ed-affordable-what-the-data-shows">subsidize tuition</a> directly, the U.S. government focuses assistance toward individual students based on their financial need.</p>
<p>It does this through a combination of federal grants, loans and subsidies for campus jobs, all administered by the Department of Education.</p>
<p><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">In 2019-20</a>, about 40% of the nation’s 17 million undergraduates received federal grants – <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED661443.pdf">mostly Pell Grants</a>, according to the latest federal data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 34% of undergraduates and 39% of the country’s 3 million graduate students <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">received federal loans</a> during this same time period.</p>
<p>Roughly 5% of undergraduates received <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">subsidized on-campus jobs</a> through federal work study in the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES AHEAD FOR PELL GRANTS</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. government first awarded Pell Grants to students <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45418">in 1973</a>. They are designed to make college affordable for families, as determined by their income, family size and savings.</p>
<p>Historically, Pell Grants have focused just on undergraduates.</p>
<p>In 2022-23, about 75% of Pell funds went to students from families earning <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED661443.pdf">less than $40,000 per year</a>.</p>
<p>Still, a family of four earning as much as <a href="https://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/">$92,000 a year</a> in 2024 would also qualify for a small Pell Grant in some circumstances.</p>
<p>A version of the Trump administration’s budget proposal for October 2025 through September 2026 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/08/what-pell-grant-changes-in-trump-budget-house-tax-bill-mean-for-students.html">called for reducing the maximum federal</a> Pell Grant award to $5,710 a year from $7,395.</p>
<p>This caused some <a href="https://www.ncan.org/news/699766/House-Proposes-1500-Cut-to-Max-Pell-for-Students-Taking-12-Credits.htm%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Provides%20minimum%20Pell%20eligibility%20($,meets%20the%20poverty%20table%20minimum.)">observers to worry</a> that the Trump administration would try to scale back federal Pell Grants, which offer <a href="https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/dear-colleague-letters/2025-01-31/2025-2026-federal-pell-grant-maximum-and-minimum-award-amounts-updated-may-29-2025">$740 to $7,395 per year</a> to students in the 2025-26 school year.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/plaws/publ21/PLAW-119publ21.pdf">the budget bill</a> shores up overall Pell Grant funding and holds grant amounts level with those of previous years. It also creates a new type of Pell Grant to support workers seeking short-term retraining in a particular industry.</p>
<p>The budget bill also introduces another new grant called the Workforce Pell Grant. Starting July 1, 2026, this program will make small Pell Grants available for students <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/plaws/publ21/PLAW-119publ21.pdf">pursuing career training programs</a> of eight to 15 weeks toward recognized credentials in “in-demand industry sectors or occupations,” even if students already have bachelor’s degrees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/37153/House_FY_2026_Budget_Proposal_Flat_Funds_Pell_Grants_and_Student_Aid_Administration_Eliminates_FSEOG">Controversially</a>, a new <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP00/20250909/118593/HMKP-119-AP00-20250909-SD002.pdf">House of Representatives appropriations bill</a> proposes to rename the Workforce Pell Grants as “<a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-approves-fy26-labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related">Trump Grants</a>.”</p>
<p>But whether or not Congress approves the renaming, the grants will for the first time make Pell funds available to people who need short-term training to stay current in the labor market.</p>
<p>This is particularly important as long-term unemployment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/business/long-term-unemployment-college-grads.html">rises among the college-educated</a>, driven by federal layoffs as well as the growth of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>THE ROLE PLAYED BY FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS</strong></p>
<p>Despite some of their advantages, Pell Grants cover only about <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45418">a quarter of the total cost of college attendance</a>. As a result, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45418">83% of Pell Grant recipients also receive other forms of aid</a> – mostly through <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">federal direct loans</a>, which must be repaid.</p>
<p>The average undergraduate direct loan borrower graduated with about <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">$26,000 in federal debt in 2019-20</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2019/05/31/new-federal-student-loan-interest-rates-for-2019-2020-announced/%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=The%20new%20interest%20rates%20are:%20*%20**Direct,they%20will%20charge%20on%20their%20own%20loans.">Assuming the 6.08% interest rate</a> on federal loans at that time, it would have cost a graduate <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/college-planning/tools/student-loan-repayment-calculator/">$290 a month to repay</a> the loans under the <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-time-to-repay-student-loans">standard 10-year payment plan</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt1wf4cnf.9">about 10% of student loan borrowers default</a>, meaning they stop paying on their loans entirely.</p>
<p>Loan default rates are higher among students who <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt1wf4cnf.9">attended less-selective colleges</a> and those <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/student-loans/solve-student-debt-crisis-by-improving-college-completion-rate/">who did not finish their degrees</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized">Under existing rules</a> that are not changing under the Trump administration, undergraduates will still be able to borrow up to roughly $10,000 per year in federal direct loans, depending on how far along they are in school.</p>
<p>Graduate students, meanwhile, will still be able to borrow up to $20,500 per year.</p>
<p><strong>NEW LIMITS FOR PART-TIME AND GRADUATE STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>One important change following the Trump budget bill’s passage is that the Department of Education will <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/plaws/publ21/PLAW-119publ21.pdf">pro-rate, or reduce, Pell Grant limits</a> for students enrolled part time.</p>
<p>This means tuition at some higher-priced colleges may become unaffordable for part-time students.</p>
<p>This change will force some students to choose between enrolling part time in a low-tuition program or full time in a higher-tuition program.</p>
<p>The other change to federal borrowing limits pertains to graduate students.</p>
<p>The budget bill lowers the lifetime borrowing limit for graduate study <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized">from $138,500</a> to $100,000.</p>
<p>For students pursuing <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-VI/part-668/subpart-A/section-668.2%22%20%5Cl%20%22p-668.2(b)(Professionaldegree)">professional degrees</a> such as law and medicine, the limit <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/plaws/publ21/PLAW-119publ21.pdf">rises to $200,000</a>.</p>
<p>But the law does away with a program for graduate students called <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus">PLUS Loans</a> that now serves <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">about 11% of graduate students</a>, including <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2023/2023466.pdf">about 40% of students seeking professional doctorates</a>.</p>
<p>These changes may make it more expensive for graduate students to receive a degree, which could steer them toward lower-priced programs.</p>
<p><strong>THE EFFECT FOR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>As prospective students weigh their options, they should remember that most facets of federal financial aid remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Key changes aim at limiting high debt levels, specifically for <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/the-wealth-gap-plus-debt-revisited/">part-time and graduate students</a> and those attending high-tuition colleges when lower-priced institutions are readily available.</p>
<p>These changes may reroute some students from private to in-state colleges and from part-time to full-time study. Faced with increased price competition, some colleges may feel <a href="https://freopp.org/whitepapers/why-college-is-too-expensive-and-how-competition-can-fix-it/">pressure to scale back costs</a> through cuts to programs, services and amenities. For prospective students, such moves could reduce colleges’ luxuries but improve their affordability in the long run.</p>

</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-text field-label-inlinec clearfix field-label-inline"><div class="field-label">By&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">RNZ Pacific staff</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> It has been almost a year since the HMNZS Manawanui sunk off the southcoast of Upolu in Samoa.</p>
<p>But people living in affected coastal communities say their calls for fair compensation and the removal of the wreck continue to fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific journalist Grace Fiavaai and visual journalist Mark Papalii paid a visit to the site of the wreck at Tafitoala and spoke with some local elders while in Samoa for the recent national general election.</p>
<p>The sixth of October will mark exactly a year since the Manawanui maritime disaster.</p>
<p>Work to remove toxic materials from the ship has been completed by salvors and the Samoa government has given the all clear and reopened the wreck and surrounding reef area for fishing.</p>
<p>It has also decided to let the ship remain where it lies.</p>
<p>But local elders say the maritime disaster has caused long-lasting damage and continues to affect the livelihood of their communities.</p>
<p>They want fair compensation for the environmental damage and for the wreck of the Manawanui to be removed from the Tafitoala Reef.</p>
<p>Tafitoala elder Puleaga Visesio Patea Fatu said the once-rich fishing grounds have been destroyed.</p>
<p>"There was a season before this (incident) where this was once like a house full of fish (tulou le gagana- excuse my language) hence why I have said that there is no longer any good fish here since the sinking of the boat.</p>
<p>"But this is where it was pounding with fish for this village, as I mentioned to media before, I said this place was like a place where money came in like nothing because of the fish and other seafood we were able to sell; before the ship had sunk, we would be out fishing from Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday — to the markets.</p>
<p>"Now the markets back then, say if we had five to six people who went out fishing, they'd all go out with coolers full or filled with fish but nowadays, there is nothing like that available," Puleaga said.</p>
<p>Another Tafitoala resident, Taula Leka Leituala, said he now has to travel to Siumu Village to fish at considerable cost.</p>
<p>"The petrol is expensive especially when we have to go by car, stay in those villages and also go out to sea in their village.</p>
<p>"Fishing here in Tafitoala is indeed a failure now, fish and meat and oysters and any kind of seafood are now limited, but before the ship hadn't sunk things were perfect there was no major effect but now yeah big impacts.</p>
<p>"The ship needs to be removed because come to think of it, when the metal from the ship rots, I am pretty sure this whole village's livelihood will be impacted," Taula said.</p>
<p>The impact of the maritime disaster is also being felt beyond Tafitoala.</p>
<p>Residents of Sataoa, further up the coast in the Safata District, say currents carry the debris and fuel from the wreck and they end up in Sataoa.</p>
<p>Fotuotupe Lemafanaolegutu, a matai from Sataoa, said the impacts in the aftermath of the Manawanui disaster are still fresh in peoples' minds.</p>
<p>"Well if you look back at what had happened, you could see the togo especially when the tide is low, you can see the leaves dried up, now when the incident had happened, on Sunday this whole village couldn't bear to stay here, because of the smell of the oil it was very strong, even the fish to kill, when we cooked it up to eat especially the anae (mullet) when cooked that's when you could really smell it.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of concerns and there was a sense of sadness when the report from government came back saying there is no impact on Safata from this incident but it would be nice if they all came to witness for themselves the things we experience here," Fotuotupe said.</p>
<p>Safata 2 MP Tuia Logoiai Pu'a Letoa, who was elected last month under the banner of the opposition Human Rights Protection Party, said he will push for accountability.</p>
<p>"As of now, we don't have firm answers from both governments," Tuia said.</p>
<p>"We still have to fight for the government of Samoa and the government of New Zealand to consider compensation for the livelihoods and also the damage already done to our environment."</p>
<p>The Manawanui, an 85-metre hydrographic vessel, was on its <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/top/529979/hmnzs-manawanui-what-we-know-about-the-ship-s-sinking">third Pacific deployment</a> when it left Auckland in September last year.</p>
<p>The final Court of Inquiry report, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/557191/transcript-what-happened-when-the-manawanui-navy-ship-grounded-off-samoa">released in April this year</a>, highlighted multiple failings, from training gaps and operational planning to leadership and supervision issues.</p>
<p>RNZ submitted two separate Official Information Act requests to the NZDF about the Manawanui disaster.</p>
<p>The NZ Defence Force told RNZ it did not do any environmental testing itself. "The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) has not undertaken any environmental testing," it said in response to an Official Information Act request.</p>
<p>It took five months for the NZDF to respond, instead of the mandated 20 days.</p>
<p>"NZDF media updates have stated that regular testing has been undertaken by the Government of Samoa's agency, the Scientific Research Organisation of Samoa (SROS). While the NZDF holds copies of these reports and associated information, it is withheld."</p>
<p>This was on the grounds that Samoa provided the information in confidence. It also withheld its correspondence with the Samoan government for the same reason.</p>
<p>Leaders from impacted Samoan communities, including some matai living overseas, said the wreck poses an ongoing threat to livelihoods.</p>
<p>Taliilagi Mauava Tuupo Toleafoa Vaatausili who lives in New Zealand but was home for the election said the ship cannot remain where it is.</p>
<p>"If there is no plan around this (ship) just like the elder Matai said they were the ones who used to fish here and even there children won't be able to and especially the future and next generation of this village who are affected, money and income that come from being able to fish is now a concern, this boat needs to be removed and it cannot stay here," Taliilagi said.</p>
<p>In February, frustrated by a lack of response to requests for compensation from both the Samoa and New Zealand governments, local elders <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/pacific/541109/samoa-communities-affected-by-manawanui-sinking-seek-support-from-china">turned to China</a> for assistance.</p>
<p>Within a day of the request <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/541251/samoan-communities-affected-by-manawanui-disaster-receive-30-000-donation-from-china">the Chinese Embassy in Apia</a> responded with a WST$50,000 donation (approximately US$18,670).</p>
<p>Former Samoa prime minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa who was in power when the Manawanui sank said responding to the disaster was a difficult and complex.</p>
<p>"The priority was to clear any toxic elements from the ship, monitoring the impacts on the environment and then monitoring the impact on the villagers in terms of livelihoods."</p>
<p>Fiame said compensation talks with New Zealand over its sunken navy vessel will need to be initiated by Samoa's newly installed government.</p>
<p>She told RNZ Pacific environmental studies required to inform compensation talks have already been conducted.</p>
<p>"The New Zealand government has been very forthcoming in working with us in the earlier stages. And now we had to do a survey to advise New Zealand in terms of compensation. I think that's more or less finalised. So it's just a matter of beginning to do the implementation," Fiame said.</p>
<p>The former prime minister also shed some new light on <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/558480/what-was-hmnzs-manawanui-doing-before-it-sank-calls-for-greater-transparency">what the Manawanui was doing</a> off the south coast.</p>
<p>She said the Manawanui was off the coast to help with security for King Charles, who was <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/531694/king-charles-queen-camilla-touch-down-in-samoa-for-chogm">due to arrive in the country</a> at the time and was to be accommodated in the area.</p>
<p>"It was part of the security for CHOGM and especially for King Charles because he was accommodated on the south side. You know all the collaborating parties including New Zealand you know I think this was their contribution to that security being provided by the CHOGM leaders," Fiame said.</p>

      <h1>In a Tough Job Market, This Top Employer Is Offering Rewarding Careers and Competitive Benefits</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      (BPT) - For many Gen Z workers, launching a meaningful career can feel overwhelming in today's challenging job market, with recent reports showing that the nation's current unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August — the highest level since 2021. This trend also disproportionately impacts young adults entering the workforce, as many organizations reduce their entry-level positions in favor of new technology.

      <h1>The Most Underutilized Resource in Literacy? Parents</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      (NAPSI)—Reading can be one of the most difficult things that students learn to do, and it takes more than just amazing teachers and classroom-only solutions to make proficient readers. According to a recent national survey, 52% of teachers say most students make literacy gains when parents are involved. However, most of our schools’ literacy movement is missing the most important partner—families.

      <h1>Silent but Serious: Prediabetes and Heart Disease Pose Hidden Risks—But Prevention is Possible</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      (NAPSI)— Prediabetes and heart disease are two of the most common—and preventable—health threats in the U.S. More than 98 million adults have prediabetes, while heart disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death, claiming a life every 34 seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Because both diseases often progress silently, many people don’t realize they’re at risk until serious complications occur. The good news: Early detection and prevention can make a big difference.

      <h1>Cómo respirar con facilidad en espacios reducidos con bombas de calor de diseño compacto</h1>

      <p>
      (BPT) - ¿Vive en una casa pequeña? Si es así, no está solo. Con el bajo inventario inmobiliario actual y el difícil mercado de la vivienda, las viviendas compactas, como las casas adosadas, los condominios y las viviendas construidas sobre el límite del terreno, son cada vez más populares. En 2025, las nuevas construcciones de proyectos de 2 a 4 dormitorios (normalmente casas adosadas) han aumentado un 31.5% en todo el país, en comparación con las nuevas construcciones unifamiliares, que solo han aumentado un 10.1%. El atractivo de las viviendas compactas se debe principalmente a su asequibilidad, su eficiencia natural y su bajo mantenimiento, pero el espacio limitado plantea algunos desafíos, especialmente cuando se trata de instalar sistemas de calefacción, ventilación y aire acondicionado (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning, HVAC) eficaces.

				<p>The text of the First Amendment hasn&#8217;t changed, but many young adults would like it to. A study from The Future of Free Speech found that fewer than half of those aged 18 to 34 believe &#8220;hate speech&#8221; should be protected.</p>

</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-source field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">compiled by Samoa News staff</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Tonga's King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau'u have been in Australia for their first official visit.</p>
<p>PMN reported the king and queen were given a tour of Ngunnawal, the traditional homeland of the Australian capital, Canberra; and met with foreign minister Penny Wong.</p>
<p>Also on the agenda were the signing of the Kaume'a Ofi, a statement of intent committing Australia and Tonga to strengthen their partnership, and a memorandum of understanding on cyber cooperation.</p>
<p>The royal couple were also set to honour Tongan Australians who helped during the 2022 Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai disaster.</p>
<p>The official royal visit ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>PEACE TALKS</strong></p>
<p>Indonesia says West Papua is an 'internal matter' and will not be discussed at Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) peace talks.</p>
<p>The Fiji Sun reported Indonesia's ambassador Duptio Simamora asked MSG members to not 'interfere' and 'respect their sovereignty and territorial integrity'.</p>
<p>The comments come just weeks after Pacific leaders made more promises to address Indonesia's West Papua issues.</p>
<p>Leaders reaffirmed the Pacific Islands Forum's ongoing recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty over West Papua (Papua) in the final communiqué of the Leaders' Meeting, at the same time as "recalling" Indonesia's 2018 invitation for a mission led by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>Leaders have tasked the PIF Secretariat to work constructively with Indonesia on a proposed visit by forum leaders' envoys in 2026, in consultation with the Melanesian Spearhead Group Secretariat.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI DRUG BUST</strong></p>
<p>Fiji police have seized large bags from a boat, containing parcels of dried leaves believed to be marijuana.</p>
<p>The Operations Sasamaki team deployed to Kadavu intercepted the fibreglass boat on Monday night in open waters.</p>
<p>Five men were arrested.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two other people appeared in court on Monday, in separate cases of methamphetamine possession.</p>
<p>Both are charged with unlawful possession of illicit drugs.</p>
<p><strong>RESTRICTED ASYLUM</strong></p>
<p>Australian refugee advocates say global implementation of restricted asylum rights would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>An Asylum Seeker Resource Center statement says reports of an effort to roll back protections offered under the global refugee protection system are alarming.</p>
<p>The group understands the proposal is to make asylum a temporary, rather than permanent status.</p>
<p>They say temporary protection visas have been implemented in the past leading to severe harm to asylum seekers' mental health.</p>
<p><strong>US H1B VISA</strong></p>
<p>A Guam senator says the fee increase to the US H1B visa would add strain Guam's healthcare system and construction industry, which rely on overseas sources.</p>
<p>It's now US$100,000 to apply for a new H1B visa — up from $1000</p>
<p>Pacific Island Times reported Senator Jesse Lujan writing to the director of the Domestic Policy Council, saying this barrier could reduce the hiring of new physicians, pharmacists and specialists who are already in short supply.</p>
<p>Lujan has requested the White House to exempt Guam from the new fee policy, citing the island's "unique challenges as a geographically isolated US territory".</p>
<p><strong>PACIFIC TOURISM</strong></p>
<p>Pacific Islands tourism hit a record high in July with Vanuatu leading the surge, recording a 130 percent increase in Australian visitors compared to last year.</p>
<p>Australasian Leisure reported this as Vanuatu's biggest July ever, surpassing pre-covid figures.</p>
<p>Samoa also saw a 52 percent rise in July visitors reflecting a broader trend of Australians exploring Pacific destinations.</p>
<p>Fiji remains the top Pacific destination for Australian tourists, but data shows an increasing interest in lesser-known islands.</p>
<p><strong>PACIFIC RESILIENCE FACILITY</strong></p>
<p>Pacific leaders have met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to launch a memorandum for investors to support the Pacific Resilience Facility (PRF).</p>
<p>The PRF is the first Pacific-led, owned, and managed regional climate financing facility for communities.</p>
<p>The Treaty has <a href="https://forumsec.org/publications/release-historic-day-blue-pacific-leaders-sign-prf-treaty">just been signed</a> at the 54th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders summit in Honiara.</p>
<p>Ireland has since announced its PRF contribution of €3 million ahead of the PRF talanoa in New York, and Portugal pledged €1m.</p>
<p>The UNGA president Annalena Baerbock further affirmed Germany's contribution of €5m, pledged at COP29, bringing total pledges made to US$166m.</p>
<p>When it comes to Pacific contributions, Nauru has deposited its instrument of ratification making it the second country to do so after Tonga as the PRF host, with entry into force ear-marked for early 2026.</p>
<p>PRF general manager Finau Soqo told RNZ Pacific that the next is step is to ratify the treaty and complete the programming co-design consultation ahead of its proposed launch in Palau next year.</p>

</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-text field-label-inlinec clearfix field-label-inline"><div class="field-label">By&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Doug Dingwall, Adel Fruean, Nick Sas</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-source field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Source: ABC.au</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> Lauano Aukuso Ah Ching sees the divine at work in the landslide election win that brought Samoa's new prime minister to power.</p>
<p>He gets emotional as he describes Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Fosi Schmidt's victory, or, as he describes it: "Our people's choice".</p>
<p>"I thank Laaulialemalietoa for seeking the Lord in his own way, driven by his deep love for Samoa, his country."</p>
<p>Lauano is among thousands of fervent supporters, a troop of passionate devotees — many from rural areas and Samoa's large diaspora — who helped sweep Laaulialemalietoa to power in last month's national election in Samoa.</p>
<p>Many of them echo Lauano, saying that Laaulialemalietoa represents them — people who feel abandoned by the Pacific nation's political system.</p>
<p>They also say the new prime minister was chosen by God to lead the country.</p>
<p>With his supporters' belief of this divine intervention, Laaulialemalietoa's rise to power — powered by fervent supporters and defying criminal charges — has even drawn comparisons to Donald Trump's sweeping return to the White House.</p>
<p>The 59-year-old Laaulialemalietoa has long put religious belief at the center of his politics.</p>
<p>"He's very, very much devoted to the Christian faith," Samoan journalist and scholar Lagipoiva Dr Cherelle Jackson told the ABC.</p>
<p>"A lot of his popularity is due to the fact that he uses [it] as a way to reach the public."</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA STANDS WITH ISRAEL</strong></p>
<p>In Samoa, religion runs deep. The country is home to more than 400 churches, and 90 per cent of its 220,000 people regularly attend church.</p>
<p>Often, there is little separation of church and state.</p>
<p>Laaulialemalietoa founded and leads the FAST Party, or Fa'atuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi, which translates to "Samoa united in faith".</p>
<p>And this fusion of religion and state was highlighted at his inauguration ceremony last week.</p>
<p>Wearing an Israeli prayer shawl and a prominent cross — and flanked by a large picture of Jesus — Laaulialemalietoa, a talented and passionate orator, spoke about "a new chapter in [Samoa's] political journey".</p>
<p>"Bless our nation, from the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Samoa," he said.</p>
<p>"Let us work together hand in hand to build a stronger Samoa, in united peace and harmony."</p>
<p>Laaulialemalietoa took it further the next day when, at a press conference, he affirmed that Samoa "stood with Israel".</p>
<p>"If people around the world don't like it, that's up to them, but Samoa stands with the land of God," he said.</p>
<p>"Our foundational faith is that Samoa is founded on God, that is our belief, that our forefathers established.</p>
<p>Samoa's previous prime ministers have also been devout Christians.</p>
<p>But according to Nanai Dr Iati Iati, a Victoria University of Wellington expert in Samoan politics, Laaulialemalietoa has entered new territory by linking the Christian principles enshrined in Samoa's constitution to Judaeo-Christian heritage and Israel.</p>
<p>"It resonates with a lot of his voters," Nanai said.</p>
<p>"At the same time, they're from different [Christian] denominations, so they may not all be in agreement with some of his religious views."</p>
<p><strong>A PENDING COURT CASE</strong></p>
<p>Despite his devoted following, Samoans who are more skeptical of Laaulialemalietoa question his motives and leadership style.</p>
<p>"There is both a sense of hope and a sense of dread amongst Samoans for his leadership," said Lagipoiva.</p>
<p>One of his first decisions in government, to appoint himself police minister while facing criminal charges, has raised some trepidation.</p>
<p>Laaulialemalietoa's charges include harassment using electronic means, defamation, and conspiring or attempting to pervert the course of justice.</p>
<p>He denies the allegations and will next appear in court in October.</p>
<p>Lagipoiva said his role as police minister had raised concern among legal experts.</p>
<p>"Only time will tell what direction he will head in terms of those charges," she said.</p>
<p>The ABC approached Laaulialemalietoa's office for comment.</p>
<p>But a spectacular unravelling of Laaulialemalietoa's partnership with Fiame, after he refused to resign from her ministry while facing his charges, brought on the election in August.</p>
<p>Laaulialemalietoa's charges and his role in the recent turmoil appear not to have harmed his standing with voters.</p>
<p>FAST expanded its majority in the parliament, winning 31 of its 51 seats at the election.</p>
<p>At his press conference last week, he restated his innocence and sought to dispel fears he would use his role to make his charges disappear.</p>
<p>"Take it from me today, the court will take its course," he said.</p>
<p>"And time will come to reveal the truth in regard to the matters currently before court … let the matters proceed before court.</p>
<p>"Whatever decision the court makes, this government will accept and follow it."</p>
<p>Samoan media is also watching his interactions with journalists to see how he will approach media freedom.</p>
<p>While Laaulialemalietoa has promised to engage with news outlets, he said they would be barred from press conferences for "untruthful" reporting.</p>
<p>Nanai said the new prime minister might be more inclined to communicate through social media, where he had marketed himself as a "man of the people" and built his following.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure if mainstream media would be his main go-to," he said.</p>
<p>"[Governments in] Samoa historically have often had a challenging relationship with the media.</p>
<p>"[Samoa's media] does a fairly good job of holding the government to account.</p>
<p>"I don't think that will change and I've not seen any indication he's going to change that."</p>
<p><strong>A SECOND CHANCE?</strong></p>
<p>On the Trump comparisons, observers say there are limits to the parallel with Laaulialemalietoa, pointing to Samoa's distinct political landscape.</p>
<p>Lagipoiva said Laaulialemalietoa's political success was built largely on his connection with voters in rural areas, which was his clearest parallel to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"For a long time [rural communities] felt neglected by the leaders in Samoa," she said.</p>
<p>"[Laaulialemalietoa] forming FAST had given them a voice once again."</p>
<p>Laaulialemalietoa, who was the agriculture minister and a speaker of parliament during former prime minister Tuila'epa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi's government, has stood out among politicians for his prolific online presence.</p>
<p>His oratory — both online and in large, energetic election rallies — attracted supporters.</p>
<p>"He speaks with respect and humility through the Samoan language," Lauano, the FAST party supporter, said.</p>
<p>FAST clinched a historic election win in 2021 on a promise to build services for rural communities, and it installed Fiame Naomi Mata'afa as Samoa's first female prime minister.</p>
<p>Nanai said voters appeared to have given FAST another chance to follow through on its promises in 2021, after it was sidetracked by the political turbulence.</p>
<p>"I suspect that a lot of the voters that support FAST felt that the government … had not been given the opportunity to roll out its policies."</p>
<p>On Sunday, Laaulialemalietoa made a surprise trip to New Zealand to treat a leg injury.</p>
<p>On one hand, it was a reminder of the government's first task ahead — passing the budget. After months of political turmoil, Samoa is in a dire financial position.</p>
<p>Despite legally being able to hop on a government-funded flight, the prime minister instead paid from his own pocket.</p>
<p>Simply put, he said, the country did not have enough money.</p>
<p>But the medical flight also highlighted the committed support of his followers, who showered him with get-well messages after he posted a video from the hospital.</p>
<p>Nanai said, overall, there was also work to do if the government was to deliver on promises to develop agriculture in rural areas and lead the country as he promised.</p>
<p>With his former colleague Fiame at the helm until now, Samoans were yet to see how Laaulialemalietoa would lead.</p>
<p>"This will give us a clearer picture," Nanai said.</p>

</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>‘WASHINGTON (AP) —</em> After serving with the Marine Corps in Iraq, Julio Torres has the American flag and Marine insignia tattooed on his arms to show his pride in serving a country he calls home.</p>
<p>After post-traumatic stress syndrome, drug addiction and a criminal charge following his deployment, the 44-year-old has found new purpose as a pastor preaching a message of freedom to those facing similar issues.</p>
<p>But these days, his community in East Texas feels more like jail than the land of the free.</p>
<p>Torres, who was born in Mexico and migrated legally to the United States at age 5, is afraid to venture far from home as President Donald Trump works to carry out his mass deportation agenda. Torres has a green card residency permit and a record of service in the U.S. military, but he was detained by immigration authorities last year under the Biden administration. He fears that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement raids under Trump could only mean more trouble.</p>
<p>“Do I want to leave this nation? No. I want to serve it. I want to continue to serve my community,” Torres told The Associated Press. “It breaks my heart that I fought for this nation to raise my children in this nation, and now I have to pull my children out of this nation if I get deported. Then what did I fight for?”</p>
<p>There are well more than 100,000 military veterans living in the U.S. who do not have citizenship, according to estimates in recent years by the Congressional Research Service. Despite military recruiters frequently describing service as a fast-track to citizenship for troops and their family members, the Republican administration’s immigration agenda is putting them at renewed risk of deportation.</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress have raised alarm about instances of military veterans either forced from the country or whose family members were detained by ICE. A bipartisan bill introduced Wednesday by Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., would require the Department of Homeland Security to identify whether immigrants are U.S. military veterans and provide them with an opportunity to apply for lawful immigration status.</p>
<p>“It’s very important for Americans to understand the contributions of noncitizens to our national security,” Takano told the AP. “They’re often posed as threats to our personal safety, but this is a story about how they play an essential role — tremendous numbers of our current military forces are noncitizens.”</p>
<p>The legislation, backed by Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., and the GOP delegate for American Samoa, Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, would also make it easier for military members to apply for citizenship.</p>
<p>“Fighting for America is one of the greatest, most noble acts a person can do, and it breaks my heart that noncitizen veterans might be deported despite their service,” Salazar said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>FROM VETERANS’ HONORS TO DEPORTATION THREATS</strong></p>
<p>Torres remembers the anger when he was taken to an immigration detention center in Texas last year after being stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He was trying to reenter the country after visiting relatives in Mexico. The criminal charges from 10 years ago for drug possession violated the terms of his permanent residency.</p>
<p>“I was angry that I served a nation that now did not want me. I was angry that I served a nation that broke me, and after they broke me, they wanted to just throw me away,” he said, then added, “I’m still angry that I don’t have the liberty to go to the store with my kids because I’m afraid of ICE stopping me and arresting me.”</p>
<p>Torres was unsure why he was released after five days in detention. ICE had a policy at the time of considering U.S. military service when deciding whether to take immigration enforcement action. The administration has issued new policy memos to do away with that kind of discretion.</p>
<p>Fear of being deported has worsened his PTSD symptoms. He has night terrors. He cries when out of earshot of his wife and children, then tries to convince them he is doing OK. He fears that if deported to Mexico, he would be under threat from cartels because he is a veteran and minister.</p>
<p>Other veterans who have been deported say that those kinds of threats are real. David Bariu was deported to Kenya in 2008 after he had served in the Army and Air Force Reserve. An Army recruiter had enlisted Bariu while he was in the U.S. on a student visa — an offense for which the recruiter was court-martialed.</p>
<p>Bariu said he struggled with depression while detained for one year before he was deported to Kenya, where he struggled to find work. Living in an area where the al-Shabab militant group was active, Bariu did not want to tell anyone he had served in the American military.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to risk putting my life into danger,” he said, adding, that “the U.S. government is deporting veterans to hostile environments.”</p>
<p>He eventually was able to apply for U.S. citizenship under a program set up under the Biden administration for deported veterans. Bariu moved back to the U.S. and today helps run Black Deported Veterans of America.</p>
<p>The naturalization process for service members</p>
<p>Immigrants with lawful permanent residency have long been able to gain U.S. citizenship through military service. Completing that process can be difficult, especially when service members are moving between military bases or are stationed overseas.</p>
<p>Takano’s bill would allow them to apply for citizenship during their basic training and establish a review process for immigration removal proceedings. Other Democrats are proposing ways to quickly extend green cards to the family members of service members.</p>
<p>Trump, in his first term, took steps to make it tougher to gain citizenship. He added mandatory waiting times for service members to apply for citizenship and closed U.S. immigration offices overseas and at several military bases. A federal judge ruled that his administration could not enact the mandatory waiting times, but Trump’s second-term team has tried once again to appeal.</p>
<p>Homeland Security has also stood by its actions when veterans have been forced to leave the country, saying it is enforcing the law.</p>
<p>Salazar said she was supporting the new bill out of concern that the administration is not making a distinction between “those who came to commit crimes and destabilize our country, and those who came here to work and build.”</p>
<p>“The vast majority of these veterans are in that second category, and they have put their lives on the line to defend this country. Congress is the branch that can lead the way on making these key policy distinctions,” she added.</p>
<p>Republican leaders have so far shown no willingness to challenge Trump’s immigration policies. Still, Torres is hoping that the push to have Congress take up the issue can avoid the contentious politics of immigration and be cast as a veterans issue, where there is sometimes bipartisan agreement.</p>
<p>“This is about a veteran,” he said. He then added: “I love my nation. And yes, even though this nation at this moment in time does not consider me part of this nation, I consider this to be my nation. I consider this my homeland.”</p>

<p>Ina o le a amata le latou fonotaga, ae fa’alogoina e le puleaoga, le pisa mai o lana failautusi ma se tagata, i tua atu o le faitoto’a o lona ofisa.</p>
<p>Ua tu ifo i luga le Puleaoga ma savali atu, ma tatala lana faitoto’a, ae sa matua’i faate’ia o ia ina ua tatala atu le faitoto’a, ae o lo’o tu mai ai le Taitai Leoleo lea na la talanoa i lea taeao, o lo’o tau taofiofi mai e lana failautusi, mai i le tatalaina o le faitoto’a o le ofisa o le Puleaoga.</p>
<p>Ua na’o le sioa mai o le Puleaoga i le Taitai Leoleo, ae ua ‘ata le Taitai Leoleo ma faapea atu i le Puleaoga, “Ou te iloa, e tatau ona ou auai i le tou fonotaga lea e fai.”</p>
<p>Ua leai se tala a le Puleaoga, ae ua na’o le faatafa ma ua savali atu le Taitai Leoleo i totonu o le potu ma saofa’i ifo i le nofoa.</p>
<p>E ulufale atu le Taitai Leoleo, ae o le taimi lea ua pupula to’a mai iai le to’afa lea o lo’o nonofo i totonu o le ofisa a le puleaoga, i le ulufale atu o le Taitai Leoleo ma saofa’i ifo i lona nofoa.</p>

<p>Ua toe saofa’i ifo le puleaoga i lona nofoa ma amata ona ia tautala, ma ia fa’afetaia le susu mai o totino o le komiti faafoe faapea le peresetene o le PTA.</p>
<p>Ona fa’aauau lea ona fa’amatala atu e le Puleaoga ia le tala atoa, e uiga i le o’o atu o alii a’oga o Simeona i lona ofisa ma fa’ailoa atu, ia lona iloa o le tulaga sa tupu ia Paulo, le alii ave pasi ua maliu, a’o soifua o ia.  Ma sa ta’ua e le Puleaoga, na ia matua’i o’o lelei i le aiga o Simeona, e toe talanoa ia Simeona ma faamamafa ia te ia, le taua o le ‘aua ne’i faamatalaina o nei tulaga, i seisi.</p>
<p>Ae peitai, e foliga mai, ua mae’a ona faamatala e Simeona i ona matua.</p>
<p>Na fa’ai’u le lauga a le Puleaoga i lona faapea atu, “Ou te iloa, ua le toe umi ae amata ona salalau i aiga o fanau a’oga, ia le faamatalaga a Simeona.  Ma o le mafua’aga lea ua ou valaau atu ai, ina ia o tatou soalaupuleina leisi a tatou la’asaga, e mafai ai ona fofoina lenei faafitauli.”</p>
<p>Ua oso mai se tasi o totino o le komiti faafoe ma faapea mai, “O le a le mea e tatou te popole ai?  O ai o le a talitonu i le faamatalaga a se tamaititi a’ga laititi?”</p>
<p>E le’i uma lelei atu le fesili a le sui o le komiti faafoe, ae tali mai le Taitai Leoleo lea e nofonofo lava i lona tulimanu ma fa’alogologo mai i le fono.  “O ona matua.”</p>
