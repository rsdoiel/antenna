this is a midterm election it is still critical to our very future and
quality of life. Statistical data has proven that “the lower the voter
turnout can be equated to the very quality of government” as it is
directly tied to having an accountable government.  If WE don’t hold
those in office accountable on election day then WE have not done OUR
job, as citizens have a fiduciary DUTY to “be informed &amp; vote.” So,
if you are one who gets in the voting booth and doesn’t know WHO someone
is, it can be a good sign not to vote for them or a bad sign that you
didn’t do your homework as a voter.</p>

at the Vatican in ‘Conclave’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — In Edward Berger’s “Conclave,” the selection of the pope is no
holy affair. Instead, it’s a petty, political campaign carried out in
secrecy, where gossip flows, agendas are malleable and loyalties are
fleeting. All are there to serve God, they say. But we all know how
helpful that has been in conflicts throughout history. “Conclave” might
not have much new or interesting to say about the Catholic Church, but
it is a deliriously fun watch in the way that tense, smart thrillers
with an ensemble of great actors can be.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s sunset, and I&amp;#8217;m at the place to be in Granada &amp;#8212; the breathtaking San Nicol&amp;#0225;s viewpoint overlooking the fortress of the Alhambra. Here, at the edge of the city&amp;#8217;s exotic Moorish quarter, lovers, widows, and tourists jostle for the best view of the hill-capping, floodlit fortress, the last stronghold of the Moorish kingdom in Spain. For more than 700 years, Spain, the most Catholic of countries, lived under Muslim rule, until the Christians retook the land in 1492.&lt;/p&gt;
