Glasgow surprises with art, design and culture</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-08, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Glasgow, astride the River Clyde, is a surprising city &amp;#8212; and Scotland&amp;#8217;s most underrated destination. Just an hour from Edinburgh (making it an easy day trip), Glasgow offers an energetic dining and nightlife scene, fanciful architecture, and top-notch museums &amp;#8212; most of which are free. Today, this once-run-down city feels revitalized, and Glaswegians (sounds like &amp;#8220;Norwegians&amp;#8221;) are eager to give visitors a warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
