<p>date: 2025-01-04, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In Hawaii, growing roses is always a rewarding challenge to the gardener. Roses are cool climate plants that do best at elevations of 1,000 feet or more. At lower elevations, insects and disease problems are aggravated. At best, roses require specific care or they will not do well.&lt;/p&gt;
