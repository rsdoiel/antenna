<p>Rice has become a staple food in Papua New Guinea. According to the National Research Institute nearly 98 percent of the rice consumed in the country is imported. Against this backdrop, more than 600 bags of Rigo Rice, a 100 per cent PNG-owned product, were delivered to the villages of Keapara, Alukuni and Karawa in the Rigo District.</p>
<p>Among the three villages, Keapara and Karawa have access to land where they cultivate crops for their community’s sustenance.</p>

<p>Minister for Energy and Member for Kairuku, Peter Namea Isoaimo, has issued an urgent call to the Ministry of Works to immediately intervene in a road emergency along the Hiritano Highway at Tubu in the Nara area of Kairuku District.</p>
<p>The Minister said the situation is now critical, with the damaged section posing an imminent risk of cutting off the people of Kerema, Kairuku, and Goilala from essential travel, trade, and services.</p>
<p>Minister Isoaimo's appeal is directly to Minister for Works, Solon Mirisin, urging him to instruct Secretary David Holemba and relevant technical teams to immediately assess and respond to the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>“This is an emergency. Our people will now be completely cut off if Works does not intervene quickly,” Minister Isoaimo stressed, adding that continuous rainfall has worsened the deterioration of the affected road segment.</p>
<p>He said restoring accessibility on this vital national highway is crucial to avoid disruptions in the movement of goods, government services, and emergency response operations.</p>
<p>The Minister also called for a coordinated approach involving provincial and district authorities to ensure swift mobilisation of machinery and resources.</p>
<p>“We must act now to prevent a total shutdown of the route. The lives and livelihoods of thousands depend on it,” Minister Isoaimo said.</p>

<p>THE people of Dapera village, who were once forcefully displaced by the Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) and Rio Tinto, have celebrated the 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>8th July 1975 is a date Dapera people will never forget when they were forcefully removed from their homes, leaving behind. When the mine expanded, these were the first people affected physically, and it's in their expense and in their suffering and sacrifice that PNG gained independence in 1975, and yet nothing has been done to appreciate and compensate them.</p>

<p>At a global moment of rampant authoritarianism, emboldened tech oligarchs, media funding freezes, and both cyber and physical attacks on journalists, Ressa used her keynote address to warn that many press freedoms may only have one year left before they could be forever lost. But she recounted her own personal experience of persecution in the Philippines to show how a relentless commitment to hold powerful actors accountable — even in the face of repression — can lead to sustainable revenue and justice.</p>

      <h1>Samoa welcomes first electric fire trucks as part of green transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/samoas_electric_firetruck.jpeg?itok=eGL0Iusn"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/samoas_electric_firetruck.jpeg?itok=meEVyboV" alt="electric firetrucks"></a></p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> The Government of Samoa and Japan and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) celebrated a major national milestone with the launch last week of Samoa’s first fully electric fire fighting vehicles, and the handover of new, specialized rescue emergency equipment under the Climate Action Pathways for Island Transport (CAP-IT) Project.</p>
<p>This landmark achievement reflects the strength of the tripartite partnership and Samoa’s ongoing commitment to advancing climate-resilient, low-emission technologies while significantly enhancing the nation’s emergency response capacity.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led and blessed by Reverend Semikueva Fa’atoafe of the EFKS Moata’a, who encouraged the nation to view these new assets as symbols of peace, service, and protection for all communities in Samoa.</p>
<p>The Minister for Fire and Emergency Services, Seve Te’i Fuimaono, commended the collaboration behind this historic development.</p>
<p>“Today marks a historic step forward for Samoa’s resilience and emergency readiness. The introduction of these electric firefighting vehicles and specialised equipment demonstrates how innovation, sustainability, and strong partnerships can directly improve the safety of our people. We thank Japan and UNDP for their steadfast support in modernizing SFESA and advancing our green transformation.”</p>
<p>Funded through a grant from the Government of Japan and implemented by UNDP in close partnership with the Government of Samoa, the CAP-IT Project has enabled the conversion of two fully electric Ford F-150 Lightning into first-responder fire trucks in a world-first adaptation of electric vehicle technology for island emergency services.</p>
<p>In addition to the vehicles, Japan has provided over USD 100,000 in specialized fire fighting rescue equipment, including Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), heavy-duty cutting and spreading tools, a positive pressure ventilation fan, as well as additional equipment arriving in December, such as thermal imaging cameras and lifting and stabilization tools.</p>
<p>The Ambassador of Japan to Samoa reaffirmed Japan’s commitment to sustainable development and safety in the Pacific:</p>
<p>“Japan is honored to partner with Samoa and UNDP through CAP-IT to deliver innovative, low-carbon solutions that strengthen emergency services. These electric fire trucks are not only climate-friendly but also represent ground-breaking technology for small island states. Our partnership reflects Japan’s commitment to supporting Samoa’s national decarbonization goals and building safer, more resilient communities.”</p>
<p>UNDP Resident Representative, Aliona Niculita, further emphasized that:</p>
<p>“By deploying clean technology in essential public services, Samoa is showing the world that climate innovation can directly improve lives — protecting families, homes, and communities while contributing to national emission reduction goals.”</p>
<p>SFESA Commissioner, Tanuvasa Oloapu Petone Mauga, expressed gratitude for the support, and emphasized its impact on frontline readiness:</p>
<p>“This investment directly supports the safety of our fire-fighters and the communities we serve. Our teams respond to emergencies every day, and having reliable, modern tools including EV-based fire trucks strengthens our readiness and ensures we can protect lives with greater effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Chairperson of the SFESA Board of Directors, Aiono Meresaini Siaosi, who officiated the ribbon cutting ceremony, underscored the long-term significance of the partnership:</p>
<p>“This partnership demonstrates what is possible when nations and development partners work together with shared purpose. These vehicles and equipment represent progress, protection, and hope for our people. On behalf of the Board, we extend our sincere gratitude to Japan, UNDP, and the Government of Samoa.”</p>
<p>The fully electric fire fighting vehicles and specialised equipment will now be deployed to support SFESA’s operational duties nationwide, strengthening Samoa’s capacity in fire suppression, rescue operations, and hazardous incident response.</p>
<p>This joint achievement reinforces the shared commitment of Samoa, Japan, and UNDP to advancing green technology, protecting communities, and building a safer, more climate-resilient future for Samoa.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Margot Staunton, RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's opposition leader claims the Prime Minister is too sick to lead the country and should resign.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/575223/tuilaepa-sa-ilele-malielegaoi-samoa-s-longest-serving-leader-reflects-on-political-career">Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi</a> hit out at La'aulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Schmidt after he <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579054/samoan-pm-back-home-as-reporter-alleges-assault-outside-his-residence">returned from a two month absence in New Zealand</a>.</p>
<p>In September, La'auli was medivacced from Apia to Auckland just days after being sworn in as <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573201/laaulialemalietoa-schmidt-sworn-in-as-samoa-s-8th-prime-minister-third-leader-from-savai-i">Samoa's eighth prime minister</a>.</p>
<p>La'auli <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579168/samoan-pm-bans-nation-s-only-newspaper-from-government-access">banned</a> the nation's only newspaper from government access on his return home.</p>
<p>He barred the <em>Samoa Observer</em> from all ministerial press conferences on Monday, just days after returning on a private jet from New Zealand.</p>
<p>He also stopped his Cabinet ministers from talking to the newspaper, following an ugly scene outside his house on Saturday.</p>
<p>Journalists from the <em>Observer</em> and the <em>BBC</em> claim they <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579330/samoa-editor-responds-as-pm-la-aulialemalietoa-bans-newspaper-over-coverage">did not enter</a> the Prime Minister's compound, but were accused of trespassing by his security guards.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa said the incident outside the PM's house and the media ban that ensued were &quot;inappropriate&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it is telling the world, that the present government in Samoa is hiding things that they should have disclosed. It's a govenrment that does not recognise the rule of law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa claims the government is covering up the true nature of La'auli's illness.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumours are that he should have both legs cut (amputated), he had an accident, a fall, and his legs are absolutely useless, that's what I am told,&quot; he said.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Waves</em> has attempted to contact the Prime Minister repeatedly for a response.</p>
<p>In a text message on Thursday, La'auli said: &quot;Don't worry about Tuilaepa, I have far more better duties to serve Samoa.&quot;</p>
<p>In a social media video message while in Auckland, he said that his leg was injured while campaigning for the election in August, and that the &quot;trip for treatment was long overdue&quot;.</p>
<p>He said it was &quot;not something the country should be worried about&quot;.</p>
<p>However, Tuilaepa claims that most Samoans know the Prime Minister is unwell.</p>
<p>&quot;It is well known to all Samoans, 100 percent, although those who support the Prime Minister prefer not to know,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In our constitution, when a prime minister is unable to run the country, he ought to resign. That's where we are now, he is very sick.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573087/watch-i-ll-be-staying-on-for-the-next-five-years-fiame-naomi-mata-afa">former Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa</a> believes the media ban was &quot;reactionary&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think its an unwise position to take to have a ban, I don't think it serves the government well or the public for that matter. Especially since the <em>Observer</em> is the only print media that we have,&quot; Fiame said.</p>
<p>She said the optics for the government are not good.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now getting comments from outside sources condemning the actions taken, so I think the external scrutiny will be there for our government and that's not a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She believes there was a definite lack of transparency while the Prime Minister was on medical leave.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought the government would have been a lot more 'onto it', and kept the public informed, given the timing of the trip and the length of time he was away,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I had thought that they had a better media sense, all it really required was for a spokesperson to keep people updated. I mean if he's unwell, he's unwell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All they (the PM's team) needed to say was that he had arrived safely, that he needed to rest and that he would meet the media at a designated time.&quot;</p>
<p>Fiame admitted that while she had her own squirmishes with the newspaper while Prime Minister, she never sought to ban it.</p>

      <h1>Labubu and ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ to dazzle at Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)

<p><em>NEW YORK (AP) —</em> Two things that made massive cultural splashes this year — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/labubu-viral-plushy-influencers-2de46ecf0b2101a16ef6df4e46f4bc48">Labubu</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-summer-smash-surprise-b1f1a0390c303fb46959f6cf6e77b5ff">“KPop Demon Hunters”</a> — will fill the sky and streets of New York when the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off this year.</p>
<p>The Nov. 27 parade begins rain or shine on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances. It will feature 34 balloons, four mini-balloons, 28 floats, 33 clown groups and 11 marching bands — all leading the way for Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Here’s key things to know about the parade and how to watch it.</p>
<p>It starts at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and airs at that time in all time zones.</p>
<p>What channel is the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on?</p>
<p>It will be on NBC, available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers.</p>
<p>What if I want to stream it?</p>
<p>For cord cutters, the parade is being simulcast on Peacock and an encore telecast begins at 2 p.m. EST/PST. A Spanish language simulcast will also be on Telemundo.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/macys-thanksgiving-parade-jennifer-hudson-billy-porter-56d790dadc0485add54148d71c82f0fe">Last year,</a> more than 31 million people tuned in on NBC and Peacock, up 10% from the previous year and marking the biggest audience ever for the parade.</p>
<p>What’s the weather going to be like?</p>
<p>The Weather Channel predicts a high of 52 degrees and a partly cloudy day, with winds up to 10 mph. AccuWeather also predicts 52 degrees with intervals of clouds and sunshine and a passing shower and winds at 6 mph.

The jobless rate rose to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, from 4.3% in August, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Thursday. The August payrolls data was revised to show employers shedding jobs for the second time this year, underscoring the labor market softness.</p>

      <p>
      <p>A federal judge on Thursday moved to halt President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., a temporary legal setback to Trump’s efforts to send the military to American cities over objections of local leaders. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to enforce the law in the nation’s capital without approval from its mayor. However, she paused her ruling until Dec. 11 to allow the administration to appeal. The legal fight is playing out alongside several others across the country as Trump presses against longstanding but rarely tested constraints on presidents using troops to enforce domestic law.</p>

      <h1>Trump signs order to remove tariffs from Brazilian beef, coffee</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — President Donald Trump on Thursday removed his 40% tariffs on Brazilian food products, including beef, coffee, cocoa and fruits that were imposed in July to punish Brazil over the prosecution of its former president, Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. The move follows a similar order by the administration last Friday to remove tariffs on several agricultural products as the White House makes a U-turn on some tariffs that have increased the cost of food in the United States.</p>

<p>His remarks followed a strong warning from Opposition Leader and Kiriwina–Goodenough MP Douglas Tomuriesa, who raised concerns about secretive mining wardens’ visits, illegal foreign incursions, and reports of exceptionally rich gold deposits beneath the island.</p>

      <h1>Pasifika smoking rate is still twice the national average in NZ</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Kaya Selby, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A health leader has labelled the latest Pasifika smoking rates &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, despite the New Zealand government celebrating them.</p>
<p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said in a press release that, over the last six years, the Pacific peoples smoking rate has halved.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the survey data shows a continuation of the great progress that's been made in the last few years — especially with falling numbers of Pacific peoples' smokers and very low rates of youth smoking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Auckland University professor Sir Collin Tukuitonga said Costello was being &quot;very generous&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's dropped, no question, but it's still twice the rate as the rest of New Zealand. In other words, it's unacceptable that we have significant inequities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To claim that it's halved in the last six years is, I think, a bit generous with the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>The data that the minister referred to — from the latest New Zealand Health Survey — showed that between the 2019- 20 and 2024- 25 fiscal years, the Pasifika daily smoking rate decreased from 18 to 10.3 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Further, &quot;heavy smokers&quot; as part of the daily smoker population among Pasifika increased in that time, from 4.6 to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>Costello's office clarified to RNZ Pacific that they meant the 2018/ 19 fiscal year, which showed a drop of slightly more than half from 21 percent.</p>
<p>Pasifika smoking rates did see slight decreases from the last fiscal year in current and daily smoking rates.</p>
<p>While it showed an improvement, Sir Collin said it falls within a broader trend, and still falls well above the general population.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a long term trend downwards as a result of successive governments, not just this government policy, but educational programs and efforts by Pacific providers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So it's been a long term decline. It's just that the rate of decline is very slow compared with the rest of New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Costello said the latest results showed &quot;great progress&quot; across the whole of Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has made some of the best progress in reducing smoking rates in the world — these latest survey results show adult daily smoking has halved in the last decade,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Conversely, daily vaping rates have increased more than threefold from 3.5 percent in 2019-20 to 11.7 percent in 2024-25 for the general population.</p>
<p>For Pasifika, daily vaping has increased by more than five times during that same period, from 3.9 to 20 percent.</p>
<p>Other key indicators for Pasifika health, such as mental health and obesity, have worsened over the last six years.</p>
<p>Rates of high or very high psychological distress have more than doubled from 9.7 to 23.8 percent, while 16.2 percent of Pasifika report unmet needs for mental health and addiction care.</p>
<p>Alongside a 5.6 percent decrease in physical activity, obesity has increased from 63.8 percent to 69.5 percent, while Pasifika living with high blood pressure and high cholesterol have increased slightly.</p>
<p>The rate of ischaemic heart disease (or coronary heart disease) among Pasifika has more than doubled to 5.7 percent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hazardous drinking has seen an improvement, declining from 25.1 to 17.5 percent, and weekly heavy episodic drinking halving from 14.7 to 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Fewer Pasifika are smoking cannabis (-3.1 to 12.7 percent), while more are using cocaine (+1 to 1.7 percent) and sedatives or sleeping pills (+1.3 to 1.8 percent).</p>

      <p>HEALTH EATING FOR DIABETES</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/healthy_eating.jpeg?itok=KDnVT_Um"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/healthy_eating.jpeg?itok=tFcsy2aT" alt="Reduce sugar intake and stay active"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><strong>DIABETES CRISIS</strong></p>
<p>Deputy Minister for Public Health Minister Rennier Gadabu says diabetes is a national crisis in the country.</p>
<p>The government paper reported Rennier Gadabu attended the World Diabetes Day earlier this month.</p>
<p>Gadabu said diabetes weakens Nauru's workforce and drains its health system.</p>
<p>He said Nauru has one of the highest diabetes rates in the world, with more than one in five adults living with the disease.</p>
<p>The minister urged citizens to choose healthier meals, reduce sugar intake and stay active.</p>
<p>He also called on the government to increase and dedicate funding for non-communicable diseases, saying it is an investment in Nauru's future.</p>
<p><strong>UNITED STATES VISAS</strong></p>
<p>The United States is strengthening health screenings for immigrant visas, including for conditions like obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>The US Embassy in Wellington said they are doing strict vetting to prevent immigration of those who cannot cover their own living expenses, including medical costs.</p>
<p>NPR reported a new directive to embassies, which expands the criteria by which a visa may be denied to include more health issues and age.</p>
<p>The embassy said each application will continue to be subject to individual review from consular officers.</p>
<p><strong>PACIFIC CLIMATE</strong></p>
<p>Climate Minister Simon Watts has called on other states to back a Pacific COP hosted by Australia next year.</p>
<p>It is still unknown who will host COP31 in 2026, with both Australia and Turkey wanting to host.</p>
<p>Watts said climate change in the Pacific is not a distant threat but a lived reality.</p>
<p>He said having the climate meeting in Australia will be an opportunity to deliver global climate solutions.</p>
<p><strong>WWII MEDALS</strong></p>
<p>Families of Cook Islanders who served in the Cook Islands Local Defense Force (CILDF) but never received their Second World War medals can now apply for them.</p>
<p>While more than half the CILDF personnel were issued medals in the early 1950s, others were deemed ineligible, largely due to being discharged from service before the end of the war for minor disciplinary infractions.</p>
<p>After reviewing past medal-issuing processes, the New Zealand Defence Force has confirmed that these veterans, or their next of kin, should be eligible.</p>
<p>Researchers identified 85 Cook Islanders who qualify for medals, including the War Medal 1939-1945, the New Zealand War Service medal, and for some cases, the Defence Medal.</p>
<p>Surviving CILDF members or their families can request an application form, and families must agree on who will claim each medal and provide the required documentation.</p>
<p><strong>VANUATU NEGOTIATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Vanuatu government is preparing for the first round of formal negotiations with France on sovereignty over Umaenupne and Umaeneg, otherwise known as Matthew and Hunter Islands.</p>
<p>Permanent maritime boundaries between Vanuatu and New Caledonia are also set to be raised.</p>
<p>Local media reported Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat has appointed the Deputy PM Johnny Koanapo Rasou as lead negotiator.</p>
<p>A delegation from France, led by Special Envoy Director Benoît Guidée arrived in Port Vila on Wednesday for two days of talks.</p>
<p>This first round of negotiations follows a working visit to Paris by Prime Minister Napat in July to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>The government has appointed DLA Piper to represent Vanuatu's legal interests as it pursues sovereignty over the islands and its permanent maritime boundaries.</p>
<p>As part of the visit, the Government will host a formal dinner to welcome the French delegation.</p>
<p><strong>TUVALU  TREATY</strong></p>
<p>Tuvalu has signed a new treaty with Taiwan, elevating their bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Local media reported the Kaitasi Treaty makes it more difficult for both parties to unilaterally exit the relationship.</p>
<p>On his first state visit to Taiwan, Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Teo said it's a significant historical moment.</p>
<p>He said it sets a relationship of cooperation between Tuvalu and Taiwan for the first time, with a legal platform giving rise to legal commitments instead of mere political commitments.</p>
<p>Tuvalu and Taiwan also signed two other agreements in an effort to enhance sport and fisheries.</p>
<p><strong>NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS MINING</strong></p>
<p>Discussions over potential seabed mining in the Northern Marianas are intensifying.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's governor is urging residents to weigh in as the United States advances early steps toward possible deep-ocean mineral exploration in the region.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has released a 'request for information and interest' on mineral leasing across the CNMI's Outer Continental Shelf - which is seen as the starting point for any future commercial activity.</p>
<p>Marianas governor David Apatang is calling on the community to respond, saying broad participation is critical as Washington considers how to handle the issue.</p>
<p><strong>SOLOMON ISLANDS ECOSYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>A new initiative in Solomon Islands aims to help businesses grow in ways that protect coral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overfishing, coastal development, and land-based pollution continue to threaten reefs.</p>
<p>The 'reef-positive finance' pilot is supported by multiple organisations including the World Wildlife Fund, the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the Global Fund for Coral Reefs.</p>
<p>Susan Gardner, from the Global Fund for Coral Reefs' executive board, said this project will help local businesses grow in ways that protect reefs and strengthen community resilience in the face of the climate crisis.</p>
<p>New Zealand High Commissioner to Solomon Islands Jonathan Curr said Solomon Islanders depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods, cultures and for resilience.</p>
<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS REGISTRY</strong></p>
<p>Maritime Cook Islands has reiterated that its ship registry complies with international sanctions.</p>
<p>The ship registry has come under increased scrutiny of late, after Cook Islands-flagged tanker Eagle S was seized by Finnish authorities about a year ago on suspicion of ripping up sub sea cables.</p>
<p>The ship was also thought to be part of Russia's shadow fleet used to avoid international oil sanctions.</p>
<p>A Maritime Cook Islands spokesperson said vessels under the nation's flag comply with all UN sanctions and are prohibited from trading in Russian, Iranian, or Venezuelan petroleum products.</p>

      <h1>Little Tips, Big Purpose — Cosmetology student uses tips to support local youth athletes</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Abcde Tupa'i, a young woman from the villages of Pago Pago and Mapusaga Fou is making a meaningful difference far beyond her salon chair. Now living in the US, Tupa'i is both a cosmetology and an undergraduate student, saving every tip she earns from clients at her cosmetology school to support a group of student athletes.</p>
<p>According to Ms Tupa’i, these athletes, young boys from American Samoa, have been selected to play high school football in Santa Barbara, California, a life-changing move that, like Tupa'i's own journey, requires courage, sacrifice, and leaving behind everything familiar.</p>
<p>She told Samoa News, via email, that understanding these struggles firsthand, compelled her to support them in some way.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not easy to leave home, especially a place as comfortable as Samoa, for somewhere that demands so much of you. I know how it feels to step into the unknown to chase your dreams, and I know many of our people can relate to that too,&quot; she said</p>
<p>Inspired by the stories of these athletes and their families, Tupa'i wrote that she decided to set aside all her client tips to make a meaningful contribution. But she also acknowledged that this effort was never hers alone.</p>
<p>Support poured in from other families, friends, and especially from the boys' live-in guardian, Lele Malaki, whose daily dedication, guidance, and care have helped make the boys' transition smoother and their dreams possible.</p>
<p>The tips were used to create custom football training shirts, a small reminder that they are seen, supported, and celebrated.</p>
<p>&quot;It might not be a lot,&quot; Tupa'i says, &quot;but my motivation comes from the Samoan proverb: 'O le tele o sulu e maua ai figota, e mama se avega pe a ta amo fa'atasi,' meaning 'My strength does not come from me alone, but from many.&quot;</p>
<p>She added, &quot;We often wait to cheer for our people once they've made it. But we need to support them from the very beginning, all the way until they succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Tupa'i believes it is essential for leaders in our communities to invest in youth early on, not just after they've found success.</p>
<p>&quot;The dream was always to come to the U.S., learn all I can, and give back to American Samoa one day. But I've learned that I don't have to wait, I can start giving back now,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She encourages young Samoans to dream boldly and without limitation: &quot;You don't have to choose just one path. You can do many things at once if you work hard. And if you're intimidated by the thought that you're the only Samoan in your field, remember that you're not alone, you're the first. Be proud of that!&quot;</p>
<p>Tupa'i applauds the young athletes for daring to dream big and stepping out of their comfort zone in pursuit of their goals. She also deeply admires their families, whose prayers and love continue to nurture the boys' journey from afar and at home.</p>
<p>It's not easy to be apart from the people and places you love, but their collective sacrifice speaks volumes. She wants to give these boys the recognition they truly deserve, reminding them that they are not alone on this journey. There is a whole community behind them, proud of their courage, inspired by their determination, and cheering them on every step of the way.</p>
<p>In her quiet, determined way, Abcde Tupa'i is proving that small acts rooted in love, culture, and purpose can carry a big message: “Real change begins when we show up for each other, one tip at a time”.</p>

<p>Yesterday ASTCA personnel, in coordination with Shorelink Divers and Engineers, guided the Manu’a BLAST cable out to sea. The cable is secured within yellow cable floats, providing controlled buoyancy and visibility during marine deployment. The successful execution of this phase marks a significant step toward restoring high‑capacity connectivity to the Manu’a Islands. [courtesy photo]</p>

      <p>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A U.S. judge on Wednesday repeatedly questioned the validity of the grand jury indictment of former FBI Director James Comey secured by a prosecutor closely aligned with President Donald Trump in the latest signal that the charges may be dismissed before trial.</p>

      <h1>US shoppers find Thanksgiving relief on turkey, but feel the pinch on pricier side dishes</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Deep discounting by U.S. retailers on turkeys pushed the cost of the traditional Thanksgiving dinner lower for a third straight year, while costs for side dishes highlighted the country’s nagging debate over the cost of living. The overall decline put the price of the meal at $55.18, 5% down from 2024, the lowest since 2021, driven lower by a 16.3% decline that shoppers found in what retailers were charging for a 16-pound turkey, the American Farm Bureau Federation reported in its annual survey of holiday meal prices.</p>

      <h1>Non-profit calls for stronger action on illegal fishing and high seas transshipment</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)

<p>By</p>
<p>Iliesa Tora, RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Pew Charitable Trust believes the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) needs to do more on port side measures in order to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</p>
<p>And getting transshipment in the high seas management also needs urgent attention, WCPFC international fisheries officer Glen Holmes told RNZ Pacific.</p>
<p>Three weeks out from the WCPFC 22nd Regular Session in Manila, Holmes said the two issues are of great importance and should be receiving a lot more attention now.</p>
<p>Member countries and stakeholders will meet from 1 to 5 December.</p>
<p>Holmes said while there is progress on the important South Pacific Albacore tuna fisheries, with a management procedure expected to be adopted at the meeting, Pew believes IUU fishing and transshipment in the high seas needs equal attention.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always multiple issues to be discussed in any Commission meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things that we are particularly concerned about is the various management cracks that allow for IUU fishing to occur.</p>
<p>&quot;One of those is, for example, is port state measures management. We would like to see an improvement on that, there has been a little bit of progress intersessionally on improving the port space measures agreement, but we would like to see much more progress on that.</p>
<p>&quot;We would we would have liked to have seen something adopted this year but I don't think that is going to happen and I would like to see some progress towards strengthening that measure for next year, if it can't be done this year.&quot;</p>
<p>He pointed to the continuing problem of transshipment in the high seas as well, being one that has been discussed over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>A pending report to be released on the issue, Holmes said, has the WCPFC lagging behind the other four tuna fisheries focused Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) in the world in the management of high seas transshipment.</p>
<p>The other four tuna RFMOs are the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT).</p>
<p>Holmes said the improvement of the WCPFC transshipment measure has been a a hot topic of debate for quite a number of years now.</p>
<p>&quot;It will again be discussed in detail this year and I know that there is a benchmarking exercise that is about to be released that shows that WCPFC has the worst transshipment management of all the tuna RFMOS now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every other tuna RFMO has lifted its game and brought its individual management arrangements close to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) guidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;WCPFC is currently the laggard, so it's time for the the Commission to agree to improve its transshipment measures.&quot;</p>
<p>On why agreeing to an efficient management plan for high seas transshipment, Holmes said it is critical that member countries come to an agreement on the best way forward.</p>
<p>He said this was the major cause for delay.</p>
<p>&quot;It essentially comes down to different points of view between the members, between various Members within the Commission, as to what the problem is and, or whether a problem even exists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said there are a group of members who believe that high seas transshipment should be banned altogether.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a group of members who believe that high seas transshipment shouldn't be allowed to occur, that all the Pacific is geographically structured in such a way that ports are always relatively close to, no matter where you are in the convention area, and so vessels should be required to go into port, offload their catch where they can be observed and the catch can be verified and everything can be shown to be above board.</p>
<p>&quot;Having vessels transship onto carriers in the high seas, there's not as much oversight and so there is more opportunities for IUU activity and other illegal activity to occur.</p>
<p>&quot;Other members believe that high seas transshipment has enough oversight, saying currently there are observers on carriers, for example, and that everything is fine and there's no requirement to ban it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said these differing opinions don't seem to be heading to a compromise position in WCPFC.</p>
<p>Other RFMOS have been able to agree on what they need to do, on the other hand.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just that there has been no agreement in WCPFC, even though there has been detailed discussions every year for the last eight years now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hopeful that finally an agreement can be made to improve the transshipment measure this year.&quot;</p>
<p>OBSERVER ISSUES</p>
<p>Holmes said another critical issue that Pew has been working on with governments and partner organizations is observer coverage on long line fisheries.</p>
<p>He said the current five percent coverage is too low and needs to be changed to help improve compliance by fishing companies, adding that a one hundred percent coverage is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission only requires five percent coverage for long line on the high seas and that's not enough to one get a representative picture of what's happening from an independent source,.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And it's also not enough to really incentivize any improvement in compliance. So, there really needs to be a substantial increase in long line observer coverage and that's been our position for a number of years and it continues to be our our position.</p>
<p>&quot;It should really be at 100 percent requirement.&quot;</p>
<p>Pew also wants independent observers on the compliance review process.</p>
<p>Observers are currently not allowed, and Holmes said the WCPFC is the only Tuna commission that does not allow independent observers to sit in the compliance review processes of of the RFMO.</p>
<p>He said the Commission should open up the compliance monitoring review to allow observers to observe what's going on and therefore gain the level of transparency and give confidence to the public.</p>
<p>ALL FOR ALBACORE PLAN</p>
<p>Holmes said Pew is in agreement with WCPFC chair Josie Tamate, who told RNZ Pacific two weeks ago the adoption of a management procedure (MP) for South Pacific albacore at the upcoming WCPFC meeting is her target.</p>
<p>Tamate said Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) members who are involved in South Pacific albacore tuna fisheries have come to an agreement, which, she hopes, would lead to the adoption of a plan.</p>
<p>Holmes said Pew supports that move.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with the chair that South Pacific albacore management procedure is going to be one of the major issues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission has been working on a management arrangement for South Pacific Albacore for well over a decade now, so it's time to finally agree to something.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm actually also confident that a management procedure will be adopted and that will mean good progress for the Commission in moving towards a modernized management approach for South Pacific albacore.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a really important fishery, particularly for a lot of the islands, so that'll be really good progress if we can get that across the line.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there are other aspects that Pew want to see progress on, like the development of the big eye management procedure and how yellowfin will eventually be met.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to see progress on that as well as and there are always room for improvement and so anywhere we can make those improvements we push for,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>WCPFC chair Tamate had also confirmed in her earlier interview that a management plan for big-eye Tuna fisheries will be the next step.</p>

      <h1>Jamaica faces $9.5 billion finance gap to rebuild after Melissa</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>BELEM, Brazil — Jamaica spent years building a pot of money to handle climate-fuelled disasters. It turned out to be enough to cover just 5% of the cost wrought by one storm. Hurricane Melissa has left the island nation with bills totalling <span class="math inline">\(10 billion — only \)</span>500 million of which it can cover with climate-preparation reserves stockpiled to deal with disasters, Jamaican cabinet minister Matthew Samuda told Reuters. Jamaica is asking wealthy countries at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, to urgently offer grants, investment and concessional finance. What it does not want are commercial-rate loans that saddle the country with more debt as it faces a future expected to deliver increasingly severe climate impacts such as heatwaves, droughts, rising seas and catastrophic storms. “We don’t come as mendicants. We come as victims of the actions of others,” Samuda said in an interview at the summit, referring to the fact Jamaica has done little to cause the planet-warming emissions that are driving climate change. He said Jamaica had spent three decades improving its financial health and inching closer to an investment grade credit rating.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's Prime Minister La'aulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Schmidt, has banned the country's only daily newspaper, the Samoa Observer, from all ministerial press conferences.</p>
<p>The move has raised serious concerns among industry stakeholders about media freedom as he faces growing political and legal pressure.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa announced the ban on Monday at his first press conference in two months, held just days after returning from medical treatment in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He told journalists that the ban also applies to his Cabinet ministers. The decision follows a tense confrontation on Saturday, when journalists from Samoa Observer and the BBC went to the Prime Minister's home to confirm his return.</p>
<p>The journalists claim they remained on the public roadside but were approached by men from the PM's property, who accused them of trespassing and of behaving disrespectfully.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't respect me as the Prime Minister. In my time in New Zealand, I never saw any reporters writing so disrespectfully about leaders,&quot; La'aulialemalietoa told reporters in his office on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I was in my home for ten minutes when they arrived. They argued with the Police. They were told to leave as I was only just reuniting with my family and trying to say a prayer. My home is a private home, not a public place.&quot;</p>
<p>In a report published on Saturday, Observer editor Shalveen Chand alleges he was assaulted during the Saturday exchange, in full view of police officers nearby.</p>
<p>He says when he asked police for help, he was told to lodge a complaint at the station. He has since filed a formal report.</p>
<p>BBC journalist Dr Mandeep Rai, who witnessed the incident, says the Samoa Observer team acted &quot;carefully and respectfully&quot;, and that the hostile response was surprising. She says the difficulty in simply confirming a national leader's safe arrival raises questions about transparency and access.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister linked the ban to what he described as &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot; reporting, including stories published during his medical leave.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was away, I saw numerous reports that were wrong… especially the story about a meeting between the Deputy PM and my CEOs. A meeting that never happened.&quot;</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa says that as Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) chairperson, he had previously banned the Observer from party events, but lifted that ban when he became Prime Minister at the request of senior government officials.</p>
<p>The ban intensifies an already tense political climate in Samoa. In October, former Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa filed a ST<span class="math inline">\(1.1 million (\)</span>NZ698,000) defamation case against him, alleging he falsely linked her to interference in the murder investigation of American Samoan academic Dr Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard. The case is now before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>There are also ongoing election-related disputes, public service tensions, and growing scrutiny about the government's commitment to transparency.</p>
<p>REGIONAL PRESSURE ALSO RISING</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa's return to Samoa follows an unofficial meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in Auckland earlier this month, his first public political engagement in weeks.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed major issues, including health infrastructure, drug-trafficking in the Pacific, and labor mobility.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa confirmed plans for new hospitals in Tuanaimato and Savai'i and reiterated his support for the Pacific Justice campaign, which seeks visa-on-arrival access to New Zealand for Pacific citizens.</p>
<p>At the start of Monday's press conference, La'aulialemalietoa asked the Samoa Observer's reporter to leave his office. The exchange happened in front of the President of the Journalists Association of Samoa (JAWS) and other senior media members.</p>

      <h1>Panel of legal experts to discuss ramifications of Justices Gorsuch’s recent questioning of “Plenary Power” over U.S. Territories</h1>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Next week, legal experts from U.S. Territories will come together for a virtual panel hosted by Right to Democracy to discuss the recent statement by Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas that the Territories Clause, “rightly understood,” does not “endow the federal government with plenary power … within the Territories.”</p>
<p>Moderated by Neil Weare, co-director of Right to Democracy, the panel includes Columbia Law Professor Christina Ponsa-Kraus, Rutgers Law Professor Rose Cuison-Villazor, Cesar Lopez-Morales, Counsel at Orrick, and Anthony Ciolli, co-author of the forthcoming legal casebook Law of U.S. Territories.</p>
<p>The Virtual Panel will take place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday, November 24th at 5pm EST, 6pm AST, and 11am in American Samoa</li>
<li>Tuesday, November 25th at 8am in Guam/ Northern Mariana Islands</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the questions the panel will address includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where does the “plenary power” doctrine come from, and what does it mean for congressional power over U.S. territories?</li>
<li>Does the text and history of the Territories Clause support the perpetual exercise of plenary power of people in U.S. territories?</li>
<li>If not, what limits on congressional power might exist?</li>
<li>What does this all mean for the future of democracy, self-determination, and the protection of Indigenous/cultural rights in U.S. territories?</li>
</ol>
<p>This conversation is timely as we approach the 250th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and 125th Anniversary of the Insular Cases next year and explore how the current undemocratic colonial framework governing U.S. territories is in tension with foundational U.S. values like “consent of the governed” and “all … created equal.”</p>

<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Win Daki has reaffirmed that all businesses reserved for Papua New Guineans must be operated exclusively by citizens.</p>
<p>He said although a business reserved list already exists, successive governments and ministers have failed to update and enforce it, allowing foreign operators to enter and dominate sectors meant solely for Papua New Guineans.</p>

<p>With the 2026 National Budget set to be tabled next week, Papua New Guineans are again bracing themselves for promises of change, particularly around law and order, a sector repeatedly identified as key to driving economic growth and improving public safety yet still besieged by structural neglect and chronic under-performance.</p>
<p>Despite government assurances of commitment, critics say that the real problem has never been the absence of money but rather how it's spent, or often not spent.</p>

<p>According to Final Budget Outcome (FBO) and Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) reports, Papua New Guinea’s public debt has more than doubled over the past six years—surpassing K65 billion in 2025, well above the 35 percent debt-to-GDP ceiling set under the Fiscal Responsibility Act.</p>

(date: 2025-11-18)

      <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump denounced calls for the release of the Epstein files as a Democratic hoax. He dispatched aides to warn Republicans that backing it would be seen as a “hostile act.” He placed personal calls to those who dared to do so, and even dispatched his attorney general and FBI director to meet with one in the White House Situation Room in efforts to get her to flip.</p>

      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The UN Security Council on Monday voted to adopt a U.S.-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and authorizing an international stabilization force for the Palestinian enclave. Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza — a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal — but the UN resolution is seen as vital to legitimizing a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza.</p>

<p>The Samoa Observer confirmed his arrival on Saturday after visiting his residence in Siusega.</p>
<p>However, attempts by reporters to seek comment from the prime minister were stopped by his supporters, who told them to leave.</p>
<p>The situation escalated when the Samoa Observer editor was allegedly assaulted by two men in the presence of police officers.</p>
<p>He has since lodged a formal complaint with the police.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa later told reporters to come back on Monday.</p>

<p>Source: Samoa Govt press release</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa Ministry of Health has issued new travel advisories for all travelers entering Samoa, effective from the 3rd of this month requiring <em>all</em> travelers from infants aged 12 months and above, to have received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine at least two weeks before, or no later than 14 days prior to arrival into Samoa.</p>
<p>The advisory is part of Samoa’s swift response to the increasing number of measles cases reported in New Zealand and other neighboring countries, said Acting Director-General of Health, Tagaloa Dr. Robert Thompson.</p>
<p>“Samoa’s response aims to prevent the potential importation of measles into the country,” said Dr Thompson.</p>
<p>The advisory outlines the following key measures:</p>
<p>• All travelers, including infants aged 12 months and above, are strongly advised to have received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine at least two weeks before, or no later than 14 days prior to arrival in Samoa.</p>
<p>• Infants under 12 months of age and pregnant mothers are exempted from this requirement.</p>
<p>• Any person showing symptoms of measles — including fever, dry cough, red or watery eyes, runny nose, or a blotchy rash — is strongly advised to defer travel until fully recovered.</p>
<p>• Travelers identified with symptoms of measles upon arrival at any point of entry will be assessed and detained as required under public health regulations.</p>
<p>• All travelers are strongly advised to carry a legitimate vaccination certificate as proof of measles immunization.</p>
<p>The Acting Director-General of Health, Tagaloa Dr. Robert Thompson, said there are currently no plans for a lockdown, however, the Ministry will impose restrictions if an outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>Travelers who develop symptoms consistent with measles after arrival — including fever, cough, red or watery eyes, runny nose, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body — should isolate immediately at home or in their accommodation, and seek prompt medical attention.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Samoa woman in her late 20s freed herself after she says she was kidnapped, assaulted, and tied to an iron pole.</p>
<p>After members of her husband’s family, who were her alleged captors fell asleep, she managed to escape.</p>
<p>She reportedly then fled to a nearby household whose residents hid her and guided her to the main road to catch an early morning bus. She later reached a friend, a police officer, who accompanied her to Faleata Police Station to lodge a formal complaint.</p>
<p>The following morning, a black minivan carrying several family members reportedly returned to the house. Three women allegedly confronted her at the back of the kitchen, slapping, punching, kicking, and stomping her before putting her inside the vehicle. She reported she was also beaten with a stick and struck with an iron rod. One older female relative allegedly cut her hair with scissors, while others tied her to an iron pole. During the assault, a suspect reportedly threatened her, saying, “There is no family in Samoa that can challenge us. You will see when we get to kuā, we are going to mark you like an animal.”</p>
<p>Police said the assault followed a dispute at the victim’s home. According to her account, the confrontation began on October 30 when her sister-in-law allegedly punched her and called other relatives, claiming she had been attacked.</p>
<p>The circulation of a video showing the incident on social media has provided police with further evidence. Acting Police Commissioner Leiataua Samuelu Afamasaga confirmed the footage was recorded by the family and said the victim is now under the care of the Samoa Victim Support Group (SVSG).</p>
<p>Leiataua said the suspects are already known to police and are relatives of a notorious criminal. “The video, together with witness statements and the victim’s account, provides sufficient evidence to file charges,” he said.</p>

      <h1>Wall Street tumbles as Nvidia slides, investors fret that Fed may slow rate cuts</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday, with steep losses in Nvidia and other AI heavyweights, as investors scaled back expectations of interest rate cuts due to inflation worries and divisions among central bankers about the U.S. economy’s health. All three major U.S. stock indexes posted their steepest daily percentage declines in over a month. The U.S. government reopened after a record 43-day shutdown that had worried investors and disrupted the flow of economic data. A growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers in recent days have signaled hesitation about further interest rate cuts, pushing financial market-based odds of a reduction in borrowing costs in December to near even. Fed officials who spoke recently cited worries about inflation and signs of relative stability in the labor market after two U.S. interest rate cuts this year.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — American sailors and personnel from nine other nations recently wrapped up a two-week exercise in the South Pacific island nation of Samoa as part of an annual U.S. Navy humanitarian mission. The sailors, along with personnel from Samoa, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore and the United Kingdom, rehearsed a mass rescue in the islands, according to an Australian Defense Department news release last week Wednesday.</p>
<p>Samoa is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the drill sought to improve disaster readiness and the ability of South Pacific nations to work together, the release said. Five to nine named tropical cyclones could occur in the Southwest Pacific between this month and April, New Zealand’s National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research reported Oct. 8.</p>
<p>The expeditionary sea base USS John L. Canley arrived in Samoa on Oct. 21, the Samoan News Hub website. The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Steve Koehler, attended the closing ceremony for the exercise aboard the French patrol vessel Auguste Bénébig docked at Apia, according to the report. The Navy’s work in Samoa was part of Pacific Partnership, an annual deployment conceived after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that involves port calls in developing nations throughout the region.</p>
<p>This year’s mission, involving more than 1,500 personnel, included stops in Papua New Guinea, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Philippines, Fiji, and Tonga, according to a July 9 Navy news release. The dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor began its Pacific Partnership voyage on July 8 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.</p>
<p>The operation, led by the commander of Destroyer Squadron 31, Capt. Mark Stefanik, is focused on engineering, disaster management and medical support, according to the Navy release.</p>
<p>“This enduring mission provides us the opportunity to build on our relationships, share expertise, and learn from one another,” he said in the release. “Our shared experiences help create more resilient communities, and I’m proud to lead a team committed to strengthening partnerships across the Indo-Pacific.”</p>

      <h1>No quick fix for soaring child obesity in Polynesia Pacific health leader says</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Margo Staunton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Child and adolescent obesity is soaring in Polynesia and there is no quick fix, according to an eminent Pacific health leader.</p>
<p>The most obese 5-19-year-olds globally live in three Pacific Island nations, a UNICEF report found.</p>
<p>The report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children 2025, reveals that Niue — with a population of 1600 — tops the lot, with nearly 40 percent of children and youth being obese.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands came second with 37 percent and Nauru followed with 33 percent.</p>
<p>The report said 2025 marks an historic turning point as it is the first time global obesity has surpassed those who are underweight in the 5-19-year-old age group.</p>
<p>One fifth of the world's children and adolescents are now overweight and half of them are obese.</p>
<p>The report said global obesity was mainly driven by a shift from traditional diets to cheap, imported, ultra-processed foods and soft drinks.</p>
<p>Auckland University professor Sir Collin Tukuitonga said obesity is not a region-wide issue in the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;Overweight and obesity is more of a problem in Polynesia and to a certain extent Micronesia,&quot; Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in Melanesia — Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, under-nutrition, iron and micronutrient deficiency is still a major problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sir Collin said many people now live in urban or peri-urban areas with no access to land to grow food, and convenience was a major factor.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that people will return to growing their own staples and catching fish, I don't see that as being realistic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What needs to happen is better information and support so people moderate or reduce their consumption of ultra-processed foods.&quot;</p>
<p>He said another major factor in the trend was a rapid decline in breast feeding in the region.</p>
<p>While many mothers breastfed initially, this dropped dramatically after three months, due to pressures to return to work or church and village commitments.</p>
<p>Associated with that was a change in what he called &quot;weaning foods&quot;.</p>
<p>“Traditionally it was like fresh staples and fish, but things have changed and kids are weaned off the breast on sugar and processed food items,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Countries had put a lot of effort into trying to prevent adult obesity but the focus should now be on youth, Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given our limited capacity and resources we should put more of an effort into educating and informing young people about healthy diets... then we might in fact end up with a generation that is able to respond to the causes of it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said young obese people can later face health problems in adulthood, such as type-2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a burden of disease, that's the jargon, particularly diabetes, which then leads to kidney failure and blindness, and the social and economic costs to families and nations is enormous.&quot;</p>
<p>The way children were growing up had also changed, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have become more sedentary, using devices, families have more money to buy imported food items, and fresh fruit and vegetables are not widely eaten.&quot;</p>
<p>While there is good data on adult obesity, research into children and adolescents is relatively recent, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always been the debate over whether the Body Mass Index (BMI) is an appropriate measure for children, so there are methodological issues, but that doesn't change the findings,&quot; Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>He said while obesity is a major concern in the Pacific, finding solutions won't be easy.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the best efforts of a whole lot of people, we don't seem to have found any way of curbing the rapid rise in overweight and obesity in children and young people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One possible solution was for governments to impose a tax on unhealthy food stuffs, including soft drinks.</p>
<p>The report stated that children are considered to be overweight when they are significantly heavier than what is healthy for their age, sex and height.</p>
<p>UNICEF defines overweight as a body mass index greater than one standard deviation above the World Health Organization's median for healthy growth.</p>
<p>Obesity is more than two standard deviations above and leads to a higher risk of developing life-threatening diseases.</p>
<p>The report warns that ultra-processed and fast foods - high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives - are shaping children's diets through unhealthy food environments, rather than personal choice.</p>
<p>It said these products dominate shops and schools, where digital marketing gives the food and beverage industry powerful access to young people.</p>
<p>Without interventions to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, countries could face lifetime health and economic impacts exceeding, for example, US$210 billion in Peru, due to obesity-related health issues.</p>
<p>By 2035, the global economic impact is expected to surpass US$4 trillion annually.</p>

      <h1>'Love letter to Mum' shares dementia journey</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Susan Suisuiki, Pacific Waves presenter</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Samoan caregiver is using social media to highlight the realities of caring for someone with dementia.</p>
<p>Sapini Unoi and his mother Mutalau have gained thousands of followers on their TikTok account.</p>
<p>Unoi describes their online platform as his &quot;love letter to Mum&quot;, sharing snippets of their daily routine and conversations.</p>
<p>Speaking to Pacific Waves, Unoi said when his mother was diagnosed with dementia eight years ago, he automatically assumed the role of caring for her due to being the youngest child and identifying as fa'afafine.</p>
<p>Mutalau Unoi migrated to New Zealand from Samoa as an adolescent, attending Kelston Girls in West Auckland before heading into nursing school when she was 19 years old.</p>
<p>She spent 25 years as a nurse before she made the switch to teaching. Unoi said his mum's love of serving people at church as a Sunday school teacher inspired her to make the move.</p>
<p>However, things took a turn when Unoi noticed his mother repeating questions every hour or so. He said his mother's condition progressively got worse when she retired from teaching and when the Covid pandemic had hit.</p>
<p>Recently, Unoi made the decision to leave his full-time role to focus solely on his mother, but while it does add another level of complexity, he said he won't trade any precious time with her for a career that would still be there when his mother dies.</p>
<p>He set up a Givealittle page to raise money for living costs and bills.</p>
<p>Unoi said discussions about who will care for relatives with dementia should be normalized within Pacific families, as it wasn't the case for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost like, I'd like to say, an inheritance,&quot; Unoi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I inherited this role because of my place in my family, and because of my lifestyle and because of, again, my lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>&quot;It needs to be normalized. Because to not have the discussion, and then to expect someone to deal with what they're dealing with and then have to add on, having to be a caregiver, and then all of the emotions, the roller coaster of emotions and the exhaustion; the list goes on.&quot;</p>
<p>Unoi noted that while there are support systems and resources for people with dementia, there's barely any help for caregivers particularly those in the Pacific community.</p>
<p>The challenges of being a caregiver led to Unoi creating a Tiktok account as well as an online forum for other Pasifika caregivers.</p>
<p>He said he's been overwhelmed with the responses and messages on Tiktok.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very surreal ... although I'm very bubbly and out the gate and very outspoken, I'm still getting used to people stopping us and talking to us and noticing mum because she's the star of the show, you know, not me.&quot;</p>
<p>Unoi said reading the comments on their social media page pulls at his heartstrings.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm crying in my quiet times because how touched I am at these messages,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what pops out the most and I think again, is the scary thing which should not be scary and should be challenged, is the amount of people that are doing it by themselves, no family or family present, and no family help.&quot;</p>
<p>For other Pacific families who are coping with dementia, Unoi stresses the importance of talanoa.</p>
<p>&quot;Start to rally up as a family and start to talk about, 'what if?' What if this happens to our parents? Who is going to do it?</p>
<p>&quot;Start normalizing the conversations that need to be had, because they're vital.&quot;</p>

<p>The Port Moesby General Hospital tells us that between April and June each year, up to 50 babies are delivered every day. That amounts to a whopping 15,000 babies in just three months of the year alone. And these births are recorded every year for a while now.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will hear arguments on January 21 in President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a move without precedent that challenges the central bank’s independence. The justices said in October that they would hear arguments in the case before deciding a Justice Department request to lift a judge’s order that temporarily blocked the Republican president from removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden. That action effectively left Cook in place for the time being.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — Democratic-led states are inadvertently making their drivers’ data available to U.S. immigration authorities through a little-understood digital loophole, a group of lawmakers said Wednesday. In letters released Wednesday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and 39 other Democratic lawmakers urged like-minded governors to ensure that their residents’ data wasn’t being vacuumed up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become the speartip of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program.</p>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Justice Department has provided a legal justification that makes clear that U.S. military personnel involved in strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels are immune from prosecution, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Since early September, the U.S. military has carried out at least 19 strikes against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coast of Latin America, killing at least 76 people. Legal experts and Democratic lawmakers have questioned the legality of the strikes and many say they do not adhere to the laws of war.</p>

      <h1>Supreme Court Justices speak up: The Constitution does not grant Congress “Plenary Power” over U.S. territories</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Right to Democracy staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> U.S. Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas joined together on Monday to issue a written opinion disputing the view that the “Territories Clause” of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress with “plenary power” over residents of U.S. territories.</p>
<p>The opinion was issued in dissent to the Supreme Court’s decision not to review <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-5191.html%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Veneno v. United States</a>, in which the defendant, Quentin Veneno, Jr., <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-5191/320898/20240726123005099_Petition%20for%20Certiorari%20-%20Veneno.pdf%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">challenged</a> the Court’s 1886 decision in United States v. Kagama and “the constitutional authority [of Congress] to criminalize the conduct of Indians on Indian land.” Justices Gorsuch and Thomas would have granted review to consider whether “the federal government enjoys ‘plenary power’ over the internal affairs of Native American Tribes.” The petition for Supreme Court review in Veneno had been pending for over a year, since July 26, 2024.</p>
<p>“The idea that Congress has unrestricted plenary power over U.S. territories is not grounded in the text or history of the U.S. Constitution. But until now the federal government’s reliance on this near-unlimited power has never been questioned by any federal judge, much less a Supreme Court Justice. It is significant to have two Justices now calling into question this unrestrained congressional authority over people in U.S. territories,” said Attorney Neil Weare, co-director of <a href="https://www.righttodemocracy.us/%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Right to Democracy</a>, which works to advance democracy, equity, and self-determination in U.S. territories.</p>
<p>Monday’s opinion critiqued the idea that the Territories Clause might serve as a basis for Congress to criminalize the conduct of Indians on tribal land, stating that “[The Territories Clause” affords Congress only the power to make ‘needful Rules and Regulations’ for ‘Territor[ies] … belonging to the United States.” It then concluded that “[the Territories] Clause, rightly understood,” did not “endow the federal government with plenary power even within the Territories themselves.”</p>
<p>In support of that proposition, the opinion cited to Justice Gorsuch’s earlier concurring opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=304826987936580518&amp;q=vaello+madero&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000006%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">United States v. Vaello Madero</a>, in which he explained: “Monarchical and despotic governments may possess the power to act unrestrained by written constitutions. But our Nation's government has no existence except by virtue of the Constitution, and it may not ignore that charter in the Territories any more than it may in the States.”</p>
<p>“People across all five U.S. territories have consistently rejected the exercise of undemocratic, unchecked power over our communities by the federal government. The repudiation of this plenary power by these two conservative Justices is timely as we approach the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and consider what ‘consent of the governed’ means for people in U.S. territories who have been denied self-determination for over 125 years,” said Dr. Adi Martinez Román, co-director of Right to Democracy, an organization that does not take a position on political status.</p>
<p>“As concerns about authoritarian rule grow across the United States, these cautionary words about the breathtakingly expansive scope of congressional power over tribal communities and people in U.S. territories deserves more attention,” Weare added.</p>
<p>Right to Democracy will be convening a panel of legal experts to discuss these important developments later this month.</p>

<p>A former primary school teacher and principal has won his wrongful termination case against Porgera SDA International Primary School after the National Court found that he was unfairly dismissed over a misappropriation allegation that was later withdrawn.</p>

<p>Surgeons and theatre staff at Angau Memorial Hospital have told the Special Parliamentary Committee inquiry into the Morobe Provincial Health Authority that constant power cuts and a faulty steriliser are forcing the hospital to cancel almost half of its scheduled operations.</p>
<p>Clinicians revealed that 40 to 45 percent of surgeries are now being postponed — nearly three times higher than the World Health Organisation’s safe surgery benchmark of 15 percent. They blamed the high cancellation rate on repeated steriliser breakdowns, inconsistent power supply, and shortages of sutures and other vital consumables.</p>

(date: 2025-11-12)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Members of the House of Representatives headed back to Washington on Tuesday, after a 53-day break, braving the congestion at the nation’s tangled airports for a vote that could bring the longest U.S. government shutdown in history to a close. With nearly 1,200 flights canceled on Tuesday due to the shutdown, lawmakers including Republican Reps. Rick Crawford of Arkansas and Trent Kelly of Mississippi said they were carpooling to the Capitol, while Representative Derrick Van Orden said he was making the 16-hour drive from Wisconsin on his motorcycle.</p>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Monday approved a compromise that would end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, breaking a weeks-long stalemate that has disrupted food benefits for millions, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers unpaid and snarled air traffic. The 60-40 vote passed with the support of nearly all of the chamber’s Republicans and eight Democrats, who unsuccessfully sought to tie government funding to health subsidies that are due to expire at the end of the year. While the agreement sets up a December vote on those subsidies, which benefit 24 million Americans, it does not guarantee they will continue.</p>

      <h1>Trump says US faces ‘economic disaster’ if Supreme Court rules against tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday the United States faced an economic and national security disaster if the Supreme Court ruled against his use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs against nearly every country. Trump said his administration planned to issue a $2,000 payment to lower- and middle-income Americans using the tariff dividends, while using the remaining proceeds to lower U.S. debt. Trump, who has previously floated the idea of using tariff revenues to pay what he calls a “dividend” to lower-earning Americans, repeated it in a Truth Social post on Sunday and during remarks to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Last week I wrote about mashed potatoes but did not include the recipe. I was guilty of boiling potatoes in a pot of water, which, after the potatoes are drained, flavors as well as the starches that add creaminess, are all going down the drain. This recipe from Milk Street has only 1-1/2 cups of water to 3 cups of potatoes which is just enough water to cook the potatoes without drowning it.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — A feral rooster lands upon a Range Officer for a sip from his water bottle at the Koko Head Public Shooting Range in Hawaii Kai, Hawaii.</p>

<p>In a historical similar local connection, the Western Samoa Shooting Association was created, in part as an alternative sporting outlet, to redirect from the rampart slaughter of fruit bats, beyond the needs of individual hunters.</p>

      <h1>Pacific peoples warn of growing militarization and mining pressure on the ocean</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific civil society groups say 2025 has been a big year for the ocean.</p>
<p>Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) representative Maureen Penjueli said the Pacific Ocean is being hyper-militarized and there is a desire for seabed minerals to be used to build-up military capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;Critical minerals, whether from land or from the deep ocean itself, have a military end use, and that's been made very clear in 2025,&quot; Penjueli said during the Pacific Network on Globalization (PANG) 2025 State of the Ocean webinar.</p>
<p>&quot;They're deemed extremely vital for defense industrial base, enabling the production of military platforms such as fighter aircraft, tanks, missiles, submarines.</p>
<p>&quot;2025 is the year where we see the link between critical minerals on the sea floor and use [in the] military.&quot;</p>
<p>PANG's Joey Tau said one of the developments has been the increase in countries calling for a moratorium or pause on deep sea mining, which is now up to 40.</p>
<p>&quot;Eight of which are from the Pacific and a sub-regional grouping the MSG (Melanesian Spearhead Group) still holds that political space or that movement around a moratorium.&quot;</p>
<p>Tau said it comes as the UN-sanctioned International Seabed Authority tries to come to an agreement on deep-sea mining rules at the same time as the United States is considering its own legal pathway.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bad precedent setting by the US, we hope that the ISA both assembly and the council would hold ground and warn the US.&quot;</p>
<p>He said unlike US, China spoke about the importance of multilateralism and it for global partners to maintain unity within the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) agreement which has not been ratified by the United States.</p>
<p>Also in February was the deep sea minerals talanoa, where Pacific leaders met to discuss deep sea mining.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of our countries sit on different sides of the table on this issue. You have countries who are sponsoring and who are progressing the agenda of deep-sea mining, not only within their national jurisdiction, but also in the international arena,&quot; Tau said.</p>
<p>In May, UN human rights experts expressed concern about the release of treated nuclear wastewater.</p>
<p>Japan's government has consistently maintained the release meets international safety standards, and monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency shows there is no measurable impact beyond Japan's coastal waters.</p>
<p>However, Ocean Vision Legal's Naima Taafaki-Fifita said as well as being an environmental issue, it is also a legal and moral problem.</p>
<p>&quot;By discharging these radioactive contaminants into the Pacific, Japan risks breaching its obligations under international law,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;[The UN special rapporteurs] caution that this may pose grave risks to human rights, particularly the rights to life, health, food and culture, not only in Japan, but across the Pacific.&quot;</p>
<p>Taafaki-Fifita said it was a &quot;deeply personal&quot; issue for Pacific people who live with the nuclear legacy of testing.</p>
<p>In September, what is known as the &quot;High Seas Treaty&quot; received its 60th ratification which means it will now be legally effective in January 2026.</p>
<p>The agreement allows international waters - which make up nearly two-thirds of the ocean - to be placed into marine protected areas.</p>
<p>Taafaki-Fitita said it was important that Pacific priorities are visible and heard as the treaty gets implemented.</p>

<p><em>APIA, Samoa —</em> Pacific Partnership 2025 hosted a Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) key leadership symposium, Oct. 23-24, bringing together Samoan national leaders and representatives from partner nations including Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>This two-day conference focused on incorporating the contributions and specific needs of women into planning for disaster management, improving access to health care, preventing violence against vulnerable populations, and strengthening civil society.</p>
<p>“Pacific Partnership is about preparing in calm to respond together in crisis,” said Capt. Mark Stefanik, mission commander of Pacific Partnership 25. “That spirit of readiness extends beyond disaster response – it includes strengthening the systems that protect and empower every member of society.”</p>
<p>Loau Donina Tili Vaa, Chief Executive Officer of Samoa’s Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, delivered opening remarks on behalf of the Samoan government. She spoke about the country’s progress and ongoing challenges in advancing gender equality.</p>
<p>Vaa noted that while Samoans have seen significant improvements in girls’ performance in secondary education, women’s participation in the workforce remains disproportionately low. Domestic and sexual violence are also persistent concerns.</p>
<p>Addressing the Pacific Partnership nations present at the symposium, Ms. Vaa said, “Your collaboration reaffirms that peace is not the absence of conflict but the presence of cooperation. In Samoa, when cyclones strike or disasters unfold, it is the women’s committees and village representatives who mobilize first — assessing needs, coordinating food, and caring for children and elders long before the formal response arrives.”</p>
<p>“WPS ties together all of the Pacific Partnership lines of effort – medical, engineering, disaster management, and host nation outreach and engagement – to ensure that our efforts are having a whole-of-population impact,” said Capt. Laura Gilstrap, Women’s Affairs Advisor for Pacific Partnership 25 and the lead organizer of the event. Pacific Partnership is all about working by, with, and through local partners, and that can only be effective if we’re working with the entire population.”</p>
<p>The WPS framework, established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted Oct. 31, 2000, established the WPS framework, which reaffirms the essential role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, humanitarian response, and post-conflict reconstruction. On Oct. 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, requiring the U.S. Government to integrate women’s participation into its foreign policy, national security, and development efforts in conflict zones. In 2019, the U.S. Government released the U.S. WPS Strategy, making the United States the first country to adopt both a comprehensive law and whole-of-government strategy on WPS.</p>
<p>Pacific Partnership is the largest annual multinational humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted in the Indo-Pacific. The mission fosters multilateral cooperation and strengthens collective capacity to respond to crises while promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region grounded in shared respect and partnership.</p>

      <h1>New short story collection especially for young people searching for stories that reflect their lives</h1>

(date: 2025-11-07)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/book_cover.png?itok=1z6lYwSU"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/book_cover.png?itok=HlY8jTz8" alt="Am I There Yet? book cover"></a></p>
<p>Source: press release</p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> Samoa has an exciting new literary voice with the upcoming publication of Am I There Yet?, the debut short story collection by Samoan poet, educator, and proud fa’afafine author Nicki Perese <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The collection takes its name from the opening story, a piece that sets the emotional tone and guiding question that echoes throughout the book: “Am I there yet?” - a phrase that speaks not only to a physical journey, but to the deeper, personal movement toward identity, belonging, purpose, and self-understanding. The title becomes a metaphor for navigating life’s turning points, challenges, and quiet triumphs.</p>
<p>Although the stories in this collection are fictional, they are firmly rooted in experiences, themes, and realities familiar to Samoan and Pacific communities. Perese’s writing draws from everyday life in Samoa. Moments of humor, hardship, cultural responsibility, faith, love, identity, and the unseen emotional currents that shape who we become. Her storytelling captures voices and experiences that are often felt but rarely spoken aloud, weaving narrative with empathy and cultural memory.</p>
<p>Perese shares that her motivation for writing the collection grew from observing the world around her, conversations within villages, the vibrancy of family life, unspoken struggles between friends, and the unique spirit of Samoa’s youth. She believes storytelling is not new to Samoan people; it is part of who we are. From fāgogo shared at night, to family stories, village humor, household gossip, and everyday reflections, Samoans are natural storytellers. What she hopes this collection will encourage is the confidence for Samoans to see their stories as worthy of being written, studied, and celebrated.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her writing journey, Perese notes, “Writing is about the process, you must trust it, grow through it, and enjoy it,” spoken with the warm laughter and humility she is known for.</p>
<p>This collection is particularly meaningful as it is written by a Samoan author, for Samoan readers especially young people searching for stories that reflect their lives, their families, their language, and their dreams. It also speaks to the Samoan diaspora who continue to carry home within them, no matter where they live.</p>
<p>Am I There Yet? will be launched later this month on TalaSamoa.com, and available worldwide in both ebook and then print format.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Caleb Fotheringham &amp; Tiana Haxton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific journalists</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> There is still not enough known about the seafloor to decide if deep sea mining can start in the Cook Islands, an ocean scientist with the government authority in charge of seabed minerals says.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) returned last week from a 21-day deep-sea research expedition on board the United States exploration vessel EV Nautilus.</p>
<p>The trip was also funded by the United States and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>High-resolution imagery and data were collected in a bid to better understand what lives on the seafloor.</p>
<p>SBMA knowledge management officer Dr John Parianos said the findings would guide decisions about seabed mining.</p>
<p>&quot;One day someone will have to make a decision about what to do and it's clear today we don't know enough to make a decision,&quot; Parianos said.</p>
<p>On its return, EV Nautilus was confronted by a group of kayakers holding signs that read: &quot;Don't mine the moana&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the protesters, Louisa Castledine told RNZ Pacific she is conscious both NOAA and Nautilus had a reputation for being &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; but is concerned about research being &quot;weaponized&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This research is being used to help enable and guide decision making towards deep-sea mining,&quot; Castledine said who is the spokesperson for Ocean Ancestors.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the guise in which this research is being utilized, and it's who sent them is the challenge, because who sent them is quite clear on their intent in mining.</p>
<p>In August, the US and the Cook Islands agreed to work closer in the area of seabed minerals to &quot;advance scientific research and the responsible development of seabed mineral resources&quot;.</p>
<p>It came off the back of the Cook Islands signing a five-year agreement with China to cooperate in exploring and researching seabed minerals.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Trainer, a geopolitical analyst with Terra Global Insights, said both countries are interested in the metals to enhance military capabilities but it's not the primary market.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes are greater for other industries such as the renewable energy sectors and in China there's huge demand for electric vehicles.&quot;</p>
<p>Trainer said China is ahead of the US in obtaining critical minerals through land mining and mineral processing.</p>
<p>&quot;The US is seeming to choose to start with the supply side of things, get the minerals, and then perhaps work up the knowledge of production and refining.&quot;</p>
<p>Castledine said the region is in the middle of a &quot;geopolitical storm&quot; with the US and China vying for control over deep-sea minerals.</p>
<p>&quot;The USA's building their military might within the Pacific and this is one of those ways in which their reach is moving more into the Pacific and more specifically into Cook Islands waters.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nautilus expedition focused on discovery and the chance to test new deep-sea technology.</p>
<p>Expedition lead Renato Kane said bad weather threatened the mission, however it cleared up in time to send their ROVs down.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had six really successful dives to the sea floor. We're diving these vehicles down to over 5000 meters depth and the length of these dives were on average, about 30 hours each. So we've got a lot of high definition video footage for scientific observation on the sea floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Central to the expedition's success was the testing of a new, ultra-high-resolution camera, the MxD SeaCam, designed for deep-sea research at depths of up to 7000 metres.</p>
<p>The camera combines a compact broadcast camera with custom-built titanium housing to capture 4K images with remarkable clarity.</p>
<p>Dr John Parianos said it is some of the best footage ever recorded several kilometres below the surface.</p>
<p>He said footage would help create the Cook Islands first public catalogue of deep-sea life.</p>
<p>&quot;We've benefited from probably the highest resolution images ever taken at these depths in the whole world ever.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to make a catalogue of the types of life in the Cook Islands seabed so that researchers in the future can reference it. Having such high-quality images means that the catalogue will be even better quality than what exists internationally today.&quot;</p>
<p>Tanga Morris, who was responsible for logging data of both biological and geological discoveries on the expedition, said she was in awe of the various life forms they observed.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main ones that's quite dominant down in the deep sea would be deep-sea sponges. We've seen them in different species, morphotypes, and sizes, even a whole garden of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Other creatures found were sea stars, anemones, octopi and eels - some of which have possibly never been seen before.</p>
<p>&quot;A few people have asked questions like, 'have you guys spotted any unidentified species?' And I think we have come across a few, but then it will take a while to really be sure. But if so, what a great milestone it is for us to acknowledge that within our Cook Island waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Antony Vavia, a senior research fellow at Te Puna Vai Marama, the Cook Islands Centre for Research, said the opportunity to go onboard and study deep-sea organisms firsthand was an eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that I've seen down there has been a bit of a wow for me, [I'm] just amazed at how much life is down there. I was talking to my former supervisor, and he described us as the astronauts of the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>A notable feature of the EV Nautilus was its 24/7 online livestream.</p>
<p>He said people from around the world tuned in during dives to see the deep-sea discoveries for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Being able to show what our ROV - what is ROV, the little Hercules, is seeing in real time, and so having the wholesome thought that we're not on this exploration journey alone, but the fact that we can broadcast it to anyone that is interested and invested in learning more about our deep sea environments is incredibly rewarding, because you feel like you're pulling in others to be a part of this discovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Vavia who is also a lecturer at the Auckland University of Technology, said many schools and university groups got involved, broadcasting the deep-sea right into their classrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunities to reach out to schools from a primary school level all the way up to university has been a great opportunity to showcase the science that we're doing here, and hopefully to inspire younger generations and those that are already in the pursuit of careers in marine science or doing work on board research vessels such as the EV Nautilus.&quot;</p>
<p>The EV Nautilus crew said this element of the voyage helps to answer the public's questions on what life is found on the seabed.</p>
<p>Crew member and journalist Madison Dapcevich said they hope their passion inspires future scientists.</p>
<p>&quot;Something that's really great about Nautilus is we do have this like childlike wonder. We do get really excited about sponges, which most people are not that excited about. And then it's also a great pathway for early career professionals. So, we do have an internship and fellowship program, and those applications are open right now through the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The teams findings that will form their first public catalogue of deep-sea life will be a foundation for future research and one day, the difficult decisions about what lies beneath.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand — where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, updated the public on the Atoa o Samoa Talks — set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks — during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>This is Part II of the segment, reported in Samoa News on Wednesday, November 5, 2025.</p>
<p>During the podcast, Taupau raised the importance of fostering sporting exchanges between the two Samoas, emphasizing their potential to elevate the standard of national teams ahead of international competitions, promote genuine sportsmanship, and revive traditional sports that once served as powerful unifiers across communities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed full support for the proposal, affirming that it deserves a place on the agenda of the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks. He specifically highlighted the decline of traditional sports in Samoa, noting that the iconic Fautasi races — once a source of national pride — have largely faded from the local sporting landscape, while they continue to thrive in American Samoa.</p>
<p>“American Samoa is so far ahead in Fautasi racing,” Laauli remarked. “Villages are rowing state-of-the-art fautasi made of fiberglass and equipped with sliding seats, costing close to a million dollars. In Samoa, the opposite is happening — villages no longer want to row their old wooden fautasi.”</p>
<p>With a touch of humor, the Prime Minister suggested inviting five or six fautasi crews from American Samoa to compete during Samoa’s Independence celebrations, and playfully proposed that their hosts offer to sell the boats at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Laauli lamented the decline of Samoan kirikiti (cricket) in Samoa, where the sport was first introduced by missionaries in the 19th century and once flourished as a national pastime. He recalled that village matches often spanned two to three days, drawing crowds and fostering community spirit.</p>
<p>“Now, it is practically a dead sport in Samoa because everyone is playing international cricket,” Laauli remarked. “The benefits of international cricket are all very well, but Samoan kirikiti used to be our national sport — and it needs to be revived.”</p>
<p>He noted that, like fautasi racing, kirikiti remains vibrant in American Samoa and among Samoan diaspora communities in New Zealand, Australia, Hawai‘i, and the U.S. mainland. “But in Samoa, where it all began, it’s practically extinct. That’s very sad, and something must be done to bring it back.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the golden era of sports in both Samoas, the Prime Minister reminisced about the excitement of inter-island competitions across rugby, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and especially boxing.</p>
<p>“Those were the golden years of boxing in both Samoas,” he recalled. “We produced formidable boxers like George Tanoa, Aso Paletaoga, Vai, my cousin Fosi Schmidt, Monty Betham, and William White. Samoan boxers were a force to be reckoned with—and they were respected throughout the Pacific region.”</p>
<p>Following the discussion on sports, Taupau shifted the dialogue to joint agricultural initiatives, specifically livestock development aimed at providing consumers in American Samoa with access to fresh meat sourced from Samoa.</p>
<p>The proposal has sparked considerable controversy, with critics — including members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament.</p>
<p>Taupau asked Prime Minister Laauli whether he plans to revisit the matter when the Atoa o Samoa Talks resume next year.</p>
<p>In response, Laauli acknowledged the complexity of launching a cattle farming operation, noting that such an undertaking would only be viable as a joint venture. He proposed a collaborative model involving the purchase of up to 2,000 cattle from Australia, to be divided between the two governments.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister emphasized that the primary goal is to make fresh meat more accessible to consumers in American Samoa, in contrast to the current reliance on meat that has been refrigerated for extended periods. He further claimed that the practice of importing fresh meat from Samoa — once approved by the USDA — was abruptly discontinued following the September 11 terrorist attacks, citing heightened security and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>Laauli affirmed that key agricultural exports —i ncluding taro, bananas, fish, and vegetables — have already received approval for trade between Samoa and American Samoa. He noted that following the FAST party’s rise to power in 2021, he personally advocated for a joint agricultural venture between the two governments to strengthen regional food security.</p>
<p>As part of a pilot initiative, Samoa donated five cattle, five sheep, and over 500 oysters to American Samoa, laying the groundwork for future collaboration in livestock and aquaculture development.</p>
<p>However, the project drew criticism from members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament, who accused the previous administration of gifting 400 acres of government land to the American Samoa Government — despite the fact that the proposed cattle farm had not yet commenced.</p>
<p>“Despite the political allegations, I remain fully committed to this initiative,” Laauli declared. “It is a vital development that will benefit both countries, and I urge any future administration to continue its implementation to ensure food security for the well-being of our people.”</p>
<p>Taupau concluded the interview by turning attention to the highly anticipated Rugby League Pacific Championship final this weekend between Toa Samoa and the New Zealand Kiwis. He asked the Prime Minister whether he planned to travel to Australia to witness the match in person.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that he had received an official invitation from Australia but shared that he would not be attending due to medical advice. His doctor has advised against air travel given his current physical condition.</p>
<p>In his stead, Laauli announced that the Minister for Sports, Laumatiamanu Ringo Purcell, will represent the Government of Samoa at the match.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the sons of Samoa who have stepped forward to represent their heritage on the international stage.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that many of these gifted athletes had been offered substantial financial incentives to play for New Zealand or Australia. Yet, they chose instead to honor their roots — traveling at their own expense to don the blue jersey and represent Samoa with pride.</p>
<p>“As the Samoan proverb goes, ‘E lele le toloa ae ma’au i le vai’—the tolóa, or Pacific duck, may fly far, but it always returns to the water,” Laauli reflected. “Wherever in the world you reside, and wherever in the world you were born, Samoa is your heritage—the land of your ancestors. Thank you for your service.”</p>

This increase is all the more striking given that last year the ballot was open for almost three months, whereas this year it was only open for one.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA</em>— The Atoa o Samoa Talks between the governments of Samoa and American Samoa are set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand—where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, confirmed the update during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>Taupau opened the conversation by reflecting on the historic ceremony marking the official opening of the 18th Parliament of the Independent State of Samoa, held on September 16, 2025. During the occasion, the Prime Minister, members of Cabinet, and Members of Parliament were formally sworn in by the Head of State, His Highness Tuimalealiifano Vaaleto‘a Sualauvi II.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula, Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, and House Speaker Savali Talavou Ale, representing the American Samoa Government.</p>
<p>“It was a historic moment for the Territory,” noted Taupau, “as it marked the first time a sitting Governor of American Samoa and Fono leaders were formally invited to such a prestigious occasion.”</p>
<p>He then posed the question: “What inspired your decision to extend this special invitation to the leaders of American Samoa?”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli responded that he felt it was the right thing to do not only as a courtesy from one leader to another, but also from one family member to another.</p>
<p>&quot;We are family,&quot; he declared. &quot;We speak the same language, we observe the same culture and traditions, our lineages intertwine, we are one people.</p>
<p>&quot;The Samoan salutation, 'Mai le tai samasama o le Tui Manu'a ma Malaetele, seia paia Fili ma Puletuu na tauilo ai Malo,' immortalizes the sacred geography of the Samoan islands. From the sacred islands of the Tui Manu'a, to the sacred thresholds of chiefs and ceremonial guardians in Savaii veiled in reverence.&quot;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister expressed his hope that the recent ceremony would set a meaningful precedent for future leaders of Samoa. He emphasized the importance of the Samoan people witnessing the active participation of American Samoa’s leadership in prestigious national events, describing it as a powerful gesture of mutual respect and cooperation.</p>
<p>“It was overwhelming and uplifting to hear the audience applaud and cheer when Governor Pula, Senate President Tuaolo, and Speaker Savali entered the venue,” the Prime Minister shared. “It was a sign of recognition — an affirmation of the respect between the leaders of our two countries. You see, we may be under different political jurisdictions, but we are one people.”</p>
<p>After the ceremony on Sept 16th, which was held at the Multi-Purpose Gymnasium within the government’s sports complex at Tuana’imato, Governor Pula and the Fono leaders held a meeting with Laauli later in the day. It was an especially significant meeting, because it marked the first time an American Samoa Governor and Fono leaders have met a Samoa Prime Minister inside the Cabinet Room.</p>
<p>During the discussions, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of holding regular Atoa o Samoa Talks to strengthen cooperation and address shared challenges and opportunities faced by the two Samoas.</p>
<p>&quot;Our discussion with Governor Pula and the Fono leaders was brief, owing to time constraints related to their return flight to the Territory that same day,&quot; Laauli recalled. &quot;Nevertheless, it was a highly constructive exchange, and we reached consensus on several key issues of mutual importance.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli reflected on Governor Pula’s remarks during their brief meeting noting their shared emphasis on preserving the cultural ties that bind the two Samoas.</p>
<p>“He acknowledged that while collaboration on socio-economic development is vital, it means little if we fail to prioritize the truth that we are of the same blood, flesh, and bone,” Laauli said. “But if we work together as one family, then whatever we achieve — whether great or small — we share as a family that endures hardship together. What is good for American Samoa is also good for Samoa and vice versa.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that Governor Pula extended a personal invitation for him to visit Manu‘a, which he has graciously accepted. He also shared that Senate President Tuaolo and House Speaker Savali invited him and members of the Samoa Parliament to observe sessions of the American Samoa Legislature.</p>
<p>In turn, Prime Minister Laauli extended a reciprocal invitation for American Samoa lawmakers to attend and observe proceedings of the Samoa Parliament, reinforcing a spirit of mutual respect and legislative exchange.</p>
<p>Taupau informed the Prime Minister that upon their return to the Territory, the Fono leaders introduced a concurrent resolution calling for the resumption of the Atoa o Samoa Talks. The resolution was unanimously passed by both chambers of the American Samoa Legislature.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his gratitude to the Fono leadership for their commitment to advancing the Atoa o Samoa Talks, affirming that the initiative is moving forward as previously discussed.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the history of the initiative originally known as the  2Samoa Talks when he first entered politics in 2006 — Laauli noted that nearly two decades have passed since its inception, yet no concrete policies have been implemented to address key areas of social and economic development affecting the standard of living in both countries.</p>
<p>He attributed this lack of progress to recurring conflicts with federal policies and shifting priorities among successive administrations leading the executive branch of the American Samoa Government.</p>
<p>When the Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party first came to power five years ago under the leadership of then Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata‘afa, the 2Samoa Talks was renamed the Atoa o Samoa Talks.</p>
<p>Laauli recalled encouraging then Prime Minister Fiame to pursue deeper collaboration with the American Samoa Government, emphasizing the many potential benefits rooted in the close cultural ties shared by the two Samoas.</p>
<p>He noted that American Samoa’s unique relationship with the United States Federal Government affords it certain advantages — benefits that, through strategic cooperation, could also positively impact Samoa.</p>
<p>One such example is the remittances sent by Samoa workers employed at the canneries in American Samoa. These U.S. dollar transfers, when converted to Samoa tala, effectively double in value, providing significant economic support to families in Samoa.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli stated that his administration has been focused on stabilizing the urgent financial crisis it inherited from the previous government. The severity of the situation necessitated the adoption of an Emergency Budget under Article 105 of the Constitution, which provides for special financial measures in response to unforeseen national challenges.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the financial situation is now under control, and a short-term fiscal plan has been developed to guide the government over the next three months. With this groundwork in place, the Prime Minister affirmed that the resumption of the Atoa o Samoa Talks is now the administration’s next priority, with the exact date to reconvene the dialogue to be announced sometime at the beginning of 2026.</p>
<p>Responding to questions about the long-term plans initiated by the previous administration to establish a Samoa Consulate General's Office on land allocated by the American Samoa Government in Tafuna, Laauli confirmed that the project will proceed as planned. He further noted that Cabinet has approved amendments to the project’s scope to better align with current priorities.</p>
<p>In a gesture of reciprocity, the Samoa Government has earmarked land at Taumeasina, Moata‘a for the future construction of an American Samoa Embassy in the Independent State of Samoa — cementing a deepening commitment to diplomatic presence and bilateral cooperation between the two Samoas.</p>
<p>Laauli stated that upon his return to Samoa, he will meet with Samoa’s Consul General to American Samoa, Fata Brian Kaio, who is expected to present the feasibility study that will determine whether construction of a permanent consulate facility should proceed.</p>
<p>“I personally believe the need for a dedicated Consulate General’s Office is well justified,” Laauli explained. “Thousands of Samoan nationals work in the canneries and across various sectors in the Territory, and many have made American Samoa their permanent home.”</p>
<p>The Samoa Consulate General’s Office in American Samoa was officially established in 2005 at the Methodist Iupeli Siliva Building in Fagatogo, following approval from the U.S. State Department. On July 31, 2023, the office relocated to its current premises at Unit 108, Mosooi Business Center in Ottoville, Tafuna.</p>
<p>“It has been two decades, and we’re still renting office space,” the Prime Minister remarked. “It’s time we make this a reality — establish a permanent presence to better serve our citizens with their immigration and travel needs.”</p>
<p>He also shared that Cabinet-approved amendments to the project include the construction of additional facilities to provide housing for cannery workers from Samoa, further reinforcing the government’s commitment to supporting its diaspora in the Territory.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli stated that the timeline for construction will be guided by the recommendation of Consul General Kaio, whose long-standing residence in the Territory has given him a deep understanding of the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>However, he affirmed that the government stands ready to move forward with this important undertaking.</p>
<p>Taupau also raised concerns regarding the welfare of Samoa nationals employed at the StarKist canneries in American Samoa, emphasizing Samoa’s ongoing efforts to advocate for improved employment conditions.</p>
<p>He highlighted the need to include decent living quarters for these workers —similar to the accommodations provided for Samoa’s seasonal workers in New Zealand and Australia where housing is a standard component of their employment agreements.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his gratitude to the StarKist company for its longstanding commitment to employing Samoa nationals in American Samoa. He emphasized that the Samoa Government’s relationship with StarKist — facilitated through the support of the American Samoa Government — is a well-established partnership that predates the current Seasonal Workers Programs in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>“It has been a close and complementary relationship that has withstood the test of time and circumstance,” Laauli affirmed. “Why? Because dialogue is easy — we speak the same language and we understand each other well.”</p>
<p>However, the Prime Minister acknowledged that challenges remain. He cited data from American Samoa authorities indicating that Samoan nationals significantly outnumber U.S. nationals in the inmate population at the Tafuna Correctional Facility (TCF) — a reality he said he does not take lightly.</p>
<p>Laauli noted that many of those incarcerated are employees of the StarKist company, and that their offenses often stem from difficult living conditions and unfavorable circumstances within their immediate environment. He underscored the need for proactive measures to address these social vulnerabilities, including improved housing and support systems for Samoa workers in the Territory, and particularly the lack of affordable rental housing. He noted that many are compelled to live with relatives, where they are expected to contribute not only to daily household expenses but also to cultural obligations — fa'alavelave.</p>
<p>Laauli emphasized that this issue warrants serious and sustained discussion during the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks, as it directly affects the well-being and stability of Samoa nationals residing in the Territory.</p>
<p>He reiterated that this concern is a driving factor behind his decision to incorporate housing facilities into the development plans for the new Consulate General’s Office in Tafuna. These accommodations are intended to support Samoa workers who currently face housing insecurity. The Prime Minister also noted that StarKist management is planning a similar initiative, with proposed housing facilities in Atu‘u to better serve their workforce.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau continued with other areas of concern and interest in developing the relationship between the two Samoas — such as Sports, Agriculture, etc. Samoa News will report further on the appearance of Prime Minister Laauli on this segment this week.</p>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday cleared the way for Florida to enforce a law restricting real estate and land purchases by Chinese citizens, rejecting claims it violates federal law and discriminates against Asians. The 2-1 ruling by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could encourage other states to adopt so-called alien land laws, which were once common but fell out of favor a century ago. Lawmakers in more than 30 states have passed or introduced bills restricting foreign property ownership. The 11th Circuit said four Chinese citizens represented by the American Civil Liberties Union lacked legal standing to sue over Florida’s 2023 law because it only applies to people “domiciled” in China, and they have lived in Florida for years.</p>

It touches every community on Earth, from small islands in the Pacific to farming heartlands on every continent. It demands that, even in a fractured world, we still  find common purpose.

<p>Papua New Guinea’s glaring lack of an official waste oil policy will likely persist for months, possibly extending into 2026, as the Minister responsible still awaits the Environment Conservation and Protection Authority (CEPA) to finalize the draft document.</p>
<p>The country continues to operate large industrial sectors and resource projects without a clearly defined policy to regulate the disposal of waste oil, which are by-products of combustion and heavy machinery usage.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Sixty-two haka groups are set to perform in Tauranga next week at the 25th anniversary of Te Mana Kuratahi, the National Primary Schools Kapa Haka competition.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018913224/kids-kapa-haka-competition-kicks-off-in-south-island-for-first-time">small beginnings</a> with just over 20 rōpū, Te Mana Kuratahi has grown into a nationwide celebration of Māori excellence and identity, with the competition running all week — from Monday to Friday — to accommodate all the groups.</p>
<p>Among those taking the stage are the defending champions Te Kapa Puāwai of Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Hoani Waititi Marae from Auckland, who have competed in every Te Mana Kuratahi since it began 25 years ago, lifting the national title a record setting four times.</p>
<p>Kaiārahi o Te Kapa Puāwai Te Ora Pahewa said it was a surreal feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;I stood on that first stage in 2000 at Hopuhopu representing my kura, our entire school, our whānau, both sets of grandparents were there to tautoko. You felt like a superstar.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, to stand here as the kaiārahi, guiding our next generation, it's come full circle. The scale might be bigger, but the kaupapa hasn't changed, pride in who you are, and belief in your ao Māori.&quot;</p>
<p>Māori health coalition asked those attending Te Mana Kuratahi to <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/577329/people-going-to-tauranga-kapa-haka-event-asked-to-take-measles-precautions">take precautions to prevent measles from spreading</a>.</p>

<p><strong>RNZ PACIFIC CYCLONE WATCH SERVICE ACTIVATED</strong></p>
<p>The South Pacific cyclone season officially started Nov. 01, 2025 and will run through to April 2026.</p>
<p>Meteorologists are predicting five to nine cyclones <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/575847/up-to-nine-tropical-cycones-forecast-for-pacific-this-season">for the southwest</a> Pacific in this season.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific's Cyclone Watch Service has become an important communications lifeline for Pacific nations and territories over the years, who are affected by the ever-increasing number of tropical cyclones in the Region.</p>
<p>Our information comes from Meteorological Services in the region. We also attempt to get damage reports from local government authorities and non-governmental agencies who are active in the field, as well people on the ground, who have been affected by the Cyclone.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific broadcasts official vital weather updates and information via our shortwave transmitter. When local power grids and transmission facilities have been rendered inoperable by a cyclone, our broadcasts may be the only updates that people in the Island nations and territories can receive.</p>

<p><strong>CONJOINED TWINS IN PNG</strong></p>
<p>The parents of conjoined twins in Papua New Guinea who had hoped to send their babies to Sydney for surgery are now desperately trying to go to Germany instead, saying Australia is too expensive.</p>
<p>Male twins Tom and Sawrong were born on 9 October in remote PNG, joined at the lower abdomen.</p>
<p>The boys share a single liver and portions of their gastrointestinal tract. One twin also has a congenital heart defect and only one kidney.</p>
<p>They are currently receiving care in Port Moresby's public hospital, which is not equipped to handle complex neonatal cases.</p>
<p>Conjoined twins are extremely rare, accounting for just one or two in every 100,000 births. Most cases result in miscarriage or stillbirth, and even when born alive the twins have a low chance of survival.</p>

<p>By Talaia Mika, Cook Islands News</p>
<p>Source: Cook Is. News via RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The newly appointed Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) commissioner Beverly Stacey-Ataera says public trust and open dialogue will be at the centre of the Cook Islands' seabed minerals journey.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera told Cook Islands News she welcomes scrutiny from environmental groups and the wider community, adding that public accountability strengthens the Authority's work.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome their feedback,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have an incredibly important role, and we enjoy working with them. They need to hold us accountable and make sure that everything's being done properly, which it is, but it's good to have that additional people out there who are having an oversight so that we have the trust of the people. They do just as important a job as we do, so it's great.&quot;</p>
<p>Her comments come as debate continues over the future of the industry, with environmental advocates calling for caution while government says seabed minerals could support the nation's long-term resilience.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera stressed that no decision has been made to mine, and the priority is research, understanding and public engagement.</p>
<p>&quot;We reaffirm, we're not mining. We're not mining at all,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in exploration phase, which is just science, and quite possibly the coolest thing ever is doing the science.&quot;</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera said the Authority is focused on completing scientific studies with licence holders to better understand the seabed environment.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Cook Islands government granted licenses for exploratory work to three seabed mining companies — CIC, CIIC Seabed Resources and Moana Minerals. The exploration is now in the fourth year of a five-year phase to assess the feasibility of deep-sea mining for mineral rich polymetallic nodules.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera reiterated their immediate focus is &quot;completing the scientific research with our license holders&quot;.</p>
<p>She feels &quot;incredibly humbled&quot; to lead the Authority and remains committed to ensuring Cook Islanders are informed and involved.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to do the scientific research. We need to understand the environment, and then we need to share that with our people, and then our people will make a decision about what they want to do.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome everybody to come and have a chat with us. We're moving towards more consults and going out with more information, so stay tuned. We've got a lot of exciting things to share with you.&quot;</p>

      <h1>‘We’re not a violent city’: Chicago locals take on ICE block-by-block</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>CHICAGO — The immigration agents’ tear gas grenades clinked and then exploded against the concrete, shrouding the block in plumes of white gas. The dozen or so residents at the scene only screamed louder. “We don’t want you here,” yelled Rae Lindenberg. The 32-year-old, who works in marketing, ran out of her apartment when she heard the shrill sound of whistles. “Get out of our neighborhood!” The squad of agents had appeared in Lakeview last month, an upscale neighborhood dotted with dog daycares, medical spas and vegan restaurants, hopping over a gate to chase down a construction worker who was handcuffed and shoved into a vehicle.</p>

      <h1>Bessent says high US interest rates may have caused housing recession</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Parts of the U.S. economy, particularly housing, may already be in recession because of high interest rates, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday, repeating his call for the Federal Reserve to accelerate rate cuts. “I think that we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,” Bessent said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “And the Fed has caused a lot of distributional problems with their policies.” Bessent said that, although the overall U.S. economy remains solid, high mortgage rates still hinder the real estate market. Housing, he said, is effectively in a recession that is hitting low-end consumers the hardest because they have debts, not assets. Pending home sales in the United States were flat in September, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
