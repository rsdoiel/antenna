Court appears inclined to uphold TikTok ban in US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, updated: 2025-01-12, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Supreme Court seemed inclined on Friday to
uphold a law that would force a sale or ban the popular short-video app
TikTok in the United States by Jan. 19, with the justices focusing on
the national security concerns about China that prompted the
crackdown.</p>

<p>(BPT) - As we turn the page to a new year, many of us are writing our
list of resolutions. While grand goals like “lose weight” or “eat
healthier” often take center stage, these can quickly feel like a
mountain too steep to climb, leaving many of us overwhelmed before we
even begin. This year, it’s time to flip the script on those common
lofty resolutions and, instead, prioritize small, purposeful changes
that can offer real and tangible health benefits.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS &amp;#8212; Global auto suppliers are working out how much of their production can be moved to the United States, or closer to it, as a defense against tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, according to industry executives at CES in Las Vegas. The auto industry has already experienced eight years of U.S. protectionism, from real and threatened tariffs during Trump&amp;#8217;s first term and then more tariffs and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden. Most of those measures were aimed squarely at China, in particular a proposal by the Biden administration to bar Chinese software and hardware from cars on U.S. roads. But Trump has vowed to go much further, imposing a blanket tariff of 10% on global imports into the United States and a far higher 60% tariff on Chinese goods. In late November, he specifically pledged a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico when he takes office on Jan. 20. &lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2025-01-10, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
