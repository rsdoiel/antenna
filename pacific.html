<p>(BECQ) — The Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality analyzes
water samples collected from Managaha’s recreational beaches and dock as
part of the regularly scheduled sampling.  None of the samples collected
this week contained excessive concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria
nor did they exceed CNMI marine water quality standards. Therefore, BECQ
assigns all of the sampled beach sites a green flag. Enjoy our
waters!</p>
