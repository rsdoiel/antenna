<p>date: 2024-02-22, updated: 2024-02-22, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>MY college lacrosse teammates and I were required to run two miles in
twelve minutes (or less) at the beginning of each season or we’d be made
to run before each daily practice until we succeeded — a fitting test, I
suppose, of the will and physical prowess needed for the sport.  It
usually took me three or four tries before making time each year — some
did it on their first try.  A few others never could run it in time, so
they kept our sideline benches warm throughout the season… not fun
especially during the winter months.</p>

<p>THE Pacific region is in the spotlight as a zone of competition for
power between the US and China. In New Zealand, the government is
weighing up a potential role as a junior partner in AUKUS, the nuclear
submarine military pact between Australia, the UK and the U.S. AUKUS is
designed to contain China’s influence in the Pacific, and is among a
range of agreements that would open the door to greater military
activity in the region.</p>
