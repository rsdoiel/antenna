crossroads of civilizations in Istanbul</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-04, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Some of my most vivid memories from my first visit to Istanbul in the 1970s are of the colorful locals. Scruffy kids sold cherry juice, and old men would grab huge cucumbers from wheeled carts, then peel, quarter, and salt them, and sell them for pennies. While the Old World magic in many parts of the city has been plowed under by modern affluence, today&amp;#8217;s Istanbul is every bit as rich and rewarding as it was back then.&lt;/p&gt;
