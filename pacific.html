Watch: Petrologists gather to discuss challenges and goals in
understanding Kilauea chemistry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;During the most active portion of their life cycle, called the shield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes erupt frequently and mostly produce a rock type called basalt. Basaltic lava flows formed during the shield stage make up the majority of the rock of the Hawaiian Islands. Kilauea, one of the world&amp;#8217;s most active volcanoes, is a modern example of a volcano in the shield-building stage.&lt;/p&gt;

I eat and drink regional specialties with gusto, feasting on steak and red wine in Tuscany and stuffing down tapas at midnight in Spain. So when I travel to countries that are known for their beer, I morph into the best beer aficionado I can be.&lt;/p&gt;
