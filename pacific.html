US is heading for recession or just ‘detox,’ downturns are costly</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) — U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says a
recession would be “worth it” to get President Donald Trump’s economic
policies in place, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has spoken of
a coming period of “detox” and Trump himself says the economy is in
“transition.”</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-13, updated: 2025-03-13, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality analyzed water
samples collected from Managaha’s recreational beaches and dock as well
as from Rota’s recreational beaches and storm drainages this week.  None
of the samples contained excessive concentrations of fecal indicator
bacteria nor did they exceed CNMI Marine Water Quality Standards.
Therefore, BECQ assigns all of the sampled beach sites a green flag.
Enjoy our waters!</p>
