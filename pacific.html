<p>By</p>
<p>Caleb Fotheringham &amp; Tiana Haxton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific journalists</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> There is still not enough known about the seafloor to decide if deep sea mining can start in the Cook Islands, an ocean scientist with the government authority in charge of seabed minerals says.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) returned last week from a 21-day deep-sea research expedition on board the United States exploration vessel EV Nautilus.</p>
<p>The trip was also funded by the United States and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>High-resolution imagery and data were collected in a bid to better understand what lives on the seafloor.</p>
<p>SBMA knowledge management officer Dr John Parianos said the findings would guide decisions about seabed mining.</p>
<p>&quot;One day someone will have to make a decision about what to do and it's clear today we don't know enough to make a decision,&quot; Parianos said.</p>
<p>On its return, EV Nautilus was confronted by a group of kayakers holding signs that read: &quot;Don't mine the moana&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the protesters, Louisa Castledine told RNZ Pacific she is conscious both NOAA and Nautilus had a reputation for being &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; but is concerned about research being &quot;weaponized&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This research is being used to help enable and guide decision making towards deep-sea mining,&quot; Castledine said who is the spokesperson for Ocean Ancestors.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the guise in which this research is being utilized, and it's who sent them is the challenge, because who sent them is quite clear on their intent in mining.</p>
<p>In August, the US and the Cook Islands agreed to work closer in the area of seabed minerals to &quot;advance scientific research and the responsible development of seabed mineral resources&quot;.</p>
<p>It came off the back of the Cook Islands signing a five-year agreement with China to cooperate in exploring and researching seabed minerals.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Trainer, a geopolitical analyst with Terra Global Insights, said both countries are interested in the metals to enhance military capabilities but it's not the primary market.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes are greater for other industries such as the renewable energy sectors and in China there's huge demand for electric vehicles.&quot;</p>
<p>Trainer said China is ahead of the US in obtaining critical minerals through land mining and mineral processing.</p>
<p>&quot;The US is seeming to choose to start with the supply side of things, get the minerals, and then perhaps work up the knowledge of production and refining.&quot;</p>
<p>Castledine said the region is in the middle of a &quot;geopolitical storm&quot; with the US and China vying for control over deep-sea minerals.</p>
<p>&quot;The USA's building their military might within the Pacific and this is one of those ways in which their reach is moving more into the Pacific and more specifically into Cook Islands waters.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nautilus expedition focused on discovery and the chance to test new deep-sea technology.</p>
<p>Expedition lead Renato Kane said bad weather threatened the mission, however it cleared up in time to send their ROVs down.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had six really successful dives to the sea floor. We're diving these vehicles down to over 5000 meters depth and the length of these dives were on average, about 30 hours each. So we've got a lot of high definition video footage for scientific observation on the sea floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Central to the expedition's success was the testing of a new, ultra-high-resolution camera, the MxD SeaCam, designed for deep-sea research at depths of up to 7000 metres.</p>
<p>The camera combines a compact broadcast camera with custom-built titanium housing to capture 4K images with remarkable clarity.</p>
<p>Dr John Parianos said it is some of the best footage ever recorded several kilometres below the surface.</p>
<p>He said footage would help create the Cook Islands first public catalogue of deep-sea life.</p>
<p>&quot;We've benefited from probably the highest resolution images ever taken at these depths in the whole world ever.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to make a catalogue of the types of life in the Cook Islands seabed so that researchers in the future can reference it. Having such high-quality images means that the catalogue will be even better quality than what exists internationally today.&quot;</p>
<p>Tanga Morris, who was responsible for logging data of both biological and geological discoveries on the expedition, said she was in awe of the various life forms they observed.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main ones that's quite dominant down in the deep sea would be deep-sea sponges. We've seen them in different species, morphotypes, and sizes, even a whole garden of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Other creatures found were sea stars, anemones, octopi and eels - some of which have possibly never been seen before.</p>
<p>&quot;A few people have asked questions like, 'have you guys spotted any unidentified species?' And I think we have come across a few, but then it will take a while to really be sure. But if so, what a great milestone it is for us to acknowledge that within our Cook Island waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Antony Vavia, a senior research fellow at Te Puna Vai Marama, the Cook Islands Centre for Research, said the opportunity to go onboard and study deep-sea organisms firsthand was an eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that I've seen down there has been a bit of a wow for me, [I'm] just amazed at how much life is down there. I was talking to my former supervisor, and he described us as the astronauts of the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>A notable feature of the EV Nautilus was its 24/7 online livestream.</p>
<p>He said people from around the world tuned in during dives to see the deep-sea discoveries for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Being able to show what our ROV - what is ROV, the little Hercules, is seeing in real time, and so having the wholesome thought that we're not on this exploration journey alone, but the fact that we can broadcast it to anyone that is interested and invested in learning more about our deep sea environments is incredibly rewarding, because you feel like you're pulling in others to be a part of this discovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Vavia who is also a lecturer at the Auckland University of Technology, said many schools and university groups got involved, broadcasting the deep-sea right into their classrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunities to reach out to schools from a primary school level all the way up to university has been a great opportunity to showcase the science that we're doing here, and hopefully to inspire younger generations and those that are already in the pursuit of careers in marine science or doing work on board research vessels such as the EV Nautilus.&quot;</p>
<p>The EV Nautilus crew said this element of the voyage helps to answer the public's questions on what life is found on the seabed.</p>
<p>Crew member and journalist Madison Dapcevich said they hope their passion inspires future scientists.</p>
<p>&quot;Something that's really great about Nautilus is we do have this like childlike wonder. We do get really excited about sponges, which most people are not that excited about. And then it's also a great pathway for early career professionals. So, we do have an internship and fellowship program, and those applications are open right now through the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The teams findings that will form their first public catalogue of deep-sea life will be a foundation for future research and one day, the difficult decisions about what lies beneath.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand — where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, updated the public on the Atoa o Samoa Talks — set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks — during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>This is Part II of the segment, reported in Samoa News on Wednesday, November 5, 2025.</p>
<p>During the podcast, Taupau raised the importance of fostering sporting exchanges between the two Samoas, emphasizing their potential to elevate the standard of national teams ahead of international competitions, promote genuine sportsmanship, and revive traditional sports that once served as powerful unifiers across communities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed full support for the proposal, affirming that it deserves a place on the agenda of the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks. He specifically highlighted the decline of traditional sports in Samoa, noting that the iconic Fautasi races — once a source of national pride — have largely faded from the local sporting landscape, while they continue to thrive in American Samoa.</p>
<p>“American Samoa is so far ahead in Fautasi racing,” Laauli remarked. “Villages are rowing state-of-the-art fautasi made of fiberglass and equipped with sliding seats, costing close to a million dollars. In Samoa, the opposite is happening — villages no longer want to row their old wooden fautasi.”</p>
<p>With a touch of humor, the Prime Minister suggested inviting five or six fautasi crews from American Samoa to compete during Samoa’s Independence celebrations, and playfully proposed that their hosts offer to sell the boats at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Laauli lamented the decline of Samoan kirikiti (cricket) in Samoa, where the sport was first introduced by missionaries in the 19th century and once flourished as a national pastime. He recalled that village matches often spanned two to three days, drawing crowds and fostering community spirit.</p>
<p>“Now, it is practically a dead sport in Samoa because everyone is playing international cricket,” Laauli remarked. “The benefits of international cricket are all very well, but Samoan kirikiti used to be our national sport — and it needs to be revived.”</p>
<p>He noted that, like fautasi racing, kirikiti remains vibrant in American Samoa and among Samoan diaspora communities in New Zealand, Australia, Hawai‘i, and the U.S. mainland. “But in Samoa, where it all began, it’s practically extinct. That’s very sad, and something must be done to bring it back.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the golden era of sports in both Samoas, the Prime Minister reminisced about the excitement of inter-island competitions across rugby, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and especially boxing.</p>
<p>“Those were the golden years of boxing in both Samoas,” he recalled. “We produced formidable boxers like George Tanoa, Aso Paletaoga, Vai, my cousin Fosi Schmidt, Monty Betham, and William White. Samoan boxers were a force to be reckoned with—and they were respected throughout the Pacific region.”</p>
<p>Following the discussion on sports, Taupau shifted the dialogue to joint agricultural initiatives, specifically livestock development aimed at providing consumers in American Samoa with access to fresh meat sourced from Samoa.</p>
<p>The proposal has sparked considerable controversy, with critics — including members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament.</p>
<p>Taupau asked Prime Minister Laauli whether he plans to revisit the matter when the Atoa o Samoa Talks resume next year.</p>
<p>In response, Laauli acknowledged the complexity of launching a cattle farming operation, noting that such an undertaking would only be viable as a joint venture. He proposed a collaborative model involving the purchase of up to 2,000 cattle from Australia, to be divided between the two governments.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister emphasized that the primary goal is to make fresh meat more accessible to consumers in American Samoa, in contrast to the current reliance on meat that has been refrigerated for extended periods. He further claimed that the practice of importing fresh meat from Samoa — once approved by the USDA — was abruptly discontinued following the September 11 terrorist attacks, citing heightened security and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>Laauli affirmed that key agricultural exports —i ncluding taro, bananas, fish, and vegetables — have already received approval for trade between Samoa and American Samoa. He noted that following the FAST party’s rise to power in 2021, he personally advocated for a joint agricultural venture between the two governments to strengthen regional food security.</p>
<p>As part of a pilot initiative, Samoa donated five cattle, five sheep, and over 500 oysters to American Samoa, laying the groundwork for future collaboration in livestock and aquaculture development.</p>
<p>However, the project drew criticism from members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament, who accused the previous administration of gifting 400 acres of government land to the American Samoa Government — despite the fact that the proposed cattle farm had not yet commenced.</p>
<p>“Despite the political allegations, I remain fully committed to this initiative,” Laauli declared. “It is a vital development that will benefit both countries, and I urge any future administration to continue its implementation to ensure food security for the well-being of our people.”</p>
<p>Taupau concluded the interview by turning attention to the highly anticipated Rugby League Pacific Championship final this weekend between Toa Samoa and the New Zealand Kiwis. He asked the Prime Minister whether he planned to travel to Australia to witness the match in person.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that he had received an official invitation from Australia but shared that he would not be attending due to medical advice. His doctor has advised against air travel given his current physical condition.</p>
<p>In his stead, Laauli announced that the Minister for Sports, Laumatiamanu Ringo Purcell, will represent the Government of Samoa at the match.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the sons of Samoa who have stepped forward to represent their heritage on the international stage.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that many of these gifted athletes had been offered substantial financial incentives to play for New Zealand or Australia. Yet, they chose instead to honor their roots — traveling at their own expense to don the blue jersey and represent Samoa with pride.</p>
<p>“As the Samoan proverb goes, ‘E lele le toloa ae ma’au i le vai’—the tolóa, or Pacific duck, may fly far, but it always returns to the water,” Laauli reflected. “Wherever in the world you reside, and wherever in the world you were born, Samoa is your heritage—the land of your ancestors. Thank you for your service.”</p>

This increase is all the more striking given that last year the ballot was open for almost three months, whereas this year it was only open for one.</p>

      <p>
      <p>PACIFIC LABOR MOBILITY</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/man_picking_fruit.jpg?itok=fxJ-wDaj"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/man_picking_fruit.jpg?itok=zpiDelMD" alt="A ni-Vanuatu doing seasonal work in New Zealand"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific nations have been gathering in Solomon Islands to discuss the future of labor mobility in the region.</p>
<p>Workers' rights, brain and labor drain from island countries, and abscondment and visa overstaying are some of the major issues Pacific leaders have voiced concern about in recent years.</p>
<p>The Pacific Labor Mobility Annual Meeting kicked off Monday with the PACER-Plus Forum Island Country Caucus and the Employer Forum.</p>
<p>Solomon Islands Foreign Secretary Collin Beck said the meeting allows countries to share challenges and find joint solutions.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI HOME OWNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>Fiji's government is preparing to extend a first home ownership initiative to support families who have been evicted from informal settlements.</p>
<p>The government said the pilot will target families from Veidogo, Nabua Muslim League, and Kilikali settlements, with a combined household income of up to FJ$30,000.</p>
<p>The program will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Housing and the Housing Authority to ensure transparent assessment and allocation of social housing lots.</p>
<p>Once approved by Cabinet, it will be brought in in phases.</p>
<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS CLIMATE FUNDS</strong></p>
<p>The Cook Islands has secured US$40 million in climate finance from the Green Climate Fund.</p>
<p>The money will be used to strengthen buildings and vulnerable communities against the impacts of extreme weather events.</p>
<p>As part of it, over 2000 homes will be strengthened to meet the 2019 Cook Islands Building Code for cyclone resilience.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mark Brown said the approval reflects years of sustained effort and partnership across government, financial institutions, and the community.</p>
<p><strong>HAWAI'I E-BIKE SAFETY</strong></p>
<p>Hawai'i police and cyclists are stepping up efforts to promote e-bike safety following recent incidents.</p>
<p>An e-bike rider, who was not wearing a helmet, was critically injured in Waimanalo last week, and the previous week, a 79-year-old was killed in a collision on Maui.</p>
<p>More than 100 people have died on Hawaii roads so far this year - about a third of them on motorcycles, bicycles, or scooters.</p>
<p>Hawaii News Now reported a bike expo was held to educate riders.</p>
<p>Police also ran an operation in Ewa which netted three riders for riding without a license.</p>
<p>Officers also issued ten citations, fifteen warnings, and recovered three e-dirt bikes.</p>
<p><strong>PALAU VISITOR NUMBERS</strong></p>
<p>Visitor arrivals to Palau have increased by close to a quarter from January to September, compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>Nearly 60,000 international visitors have gone to Palau this year, up from about 40,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>China remains the leading market with 17,000 visitors, followed by Taiwan and Japan.</p>
<p>Arrivals from Europe increased by about 60 per cent, to 3500 visitors, while there was an 86 percent increase in Australian visitors, making up nearly 2000 visitors.</p>
<p><strong>VANUATU SOLAR POWERED X-RAY</strong></p>
<p>Vanuatu's Torba Province has launched its first x-ray service, powered by solar energy.</p>
<p>The Vanuatu Daily Post reported X-rays are now available at Quatvaes Hospital.</p>
<p>The upgrade is part of an Australian project and also supported by the National Green Energy Fund and Respond Global.</p>
<p>Minister of Health, John Qetu, said with the province's first x-ray machine and reliable solar power at Quatvaes Hospital and Bemisas Health Centre, clinicians can diagnose and treat patients faster and closer to home.</p>
<p><strong>TONGA CONSTITUTION</strong></p>
<p>A colorful parade has marked the 150th anniversary of the Tonga Constitution in Nuku'alofa this week.</p>
<p>Matangi Tonga reported the float parade was led by government ministries, the diplomatic corps and residents from foreign countries living in Tonga.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, James Marape, asked where the billions of kina his government has allocated to provinces, departments, agencies, and districts have gone over the past six years.</p>
<p>Good question, Mr PM. We need transparency and accountability. These are public funds.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA</em>— The Atoa o Samoa Talks between the governments of Samoa and American Samoa are set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand—where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, confirmed the update during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>Taupau opened the conversation by reflecting on the historic ceremony marking the official opening of the 18th Parliament of the Independent State of Samoa, held on September 16, 2025. During the occasion, the Prime Minister, members of Cabinet, and Members of Parliament were formally sworn in by the Head of State, His Highness Tuimalealiifano Vaaleto‘a Sualauvi II.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula, Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, and House Speaker Savali Talavou Ale, representing the American Samoa Government.</p>
<p>“It was a historic moment for the Territory,” noted Taupau, “as it marked the first time a sitting Governor of American Samoa and Fono leaders were formally invited to such a prestigious occasion.”</p>
<p>He then posed the question: “What inspired your decision to extend this special invitation to the leaders of American Samoa?”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli responded that he felt it was the right thing to do not only as a courtesy from one leader to another, but also from one family member to another.</p>
<p>&quot;We are family,&quot; he declared. &quot;We speak the same language, we observe the same culture and traditions, our lineages intertwine, we are one people.</p>
<p>&quot;The Samoan salutation, 'Mai le tai samasama o le Tui Manu'a ma Malaetele, seia paia Fili ma Puletuu na tauilo ai Malo,' immortalizes the sacred geography of the Samoan islands. From the sacred islands of the Tui Manu'a, to the sacred thresholds of chiefs and ceremonial guardians in Savaii veiled in reverence.&quot;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister expressed his hope that the recent ceremony would set a meaningful precedent for future leaders of Samoa. He emphasized the importance of the Samoan people witnessing the active participation of American Samoa’s leadership in prestigious national events, describing it as a powerful gesture of mutual respect and cooperation.</p>
<p>“It was overwhelming and uplifting to hear the audience applaud and cheer when Governor Pula, Senate President Tuaolo, and Speaker Savali entered the venue,” the Prime Minister shared. “It was a sign of recognition — an affirmation of the respect between the leaders of our two countries. You see, we may be under different political jurisdictions, but we are one people.”</p>
<p>After the ceremony on Sept 16th, which was held at the Multi-Purpose Gymnasium within the government’s sports complex at Tuana’imato, Governor Pula and the Fono leaders held a meeting with Laauli later in the day. It was an especially significant meeting, because it marked the first time an American Samoa Governor and Fono leaders have met a Samoa Prime Minister inside the Cabinet Room.</p>
<p>During the discussions, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of holding regular Atoa o Samoa Talks to strengthen cooperation and address shared challenges and opportunities faced by the two Samoas.</p>
<p>&quot;Our discussion with Governor Pula and the Fono leaders was brief, owing to time constraints related to their return flight to the Territory that same day,&quot; Laauli recalled. &quot;Nevertheless, it was a highly constructive exchange, and we reached consensus on several key issues of mutual importance.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli reflected on Governor Pula’s remarks during their brief meeting noting their shared emphasis on preserving the cultural ties that bind the two Samoas.</p>
<p>“He acknowledged that while collaboration on socio-economic development is vital, it means little if we fail to prioritize the truth that we are of the same blood, flesh, and bone,” Laauli said. “But if we work together as one family, then whatever we achieve — whether great or small — we share as a family that endures hardship together. What is good for American Samoa is also good for Samoa and vice versa.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that Governor Pula extended a personal invitation for him to visit Manu‘a, which he has graciously accepted. He also shared that Senate President Tuaolo and House Speaker Savali invited him and members of the Samoa Parliament to observe sessions of the American Samoa Legislature.</p>
<p>In turn, Prime Minister Laauli extended a reciprocal invitation for American Samoa lawmakers to attend and observe proceedings of the Samoa Parliament, reinforcing a spirit of mutual respect and legislative exchange.</p>
<p>Taupau informed the Prime Minister that upon their return to the Territory, the Fono leaders introduced a concurrent resolution calling for the resumption of the Atoa o Samoa Talks. The resolution was unanimously passed by both chambers of the American Samoa Legislature.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his gratitude to the Fono leadership for their commitment to advancing the Atoa o Samoa Talks, affirming that the initiative is moving forward as previously discussed.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the history of the initiative originally known as the  2Samoa Talks when he first entered politics in 2006 — Laauli noted that nearly two decades have passed since its inception, yet no concrete policies have been implemented to address key areas of social and economic development affecting the standard of living in both countries.</p>
<p>He attributed this lack of progress to recurring conflicts with federal policies and shifting priorities among successive administrations leading the executive branch of the American Samoa Government.</p>
<p>When the Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party first came to power five years ago under the leadership of then Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata‘afa, the 2Samoa Talks was renamed the Atoa o Samoa Talks.</p>
<p>Laauli recalled encouraging then Prime Minister Fiame to pursue deeper collaboration with the American Samoa Government, emphasizing the many potential benefits rooted in the close cultural ties shared by the two Samoas.</p>
<p>He noted that American Samoa’s unique relationship with the United States Federal Government affords it certain advantages — benefits that, through strategic cooperation, could also positively impact Samoa.</p>
<p>One such example is the remittances sent by Samoa workers employed at the canneries in American Samoa. These U.S. dollar transfers, when converted to Samoa tala, effectively double in value, providing significant economic support to families in Samoa.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli stated that his administration has been focused on stabilizing the urgent financial crisis it inherited from the previous government. The severity of the situation necessitated the adoption of an Emergency Budget under Article 105 of the Constitution, which provides for special financial measures in response to unforeseen national challenges.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the financial situation is now under control, and a short-term fiscal plan has been developed to guide the government over the next three months. With this groundwork in place, the Prime Minister affirmed that the resumption of the Atoa o Samoa Talks is now the administration’s next priority, with the exact date to reconvene the dialogue to be announced sometime at the beginning of 2026.</p>
<p>Responding to questions about the long-term plans initiated by the previous administration to establish a Samoa Consulate General's Office on land allocated by the American Samoa Government in Tafuna, Laauli confirmed that the project will proceed as planned. He further noted that Cabinet has approved amendments to the project’s scope to better align with current priorities.</p>
<p>In a gesture of reciprocity, the Samoa Government has earmarked land at Taumeasina, Moata‘a for the future construction of an American Samoa Embassy in the Independent State of Samoa — cementing a deepening commitment to diplomatic presence and bilateral cooperation between the two Samoas.</p>
<p>Laauli stated that upon his return to Samoa, he will meet with Samoa’s Consul General to American Samoa, Fata Brian Kaio, who is expected to present the feasibility study that will determine whether construction of a permanent consulate facility should proceed.</p>
<p>“I personally believe the need for a dedicated Consulate General’s Office is well justified,” Laauli explained. “Thousands of Samoan nationals work in the canneries and across various sectors in the Territory, and many have made American Samoa their permanent home.”</p>
<p>The Samoa Consulate General’s Office in American Samoa was officially established in 2005 at the Methodist Iupeli Siliva Building in Fagatogo, following approval from the U.S. State Department. On July 31, 2023, the office relocated to its current premises at Unit 108, Mosooi Business Center in Ottoville, Tafuna.</p>
<p>“It has been two decades, and we’re still renting office space,” the Prime Minister remarked. “It’s time we make this a reality — establish a permanent presence to better serve our citizens with their immigration and travel needs.”</p>
<p>He also shared that Cabinet-approved amendments to the project include the construction of additional facilities to provide housing for cannery workers from Samoa, further reinforcing the government’s commitment to supporting its diaspora in the Territory.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli stated that the timeline for construction will be guided by the recommendation of Consul General Kaio, whose long-standing residence in the Territory has given him a deep understanding of the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>However, he affirmed that the government stands ready to move forward with this important undertaking.</p>
<p>Taupau also raised concerns regarding the welfare of Samoa nationals employed at the StarKist canneries in American Samoa, emphasizing Samoa’s ongoing efforts to advocate for improved employment conditions.</p>
<p>He highlighted the need to include decent living quarters for these workers —similar to the accommodations provided for Samoa’s seasonal workers in New Zealand and Australia where housing is a standard component of their employment agreements.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his gratitude to the StarKist company for its longstanding commitment to employing Samoa nationals in American Samoa. He emphasized that the Samoa Government’s relationship with StarKist — facilitated through the support of the American Samoa Government — is a well-established partnership that predates the current Seasonal Workers Programs in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>“It has been a close and complementary relationship that has withstood the test of time and circumstance,” Laauli affirmed. “Why? Because dialogue is easy — we speak the same language and we understand each other well.”</p>
<p>However, the Prime Minister acknowledged that challenges remain. He cited data from American Samoa authorities indicating that Samoan nationals significantly outnumber U.S. nationals in the inmate population at the Tafuna Correctional Facility (TCF) — a reality he said he does not take lightly.</p>
<p>Laauli noted that many of those incarcerated are employees of the StarKist company, and that their offenses often stem from difficult living conditions and unfavorable circumstances within their immediate environment. He underscored the need for proactive measures to address these social vulnerabilities, including improved housing and support systems for Samoa workers in the Territory, and particularly the lack of affordable rental housing. He noted that many are compelled to live with relatives, where they are expected to contribute not only to daily household expenses but also to cultural obligations — fa'alavelave.</p>
<p>Laauli emphasized that this issue warrants serious and sustained discussion during the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks, as it directly affects the well-being and stability of Samoa nationals residing in the Territory.</p>
<p>He reiterated that this concern is a driving factor behind his decision to incorporate housing facilities into the development plans for the new Consulate General’s Office in Tafuna. These accommodations are intended to support Samoa workers who currently face housing insecurity. The Prime Minister also noted that StarKist management is planning a similar initiative, with proposed housing facilities in Atu‘u to better serve their workforce.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau continued with other areas of concern and interest in developing the relationship between the two Samoas — such as Sports, Agriculture, etc. Samoa News will report further on the appearance of Prime Minister Laauli on this segment this week.</p>

      <h1>US appeals court says Florida can ban Chinese citizens from buying property</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday cleared the way for Florida to enforce a law restricting real estate and land purchases by Chinese citizens, rejecting claims it violates federal law and discriminates against Asians. The 2-1 ruling by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could encourage other states to adopt so-called alien land laws, which were once common but fell out of favor a century ago. Lawmakers in more than 30 states have passed or introduced bills restricting foreign property ownership. The 11th Circuit said four Chinese citizens represented by the American Civil Liberties Union lacked legal standing to sue over Florida’s 2023 law because it only applies to people “domiciled” in China, and they have lived in Florida for years.</p>

      <p>Guam is the capital of Micronesia.
That’s hardly a unique observation.</p>
<p>Whatever you want to call the reason, Great Power Geopolitical Play, Trappings of Empire, Expansionism, Injustice, the simple fact of the matter remains that Guam is the economic and social anchor of the Western Pacific known as Micronesia.</p>

      <p>By Mukhtar Babayev The world arrives in Belém for COP30 at a moment of profound division. The international system is being tested in ways we have not seen in decades.  Yet the climate crisis does not wait for stability. It touches every community on Earth, from small islands in the Pacific to farming heartlands on every continent. It demands that, even in a fractured world, we still  find common purpose. Over the past year, too many environmental negotiations have fallen...</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea’s glaring lack of an official waste oil policy will likely persist for months, possibly extending into 2026, as the Minister responsible still awaits the Environment Conservation and Protection Authority (CEPA) to finalize the draft document.</p>
<p>The country continues to operate large industrial sectors and resource projects without a clearly defined policy to regulate the disposal of waste oil, which are by-products of combustion and heavy machinery usage.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Sixty-two haka groups are set to perform in Tauranga next week at the 25th anniversary of Te Mana Kuratahi, the National Primary Schools Kapa Haka competition.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018913224/kids-kapa-haka-competition-kicks-off-in-south-island-for-first-time">small beginnings</a> with just over 20 rōpū, Te Mana Kuratahi has grown into a nationwide celebration of Māori excellence and identity, with the competition running all week — from Monday to Friday — to accommodate all the groups.</p>
<p>Among those taking the stage are the defending champions Te Kapa Puāwai of Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Hoani Waititi Marae from Auckland, who have competed in every Te Mana Kuratahi since it began 25 years ago, lifting the national title a record setting four times.</p>
<p>Kaiārahi o Te Kapa Puāwai Te Ora Pahewa said it was a surreal feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;I stood on that first stage in 2000 at Hopuhopu representing my kura, our entire school, our whānau, both sets of grandparents were there to tautoko. You felt like a superstar.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, to stand here as the kaiārahi, guiding our next generation, it's come full circle. The scale might be bigger, but the kaupapa hasn't changed, pride in who you are, and belief in your ao Māori.&quot;</p>
<p>Māori health coalition asked those attending Te Mana Kuratahi to <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/577329/people-going-to-tauranga-kapa-haka-event-asked-to-take-measles-precautions">take precautions to prevent measles from spreading</a>.</p>

<p>The South Pacific cyclone season officially started Nov. 01, 2025 and will run through to April 2026.</p>
<p>Meteorologists are predicting five to nine cyclones <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/575847/up-to-nine-tropical-cycones-forecast-for-pacific-this-season">for the southwest</a> Pacific in this season.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific's Cyclone Watch Service has become an important communications lifeline for Pacific nations and territories over the years, who are affected by the ever-increasing number of tropical cyclones in the Region.</p>
<p>Our information comes from Meteorological Services in the region. We also attempt to get damage reports from local government authorities and non-governmental agencies who are active in the field, as well people on the ground, who have been affected by the Cyclone.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific broadcasts official vital weather updates and information via our shortwave transmitter. When local power grids and transmission facilities have been rendered inoperable by a cyclone, our broadcasts may be the only updates that people in the Island nations and territories can receive.</p>

<p><strong>CONJOINED TWINS IN PNG</strong></p>
<p>The parents of conjoined twins in Papua New Guinea who had hoped to send their babies to Sydney for surgery are now desperately trying to go to Germany instead, saying Australia is too expensive.</p>
<p>Male twins Tom and Sawrong were born on 9 October in remote PNG, joined at the lower abdomen.</p>
<p>The boys share a single liver and portions of their gastrointestinal tract. One twin also has a congenital heart defect and only one kidney.</p>
<p>They are currently receiving care in Port Moresby's public hospital, which is not equipped to handle complex neonatal cases.</p>
<p>Conjoined twins are extremely rare, accounting for just one or two in every 100,000 births. Most cases result in miscarriage or stillbirth, and even when born alive the twins have a low chance of survival.</p>

<p>By Talaia Mika, Cook Islands News</p>
<p>Source: Cook Is. News via RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The newly appointed Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) commissioner Beverly Stacey-Ataera says public trust and open dialogue will be at the centre of the Cook Islands' seabed minerals journey.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera told Cook Islands News she welcomes scrutiny from environmental groups and the wider community, adding that public accountability strengthens the Authority's work.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome their feedback,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have an incredibly important role, and we enjoy working with them. They need to hold us accountable and make sure that everything's being done properly, which it is, but it's good to have that additional people out there who are having an oversight so that we have the trust of the people. They do just as important a job as we do, so it's great.&quot;</p>
<p>Her comments come as debate continues over the future of the industry, with environmental advocates calling for caution while government says seabed minerals could support the nation's long-term resilience.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera stressed that no decision has been made to mine, and the priority is research, understanding and public engagement.</p>
<p>&quot;We reaffirm, we're not mining. We're not mining at all,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in exploration phase, which is just science, and quite possibly the coolest thing ever is doing the science.&quot;</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera said the Authority is focused on completing scientific studies with licence holders to better understand the seabed environment.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Cook Islands government granted licenses for exploratory work to three seabed mining companies — CIC, CIIC Seabed Resources and Moana Minerals. The exploration is now in the fourth year of a five-year phase to assess the feasibility of deep-sea mining for mineral rich polymetallic nodules.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera reiterated their immediate focus is &quot;completing the scientific research with our license holders&quot;.</p>
<p>She feels &quot;incredibly humbled&quot; to lead the Authority and remains committed to ensuring Cook Islanders are informed and involved.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to do the scientific research. We need to understand the environment, and then we need to share that with our people, and then our people will make a decision about what they want to do.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome everybody to come and have a chat with us. We're moving towards more consults and going out with more information, so stay tuned. We've got a lot of exciting things to share with you.&quot;</p>

      <p>CHICAGO — The immigration agents’ tear gas grenades clinked and then exploded against the concrete, shrouding the block in plumes of white gas. The dozen or so residents at the scene only screamed louder. “We don’t want you here,” yelled Rae Lindenberg. The 32-year-old, who works in marketing, ran out of her apartment when she heard the shrill sound of whistles. “Get out of our neighborhood!” The squad of agents had appeared in Lakeview last month, an upscale neighborhood dotted with dog daycares, medical spas and vegan restaurants, hopping over a gate to chase down a construction worker who was handcuffed and shoved into a vehicle.</p>

      <h1>Bessent says high US interest rates may have caused housing recession</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Parts of the U.S. economy, particularly housing, may already be in recession because of high interest rates, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday, repeating his call for the Federal Reserve to accelerate rate cuts. “I think that we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,” Bessent said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “And the Fed has caused a lot of distributional problems with their policies.” Bessent said that, although the overall U.S. economy remains solid, high mortgage rates still hinder the real estate market. Housing, he said, is effectively in a recession that is hitting low-end consumers the hardest because they have debts, not assets. Pending home sales in the United States were flat in September, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>

This exclusion left thousands without affordable healthcare, despite having some of the highest rates of chronic disease in the Pacific.</p>

      <h1>UN-bound report warns racial discrimination is worsening in NZ</h1>

      <p>'Absolutely breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi'</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/wellington_protest_copy.jpg?itok=JJiSEhmb"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/wellington_protest_copy.jpg?itok=p_W2Y192" alt=" The hīkoi protesting against the Treaty Principles Bill in Wellington "></a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The New Zealand government has breached Te Tiriti o Waitangi, with its policies negatively impacting Māori rights, a new report has found.</p>
<p>The report - written by the Aotearoa Centre for Indigenous Peoples and the Law (Te Wai Ariki) - has outlined several Te Tiriti breaches made by the 54th government during its term.</p>
<p>The report - in tandem with Te Hunga Roia Māori (the New Zealand Law Society) and the People's Action Plan Against Racism in Aotearoa reports - will be presented at the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in its 23rd and 24th periodic UN reviews in November.</p>
<p>The submission argues that the current coalition government's policies negatively impact Māori rights and remove certain protections, stating &quot;the government is actively and profoundly aggravating New Zealand's constitutionally racist foundation in a way we have not seen for at least half a century&quot;.</p>
<p>It claims that they are ignoring the impact of land confiscation and decades of systemic injustice and discrimination towards Māori - actions that in breaches the rights of Māori which CERD has described as permanent rights.</p>
<p>Te Wai Ariki co-director Professor Claire Charters (Ngāti Whakaue, Tūwharetoa, Ngā Puhi, Tainui) said the whole constitution was fundamentally opposed to, or in contradiction to, Te Tiriti o Waitangi because it keeps all power in one place.</p>
<p>'Racially discriminatory' laws highlighted in the report include the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 and Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2025.</p>
<p>A large number of rights-breaching bills and legislation have been identified by the three reports affecting equality, political rights, equal rights in employment, housing, health and education and training.</p>
<p>Some of those are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/523622/maori-wards-bill-passes-third-reading">Local Government (Electoral Legislation and Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/536600/new-three-strikes-regime-passed-into-law">Sentencing (Reinstating Three Strikes) Amendment Act</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/572763/law-changes-will-further-sideline-maori-in-health-sector-select-committee-told">The Pae Ora Amendment Act</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/536961/fast-track-bill-passes-into-law-amid-protest">Fast-track Approvals Act</a></p>
<p>&quot;What they're doing now is creating and exacerbating existing inequality... I definitely think that all these pieces of legislation are especially racially discriminatory.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no surprise when you have policy, particularly from ACT and also New Zealand First that is about, amongst other things, not recognising the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and reinterpreting what Te Tiriti o Waitangi means so that it is saying what it does not say.&quot;</p>
<p>In July, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples Albert K. Barume issued a letter to government ministers expressing a number of concerns, including about David Seymour's Regulatory Standards Bill. Seymour criticized the letter.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole constitutional structure, whereby the parliament legislature can ignore Te Tiriti o Waitangi is a treaty breach,&quot; Charters said.</p>
<p>She added that the disestablishment of the short-lived Te Aka Whai Ora, the Māori Health Authority, was also a form of a treaty breach.</p>
<p>&quot;When you take away a mechanism that is designed, at least in part, to improve those statistics so that we at least come up to the same standard as our fellow citizens, then I would say creates an inequality or exacerbates an existing inequality.&quot;</p>
<p>It came down to structural racism, where a community was disadvantaged by unfair systems, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you've got, on the collective level, that Māori are indigenous peoples and should also have some sort of authority about how we are regulated or they are regulated. Just like the Crown has its own system, or the settler state has its own kind of system.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, we live under a different peoples and states system and without any recognition of our own tikanga or our own law or our own governance. So that, at a kind of collective level, also creates inequality.&quot;</p>
<p>'There Needs To Be Some Reform Of New Zealand's Constitution'</p>
<p>Te Wai Ariki is concerned about the current government's &quot;exacerbation of racial discrimination towards Māori&quot; through unconstitutional and mass legislation changes.</p>
<p>Recommendations stated in the report call for constitutional transformation, and not incremental reform.</p>
<p>It warns that &quot;without transformation, Parliament remains unchecked and continues to pass laws in breach of Indigenous peoples' rights&quot;.</p>
<p>Constitutional transformation in Aotearoa New Zealand must be centerd on te Tiriti (and He Whakaputanga) in recognition of their status as the founding constitutional documents of this nation.</p>
<p>Such constitutional transformation would also result in greater compliance with recommendations from UN human rights treaty bodies, special procedures and other international mechanisms designed to monitor Aotearoa New Zealand's human rights record, the report states.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be some strong check on Parliament, on the Crown, so that it can't do that on its political whim of the day,&quot; Charters said.</p>
<p>She said there are many examples, or basic features, of western liberal democracies from around the world that New Zealand can take note of.</p>
<p>&quot;The most well-known is generally the US where the constitution includes freedom from discrimination, and the Supreme Court can overturn legislation that breaches those rights.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is an absolute outlier, and that we can't check our Parliament or make sure or overturn racially discriminatory laws.&quot;</p>
<p>Collectively, the reports ask the UN CERD to record that the 54th government's reforms are racially discriminatory and in breach of International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, reaffirm the constitutional status of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Waitangi Tribunal, recommend an independent investigation into racial discrimination and legislative harm in Aotearoa, urge constitutional transformation consistent with Matike Mai Aotearoa, establish enhanced UN monitoring and in-country consultations with Māori and affected communities.</p>

      <h1>Pacific islands at risk of becoming 'narco-states', crime advisor warns</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/narco_boat_interseption_.jpg?itok=JLLIvEU4"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/narco_boat_interseption_.jpg?itok=8QIQKuSj" alt="The narco sub"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>Caleb Fotheringham, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific Island nations are at risk of becoming &quot;narco-states&quot;, the chair of New Zealand's Ministerial Advisory Group on transnational and serious organized- crime says.</p>
<p>Steve Symon told Pacific Waves that drugs pass through the Pacific region to reach lucrative markets such as New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happened is that in trying to reach New Zealand and Australia, we've opened up drug routes through the Pacific, which has seen a rise in the methamphetamine use in places such as Fiji and Tonga,&quot; Symon said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we continue with business as usual, we will continue to go backwards. Places like Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Rarotonga [which] are vulnerable because of their size and because of economic difficulties, those countries are at risk of becoming narco-states.&quot;</p>
<p>Symon said a nation becoming a narco-state would mean organized crime corrupting government organizations, like the police, customs and other border agencies.</p>
<p>The final report from the advisory group to the New Zealand government titled, Lead boldly, act decisively: Tackling and dismantling organized crime, said addressing organized crime in New Zealand would contribute positively to regional stability.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pacific region is a particular focus. It is increasingly used as a transshipment point for illicit goods destined for New Zealand,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said organized crime is &quot;one of the most significant threats&quot; to New Zealand which could not be &quot;understated or underestimated&quot;.</p>
<p>Symon said New Zealand had a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to support the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is so connected to our Pacific nation, everyone's got family or friends who are from the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're looking purely from a New Zealand centric approach, our borders really reach there. The drugs that are coming to New Zealand, Australia are passing through there. So really, we need to reach out and stop things coming through the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;There's some great work being done in the Pacific, and there's some really passionate people working in the Pacific, but we really need to help coordinate and pull them together so that we have a coordinated fight.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>CALL FOR NZ AND AUS STEP UP</strong></p>
<p>José Sousa-Santos, associate professor of practice and head of the University of Canterbury's Pacific Regional Security Hub, said there is no excuse for New Zealand and Australia to be &quot;counting dollars and cents&quot; when it comes to supporting the region amid the current drug threat.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pacific would not have this drug problem or an issue with traditional organized crime, if it wasn't for New Zealand's and Australia's drug markets and its hunger for illicit drugs,&quot; Sousa-Santos said.</p>
<p>He said Australia and New Zealand call themselves part of the Pacific family but deport criminals to the Pacific with no job prospects or cultural understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;And of course, a percentage of those deportees will turn to crime, reach back into their contacts in Australia, New Zealand, and exacerbate the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Sousa-Santos said 501 deportees who have come from Australia to New Zealand had required law enforcement agencies to strengthen their response.</p>
<p>&quot;If a country like New Zealand, with the resources that it has in law enforcement, is struggling to deal with the 501 deportees from Australia, one can only imagine the impact that deportees from New Zealand and Australia are having in small island states.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>RISK OF FENTANYL IN THE PACIFIC</strong></p>
<p>The report also warned of a &quot;new scourge&quot; in the form of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. It said New Zealand should be &quot;throwing the kitchen sink&quot; at stopping it from taking hold.</p>
<p>Between October 2023 and September 2024, there were about 87000 opioid-related deaths in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Many believe that for New Zealand it is a matter of when, not if,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Sousa-Santos said small amounts of fentanyl had already been found in wastewater testing in Fiji and Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>&quot;If you ask me one thing that will keep me up at night, it's definitely fentanyl,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most experts looking at the Pacific see fentanyl as the next wave coming to the region. I don't think the Pacific quite understands the risk and the damage that fentanyl will do.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the points that I always make is methamphetamines has an impact on communities, on society, mental health, but fentanyl kills and I think that's about as clear as one can make it.&quot;</p>
<p>Symon said the social and emotional costs of fentanyl reaching the Pacific and New Zealand would be huge.</p>
<p>&quot;I was talking to some people from America, and they were trying to give an example, saying, you know, we had concerns about covid, but fentanyl is just 100 times worse.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the lucrative market for methamphetamine was likely why fentanyl had not arrived yet in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>'GENIE NOT OUT OF THE BOTTLE'</strong></p>
<p>Sousa-Santos does not think the Pacific is at risk of becoming narco-states, similar to what is seen in central American countries, but it could still be a semi-narco region, where criminal entities have &quot;undue influence&quot; over state institutions.</p>
<p>He said it is not too late to turn around the current state of drug use in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The genie is definitely not out of the bottle, the red flags, well and truly waving.&quot;</p>
<p>Sousa-Santos said low population numbers, in most Pacific nations, makes it easier to address drug problems.</p>
<p>He said the traditional power structures, like the church and chiefly systems is where the regions strength lies.</p>
<p>&quot;By ensuring that any response to the Pacific is grounded by Pacific led, partner supported initiatives that will give us much stronger returns.&quot;</p>

      <p>NEW YORK — Coffee roasters in the United States are plowing through their stockpiles as they await the outcome of ongoing U.S.-Brazil trade negotiations, talks that could determine whether they have to pay much higher prices for alternative sources of coffee. Brazilian coffee, which accounts for a third of the beans consumed by the world’s largest coffee consumer, has been priced out of the American market since August when the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 50% import tariff on Brazil’s beans, in a case that mixed trade with politics. Trump has accused Brazil’s Supreme Court of unfair treatment of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro. The trade tariff on coffee among other Brazilian goods was widely viewed as punishment of the government of leftist Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro’s successor. Bolsonaro was later found guilty of organizing a coup plot. So far, the steep duty has caused havoc in the $340 billion U.S. coffee industry, leaving importers with stranded cargoes of Brazilian coffee, roasters paying a fee to cancel deliveries and consumers spending as much as 40% more for their morning brew.</p>

      <h1>Pentagon’s DOGE unit to revamp military drone program, sources say</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — The Pentagon’s DOGE unit is leading efforts to overhaul the U.S. military drone program, including streamlining procurement, expand homegrown production, and acquire tens of thousands of cheap drones in the coming months, according to Pentagon officials and people with knowledge of the matter. In July, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged to cut red tape and assert U.S. drone dominance by approving hundreds of American-made drone models and launching training programs to prepare units for ‘drone wars’ - a response to the widespread use of drones on Ukraine’s battlefield, which have exposed U.S. drone limitations. The Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) involvement, which has not been previously reported, grants the unit influence over a U.S. military drone program that President Donald Trump designated a defense priority in a June executive order, five people with knowledge of the matter said.</p>

<p>The signing followed months of negotiation between the PEA, DPM, Treasury, and Finance, after the Union submitted its 2024 log of claims, that included a 7 per cent general salary increase, 5 per cent productivity and performance allowance, rural risk allowance, bargaining fee, and insurance cover for public servants.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A massive latte stone from Rota has finally returned to the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) after more than seven decades overseas.</p>
<p>The stone pillar - an emblem of Chamorro identity - was purchased by a private collector in the 1950s and taken off-island.</p>
<p>Weighing more than 10,000 pounds, it was recently shipped from Hawai'i to Saipan and is now housed at the Northern Marianas Museum of History and Culture, where it will be publicly unveiled next month.</p>
<p>NMI Museum executive director Leni Leon told Marianas Press that the latte stone was first brought to the Honolulu Academy of Arts before being transferred to the Bishop Museum in 1970. It remained there for decades until a group of visiting Chamorros noticed it in 2021 and began advocating for its return.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason why they are brought over to the NMI Museum is because by law, the museum serves as the official repository and custodian of all ancient artifacts and cultural materials of the CNMI,&quot; Leon said.</p>
<p>He said efforts are underway to identify the latte stone's original site in Rota, with the long-term goal of returning it there.</p>
<p>Indigenous Affairs Office resident executive Luella Marciano, who witnessed the offloading at the Port of Saipan, described the moment as deeply emotional.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a connection for us when we receive it from another place,&quot; she said. &quot;Not only does it connect our history with our people, it also reminds us of what happened to us. Many of our islands were colonized, so this is another form of peace for us-restoration for our people.&quot;</p>
<p>Traditional healer Donald Mendiola led a blessing ceremony at the museum. &quot;I am proud that it is here. It is back at home,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Governor David Apatang's chief of staff Henry Hofschneider attended a repatriation ceremony in Hawai'i in August marking the start of the process to return Marianas artifacts from the Bishop Museum. He said this shipment represents the &quot;first wave&quot; of many cultural items coming home.</p>
<p>Museum officials say the latte stone will remain on display in Saipan for now, allowing the public-especially students-to see and touch a symbol that appears on the CNMI flag and has long represented Chamorro strength and resilience.</p>
<p>The official public ceremony to welcome the latte stone home is tentatively scheduled for November 15, when it will touch Marianas soil for the first time in 75 years.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Rarotonga doctor, who witnessed Samoa's deadly measles outbreak in 2019, is warning Cook Islands residents to stay alert and ensure vaccinations are up to date, as New Zealand reports new measles cases, raising concern for the country' s close travel ties.</p>
<p>Dr Teariki Puni, who operates private clinic Holistic Medical, said while the Cook Islands is currently dealing with a wave of acute respiratory illnesses, it is important not to overlook the risk of measles, especially with regular flights between Auckland and Rarotonga.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the key word here for us is to be very vigilant,&quot; Dr Puni said. &quot;The 2019 experience in Samoa taught me a lot and that is to get vaccinated.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Puni said the majority of cases seen at his clinic in recent months have been acute respiratory infections affecting both adults and children.</p>
<p>&quot;For the month of August, normally we're averaging about 300 but in August it was like almost 500 in terms of numbers. I would say 80 percent of those people had acute respiratory infections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He explained that during Te Maeva Nui celebrations, when many visitors were housed in crowded hostels, infections spread easily.</p>
<p>&quot;These hostels are like a breeding ground because it's open and everyone's staying together, both the ones that are unwell and the ones that are well,&quot; he said. &quot;We saw a lot of spread amongst the vaka teams as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Previously, the Health Ministry noted that Rarotonga has been struck by a &quot;wave of acute respiratory illness,&quot; with health officials urging those with symptoms to rest, hydrate and seek medical attention if conditions worsen.</p>
<p>While respiratory infections have kept local clinics busy, Dr Puni said the current measles situation in New Zealand poses a separate and potentially serious risk.</p>
<p>New Zealand's health authorities have confirmed rising measles cases this month, mostly among unvaccinated individuals, prompting vaccination drives across Auckland - the main gateway for travelers to the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there were 11 known measles cases throughout New Zealand, and the number of close contacts was about 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very close relationship with New Zealand and so we've got about almost two flights a day,&quot; Dr Puni said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you hit Auckland, that's our gateway - that's somewhat our gateway of people coming over and bringing that.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the best protection remains vaccination and basic hygiene measures.</p>
<p>&quot;Make sure that our kids, those who are supposed to be vaccinated at that age group, should be vaccinated with the measles vaccine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they're not vaccinated or they've fallen behind on their vaccinations, just contact the community health nurses to arrange for them to get that vaccination.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Puni's warning comes from personal experience. He was among Samoan doctors who travelled to Samoa to assist during the 2019 outbreak that claimed more than 80 lives, mostly children.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a hard lesson learned,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think we need to be mindful of that situation as well.&quot;</p>
<p>He recalled the tragedy in Samoa was made worse by a temporary halt in vaccinations following a death under investigation, which left many children unprotected when the outbreak struck.</p>
<p>&quot;When we had the cases picking up in New Zealand, that's where Samoa was exposed and that's where you saw the numbers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dr Puni urged Cook Islanders to apply lessons from Covid-19 and the Samoan measles outbreak by practising good hygiene and staying home when unwell.</p>
<p>&quot;The principles remain the same - if you're unwell, stay home. Avoid going to public places like the supermarket where you'll be spreading it to other people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hand washing and just coughing etiquette, covering your mouth and just remember social distancing. Those basic principles are very effective and economical because the money needed to treat people when they're really sick is a lot greater than it is in terms of prevention.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether setting up vaccination booths at the airport can be an option, Dr Puni said health authorities must balance preparedness with public confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes it might scare people because it can cause anxiety,&quot; he said. &quot;It's really about just monitoring the current situation and having that surveillance continue throughout that time.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Puni believes the Cook Islands is well positioned to respond, provided people remain alert and proactive.</p>
<p>&quot;My stance is that if we continue - it's just, again, being vigilant,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to wait and see, have the proper responses ready, and make sure our systems are prepared when it does happen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you're feeling unwell, see your GP or the Ministry of Health team. Prevention is always better than cure.&quot;</p>
<p>In a travel advisory alert update, the Ministry of Health said: &quot;Over the weekend, Health New Zealand confirmed a total of ten measles cases nationwide. One case was imported from overseas, while nine were locally acquired. Of the local cases, seven have been linked to an exposure event on the Bluebridge Cook Strait ferry on October 3.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Several hundred close contacts have been identified, including individuals at Wellington College and Wellington Girls' College connected to the ferry exposure. Health New Zealand continues to work swiftly to trace and notify all potential contacts.</p>
<p>The Ministry said it would continue to monitor the situation and keep the public informed.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents and guardians are encouraged to check that their children have received both MMR1 and MMR2 vaccinations. If unsure, please contact Tupapa Primary Care on 20066 or Public Health on 29110 for assistance.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Alaska-Hawaiian merger made another big step this week with the retirement of the “Hawaiian” callsign.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2025/10/24/faa-officially-drops-hawaiian-code-callsign/%22%20%5Co%20%22FAA%20Officially%20Drops%20Hawaiian%20Code,%20Callsign%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would cancel the airline’s callsign, effective Oct. 30.</a> All Hawaiian aircraft will use the Alaska Airlines callsign and code.</p>
<p>A “Hawaiian livery” note will be placed in the flight plan remarks for its flights for 60 days, the agency said.</p>
<p><strong>LAST FLIGHT</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, an airline spokesperson confirmed to AirlineGeeks that the last flight with the long-standing ‘Hawaiian’ callsign would operate on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.</p>
<p>The last flight to use the Hawaiian callsign and code was <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/HAL866%22%20%5Co%20%22%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">HA866</a> from Pago Pago, American Samoa, to Honolulu. This flight was scheduled to land in Honolulu on Wednesday at 5:39 a.m. local time.</p>
<p>“We will retire the HA call sign following the 10/29 arrival of our American Samoa-Honolulu flight,” the spokesperson said. “While Alaska and Hawaiian airlines will soon operate under single call sign (AS), guests will continue to enjoy our distinct Alaska and Hawaiian brand experiences, brought to life by our remarkable employees, along with the reach of our expanding joint global network, and the industry-leading benefits of our Atmos™ Rewards loyalty program.”</p>
<p>Alaska has committed to preserving the Hawaiian brand on flights to, from, and between the islands. The two airlines are awaiting <a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2025/10/09/alaska-hawaiian-integrating-booking-systems/%22%20%5Co%20%22Alaska,%20Hawaiian%20Integrating%20Booking%20Systems%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">a Single Operating Certification from the FAA</a>.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Shutterstock, HONOLULU (Island News) — Hawaiian Airlines marked the end of an era as a pilot made the final transmission using the callsign HA at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>It was a bittersweet moment in Hawaiian Airlines history when a pilot called to the tower at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport and used the callsign HA for the final time, which for 95 years stood for Hawaiian Airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;For Hawaiian 866 Heavy, this will clear the act,” the pilot said during the transmission. “This makes our final transmission under the HA call sign as we turn into Alaska's family. I’d like to say mahalo for your partnership through the years as we continue to share our aloha and represent the people of Hawaii everyday on every Hawaiian Airlines flight.&quot;</p>
<p>Hawaiian Airlines flight 866 took off in Pago Pago, American Samoa and landed in Honolulu before 6 a.m. A special gate was reserved for the occasion so employees could witness the last flight under that call sign. It brings a rich history of 95 years as Hawaiian Airlines to a close.</p>
<p>&quot;There was singing and hugging, and people recognizing what incredible history this company has, and also looking to the future,&quot; shared Hawaiian Airlines CEO Diana Birkett Rakow.</p>
<p>Rakow is the new CEO of Hawaiian Airlines, today is her first official day on the job. She is also the first woman to lead the company.</p>

      <p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would not seek a third term in office, a marked shift after months of teasing the idea despite constitutional limits though it was unclear whether it was his final word on the matter. Trump, who is known for changing his mind on major issues, was speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his three-country Asia tour. His flirtation with the idea has alarmed opponents and constitutional experts, who say a third term would test the 22nd Amendment, which states no person shall be elected to the presidency more than twice. “If you read it, it’s pretty clear — I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad, but we have a lot of great people,” Trump said, adding he thought Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be “unstoppable” if they ran together in 2028.</p>

      <p>Two federal prosecutors in Washington were informed Wednesday that they would be placed on leave after requesting a stiff sentence for a man granted clemency after participating in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, who later turned up armed near the house of former President Barack Obama.</p>

      <p>KYIV, Ukraine — Street battles are raging in the Ukrainian stronghold of Pokrovsk, where Russian soldiers have entered the city after a nearly yearlong assault. The breakthrough underscores the painstaking pace of Moscow’s military advances, but if Russia eventually takes full control of Pokrovsk it would gain a strategically important bridgehead in eastern Ukraine.</p>

      <h1>Billions in heating aid for Americans at risk due to shutdown</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Millions of poor and disadvantaged Americans could face trouble accessing funds for home heating starting next month due to the government shutdown, lawmakers from both parties and nonprofit groups said on Wednesday. The shutdown, now in its 29th day, could prevent states from receiving about $3.6 billion under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The funds help families pay winter heating and summer cooling bills, with about 80% used in the winter months.</p>

      <h1>Nvidia will build AI supercomputers for US Energy Department, wants to get back into China</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington on Tuesday with a message for the Trump administration: the U.S. can win the AI battle if the world, including China’s massive developer base, runs on Nvidia systems. In his address at the first Nvidia developers’ conference held in Washington, Huang walked a fine line between praising President Donald Trump, whose “America First” agenda Huang credited with spurring greater investment in U.S. manufacturing and AI leadership, and risking further antagonism of China. Huang said the artificial intelligence chip leader will build seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and had $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips, but also lamented that the Chinese government has shut it out of its market. Nvidia is at the core of the global AI rollout, and it is striking deals around the world while also navigating a U.S.-China trade war that could determine which country’s technology is most used around the world. Trump is touring Asia ahead of an expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday where China’s use of Nvidia’s chips could be a key issue.</p>

      <p>MEASLES VAX FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa government is urging parents and caregivers to get children under two years old immunized against measles amid reports of increasing measles cases in <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/news/elevated-measles-risk-get-protected-before-you-travel">New Zealand</a> and <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/ahpc-statement-on-measles">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, eight cases of measles have been confirmed, and health officials have <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/576922/hospitals-clinics-not-equipped-for-measles-outbreak-general-practitioner">warned</a> of the risk of an outbreak.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles">measles is a highly contagious and potentially deadly airborne disease</a>, particularly for young children. It can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, brain infection and even death.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry strongly urges all parents and caregivers to ensure that children under 2 years of age receive their routine measles vaccinations without delay at your nearest health facilities,&quot; Samoa's Health Ministry said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1235945695218790&amp;set=a.226234896189880">public notice</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>It said two doses of the measles vaccine are required - the first at 12 months and the second at 15 months.</p>
<p>The Ministry added both doses must be completed for full protection.</p>

<p><strong>VANUATU DEBATE OVER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>A heated debate over constitutional rights and parliamentary privilege is unfolding in Vanuatu.</p>
<p>Local media reports, the Opposition bloc has filed an urgent application in the Supreme Court challenging recent amendments to the constitution.</p>
<p>In June last year, Vanuatu voters said yes to two changes to the country's constitution introduced by government to try and curb political instability.</p>
<p>They aimed to achieve this by ending party-hopping and forcing independent MPs to join political parties.</p>
<p>It follows a particularly turbulent few years which has seen a slew of leadership challenges - resulting in three changes of government in 2023 alone.</p>
<p>But now, a group of Opposition MPs are challenging the Republic of Vanuatu and Speaker of Parliament over the constitutional amendments, arguing they stifle the democratic process and impinge on their rights as elected representatives.</p>

<p><strong>MAN ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING AN OFFICER IN WAIANAE</strong></p>
<p>Honolulu police arrested a man for assaulting an officer on Sunday in Waianae.</p>
<p>It happened at about 11:57 a.m., when police responded to a report of a man with a handgun arguing with a family member on Ala Hema St.</p>
<p>When police arrived, the 20-year-old suspect became combative and attempted to grab an officer’s firearm.</p>
<p>After a brief struggle, he was taken into custody.</p>
<p>The officer sustained minor injuries, and the gun was later determined to be an airsoft pistol.</p>
<p>Charges will be sought with the Dept. of the Prosecuting Attorney.</p>
<p>(Hawaii News Now)</p>
<p><strong>FIJI CYBER SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>Fiji has signed a new partnership with Israel on cyber security.</p>
<p>FBC reported a formal agreement was signed on Wednesday between the two governments, witnessed by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel, who was visiting Fiji.</p>
<p>Rabuka said the government has turned to one of the world's most advanced countries for support.</p>
<p>Haskel said Israel is expanding its interest into other areas to further strengthen relations between the two nations.</p>

<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS WATER</strong></p>
<p>Water levels are running low on one of the Cook Islands' outer islands.</p>
<p>The Aitutaki Water Service has closed two of its eight galleries until ground water levels are restored, which won't happen until decent rainfall.</p>
<p>Cook Islands News reported some households, particularly those on higher ground, will experience a drop in pressure.</p>
<p>One resident told the paper their household has been relying on tank water and they had not had any water from the main network for about three weeks.</p>
<p>(RNZ Pacific)</p>
<p><strong>PNG LAW SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p>The Papua New Guinea Law Society has been reinstated as a full member of the Law Association for Asia and the Pacific (Lawasia).</p>
<p>The National reported President Hubert Namani told a Lawasia Council Meeting in Vietnam this move reaffirms the society's commitment to the promotion of justice.</p>
<p>He said their re-admission to Lawasia opens new pathways for PNG lawyers to access high-level professional development, and contribute to critical regional discussions affecting the rule of law and fundamental rights.</p>

<p><strong>PARLIAMENT RECONSTRUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Two months after a devastating fire that had razed the parliament building, the Marshall Islands promptly picked up the pieces, kicking off the reconstruction of the government chamber known as “Nitijela.”</p>
<p>“Although we felt sorrow and anxiety when the house burned down two months ago, let us thank the Lord that we can now rebuild the house, which was old,” President Hilda Heine said.</p>
<p>Heine led Marshallese officials during the 08 October groundbreaking ceremony for the reconstruction of the Nitijela building, marking “an important step forward,” the president’s office said in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>The fire consumed the parliament building on 26 August, destroying official documents and historical resources stashed in the library and archives. While the structure is mostly still standing, the facility is considered a complete loss.</p>
<p>The Nitijela currently meets at the International Conference Centre in Majuro, which will be its temporary session hall until a new building is constructed. The U.S government has pitched in US<span class="math inline">\(13 million, supplementing the US\)</span>30 million donation from Taiwan, to cover the rebuilding costs.</p>
<p>“I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Donald Trump and the U.S government for their great support, and in these thanks, I add Ambassador Laura Stone. I would also like to express my gratitude to President Lai Ching-te and his family for their support,” Heine said.</p>
<p>She promised that the reconstruction would be completed on time.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning on Tuesday, as the company pares expenses and compensates for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, according to three people familiar with the matter. The figure represents a small percentage of Amazon’s 1.55 million total employees, but nearly 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees. This would mark Amazon’s largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>If the dinner problem — defined, broadly, as “what should I make for dinner?” — is difficult to solve, picture solving it every night for the choosiest audience imaginable. This audience is not composed of food critics, or exacting chefs. It’s children. Nothing in the kitchen is more reliably frustrating than trying to feed a picky one. (I say all of this with love.)</p>

      <p>Many family dinners are planned ahead of time after pulling a delicious-sounding recipe out of a cookbook and making a detailed grocery list. But there are plenty of nights when this home cook just wings it based on what’s lurking in her freezer, has ripened on the counter or — more often than I’d like to admit — is about to spoil in the refrigerator crisper.</p>

<p>The  singing of songs in tune with the beats came from a part of the ranch 300 metres away from the Okuk Highway where  28 cows bought from Sialum in Morobe province are kept in a newly constructed yard, replacing the existing yard built of bush materials and a parameter pike fence all around, all at the cost of K300, 000.</p>

<p>Despite a slow start, the Papua New Guinea Kumuls found their rhythm with a powerful first-half display against the Cook Islands Aitu. Spearheaded by hooker Edwin Ipape, delivered a series of big hits that rattled the Cook Islands forwards and shifted momentum in PNG’s favour.</p>
<p>Ipape was instrumental both in defense and attack; his trademark aggression and energy around the ruck created opportunities that broke the Aitu’s defensive line. His dominance in the middle of the park allowed the Kumuls to seize control, pushing them ahead 22–12 at halftime.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Talaia Mika, Cook Islands News</p>
<p>Source: RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The United States research vessel E/V Nautilus was officially welcomed at Avatiu Wharf on Wednesday local time with a traditional ceremony celebrating a new era of ocean exploration and scientific partnership in the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA), the launch brought together government leaders, scientists and representatives from the Ocean Exploration Trust, the US Embassy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>SBMA commissioner Beverly Stacey Ataera said the arrival of Nautilus and its crew marked the successful completion of a groundbreaking three-week expedition that deepened the country's understanding of its marine environment.</p>
<p>&quot;This voyage was about understanding, and over three weeks, meticulous mapping, imaging and documentation have deepened our view of the seafloor,&quot; Ataera said.</p>
<p>She said the research had helped scientists see what lies beneath our marae moana, &quot;a fascinating space with some truly cute, fascinating creatures&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;To our partners from NOAA and the Ocean Exploration Trust and the US Embassy, meitaki maata, the gift you have given us is knowledge, freely shared, and now you are part of our nation's story,&quot; Ataera said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mark Brown, who is also the Minister responsible for seabed minerals, said the expedition had strengthened scientific collaboration and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to a &quot;science-led path&quot; in exploring its vast ocean territory.</p>
<p>&quot;To our partners, from the government of the United States, and also our representative from NOAA, Dr Eric Noble, welcome,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd also like to acknowledge the Ocean Exploration Trust. Thank you very much for the work that you've done with our Seabed Minerals Authority and also with our scientists over the last few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said the voyage had added to the country's knowledge of the deep and reminded Cook Islanders of their responsibility as &quot;guardians of our moana&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;So this voyage has helped us to see more of our ocean home,&quot; he said. &quot;It's added to our understanding of the deep and has reminded us of the responsibility that we carry as guardians of our moana. We are a people of the ocean. It shapes our culture, our identity and who we are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I spoke with our team on board during the expedition, what stood out was the pride in their voices,&quot; Brown added. &quot;Cook Islanders leading and contributing and being part of world-class science - this is what partnership is all about.&quot;</p>
<p>Ataera praised the enthusiasm of local scientists who worked alongside international experts during the expedition.</p>
<p>&quot;They have lit up with curiosity and are completely absorbed by the work. They have been proudly nerding out, as I say, over tiny fauna, delicate sponges and loudly squealing at times, discussing and celebrating each new image that came through,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ataera described a special moment when Brown spoke directly to Cook Islands scientists onboard the vessel.</p>
<p>&quot;That simple exchange captured for me what this voyage was truly about, partnership in action, science in service of our people and knowledge guiding our future,&quot; Ataera said. &quot;Understanding the deep is not just a luxury, it is essential.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said the collaboration with the United States was a milestone, the first of its kind in years, and reflected the Cook Islands' growing leadership in marine science.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a long time since we've had a significant collaboration of this nature with the United States. So welcome back,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every discovery helps us to make better decisions, decisions based on evidence, transparency and care for our people and our environment.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nautilus expedition, titled Deep-Sea Habitats of the Cook Islands, spent three weeks mapping and documenting the seafloor within the Cook Islands Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
<p>The mission aimed to gather new scientific data to inform government decisions on ocean management, including the exploration phase of seabed minerals.</p>
<p>Ataera said the research would strengthen the country's ability to protect its marine environment while guiding policy and planning for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ocean is not our limit, it is our legacy, and we will continue to explore it with courage, humility and care,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Right to Democracy staff,</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Right to Democracy (RtD) will host a virtual dialogue “Effects of Militarization in U.S. Territories,” bringing together leading scholars to examine how the rapid expansion of joint exercises, base build-outs, and live-fire training across the Pacific and Caribbean is reshaping life in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Panelists will offer historical context, assess the effects of current escalation of activities, and discuss how these dynamics interact with the territories’ democratic deficits and the enduring colonial legal framework under which they are governed.</p>
<p>Moderated by RtD Co-Founder Adi Martínez-Román and RtD Solidarity Director and Cross-territorial Fellow Hadiya Sewer, this panel will bring expert voices and a cross-territorial perspective to the phenomenon of militarization in the Territories, and the unique problems Territories face.</p>
<p>The dialogue will include the contribution of the following participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>          Guam: Dr. Kenneth Gofigan Kuper, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Guam’s Micronesian Area Research Center; Director, Pacific Center for Island Security, providing independent foreign-policy analysis for the Asia-Pacific.</li>
<li>          Northern Mariana Islands: Dr. Theresa “Isa” Arriola, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, Concordia University; Chair, Our Common Wealth 670 (OCW 670) on Saipan, a community advocacy group dedicated to research, education, and public awareness regarding military impacts in the Marianas.</li>
<li>          Puerto Rico: Dr. Melody Fonseca Santos, Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Puerto Rico –Mayagüez. Her research and teaching focus on International Relations Critical Theory, U.S. foreign policy toward the Caribbean, and feminist and gender studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Communities in the territories have lived for generations with decisions made about our lands, waters, and futures without our consent and with “U.S. national security” interests in mind,” said Dr. Adi Martínez-Román, Co-Director and Co-Founder of Right to Democracy and event co-moderator.</p>
<p>“This conversation connects the expertise of scholars from our archipelagos to uncover shared challenges — and to underscore why understanding the intersection between militarization and colonial rule is not optional but urgent.”</p>
<p>“Militarization is never just about bases or training schedules,” added Hadiya Sewer, RtD’s Solidarity Director and National Environment &amp; Democracy Fellow, and event co-moderator.</p>
<p>“It’s about environmental risk, cultural survival, public health, and the everyday ability of people—who lack full democratic voice—to shape what happens to their homelands. This panel explores the effects of militarization when the legal structure itself enables vulnerability.”</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the convicted founder of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, the White House said Thursday, in the latest move by Trump to boost the crypto industry and expunge its past misdeeds. Zhao, a billionaire known as “CZ” who is one of the most influential figures in crypto, quit in 2023 as Binance chief after the company pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and paid a penalty of $4.3 billion. Zhao was prosecuted by the Biden administration “in their war on cryptocurrency,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

<p>For the second consecutive year, the Sugu Peace Basketball Association is preparing to host a major event aimed at cementing reconciliation in a region previously torn by violence. The 2nd Edition Christmas Peace Basketball Tournament is scheduled to run for five days, from December 20th to December 24th, at Katiloma Village in Sugu Valley.</p>
<p>The return of the tournament underscores the success of last year’s inaugural event and the commitment of local youth to sustain a culture of harmony. The basketball games are far more than a holiday celebration; they serve as an official, highly anticipated association tournament designed to attract teams from neighbouring districts and provinces, extending the reach of the peace message.</p>

      <h1>U.S. Pacific territories chart path to Universal Broadband Coverage</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>Territories’ BEAD plans emphasize buried fiber, resiliency, and disaster readiness</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/broadband_logo.png?itok=Ovl5zQk0"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/broadband_logo.png?itok=x0kMHqiv" alt="BEAD LOGO"></a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Three U.S. territories – Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa – have finalized plans to close vast Internet coverage gaps under the federal Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment program.</p>
<p>If approved, the plans would be transformational for the Pacific islands, delivering robust, resilient Internet connections to regions where as much as 80 to 100 percent of locations remain underserved.</p>
<p>In American Samoa, BEAD funding would be used to deploy broadband connections to 80 percent, or 7,653 of the territory’s 9,535 total locations. In the Northern Mariana Islands, it would connect every one of the island’s 9,568 locations to hardened, end-to-end fiber, marking the first time the islands would achieve universal broadband coverage.</p>
<p>Each of the territories' proposals underscores the distinct challenges facing island communities in their efforts to expand broadband. Typhoons and earthquakes are constant threats, limited infrastructure hampers progress, and network resiliency takes on new meaning.</p>
<p>Guam’s submission prioritizes hardening networks and new undersea fiber cabling, while the Northern Mariana Islands requires subgrantees to prepare risk management plans for natural disasters. American Samoa, meanwhile, points to geographic isolation and high deployment costs as its biggest barriers to broadband expansion.</p>
<p>American Samoa To Utilize Fiber, Wireless, And Satellites</p>
<p>American Samoa’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RqCsaL01ort4BoTWfXMVAJvPkteSwEiB/edit?ref=broadbandbreakfast.com">final BEAD plan</a> calls for use of its $37 million BEAD allocation to overcome the territory’s persistent connectivity barriers through strategic investments in fiber and fixed wireless, while also supporting workforce development and digital equity initiatives.</p>
<p>“This funding is critical for the Territory, where geographic isolation, high deployment costs, and infrastructure challenges have historically limited broadband availability,” the Office of Broadband Coordination, Opportunities, Development and Deployment said.</p>
<p>Similar to Guam, two terrestrial providers and one satellite provider were selected to deliver universal coverage across the territory’s 17 project-funded areas.</p>
<p>The American Samoa Telecommunications Authority will lead the largest share of construction, deploying buried fiber to roughly 6,900 locations.</p>
<p>AST Telecom LLC, operating as Bluesky Communications, will extend a fiber and licensed fixed wireless hybrid network to about 300 sites, across five project areas. And, SpaceX’s Starlink service will connect around 430 of the most remote locations.</p>
<p>Together, these projects will connect all 7,653 broadband-serviceable locations and 41 community anchor institutions on the island.</p>
<p>The three U.S. territories are among the <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/states-20-billion-under-budget-for-bead-so-far/">49 U.S. states</a> and <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/washington-d-c-finalizes-plan-for-100m-in-federal-broadband-funding/">the District of Columbia</a> in publicizing their final BEAD proposals. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have not yet released their proposals.</p>
<p>The program’s administrator, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, has yet to approve any plans under its <a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/ntia-rewrites-rules-for-bead-forcing-states-to-rebid-broadband-projects/">revised rules</a>.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The 60,000 men and women responsible for keeping American skies safe have gone unpaid throughout the government shutdown. Without a funding agreement soon, many will be forced to dip into savings, rack up credit-card debt, or take on part-time jobs to make ends meet, several federal employees said. The shutdown is now three weeks old, and rapidly approaching the time when the tens of thousands of government employees who keep security lines moving and air traffic safe will miss a full paycheck. Those workers last received paychecks in mid-October, and those checks were missing up to two days’ worth of pay.</p>

      <p>NEW YORK — North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a new congressional map on Wednesday aimed at securing the party another seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, expanding President Donald Trump’s campaign to use partisan redistricting to help Republicans keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. The state’s previous map, approved by Republicans only two years ago, was already heavily skewed, allowing Republicans to win 10 of 14 U.S. House seats in 2024 despite North Carolina’s status as a closely divided swing state.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Your phone buzzes at 6 a.m. It’s ChatGPT: “I see you’re traveling to New York this week. Based on your preferences, I’ve found three restaurants near your hotel. Would you like me to make a reservation?” You didn’t ask for this. The AI simply knew your plans from scanning your calendar and email and decided to help. Later, you mention to the chatbot needing flowers for your wife’s birthday. Within seconds, beautiful arrangements appear in the chat. You tap one: “Buy now.” Done. The flowers are ordered.</p>
<p>This isn’t science fiction. On Sept. 29, 2025, OpenAI and payment processor <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> launched the <a href="https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/">Agentic Commerce Protocol</a>. This technology lets you buy things instantly from Etsy within ChatGPT conversations. ChatGPT users are scheduled to gain access to over 1 million other Shopify merchants, from major household brand names to small shops as well.</p>

Most people have no idea it’s happening.</p>

<p><strong>FROM SEARCHING TO BEING SERVED</strong></p>
<p>For three decades, the internet has worked the same way: You want something, you Google it, you compare options, you decide, you buy. You’re in control.</p>
<p>That era is ending.</p>
<p>AI shopping assistants are evolving through three phases. First came “on-demand AI.” You ask ChatGPT a question, it answers. That’s where most people are today.</p>
<p>Now we’re entering “ambient AI,” where <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/">AI suggests things before you ask</a>. ChatGPT monitors your calendar, reads your emails and offers recommendations without being asked.</p>
<p>Soon comes “autopilot AI,” where AI makes purchases for you with minimal input from you. “Order flowers for my anniversary next week.” ChatGPT checks your calendar, remembers preferences, processes payment and confirms delivery.</p>
<p>Each phase adds convenience but gives you less control.</p>
<p><strong>THE MANIPULATION PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>AI’s responses create what researchers call an “advice illusion.” When ChatGPT suggests three hotels, you don’t see them as ads. They feel like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend. But you don’t know whether those hotels paid for placement or whether better options exist that ChatGPT didn’t show you.</p>
<p>Traditional advertising is something most people have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/13522751211191973">learned to recognize and dismiss</a>. But AI recommendations feel objective even when they’re not. With one-tap purchasing, the entire process happens so smoothly that you might not pause to compare options.</p>
<p>OpenAI isn’t alone in this race. In the same month, Google announced its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2025/09/22/the-google-ap2-payment-protocol-will-trigger-interesting-innovation/">competing protocol, AP2</a>. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are building similar systems. Whoever wins will be in position to control how billions of people buy things, potentially capturing a percentage of trillions of dollars in annual transactions.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE’RE GIVING UP</strong></p>
<p>This convenience comes with costs most people haven’t thought about.</p>
<p>Privacy: For AI to suggest restaurants, it needs to read your calendar and emails. For it to buy flowers, it needs your purchase history. People will be trading total surveillance for convenience.</p>
<p>Choice: Right now, you see multiple options when you search. With AI as the middleman, you might see only three options ChatGPT chooses. Entire businesses could become invisible if AI chooses to ignore them.</p>
<p>Power of comparing: When ChatGPT suggests products with one-tap checkout, the friction that made you pause and compare disappears.</p>
<p><strong>IT’S HAPPENING FASTER THAN YOU THINK</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT reached <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/">800 million weekly users</a> by September 2025, growing four times faster than social media platforms did. Major retailers began using OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol within days of its launch.</p>
<p>History shows people consistently underestimate how quickly they adapt to convenient technologies. Not long ago most people wouldn’t think of getting in a stranger’s car. Uber now has <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4826/uber-technologies/?srsltid=AfmBOooEKiBOI80u7bBcAdQJQTq2lJTLYQL0ENr1L6dZKtwCuxbagoxs%22%20%5Cl%20%22editorsPicks">150 million users</a>.</p>
<p>Convenience always wins. The question isn’t whether AI shopping will become mainstream. It’s whether people will keep any real control over what they buy and why.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></p>
<p>The open internet gave people a world of information and choice at their fingertips. The AI revolution could take that away. Not by forcing people, but by making it so easy to let the algorithm decide that they forget what it’s like to truly choose for themselves. Buying things is becoming as thoughtless as sending a text.</p>
<p>In addition, a single company could become the gatekeeper for all digital shopping, with the potential for monopolization beyond even Amazon’s current dominance in e-commerce. We believe that it’s important to at least have a vigorous public conversation about whether this is the future people actually want.</p>
<p>Here are some steps you can take to resist the lure of convenience:</p>
<p>Question AI suggestions. When ChatGPT suggests products, recognize you’re seeing hand-picked choices, not all your options. Before one-tap purchases, pause and ask: Would I buy this if I had to visit five websites and compare prices?</p>
<p>Review your privacy settings carefully. Understand what you’re trading for convenience.</p>
<p>Talk about this with friends and family. The shift to AI shopping is happening without public awareness. The time to have conversations about acceptable limits is now, before one-tap purchasing becomes so normal that questioning it seems strange.</p>
<p><strong>THE INVISIBLE PRICE TAG</strong></p>
<p>AI will learn what you want, maybe even before you want it. Every time you tap “Buy now” you’re training it – teaching it your patterns, your weaknesses, what time of day you impulse buy.</p>
<p>Our warning isn’t about rejecting technology. It’s about recognizing the trade-offs. Every convenience has a cost. Every tap is data. The companies building these systems are betting you won’t notice, and in most cases they’re probably right.</p>

      <h1>OpenAI launches AI browser Atlas in latest challenge to Google</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>OpenAI on Tuesday unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, a long-anticipated artificial intelligence-powered web browser built around its popular chatbot, in a direct challenge to Google Chrome’s dominance. The launch marks OpenAI’s latest move to capitalize on 800 million weekly active ChatGPT users, as it expands into more aspects of users’ online lives by collecting data about consumers’ browser behavior. It could accelerate a broader shift toward AI-driven search, as users increasingly turn to conversational tools that synthesize information instead of relying on traditional keyword-based results from Google — intensifying competition between OpenAI and Google.</p>

But her mother insisted at first that she stay home, forbidding her from living in a boardinghouse before marriage.</p>

      <h1>Virginia Giuffre memoir goes on sale, heaping fresh scrutiny on Prince Andrew</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>LONDON — A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Britain’s Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her as a teenager, went on sale in London on Tuesday, days after the disgraced prince gave up his Duke of York title. Much of the contents of the book were reported before its release, triggering renewed scrutiny on Andrew — King Charles’ brother — whose conduct and connections with the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have long been criticised. Andrew, 65, has always denied Giuffre’s account.</p>

      <h1>Former US officials urge Congress to examine ‘weaponization’ working group</h1>

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — A group of hundreds of former U.S. national security officials on Tuesday urged lawmakers to examine an internal government group that has been coordinating President Donald Trump’s retribution drive against his perceived enemies. The Steady State, a rule-of-law advocacy group, issued its call for congressional inquiries into the Interagency Weaponization Working Group in a letter to the top Republicans and Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and armed services committees. The letter came a day after Reuters disclosed that a review of government records showed that the interagency group drew dozens of officials from the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Justice Department, the FBI and other departments.</p>

<p>However, he clarified that Papua New Guineans who join the Australian Defence Force (ADF) will not be part of PNG's Defence Force (PNGDF). Instead, they will be regular Australian soldiers.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to easing the burden of living costs on Papua New Guineans through a series of bold, people-centred economic measures, including the removal of GST from basic food items, the lifting of the non-taxable income threshold, and the recent increase in the national minimum wage.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Marape said his government remains focused on supporting ordinary working-class Papua New Guineans, families, and small wage earners who continue to feel the pressure of global economic challenges.</p>

      <p>OVER 40% OF SAMOAN HOUSEHOLDS CAN’T AFFORD HEALTHY DIETS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/apia_waterfront_wall.jpeg?itok=ysX1-mU6"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/apia_waterfront_wall.jpeg?itok=vJyevc2J" alt="Apia residents sitting on the sea wall"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Many Samoans face serious health risks due to poor nutrition, which is partly attributed to the high cost and limited availability of healthy food in the country, a diet analysis report has found.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/cost-diet-analysis-samoa-august-2025">Cost of the Diet Analysis</a> report published by Samoa's Ministry of Agriculture and the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) reveals the nation is facing a &quot;nutrition crisis&quot;, which is made worse by &quot;a shift from traditional diets to imported, ultra-processed foods&quot;.</p>
<p>The analysis used food price data from the Samoa Bureau of Statistics and WFP's Enhance linear optimization tool to model the lowest-cost food baskets that could meet the nutritional needs of a six-person household.</p>
<p>The report found that, while food may be abundant in calories, it is often deficient in the nutrients essential for health, growth and resilience.</p>
<p>According to the analysis, a nutritious diet in Samoa — which provides both energy and nutrients — costs more than four times than what a basic energy diet costs. As a result, more than 40 percent of Samoan households cannot afford healthy food.</p>
<p>The report also notes that nearly 80 percent of Samoan women are classified as obese, and that over 70 percent of deaths in the country are linked to non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</p>
<p>Samoa Ministry of Agriculture chief executive Dr Seuseu Joseph Tauati and WFP's Pacific Office country director Alpha Bah said: &quot;Findings from the Cost of the Diet Analysis report state that for an average six-member household in Samoa, a nutritious diet that meets the energy and nutritional needs of the household (including foods such as vegetables, coconut, fish, beef, milk, taro and rice) costs WST50 (US$18) per day. This is four times more than the cost of a basic, energy-only diet (such as wheat, coconut and oil).&quot;</p>
<p>They added: &quot;Furthermore, a comparison of diet costs of individual household members highlights the nutritional vulnerability of adolescent girls and breastfeeding women, who face the highest costs for nutritious diets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of this high cost for nutritious diets, many households in Samoa (over 40 percent) cannot afford a healthy diet that contributes to a healthy and productive life.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Seuseu and Bah said the report provides a roadmap for evidence-based, collaborative action.</p>
<p>&quot;First, make nutritious food more affordable and accessible.</p>
<p>“Second, leverage schools and communities.</p>
<p>“Finally, community-based solutions are essential.</p>
<p>“Nutrition is a whole-of-nation responsibility. Simply establishing basic community gardens can increase the supply of local produce not only for families but also to local markets, connecting producers to consumers.</p>
<p>“Something as simple as starting a home garden to grow staples, vegetables and herbs and sharing it with neighbors can go a long way in reducing the cost of healthy diets and adding value to home-cooked meals.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>RNZ AIMS TO STRENGTHEN PACIFIC DEFENSE TIES</strong></p>
<p>Associate Defense Minister Chris Penk says New Zealand is looking to improve regional cooperation and address shared security challenges at this week's South Pacific Defence Ministers' Meeting (SPDMM) in Chile.</p>
<p>The annual gathering brings together defense ministers and senior officials from across the Pacific, including representatives from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Australia, and France, to discuss collective security, humanitarian assistance, and defense cooperation.</p>
<p>Now in its 12th year, the meeting also includes representatives from the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and observers from the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan.</p>
<p>Speaking with William Terite on Pacific Mornings, Penk says he looks forward to the important discussions ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a really important forum for us and for the whole Pacific,&quot; he says. &quot;With friends and partners across the area, we know that there are a lot of interesting engagements that we need to have with fellow ministers, but also senior officials. It's a crucial region for the world and for New Zealand, it's right on our back step.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite ongoing deployments and humanitarian efforts, Penk says New Zealand remains committed to its Pacific obligations.</p>

<p><strong>FBI ISSUES WARNING TO SENIORS</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning seniors about a scam that has cost South Carolinians nearly $10 million this year.</p>
<p>“We know there are multiple people in the Upstate that have experienced this or people who have attempted to scam them out of their hard-earned money,” FBI Public Affairs Specialist, Kevin Wheeler said.</p>
<p>Michael and Roxanne Chrisman are two of the victims of a very advanced and in-depth tech scam.</p>
<p>Six months ago their life turned upside down when they were instructed to withdraw their life savings and turn it into gold.</p>
<p>It all started with a pop-up message on Michael Chrisman’s computer. The notice said the computer was locked and all of his information had been compromised. It gave him a phone number to call, and when he did, the person on the other end identified himself as someone who worked for a large tech company. And of course he was not.</p>
<p>“It was identified as a Microsoft number, so I was comfortable because I have a Microsoft system …”</p>
<p>The FBI also wants to prevent it from happening again. “If someone is asking you to move your money from to one account into another in order to protect it, it’s likely a scam,” FBI Public Affairs Specialist, Kevin Wheeler said.</p>
<p>The FBI gives these tips to help you protect yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>•        Do not click on unsolicited popups, text message or email links.</li>
<li>•        Never give unknown individuals access to your computer.</li>
<li>•        Do not download software at the request of unknown individuals.</li>
<li>•        Do not meet with unknown individuals to deliver cash or precious metals.</li>
<li>•        U.S. Government agencies will never tell you to wire money, send precious metals or purchase gift cards.</li>

<p><strong>RAROTONGA STRUCK BY 'WAVE OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS'</strong></p>
<p>An influx of patients with severe respiratory and flu-like symptoms, including loss of taste and smell, is overwhelming Rarotonga's clinics, as the Ministry of Health monitors the seasonal virus surge and advises the public on proper care and prevention measures.</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, the Rarotonga Hospital and Tupapa Primary Health Clinic have been flooded with people reporting similar symptoms such as loss of taste and smell, shortness of breath, severe headaches and most recently, stomach aches.</p>
<p>Long queues of waiting patients have been seen outside the centre, with many concerned residents reportedly being struck multiple times by the same mysterious illness.</p>
<p>Responding to questions from Cook Islands News, Secretary of Health Bob Williams confirmed that the symptoms being reported are consistent with a wave of acute respiratory infections currently circulating on the island.</p>
<p>Williams revealed that there were about 200 cases recorded in August and 130 cases in September, with the majority in Rarotonga.</p>

<p><strong>SAMOA PM LAAULI HOLD TALKS WITH NZ FOREIGN MINISTER</strong></p>
<p>Samoa's Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Leuatea Fosi Schmidt held talks with the New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters on Sunday.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Samoa government said Laauli and Peters met at the Samoan Consulate in Mangere in Auckland.</p>
<p>It said the two leaders discussed several issues, including the priorities of the new Samoa government, border security to tackle drug trafficking, the development of private enterprises in Samoa, and the New Zealand Recognized Seasonal Employer scheme.</p>
<p>Laauli jetted out of Apia on 21 September, just days after being sworn in as the country's eighth prime minister, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573963/samoan-pm-s-treatment-in-nz-nothing-surprising-but-highlights-domestic-healthcare-gaps-expert">for medical treatment</a> in New Zealand. He said the check-ups for a leg injury — which he had to put on hold due to campaigning for the 29 August elections — were &quot;long overdue&quot;.</p>
<p>He was expected to return to Samoa within a week, but he has had to extend his stay because he is not able to stand, Samoa's Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo confirmed to the Samoa Observer on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Laaulialemalietoa has now been in New Zealand for four weeks. He left five days after being sworn in as the Prime Minister on a private jet. His exact medical condition has not been declared,&quot; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not been confirmed if Laaulialemalietoa will be in the country when the 2025/ 2026 budget is voted on.&quot;</p>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>BOGOTA — Colombia said on Monday it has recalled its ambassador from Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise tariffs on the South American nation and stop all payments to it, intensifying a feud stemming from U.S. military strikes on vessels allegedly transporting drugs. Trump also called Colombian’s leftist President Gustavo Petro an “illegal drug leader” on Sunday, which Petro’s government described as offensive. Colombia’s currency fell 1.4% to 3,889 pesos per U.S. dollar in early trading on Monday. “Daniel Garcia-Pena, Ambassador of Colombia in the United States of America, has been recalled for consultations by President Gustavo Petro and is now in Bogota,” Colombia’s foreign ministry said. “In the coming hours the national government will inform of the decisions taken.”</p>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON/CHICAGO — U.S. farmers on Monday criticized President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the country may import more beef from Argentina, after they recently lost out to the South American nation on soybean sales to top buyer China. Trump said on Sunday that he was considering imports to reduce U.S. beef prices that have climbed to record highs. His administration earlier extended a $20 billion currency swap lifeline to Argentina, which the president considers an ally.</p>

<p>Brittany Romanello Assistant Professor of Sociology, University of Arkansas</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has spent the past few weeks in a moment of both mourning and transition. On Sept. 28, 2025, a <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/10/03/michigan-church-shooting-victims-grand-blanc-township-lds/86498026007/">shooting and arson</a> at a Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Michigan killed four people and wounded eight more. What’s more, Russell M. Nelson, president of the church, died the day before at age 101. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/dallin-h-oaks?lang=eng">Dallin H. Oaks</a>, the longest-serving of the church’s top leaders, was <a href="https://www.deseret.com/faith/2025/10/14/dallin-h-oaks-named-president-of-church-of-jesus-christ/">announced</a> the new president on Oct. 14.</p>
<p>Oaks will inherit leadership of a religious institution that is both deeply American and increasingly global – diversity at odds with the way it’s typically represented in mainstream media, from “ <a href="https://time.com/7018258/the-secret-lives-of-mormon-wives-hulu-explained/">The Secret Life of Mormon Wives</a>” to <a href="https://bookofmormonbroadway.com/">“The Book of Mormon” Broadway musical</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=M3owt_AAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">a cultural anthropologist and ethnographer</a>, I research Latter-day Saints communities across the United States, particularly <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2813777758?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">Latina immigrants</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00027642241285018">young adults</a>. When presenting my research, I’ve noticed that many people still closely associate the church with Utah, where its headquarters are located.</p>
<p>The church has played a pivotal role in Utah’s history and culture. Today, though, only <a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/2589742x-bja10019">42% of its residents are members</a>. The stereotype of Latter-day Saints as mostly white, conservative Americans is just one of many <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-michigan-church-shooting-sits-within-a-long-history-of-hatred-against-mormons-in-america-266481">long-standing misconceptions</a> about LDS communities and beliefs.</p>
<p>Many people are surprised to learn there are vibrant congregations far from the American West’s “ <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/where-is-the-mormon-corridor.html">Mormon Corridor</a>.” There are devout Latter-day Saints everywhere from <a href="https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/from-freeze-to-fire">Ghana</a> and the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20221212-uae-mormons-to-have-first-temple-in-the-middle-east/">United Arab Emirates</a> to <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/02/26/russian-mormons-search-for-identity-and-acceptance-in-an-american-church-a64574">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2025/07/04/lds-branches-shut-down-beijing/">mainland China</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL GROWTH</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Smith founded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in upstate New York in 1830 and immediately <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-missionary-work-in-the-church">sent missionaries</a> to preach along the frontier. The first overseas missionaries traveled to England in 1837.</p>
<p>Shortly after World War II, church leaders <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/chapter-forty-two?lang=eng">overhauled their missionary approach</a> to increase the number of international missions. This strategy led to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52616-0_4">growth across the globe</a>, especially in <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/8900/">Central America</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5406/dialjmormthou.46.3.0045">South America</a> and the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724233515?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">Pacific Islands</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the church has over <a href="https://news-africa.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics">17.5 million members</a>, according to church records. A majority <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/facts-statistics?lang=eng">live outside the U.S.</a>, spread across <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/01/news-of-the-church/church-growing-in-more-than-160-countries?lang=eng">more than 160 countries</a>.</p>
<p>One way the church and researchers track this global growth is <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/members/2024/06/08/charts-growth-church-jesus-christ-latter-day-saints-1830-2023-member-temples-wards-stakes/">by construction of new temples</a>. These buildings, used not for weekly worship but <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/temples">special ceremonies</a> like weddings, were once almost exclusively located in the United States. Today, they exist <a href="https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/statistics/locations/">in dozens of countries</a>, from Argentina to Tonga.</p>
<p>During Nelson’s presidency, which began in 2018, he announced <a href="https://www.thechurchnews.com/temples/2025/04/10/by-the-numbers-look-200-temples-announced-president-nelson-7-years/">200 new temples</a>, more than any of his predecessors. Temples are a physical and symbolic representation of the church’s commitment to being a global religion, although cultural tensions remain.</p>
<p>Among U.S. members, demographics are also shifting. Seventy-two percent of American members are white, down from 85% in 2007, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/latter-day-saint-mormon/?utm_source=Pew+Research+Center&amp;utm_campaign=74f329890a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_09_30_06_50&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-74f329890a-401090902&amp;dialogId=dialog_race-and-ethnicity&amp;activeChartId=30c34b3d90d4d76aebac7aaeb8c917d7">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/future-mormon-church-it-s-latino-n570621">Growing numbers of Latinos</a> – 12% of U.S. members – have played a significant role sustaining congregations across the country.</p>
<p>There are congregations in every U.S. state, including the small community of Grand Blanc, Michigan, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/10/03/michigan-church-shooting-victims-grand-blanc-township-lds/86498026007/">site of the tragic shooting</a>. Suspect <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/28/us/thomas-sanford-michigan-shooting-suspect">Thomas Jacob Sanford</a>, who was fatally shot by police, had gone on a recent <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/09/29/alleged-grand-blanc-attacker-thomas-sanford-said-mormons-were-the-antichrist-burton-man-kris-johns/86424379007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=false&amp;gca-epti=z115144p115550c115550u002844e001300v115144&amp;gca-ft=35&amp;gca-ds=sophi">tirade against Latter-day Saints</a> during a conversation with a local political candidate.</p>
<p>In the following days, an American member of the church raised <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/michigan-latter-day-saints-church-congregant-fundraiser-mass-shooter/">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> for Sanford’s family.</p>
<p><strong>GROWING PAINS</strong></p>
<p>Despite the church’s diversity, its institutional foundations remain <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/01/the-most-american-religion/617263/">firmly rooted</a> in the United States. The top leadership bodies are still composed almost entirely of <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/quorum-of-the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng">white men</a>, and most are American-born.</p>
<p>As the church continues to grow, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5325/jworlchri.13.1.0026">questions arise</a> about how well the norms of a Utah-based church fit the realities of members in Manila or Mexico City, Bangalore or Berlin. How much room is there, even in U.S. congregations, for local cultural expressions of faith?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2813777758?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">Latino Latter-day Saints</a> and members in Latin America, for example, have faced pushback against cultural traditions that were seen as distinctly “not LDS,” such as making altars and giving offerings during <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/what-is-dia-de-los-muertos-an-expert-explains-the-holiday-celebrating-loved-ones-who-have-died">Dia de los Muertos</a>. In 2021, the church launched a <a href="https://www.veniracristo.org/dia-de-los-muertos-2021">Spanish-language campaign</a> using Day of the Dead imagery to increase interest among Latinos. Many members were happy to see this representation. Still, some women I spoke with said that an emphasis on whiteness and American nationalism, as well as <a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/jmh/article-abstract/50/3/121/388041/Latina-Mormons-Remember-SB1070-and-Other-Anti?redirectedFrom=fulltext">anti-immigrant rhetoric</a> they’d heard from other members, deterred them from fully celebrating their cultures.</p>
<p>Even aesthetic details, like musical styles, often reflect a distinctly American model. The standardized hymnal, for example, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/collections/hymns?lang=eng">contains patriotic songs</a> like “America the Beautiful.” This emphasis on American culture can feel especially out of sync in places in countries with <a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/30-countries-with-the-most-latter-day-saints">high membership rates</a> that have histories of U.S. <a href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/zoltan/wp-content/uploads/sites/358/2024/04/InterventionsList2024.pdf">military</a> or <a href="https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/04/01/understand-the-us-participation-in-the-military-coup-of-1964-in-brazil-and-what-may-still-be-revealed/">political</a> interventions.</p>
<p>Expectations about clothing and physical appearance, too, have prompted questions about representation, belonging and authority. It was only in 2024, for instance, that the church offered members in humid areas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/nx-s1-5484938/mormon-women-can-wear-new-sacred-undergarments-some-wonder-why-now">sleeveless versions</a> of the sacred garments Latter-day Saints wear under clothing as a reminder of their faith.</p>
<p>Historically, the church <a href="https://faq.churchofjesuschrist.org/can-mormons-have-tattoos">viewed tattoos as taboo</a> – a <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/great-shall-be-the-peace-of-thy-children?lang=eng">violation of the sanctity of the body</a>. Many parts of the world have thousands of years of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/in-polynesia-tattoos-are-more-than-skin-deep">sacred tattooing traditions</a> – including Oceania, which has <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/06/02/the-most-mormon-country-in-the-world-its-tonga/">high rates of church membership</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGE AHEAD?</strong></p>
<p>Among many challenges, the next president of the church will navigate how to lead a global church from its American headquarters – a church that continues to be misunderstood and stereotyped, sometimes to the point of violence.</p>
<p>The number of Latter-day Saints continues to grow in many parts of the world, but this growth brings a greater need for cultural sensitivity. The church, historically very uniform in its <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/746479054?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true&amp;sourcetype=Dissertations%20&amp;%20Theses">efforts to standardize</a> Latter-day Saints history, art and teachings, is finding that harder to maintain when congregations span dozens of countries, languages, customs and histories.</p>
<p>Organizing the church like a corporation, with a top-down decision-making process, can also make it difficult to address <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/mormons-grapple-with-church-s-history-of-discrimination-amid-wider-racial-reckoning">painful racial histories</a> and the needs of marginalized groups, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/mormon-transgender-restrictions-lds-church-rcna167582">like LGBTQ+ members</a>.</p>
<p>The transition in leadership offers an opportunity not only for the church but for the broader public to better understand the multifaceted, global nature of Latter-day Saints’ lives today.</p>

      <h1>Samoa villagers begin talks with government on sharing Manawanui compensation fund</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>By Renate Rivers, Pacific Morning News</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa’s government recently met with Safata villagers to discuss how to disburse the ST$10 million <em>HMNZS Manawanui</em> payment from the New Zealand Government.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.samoaobserver.ws/category/samoa/116498?fbclid=IwY2xjawNc5xlleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHgoo48XzeIpwDpfk7Mccm18WlqrAg6QxugzQs6IoSyqgNbmZVtb7bjEikofq_aem_bitoHGJK73lR-ziFpl20bw%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Samoa Observer</a> reports that a meeting was held on Wednesday, with representatives from the district, government officials, and members of the New Zealand government. They discussed how to allocate the funds among the affected communities.</p>
<p>The Samoa government will oversee the allocation process, which includes establishing criteria, inviting applications from potential recipients, reviewing applicants based on their impact from the ship's grounding and sinking, and distributing funds accordingly.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s representative in Samoa, Sialei Van Toor, apologized for the naval disaster, highlighting the long-standing relationship between the two countries. “We deeply regret the impact this incident had on your community. For better or worse, the <em>Manawanui</em> is now a part of our shared history.”</p>
<p>The funding plan will prioritize recovery, environmental restoration, and sustainable development. Additional programs are earmarked to clean up marine and coastal waste. The plan will also include training to improve the protection of conservation areas and support for small-scale economic initiatives such as eco-tourism ventures. No decision has been made about whether the sunken ship will be turned into a local attraction or removed entirely.</p>
<p>As reported, proposals for fund disbursement include going through the district, the government, or a consultancy service, all aimed at providing direct aid to families and communities whose livelihoods depend on tourism and fishing.</p>
<p>Last week, Finance Minister <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1478507393781097&amp;set=a.596609185304260%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Mulipola Anarosa Ale-Molioo</a> announced that Parliament will enable fund disbursement once the delayed 2025/ 2026 central budget is passed.</p>
<p>Mulipola also told local media that New Zealand has pledged an additional ST<span class="math inline">\(14million (NZ\)</span>8.8m). This money will be directed towards coral reef restoration and addressing other environmental damage caused by the grounding and sinking of the Manawanui, which is valued at $100m. A prohibition zone spanning a two-kilometer radius remains in place around the site of the sunken ship.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nzdf.mil.nz/media-centre/news/statement-on-the-marking-of-one-year-since-the-sinking-of-hmnzs-manawanui/?fbclid=IwY2xjawNdHG9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFtYW5yeWcyY3ppd1dLUzY3AR53UTCivT4piJerQkTO-UrLNXFv8keLJvQ4LNnCiWQAkfKpPc14S3tosSkenA_aem_5v-U8zzQAuumoAle0jbj_g%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Captain Roger Ward</a>, who is heading the Manawanui Response, says that “further work is required” despite efforts over the last 12 months to minimise the effects of the sinking and investigate the causes. “Fallen shipping containers have been removed. Fuel, oil, other pollutants, equipment, weapons, ammunition, and debris have been recovered, and the wreck has been made as safe as possible.”</p>
<p>The Safata meeting was held over a week after Foreign Affairs Minister Vaovasamanaia Winston Peters announced the payment on the first anniversary of the wreck. Vaovasa says the payment followed a request from the Samoan government: “We recognize the impact the sinking has had on local communities and acknowledge the disruption it caused.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nzdf.mil.nz/navy/navy-news/final-court-of-inquiry-into-hmnzs-manawanui-grounding-and-sinking-in-samoa-released/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Court of Inquiry</a> report released in March on the loss of the ship showed weaknesses in training, supervision, and personnel levels within the New Zealand Navy. This included a high number of missing or unqualified personnel aboard during the mission.</p>
<p>The report concluded that leadership and procedural failures led to the grounding. However, it recognised the courage and discipline shown during the evacuation, with local Samoan responders and villagers supporting the crew to prevent a greater tragedy.</p>

<p>The start of the national Grade 8 examinations in Papua New Guinea has underscored the stark logistical divide between urban and remote schools. While students in cities begin their tests with ease, educators in the country's rugged interior are enduring a perilous, multi-day trek to ensure their students get a fair chance.</p>
<p>The challenges are dramatically illustrated by the journey to Rumara Primary School in the remote Kokoda Local Level Government (LLG) of Northern (Oro) Province. Here, the national examination papers are on an arduous two-day voyage, crossing rivers and scaling steep mountains to meet the scheduled start time.</p>

<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Hundreds of patients at Samoa's main hospital, the Tupua Tamasese Meaole Hospital in the capital, Apia, went without meals after kitchen staff failed to show up for work in protest over unpaid wages.</p>
<p>The inpatient capacity of the national hospital is around 200 beds. According to local media reports, this is the first time such an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>Dr Tito Kamu, a senior doctor at the hospital, told TV1 Samoa that the hospital chefs did not show up for work on Thursday due to 11 weeks of unpaid overtime.</p>
<p>Patients admitted across all wards and the emergency unit did not receive any breakfast, he said.</p>
<p>Dr Kamu said kitchen staff at the hospital earned around WST<span class="math inline">\(8,000 per year (approximately NZ\)</span>5000) — roughly WST<span class="math inline">\(150 (NZ\)</span>92) per week.</p>
<p>The Samoa Observer reported that private companies had stepped in to provide meals for patients.</p>
<p>&quot;By 6pm Thursday, a Ministry of Health van was seen delivering pre-packed meals to the hospital, assisted by staff members who helped unload the food,&quot; the report stated.</p>
<p>Tagaloa Dr Robert Thomsen, the country's acting director-general for health, confirmed that two catering companies had been called in to provide meals for patients, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>According to Tagaloa, the issue regarding overtime pay arose due to &quot;miscommunication&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue has been resolved, and they will return to work tomorrow,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the Samoa Observer.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> As the world watches the unfolding events in the Middle East, including the emotional reunions between the last of the Israeli hostages and their loved ones, support for the State of Israel continues to resonate in Samoa, thousands of miles away from the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, more than a thousand people from different Christian denominations, including members of Pentecostal and mainline churches, gathered in downtown Apia on Saturday, October 4, 2025, to publicly express their solidarity with Israel.</p>
<p>It was a sight to behold. Israeli flags fluttered proudly alongside Samoan flags as participants dressed in blue and white, the colors of Israel’s flag and Samoa's national colors, assembled along Beach Road, stretching from the Sheraton Hotel to the Apia Protestant Church, for the “March for Israel”. The white banner emblazoned with the blue Star of David, framed by two blue stripes, stood out prominently amid the crowd. The sound of shofars, traditional Hebrew horns, blown by participants in biblical-style attire, echoed over the rhythm of gospel music booming from large speakers, creating a powerful and emotional atmosphere of faith and unity.</p>
<p>It was a drizzly Saturday morning, and by 7am, the crowd, which had begun arriving as early as 5:30am, had swelled to more than a thousand enthusiastic marchers, all eager to show their support for Israel despite the gloomy weather.</p>
<p>Children, youth, and adults lined both sides of Beach Road, many arriving in busloads from villages as far away as Satapuala and Falelatai on the western side of Upolu. A sense of anticipation and excitement filled the air as the crowd prepared for the short march toward the Government Building on Beach Road.</p>
<p>The drizzle turned into a downpour just as the march began with the sounding of the shofar. Yet the rain did little to dampen the spirits of the marchers. Pastors and clergy, young and old alike, led the sea of blue-and-white-clad supporters who marched, sang joyfully, and waved the Samoan and Israeli flags as though it were a sun-kissed morning.</p>
<p>Led by a police vehicle escort, the procession made its way along Beach Road, circling the town clock before continuing toward the Government Building. It was a peaceful, joyful, and deeply spiritual march in support of the State and people of Israel. There were no confrontations, no violence, no angry chants or threats, just the uplifting sound of singing and praise.</p>
<p>The scene stood in stark contrast to many of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations witnessed in Europe, Australia, and the United States, where crowds have chanted slogans such as “Death to Israel,” “Free Palestine,” and “From the river to the sea.”</p>
<p>The resounding blasts of the shofar and uplifting worship music heralded the crowd’s arrival in front of the Government Building. Tents had been set up in advance, and awaiting the procession were Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo, Members of Parliament, senior government officials, and prominent church leaders and clergy.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was electric, almost festive, as drenched marchers sang, danced, and waved their flags with unrestrained joy and excitement, seemingly oblivious to the rain, which by then had mercifully eased. A short service followed, during which the crowd worshipped together, praying for God’s blessing and protection upon His chosen people as they face growing persecution.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe praised the marchers for their steadfast support of Israel, noting that their stand reflects the official position of the Government of Samoa as publicly affirmed by Prime Minister Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt.</p>
<p>There was thunderous cheering and applause as Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe concluded his remarks by reaffirming Prime Minister Laauli’s declaration: “Samoa stands with Israel! God bless Israel! God bless Samoa!” The proclamation captured the spirit of the gathering — a powerful expression of faith, unity, and biblical conviction.</p>
<p>Subsequent speakers echoed his sentiments, delivering strong messages of solidarity with the God of Israel — and the God of Samoa — as they quoted from Scripture and reminded the crowd of the shared spiritual bond between the two nations.</p>
<p>“I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” (Genesis 12:3)</p>
<p>This is part of God’s covenant with Abraham, often interpreted by believers as a divine promise extending to Abraham’s descendants, the people of Israel.</p>
<p>“For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of His eye.&quot; (Zechariah 2:8)</p>
<p>“To God be the glory!” declared Pastor Leota Kosi Latu, one of the organizers of the march. “We have made our statement loud and clear, and I want to thank everyone who braved the elements this morning to publicly declare our support for Israel, God’s chosen people.”</p>
<p>Pastor Leota also voiced concern about the number of Samoans who, in his view, have been misled by what he described as biased international media coverage of the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Some of our people, both here in Samoa and abroad, have become what Lenin once called ‘useful idiots’ — joining the thousands around the world taking part in pro-Palestinian protests, chanting death threats, and cursing Israel,” he said.</p>
<p>“It saddens me because they are protesting something they do not truly understand, chanting about a place they have never even seen. They call Israel’s actions ‘genocide,’ when in reality the nation is fighting to rescue its hostages and defend its very existence against hostile Arab neighbors.</p>
<p>“They curse Israel,” he added solemnly, “but they do not realize that in doing so, they bring that curse upon themselves.”</p>
<p>Pastor Leota clarified that their support for Israel is not political, but deeply spiritual.</p>
<p>“However,” he said, “we are witnessing in real time the unfolding of biblical prophecies — events the Scriptures foretold would occur in the ‘end times,’ just before the second coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>“Right now, we are beginning to see the convergence of politics and the spiritual,” he continued. “What was once considered purely political is no longer just that — it has become profoundly spiritual.

<p>Source: Earth.or</p>
<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —  July 1970. The Cold War is thawing, but far from over; the Nixon government is retreating from Vietnam in the face of an enormous anti-war movement; and a corporation called Deepsea Ventures is conducting the world’s first deep sea mining test on the Blake Plateau, 300 kilometers off the US east coast. There, the sea floor is littered with nuggets of valuable minerals like cobalt, nickel and manganese, some 60,000 of which will be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dredged up</a> from a test area spanning 43 kilometers.</p>
<p>The Deepsea Ventures test and the oil shock of 1973 heralded a <a href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/dreams-optimizing-ocean-1970-deepsea-ventures-mining-test-and-artificial-upwelling%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">flurry of investment</a> in seabed mining through the 1970s, as US <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2156&amp;context=jil%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">fears</a> about dependence on foreign sources of raw materials grew – the CIA even used one test to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77-00432R000100360006-2.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">hide an operation</a> to recover a wrecked Soviet submarine. But by the 1990s, the momentum behind the emerging industry had dissipated. Resource competition was incongruent with the post-Cold War “unipolar moment” of globalization and free trade and minerals were never extracted from the ocean floor on a commercial scale.</p>
<p>Five and a half decades later, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250509-blake-plateau-the-uss-50-year-old-scars-from-the-worlds-first-deep-sea-mining-test-site%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">damage</a> inflicted on Blake Plateau by the Deepsea Ventures test remains. While scientists are still studying the real environmental toll of deep sea mining, available research paints <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/deep-sea-mining-explained%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">a concerning picture</a>: the release of carbon sequestered in seabeds, permanent ecosystem disruption and fishery contamination are just <a href="https://earth.org/protecting-uncharted-ecosystems-why-we-need-a-deep-seabed-mining-moratorium/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">some of the possible costs</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with demand for critical minerals surging due to their role in <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">digital and renewable energy</a> (not to mention <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_231765.htm%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">military</a>) technologies, in April US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to restart the deep sea mining drive.</p>
<p>Wherever resource extraction might augment US power, the second Trump government seems ruthlessly committed to pursuing it – be it <a href="https://earth.org/trump-to-open-up-59-million-acres-of-national-forest-to-logging-mining/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">opening 60 million acres of national forest for logging and mining</a>, repealing <a href="https://earth.org/100-days-of-trump-how-the-us-overturned-years-of-climate-progress/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">barriers to oil drilling in the Arctic</a> or <a href="https://earth.org/trumps-signs-executive-orders-to-revive-beautiful-clean-coal-in-blow-to-us-emissions-reduction-efforts/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">reinvigorating US coal production</a>. Its determination to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“unleash”</a> deep sea mining is just another expression of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra.</p>
<p>But the geopolitical ambitions behind the move are not restricted to the Republican party. As Columbia University Professor Adam Tooze wrote in his <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“Bidenomics”</a> postmortem last year, a strategy of excluding China from key technology supply chains is now effectively bipartisan policy. In these terms, deep sea mining would be wholly consistent with Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, for instance. Just as the latter aimed to promote US economic independence from China by <a href="https://earth.org/chips-act/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">subsidizing domestic semiconductor production</a>, the Trump government presents deep sea mining as a matter of national security – of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">“securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control.”</a> Independent, in other words, of China, which currently <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/09/deep-sea-mining-critical-minerals/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">dominates</a> the global critical mineral supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p>The waters of a far-flung US territory in the south Pacific are emerging as a forefront in this new drive to plunder the deep.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Trump’s executive order, California-based firm Impossible Metals in April applied for a commercial mining lease in an <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/BOEM-2025-0035-0001%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">18 million-acre area</a> off the coast of American Samoa. Undaunted by the evidence of environmental risks, the company brands itself as a model of social responsibility. Its website is awash with references to sustainability, fairness and equity. Its number one “ <a href="https://impossiblemetals.com/about/mission-and-culture/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">core value</a>” is “planet comes first: environment and people before profit.” It promises to deliver “seabed harvesting without destroying the habitat.”</p>
<p>In a world where corporate <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-greenwashing/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">greenwashing</a> is rife, however, one would be forgiven for taking the firm’s claims with a pinch of salt – and the people of American Samoa, for one, are not convinced. Since making its application, Impossible Metals <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">has been on the ground</a> in the territory trying to win local support, presenting at public meetings and promising 1% of its profits to the islands.</p>
<p>But the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s call for public comments on Impossible Metals’ application attracted not only an <a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/territories-join-american-samoa-in-fight-against-deep-sea-mining/article_8e6e17b4-4df7-41c2-a3af-fd423ab5ee51.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">overwhelmingly negative response</a> but also a substantial <a href="https://ictnews.org/news/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-the-trump-administration-might-do-it-anyway/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">petition of opposition</a>. American Samoa’s political leadership, too, is united in rejecting deep sea mining. In 2024 then-Governor Lemanu Mauga enacted a <a href="https://www.osas.as/_files/ugd/36d1c0_3789f4f26b4f4a41bdab6e87d36a9388.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">moratorium</a> on seabed extraction in American Samoan waters, and this year, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolao Pula, who took office in January, reiterated that opposition in a <a href="https://www.americansamoa.gov/leadershipunited%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">joint-statement</a> with other key leaders.</p>
<p>American Samoans have good reasons to be circumspect of deep sea mining in their corner of the Pacific. As the American Samoa Resilience Office outlines in its <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0103%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">submission</a> on Impossible Metals’ application, the local tuna industry, which employs 5,000 people out of a total population of less than 50,000, “could be severely impacted by sediment plumes, toxins and habitat disruptions.” The material and economic risks are matched by social, cultural and spiritual ones. As another <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/BOEM-2025-0035-0104%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">submitter writes</a>, to Samoans “the ocean isn’t just a resource or commodity; it is our relative, an integral part of our culture, our provider, and our home… To threaten its health is to threaten who we are as Pasefika people.”</p>
<p>But while American Samoans’ opposition seems emphatic, what influence this might have on US government decision-making is less clear. As author Daniel Immerwahr shows in his book <em>How to Hide an Empire</em>, American Samoa and the other US territories exist in an implicitly colonial relationship with Washington. American Samoans cannot vote for President and have no Senator, and their representative in the House is excluded from voting on legislation.</p>
<p>Impossible Metals’ application must now pass a <a href="https://www.boem.gov/marine-minerals/american-samoa-activities%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">government environmental impact assessment</a> but if the Trump government proves resolute in its commitment to extraction, American Samoa may not have the power to stop it. As Immerwahr pithily puts it, “empire might be hard to make out from the mainland, but from the sites of colonial rule themselves, it’s impossible to miss.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Adam Tooze</a>, the “daunting historical significance of the [anti-China] policies that have been enacted under Biden” – and which are being extended under Trump – “is that they mark the definitive and self-conscious end of the globalizing post-Cold War moment.” It is logical, then, that this should be the moment when the prospect of deep sea mining, dormant since the end of US-Soviet competition in the late 1980s, should resurface. Before us is a new abyss of great power politics, threatening to envelop in its callous gravity both the deepest places in nature and the Indigenous people closest to them.</p>

      <h1>Teachers' union proposes 'leather belt' discipline, Fiji government emphasizes child rights</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/8124.jpeg?itok=YqpcmJoG"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/8124.jpeg?itok=o-w63ZxI" alt="students at their desks"></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Fijian Teachers Association (FTA) is advocating for &quot;some form&quot; of corporal punishment to enforce discipline in primary and secondary schools, but the government says physical punishment cannot be the solution to indiscipline.</p>
<p>The association's general secretary Paula Manumanunitoga told a forum on corporal punishment in Suva this week that teachers feel threatened in the classroom and parents are not playing their part.</p>
<p>He said teachers were being sworn at, had objects thrown at them, were verbally abused, and had their hair pulled.</p>
<p>He said it is a &quot;serious matter&quot; and the FTA is worried about the country.</p>
<p>&quot;FTA is proposing that there should be some form... we would not want to call it corporal punishment. Some have gone to the extent of calling it violence,&quot; Manumanunitoga said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are suggesting that it be only with the head of school and following the strict conditions of strapping a leather belt. It would be a deterrent for students. I was a primary school teacher, if I lay a belt on my table the students would not make a noise. But when that belt disappears, there's havoc in the classroom.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the country's Education Minister Aseri Radrodro said discipline must always be guided by law, compassion, and respect for the rights and dignity of every child.</p>
<p>Under Fiji's 2013 Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which Fiji ratified in 1993, all forms of inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited.</p>
<p>Radrodro said this was what guided the Education Ministry's approach to discipline and child protection in schools.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Education maintains a zero-tolerance policy on abuse, neglect, exploitation and corporal punishment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our teachers must adhere to the Student Code of Conduct which promotes respect, safety and engagement and we encourage parents to take the lead as the first teachers in their homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Fiji's permanent secretary for justice and a psychologist Selina Kuruleca said when a child is struck — even lightly — the brain will register danger.</p>
<p>Citing a United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) report, Kuruleca said 81 percent of Fijian children — eight out of 10 — experience violent discipline at home.</p>
<p>She told participants at the national dialogue discipline should not break a child's spirit, it should build it.</p>
<p>A letter published in The Fiji Times on Wednesday questioned the need for such a public dialogue on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Why have a national conversation on corporal punishment when it is common knowledge that classroom behavior had deteriorated since the abolition of corporal punishment?&quot; wrote Wise Muavono from Lautoka.</p>
<p>&quot;It is inevitable that bad classroom behavior has filtered into life outside school. The no smacking rule is turning some children into monsters.&quot;</p>
<p>Another letter writer and teacher Rajnesh Lingam wrote, &quot;Dialogue is a must as we aim to address negative behavior in children.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can't leave this unattended as it will have drastic consequences on teaching and learning in schools, communities and societies,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Unicef Pacific chief of child protection Michael Copeland told ABC Pacific Beat the discussion about how to discipline children is a &quot;difficult&quot; one.</p>
<p>Copeland said calling for a return to hitting children &quot;is a cry for help&quot;.</p>
<p>He said there were other options to discipline children instead of corporal punishment.</p>
<p>These could be school counseling, mental health services for kids who were struggling, capacity building for teachers, and parenting training, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids aren't born bad and disruptive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're coming out in particular environments [and] we've got gaps around more advanced and dedicated services, mental health services, and then alongside that, we've got families who are really struggling.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Conversation on Corporal Punishment was organized by Fiji's Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. The event brought together key voices from the judiciary, education, psychology, faith communities, and development partners.</p>

      <h1>Astronomers observe rings forming around icy celestial body Chiron</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The rings of Saturn are among the wonders of our solar system, with a diameter of roughly 175,000 miles (280,000 kilometers) as they encircle the giant planet. But smaller celestial bodies in the solar system also boast ring systems that are impressive in their own right, even if their scale is not as grand. Scientists said they have observed for the first time a ring system in the process of formation and evolution, consisting of four rings and diffuse material, surrounding a small icy body called Chiron that orbits the sun in the expanse between Saturn and Uranus. Chiron is part of a class of objects called centaurs that populate the outer solar system between Jupiter and Neptune, displaying characteristics of both asteroids and comets. Formally called “(2060) Chiron,” it has a diameter of about 200 kilometers (125 miles) and takes about 50 years to complete one orbit around the sun. Centaurs are composed mainly of rock, water ice and complex organic compounds.</p>
