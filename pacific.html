</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-text field-label-inlinec clearfix field-label-inline"><div class="field-label">By&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Teuila Fuatai,  RNZ Pacific senior reporter</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> New information shows Canadian mining group The Metals Company (TMC) is a step closer to deep sea mining in international waters under controversial US laws.</span></p>
<p>Two Pacific nations, Nauru and Tonga, are involved as the company's partners, even though the US process sits outside international law. The developments were revealed in TMC's documents and announcements released this month.</p>
<p>Nauru's and Tonga's respective relationships with TMC go back more than a decade.</p>
<p>Both nations have special rights to a deep sea mining area of the Pacific Ocean known as the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) under international oceans law. Each partnered with TMC to explore their areas.</p>
<p>Until this year, those arrangements were through the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which the UN recognizes as the world's deep sea mining regulator.</p>
<p>But in four months, these arrangements have changed after an executive order from President Donald Trump directed more US involvement in the deep sea mining industry.</p>
<p>The order has positioned the US as a deep sea mining regulator in international waters alongside the ISA. It has been criticised by the ISA, as well as several countries, NGOs, and legal experts for undermining international law.</p>
<p>TMC, on the other hand has leaned into it, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/561813/deep-sea-mining-frontrunner-set-to-sidestep-un-oversight-pivots-to-us-route">frustrated</a> with the ISA's lack of progress in developing commercial mining rules. To date, no commercial mining has occurred in the CCZ.</p>
<p>TMC's August documents confirmed it had sought a commercial mining permit through the US for part of Nauru's block in the CCZ.</p>
<p>The company declined an interview with RNZ Pacific, but its August documents said "commercial production" for this area could start in 2027.</p>
<p>Joey Tau, co-ordinator of the Pacific Network on Globalization (PANG), has urged caution and warned deep sea mining was a huge unknown.</p>
<p>"There is more need for deep sea science and research, but one that is done independently, that benefits the common good of all humankind, and not one that is driven by industry," he said.</p>
<p>The documents also show TMC applied for two exploration permits for Nauru and Tonga's CCZ blocks through the US pathway. The company already has existing exploration contracts for these areas under the ISA.</p>
<p>The company stated both countries would receive benefits should mining occur. It was also committed to social and community initiatives.</p>
<p>However, Tau remains unconvinced about TMC's promises, and reiterated PANG's support for a moratorium on deep sea mining.</p>
<p>"Mining has a really bad history in this part of the world. You can [also] look at other continents - it has displaced people, it has brought about social differences," he said.</p>
<p>"This agenda being pushed - I think it is the recolonising of our region over and over. This time, we're made to think that we're in a driver's seat."</p>
<p>Drew Havea, the chairman of the Civil Society Forum of Tonga, said most Tongans disagreed with their country's involvement in deep sea mining.</p>
<p>Havea was deeply disappointed with his government's partnership with TMC and called for a referendum on the issue at the country's November election.</p>
<p>"I think that we need to respect the view of the people, and we need to be accountable to the people," he said.</p>
<p>"If [the government] don't believe that we represent the voices of the people, why not a referendum in the November election this year? I think that will settle that."</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific requested comment from both the Tonga and Nauru governments, but neither responded.</p>
<p>The ISA also declined to comment.</p>
<p>The US agency incharge of deep sea mining, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), responded with an email statement, saying the US policy determines how it reviews mining applications in international waters.</p>
<p>NOAA added that it is working to streamline its process.</p>

      (BPT) - Tankless electric water heaters are transforming the way households experience hot water by offering energy-efficient, space-saving solutions that deliver heated water on demand. These compact units can be up to 98% smaller than traditional storage water heaters. They may be installed in tight spaces or even mounted to a wall, freeing up valuable space while reducing energy consumption.

      (BPT) - There truly is no place like home. It is our haven, filled with our favorite things. It is comfortable and familiar. It makes sense, then, that receiving healthcare at home is sometimes viewed more positively than in a clinical setting.

</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-source field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">Source: Congresswoman Uifa’atali Amata’s D.C. staff</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><em>Washington, D.C. —</em> Congresswoman Uifa’atali Aumua Amata, vice chairman of both the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs, the two main congressional committees with legislative responsibility regarding the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), expressed “shock and dismay” when told of the devastating fire at the Nitijela building in Majuro yesterday.</p>
<p>“I was in that building just last year,” recalled Amata, “to attend the President’s annual message opening the session of the sitting of the Nitijela,” the Republic’s national legislative body.  “Although the Nitijela is currently in session, I thank God the fire was at night and no one was hurt.  I have made calls and understand that the building was total loss and will have to be reconstructed from the ground up.”</p>
<p>“The Marshalls are like a second home to me.  I spent part of my youth on Majuro when my father was head of government and through children produced by sibling marriage, the blood of the Marshalls runs through the veins of my family,” Amata continued.  “So, this fire is personal to me and I will do all in my power to help the government in its restoration efforts.”</p>
<p>RMI President Hilda Heine is a longtime personal friend and Amata said she will pledge to work for whatever assistance President Heine needs to get the property reconstructed.  “I can only hope that any important papers that were stored in the building were digitized and can be retrieved electronically,” Amata continued.</p>
<p>The Republic of the Marshall Islands is an independent country that has a Compact of Free Association (COFA) with the United that gives the U.S. access to the islands with specific defense rights and responsibilities in exchange for guaranteed federal financial assistance.  In addition, Marshallese citizens have the right of free entry into the U.S. and can relocate anywhere in the U.S. </p>
<p>As a senior member of the Natural Resources Committee, the Congresswoman chaired the Task Force on the IndoPacific created by Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) in the 118th Congress to complete consideration of legislation to extend for 20 years the Compact for RMI and two other freely associated states (FAS) in the strategically critical northern Pacific Micronesian region. RMI, which is home to a U.S. army base on Kwajalein, is an important friend and partner in an increasingly strategic Pacific region.</p>
<p>Prior to final passage of the bill, Chairman Westerman led a bipartisan delegation to the three FAS: RMI, the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia, where Congresswoman Amata took personal pleasure in introducing most of the delegation for the first time to the beauty of the islands and the warm friendliness of the Micronesian people.</p>
<p>“I have directed my staff to review the Compact of Free Association to see what measures Congress might take in coordination with appropriate agencies in President Trump’s administration to assist President Heine in her reconstruction efforts,” Amata concluded.</p>

<p>Officer O joined the Maui Police Department in December 2020 as part of the 91st Recruit Class. She began her career in the Kīhei Patrol District. She transferred to the Wailuku Patrol District in December 2021. As a member of the Honor Guard, she was known for her dedication. Suzanne often volunteered during busy times, stepping in to help with Alternative Calls for Service, even on her days off, to support her fellow officers. She also assisted the Department’s Dispatch team, always ready to take on any role where she was needed.</p>
<p>Suzanne received a Certificate of Merit for her brave work during the August 8, 2023 wildfires. That day, she showed what it means to put others first, working in dangerous conditions to protect people and property. Community members often praised her professionalism and kindness, and her colleagues remember her as honest, caring, and dedicated to serving Maui County.</p>
<p>Fluent in Samoan, Suzanne proudly graduated from Farrington High School in 2006 on Oʻahu. Between 2010 and 2013, she pursued higher education at Solano Community College in California, then continued her criminal justice studies in 2016 at Chaminade University in Honolulu. Before joining the Maui Police Department, she worked in the legal and insurance fields.</p>
<p>Officer O leaves behind a legacy of courage, kindness, and deep devotion to others. She gave of herself freely, showing that real service is about sacrifice and love, not recognition. She will be deeply missed by everyone who knew and loved her.</p>
<p>She is predeceased by her parents, Jong Ho O and Suasua O. Suzanne is survived by her sister, Linda Teevale Fujii (Harry), and brothers Tuiloli Simeaota (Lagi), Shen O (Ioka Latisha), and Chellemine Ho (Gloria). She also shared her life with her boyfriend, Officer Alex Pagan, his children Naheana, Xander, and Kamaiya, and many nieces and nephews. Her brothers and sisters in blue from the Maui Police Department were not just colleagues but cherished friends who stood by her throughout her career, offering support and camaraderie.</p>
<p>Those who worked with Suzanne saw what true selflessness looked like. She always put others first, both at work and in her daily life. She had a quiet strength and a warmth that touched everyone she met. Her colleagues and community will remember her as a protector, a helper, and a friend who lived with integrity and heart.</p>
<p>When she wasn’t working, Suzanne loved spending time with her nieces and nephews. Family meant everything to her, and she found happiness in being with those she loved. Her sense of family went beyond relatives, including close friends in bonds of loyalty, compassion, and care.</p>
<p>A memorial service will be held on Friday, August 29, 2025, on Maui, at the Maui Arts &amp; Cultural Center (One Cameron Way, Kahului, HI 96732) at 9:30 a.m. A memorial service will be held on Monday, September 1, 2025, on Oahu, at Valley of the Temples (47-200 Kahekili Highway, Kaneohe, HI 96744) at 10:00 a.m.</p>
<p>The family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the community for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time and sincerely apologizes to anyone inadvertently omitted.</p>
