<p>(BPT) - The summer spike in COVID-19 infections, triggered in part by
a rise in new variants of the virus, was an unpleasant reminder that
COVID-19 is here to stay. As we brace for an anticipated larger wave of
COVID-19 cases during the fall and winter respiratory season, healthcare
professionals want to remind the public that the virus does not affect
everyone equally; some people, because of their age or overall health,
may be at greater risk for severe illness.1,2</p>

Auto Liability Coverage Limits to Increase in 2025 to Better Financially
Protect Drivers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - The state of California has not raised auto liability
coverage limits for more than 50 years, but that is set to change
beginning next year. The new legislation, introduced in 2022 to keep
pace with rising medical and repair costs, will require higher liability
coverage limits for drivers and will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025. As we
approach the new year, Mercury Insurance wants to help consumers better
understand what these new limits entail.</p>

creative ways to save on healthcare using your Medicare Advantage OTC
allowance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - Did you know that if you’re on a Medicare Advantage plan, you
most likely have an over-the-counter (OTC) allowance to help offset the
costs of everyday healthcare items? Millions of Medicare Advantage
beneficiaries have access to this key benefit, but most don’t use it.
According to a study by The Consumer Healthcare Products Association,
70% of OTC benefits are never used, leaving billions of dollars on the
table. They also found that on average, every dollar spent on OTC
medicines saves the U.S. healthcare system $7.33, resulting in an
overall annual savings of $167.1 billion. It is time to double-check
your health care plan and make sure you’re taking advantage of all your
benefits and supporting your everyday care routines.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Amazon.com workers will walk off the job on Thursday morning, in the crucial final days of the holiday season, after union officials said the retailer failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. The strike is a challenge to Amazon&amp;#8217;s operations as it races to fulfill orders during its busiest season of the year, although union-represented facilities represent only about 1% of Amazon&amp;#8217;s hourly workforce. In the New York City area, for example, the company has multiple warehouses and smaller delivery depots. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said unionized workers at facilities in New York City; Skokie, Illinois; Atlanta, San Francisco and southern California will join the picket line to seek contracts guaranteeing better wages and work conditions. The Teamsters union has said it represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the company&amp;#8217;s U.S. facilities. Workers at seven of those facilities will walk out on Thursday, the Teamsters said. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — News junkies will find much to love in “September 5,” a
fictionalized account of ABC’s live coverage of the hostage crisis
during the 1972 Munich Olympics. There are spirited debates about
reporting with only one source, use of words like “terrorism” and what
to do if violence breaks out during a live shot. There are negotiations
with rival networks over satellite usage, disguises and fake badges made
to get reels of 16mm film in and out of the locked down Olympic village
and plenty of confused men (and a few women) trying to keep up with an
ever-escalating situation.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;High in the mountains where France and Spain come together, I drove and drove. My goal: to stand atop a ridge looking into a rugged mountain-ringed basin where nature cradles an ancient tribe. There was an age when these pint-sized kingdoms were commonplace. But today, only a few survive. I finally reached my destination, deep in the rugged Pyrenees Mountains. Before me stretched the principality of Andorra.&lt;/p&gt;
