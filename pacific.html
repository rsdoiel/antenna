<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;BERLIN &amp;#8212; President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Saturday apologized for the crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane this past week, breaking the Kremlin&amp;#8217;s three-day silence on the accident that killed 38 people. He did not explicitly acknowledge Russia&amp;#8217;s responsibility for the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

Chilly weather, warm memories</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;London dazzles year-round, so consider visiting in winter. Despite the season&amp;#8217;s drearier weather and shorter days, London&amp;#8217;s museums, theaters, and pubs always offer a warm, cozy welcome. And come January, tourist crowds are at a minimum, and airfare and hotel rates are generally cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

Kilauea summit erupts again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Kilauea began erupting again on December 23, 2024. This is the eighth eruption of Kilauea, and the sixth within Kaluapele, since 2020. These previous eruptions within Kaluapele lasted from less than one week to more than a year in duration. This history of activity, along with continued summit inflation, suggests that eruptive activity may continue to pause and resume in the coming days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
