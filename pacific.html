<p>date: 2025-08-07, updated: 2025-08-07, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>ON July 31, 1945, the Project Alberta team on Tinian, working with
the 509th Composite Group, conducted a complete dress rehearsal of the
Little Boy atomic bomb drop.  Maj. Charles Sweeney piloted his plane,
the Great Artist, and Capt. George Marquardt piloted Necessary Evil,
accompanied by Tibbets, who was piloting the yet unnamed Enola Gay. 
They flew from Tinian to Iwo Jima, where an atomic bomb loading pit had
been constructed.  If something happened to Enola Gay along the way,
they were to land at Iwo, move the bomb from Enola Gay to the standby
aircraft, the Big Stink.  Tibbets would then fly Big Stink to the
target. The test was deemed fully successful.</p>

<p>When the Office of Public Accountability issues an audit, it’s not

reports are published? Are agencies fixing what’s broken? Is anyone held
accountable when they don’t?</p>
