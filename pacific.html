service (2)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, updated: 2025-08-10, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT Governor Dennis James C. Mendiola’s path to public service
was not historically significant — except for the fact that he was born
in the Generation X era. He sought the office of the Senate twice and
won in the 2022 election. Since January 2023, he has been serving the
first half of his term as Senate President. The untimely passing of
Governor Arnold I. Palacios catapulted him into the office of Lieutenant
Governor — a process too swift to fully assess his competency for the
role he now occupies.</p>
