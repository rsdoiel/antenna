country blends serenity, grandeur</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Though I initially came to Norway to visit relatives &amp;#8212; three of my grandparents grew up there &amp;#8212; nature is the real draw here, even for those with family ties. It&amp;#8217;s a land of intense beauty, with famously steep mountains and deep fjords carved out and shaped by an ancient ice age.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Photography has been a crucial part of volcano monitoring in Hawaii going back to the start of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. In 1911, Frank Perret spent a summer capturing stunning black and white photos of Kilauea&amp;#8217;s summit lava lake in Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u crater. Fast forward a century, and webcams are scattered across the island, snapping images of the volcanoes 24/7 in 4K resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
