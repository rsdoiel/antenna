Watch: Recent intrusions follow pattern of previous events</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Since July 2024, activity at Kilauea has been punctuated by two periods of intense unrest, centered on the upper East Rift Zone (ERZ). The periods included hundreds of earthquakes per day and high rates of tilting in the upper ERZ. Monitoring data have shown that the unrest was the result of two intrusions into a region of the ERZ between Pauahi and Makaopuhi Craters.&lt;/p&gt;

ancient Appian Way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s fitting that it was the expansion-minded ancient Romans who built Europe&amp;#8217;s first super highway &amp;#8212; they understood the value of good roads to growing an empire. And the Appian Way, begun in 312 BC, was the engineering wonder of its day. It connected Rome with Capua (near Naples), ignoring natural contours and running in a straight line for much of the way. Eventually it stretched 430 miles to Brindisi &amp;#8212; gateway to the East &amp;#8212; where Roman ships sailed for Greece and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
