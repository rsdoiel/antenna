<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia and once a nearly desolate ghost town, is one of Europe&amp;#8217;s great urban success stories. Its compact old town bursts with colorfully restored facades, lively outdoor caf&amp;#0233;s, and swanky boutiques. Its ramshackle industrial quarter, just east of the center, is rapidly being redeveloped into a forest of skyscrapers. The hilltop castle gleams. And even the glum communist-era suburb of Petr&amp;#0382;alka, right across the Danube, has undergone a Technicolor makeover. It&amp;#8217;s arguably the fastest-changing city in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
