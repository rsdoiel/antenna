<p>date: 2024-05-12, updated: 2024-05-13, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is the marijuana phobias that still exist in
“lay-language” are technically called by experts and scientist as being
“IRRATIONAL FEARS” that can’t be substantiated by scientific methods nor
with unfounded assertions.  Well, the marijuana phobias promoted by
“Saipan Man” in the comment section is the source that provided the
platform for this response to his ill-rational and unfounded assertions
about marijuana and its usage. In fact, I wish to take this opportunity
to issue an “APB” (all-points-bulletin) for the identification of Saipan
Man in the comment section who is using a fake-name for fake-comments
(please contact: ambrosebennett@yahoo.com).</p>
