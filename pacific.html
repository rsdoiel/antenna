<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There is much to appreciate about the ongoing Kilauea summit eruption as it approaches its six-month anniversary on June 23. The stunning episodic lava fountains and lava flows erupting within Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park have provided island residents and visitors with safe and accessible viewing opportunities. However, volcanic hazards are always present.&lt;/p&gt;
