ǀ The Kangaroo Courts of Trump &amp; Torres — for TRUE!!!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, updated: 2024-07-08, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>FOR True, it seems the Republican-led Supreme Court has turned into a
Kangaroo Court freeing up Trump just like our Senate Republican Kangaroo
Court did in our CNMI freeing up then Governor Ralph Torres after he was
impeached to create the “BOOST Giveaway Program,” in which he gave away
millions to political operatives and wasted nearly two billion in
Stimulus funds.   Trump and Ralph were both “impeached” and both
executives have proven to be a complete disaster causing all kinds of
economic, social and even political challenges. Trump was facing 88
charges, now convicted on 34 and Ralph is now facing CNMI State Charges
and possibly a Federal RICO case that he is facing with other
Republicans and even the Chinese Government that is also charged in the
RICO Indictments for interfering with our election &amp; immigration
fraud. It should also be noted that Ralph is a staunch Trump supporter
and was one of the first Governors to fly to Washington for a photo
shoot with Trump who seems to be Ralph’s mentor given the comparisons of
their very similar political experiences and corrupt activities. It’s
clear to me Ralph is using Trump’s tactic of “delay-delay-delay in
court” that’s futile.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The opportunity to see fascinating species thriving in their natural environments draws many of us to national parks, waterways and wildlife refuges every year. Almost as alluring is the appeal of getting the perfect picture that captures an animal&amp;#8217;s beauty, ingenuity or charisma. But our Instagram aspirations must not be achieved at animals&amp;#8217; expense. Experts agree that the best way to protect and respect wildlife is to put our binoculars and zoom lenses to good use by giving these animals plenty of room to roam. We&amp;#8217;re visiting their home, after all &amp;#8212;and we must respect them and their space.&lt;/p&gt;
