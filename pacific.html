      (BPT) - Ever wonder what kind of food Superman grew up on? Wonder no more. Continuing a Kent Family tradition, Martha has put together an heirloom cookbook full of Clark's favorite dishes, with help from his friends and colleagues. Together, they've recreated the beef bourguignon and ketchup from Lois and Clark's first date, Cyborg's lucky game day potato skins and J'onn's Chocos. Martha even recreated Plurb, which she hears is wonderfully awful. She wasn't quite ready to taste that one herself.

      <p>
      A draft plan to award a grant to a competing company to create high-speed internet access across the CNMI has drawn criticism from Docomo Pacific, which claims it not only violates revisions to the program’s criteria but also costs a “staggering” $29 million over its own plan.
