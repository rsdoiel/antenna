<p>Source: Samoa Govt press release</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa Ministry of Health has issued new travel advisories for all travelers entering Samoa, effective from the 3rd of this month requiring <em>all</em> travelers from infants aged 12 months and above, to have received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine at least two weeks before, or no later than 14 days prior to arrival into Samoa.</p>
<p>The advisory is part of Samoa’s swift response to the increasing number of measles cases reported in New Zealand and other neighboring countries, said Acting Director-General of Health, Tagaloa Dr. Robert Thompson.</p>
<p>“Samoa’s response aims to prevent the potential importation of measles into the country,” said Dr Thompson.</p>
<p>The advisory outlines the following key measures:</p>
<p>• All travelers, including infants aged 12 months and above, are strongly advised to have received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine at least two weeks before, or no later than 14 days prior to arrival in Samoa.</p>
<p>• Infants under 12 months of age and pregnant mothers are exempted from this requirement.</p>
<p>• Any person showing symptoms of measles — including fever, dry cough, red or watery eyes, runny nose, or a blotchy rash — is strongly advised to defer travel until fully recovered.</p>
<p>• Travelers identified with symptoms of measles upon arrival at any point of entry will be assessed and detained as required under public health regulations.</p>
<p>• All travelers are strongly advised to carry a legitimate vaccination certificate as proof of measles immunization.</p>
<p>The Acting Director-General of Health, Tagaloa Dr. Robert Thompson, said there are currently no plans for a lockdown, however, the Ministry will impose restrictions if an outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>Travelers who develop symptoms consistent with measles after arrival — including fever, cough, red or watery eyes, runny nose, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body — should isolate immediately at home or in their accommodation, and seek prompt medical attention.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Samoa woman in her late 20s freed herself after she says she was kidnapped, assaulted, and tied to an iron pole.</p>
<p>After members of her husband’s family, who were her alleged captors fell asleep, she managed to escape.</p>
<p>She reportedly then fled to a nearby household whose residents hid her and guided her to the main road to catch an early morning bus. She later reached a friend, a police officer, who accompanied her to Faleata Police Station to lodge a formal complaint.</p>
<p>The following morning, a black minivan carrying several family members reportedly returned to the house. Three women allegedly confronted her at the back of the kitchen, slapping, punching, kicking, and stomping her before putting her inside the vehicle. She reported she was also beaten with a stick and struck with an iron rod. One older female relative allegedly cut her hair with scissors, while others tied her to an iron pole. During the assault, a suspect reportedly threatened her, saying, “There is no family in Samoa that can challenge us. You will see when we get to kuā, we are going to mark you like an animal.”</p>
<p>Police said the assault followed a dispute at the victim’s home. According to her account, the confrontation began on October 30 when her sister-in-law allegedly punched her and called other relatives, claiming she had been attacked.</p>
<p>The circulation of a video showing the incident on social media has provided police with further evidence. Acting Police Commissioner Leiataua Samuelu Afamasaga confirmed the footage was recorded by the family and said the victim is now under the care of the Samoa Victim Support Group (SVSG).</p>
<p>Leiataua said the suspects are already known to police and are relatives of a notorious criminal. “The video, together with witness statements and the victim’s account, provides sufficient evidence to file charges,” he said.</p>

      <h1>Wall Street tumbles as Nvidia slides, investors fret that Fed may slow rate cuts</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday, with steep losses in Nvidia and other AI heavyweights, as investors scaled back expectations of interest rate cuts due to inflation worries and divisions among central bankers about the U.S. economy’s health. All three major U.S. stock indexes posted their steepest daily percentage declines in over a month. The U.S. government reopened after a record 43-day shutdown that had worried investors and disrupted the flow of economic data. A growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers in recent days have signaled hesitation about further interest rate cuts, pushing financial market-based odds of a reduction in borrowing costs in December to near even. Fed officials who spoke recently cited worries about inflation and signs of relative stability in the labor market after two U.S. interest rate cuts this year.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — American sailors and personnel from nine other nations recently wrapped up a two-week exercise in the South Pacific island nation of Samoa as part of an annual U.S. Navy humanitarian mission. The sailors, along with personnel from Samoa, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore and the United Kingdom, rehearsed a mass rescue in the islands, according to an Australian Defense Department news release last week Wednesday.</p>
<p>Samoa is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the drill sought to improve disaster readiness and the ability of South Pacific nations to work together, the release said. Five to nine named tropical cyclones could occur in the Southwest Pacific between this month and April, New Zealand’s National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research reported Oct. 8.</p>
<p>The expeditionary sea base USS John L. Canley arrived in Samoa on Oct. 21, the Samoan News Hub website. The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Steve Koehler, attended the closing ceremony for the exercise aboard the French patrol vessel Auguste Bénébig docked at Apia, according to the report. The Navy’s work in Samoa was part of Pacific Partnership, an annual deployment conceived after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that involves port calls in developing nations throughout the region.</p>
<p>This year’s mission, involving more than 1,500 personnel, included stops in Papua New Guinea, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Philippines, Fiji, and Tonga, according to a July 9 Navy news release. The dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor began its Pacific Partnership voyage on July 8 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.</p>
<p>The operation, led by the commander of Destroyer Squadron 31, Capt. Mark Stefanik, is focused on engineering, disaster management and medical support, according to the Navy release.</p>
<p>“This enduring mission provides us the opportunity to build on our relationships, share expertise, and learn from one another,” he said in the release. “Our shared experiences help create more resilient communities, and I’m proud to lead a team committed to strengthening partnerships across the Indo-Pacific.”</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Margo Staunton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Child and adolescent obesity is soaring in Polynesia and there is no quick fix, according to an eminent Pacific health leader.</p>
<p>The most obese 5-19-year-olds globally live in three Pacific Island nations, a UNICEF report found.</p>
<p>The report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children 2025, reveals that Niue — with a population of 1600 — tops the lot, with nearly 40 percent of children and youth being obese.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands came second with 37 percent and Nauru followed with 33 percent.</p>
<p>The report said 2025 marks an historic turning point as it is the first time global obesity has surpassed those who are underweight in the 5-19-year-old age group.</p>
<p>One fifth of the world's children and adolescents are now overweight and half of them are obese.</p>
<p>The report said global obesity was mainly driven by a shift from traditional diets to cheap, imported, ultra-processed foods and soft drinks.</p>
<p>Auckland University professor Sir Collin Tukuitonga said obesity is not a region-wide issue in the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;Overweight and obesity is more of a problem in Polynesia and to a certain extent Micronesia,&quot; Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in Melanesia — Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, under-nutrition, iron and micronutrient deficiency is still a major problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sir Collin said many people now live in urban or peri-urban areas with no access to land to grow food, and convenience was a major factor.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that people will return to growing their own staples and catching fish, I don't see that as being realistic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What needs to happen is better information and support so people moderate or reduce their consumption of ultra-processed foods.&quot;</p>
<p>He said another major factor in the trend was a rapid decline in breast feeding in the region.</p>
<p>While many mothers breastfed initially, this dropped dramatically after three months, due to pressures to return to work or church and village commitments.</p>
<p>Associated with that was a change in what he called &quot;weaning foods&quot;.</p>
<p>“Traditionally it was like fresh staples and fish, but things have changed and kids are weaned off the breast on sugar and processed food items,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Countries had put a lot of effort into trying to prevent adult obesity but the focus should now be on youth, Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given our limited capacity and resources we should put more of an effort into educating and informing young people about healthy diets... then we might in fact end up with a generation that is able to respond to the causes of it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said young obese people can later face health problems in adulthood, such as type-2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a burden of disease, that's the jargon, particularly diabetes, which then leads to kidney failure and blindness, and the social and economic costs to families and nations is enormous.&quot;</p>
<p>The way children were growing up had also changed, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have become more sedentary, using devices, families have more money to buy imported food items, and fresh fruit and vegetables are not widely eaten.&quot;</p>
<p>While there is good data on adult obesity, research into children and adolescents is relatively recent, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always been the debate over whether the Body Mass Index (BMI) is an appropriate measure for children, so there are methodological issues, but that doesn't change the findings,&quot; Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>He said while obesity is a major concern in the Pacific, finding solutions won't be easy.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the best efforts of a whole lot of people, we don't seem to have found any way of curbing the rapid rise in overweight and obesity in children and young people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One possible solution was for governments to impose a tax on unhealthy food stuffs, including soft drinks.</p>
<p>The report stated that children are considered to be overweight when they are significantly heavier than what is healthy for their age, sex and height.</p>
<p>UNICEF defines overweight as a body mass index greater than one standard deviation above the World Health Organization's median for healthy growth.</p>
<p>Obesity is more than two standard deviations above and leads to a higher risk of developing life-threatening diseases.</p>
<p>The report warns that ultra-processed and fast foods - high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives - are shaping children's diets through unhealthy food environments, rather than personal choice.</p>
<p>It said these products dominate shops and schools, where digital marketing gives the food and beverage industry powerful access to young people.</p>
<p>Without interventions to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, countries could face lifetime health and economic impacts exceeding, for example, US$210 billion in Peru, due to obesity-related health issues.</p>
<p>By 2035, the global economic impact is expected to surpass US$4 trillion annually.</p>

      <h1>'Love letter to Mum' shares dementia journey</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Susan Suisuiki, Pacific Waves presenter</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Samoan caregiver is using social media to highlight the realities of caring for someone with dementia.</p>
<p>Sapini Unoi and his mother Mutalau have gained thousands of followers on their TikTok account.</p>
<p>Unoi describes their online platform as his &quot;love letter to Mum&quot;, sharing snippets of their daily routine and conversations.</p>
<p>Speaking to Pacific Waves, Unoi said when his mother was diagnosed with dementia eight years ago, he automatically assumed the role of caring for her due to being the youngest child and identifying as fa'afafine.</p>
<p>Mutalau Unoi migrated to New Zealand from Samoa as an adolescent, attending Kelston Girls in West Auckland before heading into nursing school when she was 19 years old.</p>
<p>She spent 25 years as a nurse before she made the switch to teaching. Unoi said his mum's love of serving people at church as a Sunday school teacher inspired her to make the move.</p>
<p>However, things took a turn when Unoi noticed his mother repeating questions every hour or so. He said his mother's condition progressively got worse when she retired from teaching and when the Covid pandemic had hit.</p>
<p>Recently, Unoi made the decision to leave his full-time role to focus solely on his mother, but while it does add another level of complexity, he said he won't trade any precious time with her for a career that would still be there when his mother dies.</p>
<p>He set up a Givealittle page to raise money for living costs and bills.</p>
<p>Unoi said discussions about who will care for relatives with dementia should be normalized within Pacific families, as it wasn't the case for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost like, I'd like to say, an inheritance,&quot; Unoi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I inherited this role because of my place in my family, and because of my lifestyle and because of, again, my lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>&quot;It needs to be normalized. Because to not have the discussion, and then to expect someone to deal with what they're dealing with and then have to add on, having to be a caregiver, and then all of the emotions, the roller coaster of emotions and the exhaustion; the list goes on.&quot;</p>
<p>Unoi noted that while there are support systems and resources for people with dementia, there's barely any help for caregivers particularly those in the Pacific community.</p>
<p>The challenges of being a caregiver led to Unoi creating a Tiktok account as well as an online forum for other Pasifika caregivers.</p>
<p>He said he's been overwhelmed with the responses and messages on Tiktok.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very surreal ... although I'm very bubbly and out the gate and very outspoken, I'm still getting used to people stopping us and talking to us and noticing mum because she's the star of the show, you know, not me.&quot;</p>
<p>Unoi said reading the comments on their social media page pulls at his heartstrings.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm crying in my quiet times because how touched I am at these messages,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what pops out the most and I think again, is the scary thing which should not be scary and should be challenged, is the amount of people that are doing it by themselves, no family or family present, and no family help.&quot;</p>
<p>For other Pacific families who are coping with dementia, Unoi stresses the importance of talanoa.</p>
<p>&quot;Start to rally up as a family and start to talk about, 'what if?' What if this happens to our parents? Who is going to do it?</p>
<p>&quot;Start normalizing the conversations that need to be had, because they're vital.&quot;</p>

<p>The Port Moesby General Hospital tells us that between April and June each year, up to 50 babies are delivered every day. That amounts to a whopping 15,000 babies in just three months of the year alone. And these births are recorded every year for a while now.</p>
<p>The number will become frightening when the total annual number of births are added to this number, or when you add the number being born at all health facilities around the country or at homes. The number will run to hundreds of thousands.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will hear arguments on January 21 in President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a move without precedent that challenges the central bank’s independence. The justices said in October that they would hear arguments in the case before deciding a Justice Department request to lift a judge’s order that temporarily blocked the Republican president from removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden. That action effectively left Cook in place for the time being.</p>

In letters released Wednesday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and 39 other Democratic lawmakers urged like-minded governors to ensure that their residents’ data wasn’t being vacuumed up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become the speartip of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program.</p>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Justice Department has provided a legal justification that makes clear that U.S. military personnel involved in strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels are immune from prosecution, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Since early September, the U.S. military has carried out at least 19 strikes against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coast of Latin America, killing at least 76 people. Legal experts and Democratic lawmakers have questioned the legality of the strikes and many say they do not adhere to the laws of war.</p>

      <h1>Supreme Court Justices speak up: The Constitution does not grant Congress “Plenary Power” over U.S. territories</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Right to Democracy staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> U.S. Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas joined together on Monday to issue a written opinion disputing the view that the “Territories Clause” of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress with “plenary power” over residents of U.S. territories.</p>
<p>The opinion was issued in dissent to the Supreme Court’s decision not to review <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-5191.html%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Veneno v. United States</a>, in which the defendant, Quentin Veneno, Jr., <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-5191/320898/20240726123005099_Petition%20for%20Certiorari%20-%20Veneno.pdf%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">challenged</a> the Court’s 1886 decision in United States v. Kagama and “the constitutional authority [of Congress] to criminalize the conduct of Indians on Indian land.” Justices Gorsuch and Thomas would have granted review to consider whether “the federal government enjoys ‘plenary power’ over the internal affairs of Native American Tribes.” The petition for Supreme Court review in Veneno had been pending for over a year, since July 26, 2024.</p>
<p>“The idea that Congress has unrestricted plenary power over U.S. territories is not grounded in the text or history of the U.S. Constitution. But until now the federal government’s reliance on this near-unlimited power has never been questioned by any federal judge, much less a Supreme Court Justice. It is significant to have two Justices now calling into question this unrestrained congressional authority over people in U.S. territories,” said Attorney Neil Weare, co-director of <a href="https://www.righttodemocracy.us/%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Right to Democracy</a>, which works to advance democracy, equity, and self-determination in U.S. territories.</p>
<p>Monday’s opinion critiqued the idea that the Territories Clause might serve as a basis for Congress to criminalize the conduct of Indians on tribal land, stating that “[The Territories Clause” affords Congress only the power to make ‘needful Rules and Regulations’ for ‘Territor[ies] … belonging to the United States.” It then concluded that “[the Territories] Clause, rightly understood,” did not “endow the federal government with plenary power even within the Territories themselves.”</p>
<p>In support of that proposition, the opinion cited to Justice Gorsuch’s earlier concurring opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=304826987936580518&amp;q=vaello+madero&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000006%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">United States v. Vaello Madero</a>, in which he explained: “Monarchical and despotic governments may possess the power to act unrestrained by written constitutions. But our Nation's government has no existence except by virtue of the Constitution, and it may not ignore that charter in the Territories any more than it may in the States.”</p>
<p>“People across all five U.S. territories have consistently rejected the exercise of undemocratic, unchecked power over our communities by the federal government. The repudiation of this plenary power by these two conservative Justices is timely as we approach the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and consider what ‘consent of the governed’ means for people in U.S. territories who have been denied self-determination for over 125 years,” said Dr. Adi Martinez Román, co-director of Right to Democracy, an organization that does not take a position on political status.</p>
<p>“As concerns about authoritarian rule grow across the United States, these cautionary words about the breathtakingly expansive scope of congressional power over tribal communities and people in U.S. territories deserves more attention,” Weare added.</p>
<p>Right to Democracy will be convening a panel of legal experts to discuss these important developments later this month.</p>

<p>A former primary school teacher and principal has won his wrongful termination case against Porgera SDA International Primary School after the National Court found that he was unfairly dismissed over a misappropriation allegation that was later withdrawn.</p>
<p>Justice Graham Ellis, sitting in Wabag, ruled last Friday that Samson Aipita was wrongfully terminated in 2012 and ordered the school, formally known as Porgera International School Inc, to pay him K28,781.91, inclusive of interest, plus costs on an indemnity basis.</p>

<p>Surgeons and theatre staff at Angau Memorial Hospital have told the Special Parliamentary Committee inquiry into the Morobe Provincial Health Authority that constant power cuts and a faulty steriliser are forcing the hospital to cancel almost half of its scheduled operations.</p>
<p>Clinicians revealed that 40 to 45 percent of surgeries are now being postponed — nearly three times higher than the World Health Organisation’s safe surgery benchmark of 15 percent. They blamed the high cancellation rate on repeated steriliser breakdowns, inconsistent power supply, and shortages of sutures and other vital consumables.</p>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday in another attempt to halt full federal funding for food stamps, seeking to stymie the nation’s largest anti-hunger program even as the government shutdown neared its end.</p>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Monday approved a compromise that would end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, breaking a weeks-long stalemate that has disrupted food benefits for millions, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers unpaid and snarled air traffic. The 60-40 vote passed with the support of nearly all of the chamber’s Republicans and eight Democrats, who unsuccessfully sought to tie government funding to health subsidies that are due to expire at the end of the year. While the agreement sets up a December vote on those subsidies, which benefit 24 million Americans, it does not guarantee they will continue.</p>

      <h1>Trump says US faces ‘economic disaster’ if Supreme Court rules against tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday the United States faced an economic and national security disaster if the Supreme Court ruled against his use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs against nearly every country. Trump said his administration planned to issue a $2,000 payment to lower- and middle-income Americans using the tariff dividends, while using the remaining proceeds to lower U.S. debt. Trump, who has previously floated the idea of using tariff revenues to pay what he calls a “dividend” to lower-earning Americans, repeated it in a Truth Social post on Sunday and during remarks to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.</p>

      <p>Last week I wrote about mashed potatoes but did not include the recipe. I was guilty of boiling potatoes in a pot of water, which, after the potatoes are drained, flavors as well as the starches that add creaminess, are all going down the drain. This recipe from Milk Street has only 1-1/2 cups of water to 3 cups of potatoes which is just enough water to cook the potatoes without drowning it.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — A feral rooster lands upon a Range Officer for a sip from his water bottle at the Koko Head Public Shooting Range in Hawaii Kai, Hawaii.</p>
<p>For decades the feral chickens have been looked after by Hawaii's Shooting Community, who are there to develop their precision skillset, while exhibiting an ongoing respect for nature.</p>
<p>In a historical similar local connection, the Western Samoa Shooting Association was created, in part as an alternative sporting outlet, to redirect from the rampart slaughter of fruit bats, beyond the needs of individual hunters.</p>

<p>We have no idea how much the 2026 Appropriation Bill will be but usually like every budget, we expect a slight increase by about K2 billion from that of the 2025 budget.</p>
<p>We remember a time when Papua New Guineans were so interested in the budget, they digested every detail after it was tabled in Parliament.</p>

      <h1>Pacific peoples warn of growing militarization and mining pressure on the ocean</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific civil society groups say 2025 has been a big year for the ocean.</p>
<p>Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) representative Maureen Penjueli said the Pacific Ocean is being hyper-militarized and there is a desire for seabed minerals to be used to build-up military capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;Critical minerals, whether from land or from the deep ocean itself, have a military end use, and that's been made very clear in 2025,&quot; Penjueli said during the Pacific Network on Globalization (PANG) 2025 State of the Ocean webinar.</p>
<p>&quot;They're deemed extremely vital for defense industrial base, enabling the production of military platforms such as fighter aircraft, tanks, missiles, submarines.</p>
<p>&quot;2025 is the year where we see the link between critical minerals on the sea floor and use [in the] military.&quot;</p>
<p>PANG's Joey Tau said one of the developments has been the increase in countries calling for a moratorium or pause on deep sea mining, which is now up to 40.</p>
<p>&quot;Eight of which are from the Pacific and a sub-regional grouping the MSG (Melanesian Spearhead Group) still holds that political space or that movement around a moratorium.&quot;</p>
<p>Tau said it comes as the UN-sanctioned International Seabed Authority tries to come to an agreement on deep-sea mining rules at the same time as the United States is considering its own legal pathway.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bad precedent setting by the US, we hope that the ISA both assembly and the council would hold ground and warn the US.&quot;</p>
<p>He said unlike US, China spoke about the importance of multilateralism and it for global partners to maintain unity within the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) agreement which has not been ratified by the United States.</p>
<p>Also in February was the deep sea minerals talanoa, where Pacific leaders met to discuss deep sea mining.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of our countries sit on different sides of the table on this issue. You have countries who are sponsoring and who are progressing the agenda of deep-sea mining, not only within their national jurisdiction, but also in the international arena,&quot; Tau said.</p>
<p>In May, UN human rights experts expressed concern about the release of treated nuclear wastewater.</p>
<p>Japan's government has consistently maintained the release meets international safety standards, and monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency shows there is no measurable impact beyond Japan's coastal waters.</p>
<p>However, Ocean Vision Legal's Naima Taafaki-Fifita said as well as being an environmental issue, it is also a legal and moral problem.</p>
<p>&quot;By discharging these radioactive contaminants into the Pacific, Japan risks breaching its obligations under international law,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;[The UN special rapporteurs] caution that this may pose grave risks to human rights, particularly the rights to life, health, food and culture, not only in Japan, but across the Pacific.&quot;</p>
<p>Taafaki-Fifita said it was a &quot;deeply personal&quot; issue for Pacific people who live with the nuclear legacy of testing.</p>
<p>In September, what is known as the &quot;High Seas Treaty&quot; received its 60th ratification which means it will now be legally effective in January 2026.</p>
<p>The agreement allows international waters - which make up nearly two-thirds of the ocean - to be placed into marine protected areas.</p>
<p>Taafaki-Fitita said it was important that Pacific priorities are visible and heard as the treaty gets implemented.</p>

<p>At a time when uncertainty grips the U.S. government and U.S. federal operations slow to a crawl, one Samoan attorney has chosen a path of certainty — service to her people. Maj Louise Lafitaga, a United States Air Force Attorney (JAG), is leaving behind an active-duty career in the U.S. Air Force, returning home with her family to American Samoa to join the Office of the Attorney General, determined to give back to the community that raised her.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Ensign Alexis VanBuren,</p>
<p>Commander, Logistics Group Western Pacific</p>
<p><em>APIA, Samoa —</em> Pacific Partnership 2025 hosted a Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) key leadership symposium, Oct. 23-24, bringing together Samoan national leaders and representatives from partner nations including Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>This two-day conference focused on incorporating the contributions and specific needs of women into planning for disaster management, improving access to health care, preventing violence against vulnerable populations, and strengthening civil society.</p>
<p>“Pacific Partnership is about preparing in calm to respond together in crisis,” said Capt. Mark Stefanik, mission commander of Pacific Partnership 25. “That spirit of readiness extends beyond disaster response – it includes strengthening the systems that protect and empower every member of society.”</p>
<p>Loau Donina Tili Vaa, Chief Executive Officer of Samoa’s Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, delivered opening remarks on behalf of the Samoan government. She spoke about the country’s progress and ongoing challenges in advancing gender equality.</p>
<p>Vaa noted that while Samoans have seen significant improvements in girls’ performance in secondary education, women’s participation in the workforce remains disproportionately low. Domestic and sexual violence are also persistent concerns.</p>
<p>Addressing the Pacific Partnership nations present at the symposium, Ms. Vaa said, “Your collaboration reaffirms that peace is not the absence of conflict but the presence of cooperation. In Samoa, when cyclones strike or disasters unfold, it is the women’s committees and village representatives who mobilize first — assessing needs, coordinating food, and caring for children and elders long before the formal response arrives.”</p>
<p>“WPS ties together all of the Pacific Partnership lines of effort – medical, engineering, disaster management, and host nation outreach and engagement – to ensure that our efforts are having a whole-of-population impact,” said Capt. Laura Gilstrap, Women’s Affairs Advisor for Pacific Partnership 25 and the lead organizer of the event. Pacific Partnership is all about working by, with, and through local partners, and that can only be effective if we’re working with the entire population.”</p>
<p>The WPS framework, established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted Oct. 31, 2000, established the WPS framework, which reaffirms the essential role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, humanitarian response, and post-conflict reconstruction. On Oct. 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, requiring the U.S. Government to integrate women’s participation into its foreign policy, national security, and development efforts in conflict zones. In 2019, the U.S. Government released the U.S. WPS Strategy, making the United States the first country to adopt both a comprehensive law and whole-of-government strategy on WPS.</p>
<p>Pacific Partnership is the largest annual multinational humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted in the Indo-Pacific. The mission fosters multilateral cooperation and strengthens collective capacity to respond to crises while promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region grounded in shared respect and partnership.</p>

      <h1>New short story collection especially for young people searching for stories that reflect their lives</h1>

<p>Source: press release</p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> Samoa has an exciting new literary voice with the upcoming publication of Am I There Yet?, the debut short story collection by Samoan poet, educator, and proud fa’afafine author Nicki Perese <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The collection takes its name from the opening story, a piece that sets the emotional tone and guiding question that echoes throughout the book: “Am I there yet?” - a phrase that speaks not only to a physical journey, but to the deeper, personal movement toward identity, belonging, purpose, and self-understanding. The title becomes a metaphor for navigating life’s turning points, challenges, and quiet triumphs.</p>
<p>Although the stories in this collection are fictional, they are firmly rooted in experiences, themes, and realities familiar to Samoan and Pacific communities. Perese’s writing draws from everyday life in Samoa. Moments of humor, hardship, cultural responsibility, faith, love, identity, and the unseen emotional currents that shape who we become. Her storytelling captures voices and experiences that are often felt but rarely spoken aloud, weaving narrative with empathy and cultural memory.</p>
<p>Perese shares that her motivation for writing the collection grew from observing the world around her, conversations within villages, the vibrancy of family life, unspoken struggles between friends, and the unique spirit of Samoa’s youth. She believes storytelling is not new to Samoan people; it is part of who we are. From fāgogo shared at night, to family stories, village humor, household gossip, and everyday reflections, Samoans are natural storytellers. What she hopes this collection will encourage is the confidence for Samoans to see their stories as worthy of being written, studied, and celebrated.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her writing journey, Perese notes, “Writing is about the process, you must trust it, grow through it, and enjoy it,” spoken with the warm laughter and humility she is known for.</p>
<p>This collection is particularly meaningful as it is written by a Samoan author, for Samoan readers especially young people searching for stories that reflect their lives, their families, their language, and their dreams. It also speaks to the Samoan diaspora who continue to carry home within them, no matter where they live.</p>
<p>Am I There Yet? will be launched later this month on TalaSamoa.com, and available worldwide in both ebook and then print format.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Caleb Fotheringham &amp; Tiana Haxton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific journalists</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> There is still not enough known about the seafloor to decide if deep sea mining can start in the Cook Islands, an ocean scientist with the government authority in charge of seabed minerals says.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) returned last week from a 21-day deep-sea research expedition on board the United States exploration vessel EV Nautilus.</p>
<p>The trip was also funded by the United States and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>High-resolution imagery and data were collected in a bid to better understand what lives on the seafloor.</p>
<p>SBMA knowledge management officer Dr John Parianos said the findings would guide decisions about seabed mining.</p>
<p>&quot;One day someone will have to make a decision about what to do and it's clear today we don't know enough to make a decision,&quot; Parianos said.</p>
<p>On its return, EV Nautilus was confronted by a group of kayakers holding signs that read: &quot;Don't mine the moana&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the protesters, Louisa Castledine told RNZ Pacific she is conscious both NOAA and Nautilus had a reputation for being &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; but is concerned about research being &quot;weaponized&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This research is being used to help enable and guide decision making towards deep-sea mining,&quot; Castledine said who is the spokesperson for Ocean Ancestors.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the guise in which this research is being utilized, and it's who sent them is the challenge, because who sent them is quite clear on their intent in mining.</p>
<p>In August, the US and the Cook Islands agreed to work closer in the area of seabed minerals to &quot;advance scientific research and the responsible development of seabed mineral resources&quot;.</p>
<p>It came off the back of the Cook Islands signing a five-year agreement with China to cooperate in exploring and researching seabed minerals.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Trainer, a geopolitical analyst with Terra Global Insights, said both countries are interested in the metals to enhance military capabilities but it's not the primary market.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes are greater for other industries such as the renewable energy sectors and in China there's huge demand for electric vehicles.&quot;</p>
<p>Trainer said China is ahead of the US in obtaining critical minerals through land mining and mineral processing.</p>
<p>&quot;The US is seeming to choose to start with the supply side of things, get the minerals, and then perhaps work up the knowledge of production and refining.&quot;</p>
<p>Castledine said the region is in the middle of a &quot;geopolitical storm&quot; with the US and China vying for control over deep-sea minerals.</p>
<p>&quot;The USA's building their military might within the Pacific and this is one of those ways in which their reach is moving more into the Pacific and more specifically into Cook Islands waters.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nautilus expedition focused on discovery and the chance to test new deep-sea technology.</p>
<p>Expedition lead Renato Kane said bad weather threatened the mission, however it cleared up in time to send their ROVs down.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had six really successful dives to the sea floor. We're diving these vehicles down to over 5000 meters depth and the length of these dives were on average, about 30 hours each. So we've got a lot of high definition video footage for scientific observation on the sea floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Central to the expedition's success was the testing of a new, ultra-high-resolution camera, the MxD SeaCam, designed for deep-sea research at depths of up to 7000 metres.</p>
<p>The camera combines a compact broadcast camera with custom-built titanium housing to capture 4K images with remarkable clarity.</p>
<p>Dr John Parianos said it is some of the best footage ever recorded several kilometres below the surface.</p>
<p>He said footage would help create the Cook Islands first public catalogue of deep-sea life.</p>
<p>&quot;We've benefited from probably the highest resolution images ever taken at these depths in the whole world ever.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to make a catalogue of the types of life in the Cook Islands seabed so that researchers in the future can reference it. Having such high-quality images means that the catalogue will be even better quality than what exists internationally today.&quot;</p>
<p>Tanga Morris, who was responsible for logging data of both biological and geological discoveries on the expedition, said she was in awe of the various life forms they observed.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main ones that's quite dominant down in the deep sea would be deep-sea sponges. We've seen them in different species, morphotypes, and sizes, even a whole garden of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Other creatures found were sea stars, anemones, octopi and eels - some of which have possibly never been seen before.</p>
<p>&quot;A few people have asked questions like, 'have you guys spotted any unidentified species?' And I think we have come across a few, but then it will take a while to really be sure. But if so, what a great milestone it is for us to acknowledge that within our Cook Island waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Antony Vavia, a senior research fellow at Te Puna Vai Marama, the Cook Islands Centre for Research, said the opportunity to go onboard and study deep-sea organisms firsthand was an eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that I've seen down there has been a bit of a wow for me, [I'm] just amazed at how much life is down there. I was talking to my former supervisor, and he described us as the astronauts of the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>A notable feature of the EV Nautilus was its 24/7 online livestream.</p>
<p>He said people from around the world tuned in during dives to see the deep-sea discoveries for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Being able to show what our ROV - what is ROV, the little Hercules, is seeing in real time, and so having the wholesome thought that we're not on this exploration journey alone, but the fact that we can broadcast it to anyone that is interested and invested in learning more about our deep sea environments is incredibly rewarding, because you feel like you're pulling in others to be a part of this discovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Vavia who is also a lecturer at the Auckland University of Technology, said many schools and university groups got involved, broadcasting the deep-sea right into their classrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunities to reach out to schools from a primary school level all the way up to university has been a great opportunity to showcase the science that we're doing here, and hopefully to inspire younger generations and those that are already in the pursuit of careers in marine science or doing work on board research vessels such as the EV Nautilus.&quot;</p>
<p>The EV Nautilus crew said this element of the voyage helps to answer the public's questions on what life is found on the seabed.</p>
<p>Crew member and journalist Madison Dapcevich said they hope their passion inspires future scientists.</p>
<p>&quot;Something that's really great about Nautilus is we do have this like childlike wonder. We do get really excited about sponges, which most people are not that excited about. And then it's also a great pathway for early career professionals. So, we do have an internship and fellowship program, and those applications are open right now through the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The teams findings that will form their first public catalogue of deep-sea life will be a foundation for future research and one day, the difficult decisions about what lies beneath.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand — where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, updated the public on the Atoa o Samoa Talks — set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks — during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>This is Part II of the segment, reported in Samoa News on Wednesday, November 5, 2025.</p>
<p>During the podcast, Taupau raised the importance of fostering sporting exchanges between the two Samoas, emphasizing their potential to elevate the standard of national teams ahead of international competitions, promote genuine sportsmanship, and revive traditional sports that once served as powerful unifiers across communities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed full support for the proposal, affirming that it deserves a place on the agenda of the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks. He specifically highlighted the decline of traditional sports in Samoa, noting that the iconic Fautasi races — once a source of national pride — have largely faded from the local sporting landscape, while they continue to thrive in American Samoa.</p>
<p>“American Samoa is so far ahead in Fautasi racing,” Laauli remarked. “Villages are rowing state-of-the-art fautasi made of fiberglass and equipped with sliding seats, costing close to a million dollars. In Samoa, the opposite is happening — villages no longer want to row their old wooden fautasi.”</p>
<p>With a touch of humor, the Prime Minister suggested inviting five or six fautasi crews from American Samoa to compete during Samoa’s Independence celebrations, and playfully proposed that their hosts offer to sell the boats at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Laauli lamented the decline of Samoan kirikiti (cricket) in Samoa, where the sport was first introduced by missionaries in the 19th century and once flourished as a national pastime. He recalled that village matches often spanned two to three days, drawing crowds and fostering community spirit.</p>
<p>“Now, it is practically a dead sport in Samoa because everyone is playing international cricket,” Laauli remarked. “The benefits of international cricket are all very well, but Samoan kirikiti used to be our national sport — and it needs to be revived.”</p>
<p>He noted that, like fautasi racing, kirikiti remains vibrant in American Samoa and among Samoan diaspora communities in New Zealand, Australia, Hawai‘i, and the U.S. mainland. “But in Samoa, where it all began, it’s practically extinct. That’s very sad, and something must be done to bring it back.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the golden era of sports in both Samoas, the Prime Minister reminisced about the excitement of inter-island competitions across rugby, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and especially boxing.</p>
<p>“Those were the golden years of boxing in both Samoas,” he recalled. “We produced formidable boxers like George Tanoa, Aso Paletaoga, Vai, my cousin Fosi Schmidt, Monty Betham, and William White. Samoan boxers were a force to be reckoned with—and they were respected throughout the Pacific region.”</p>
<p>Following the discussion on sports, Taupau shifted the dialogue to joint agricultural initiatives, specifically livestock development aimed at providing consumers in American Samoa with access to fresh meat sourced from Samoa.</p>
<p>The proposal has sparked considerable controversy, with critics — including members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament.</p>
<p>Taupau asked Prime Minister Laauli whether he plans to revisit the matter when the Atoa o Samoa Talks resume next year.</p>
<p>In response, Laauli acknowledged the complexity of launching a cattle farming operation, noting that such an undertaking would only be viable as a joint venture. He proposed a collaborative model involving the purchase of up to 2,000 cattle from Australia, to be divided between the two governments.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister emphasized that the primary goal is to make fresh meat more accessible to consumers in American Samoa, in contrast to the current reliance on meat that has been refrigerated for extended periods. He further claimed that the practice of importing fresh meat from Samoa — once approved by the USDA — was abruptly discontinued following the September 11 terrorist attacks, citing heightened security and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>Laauli affirmed that key agricultural exports —i ncluding taro, bananas, fish, and vegetables — have already received approval for trade between Samoa and American Samoa. He noted that following the FAST party’s rise to power in 2021, he personally advocated for a joint agricultural venture between the two governments to strengthen regional food security.</p>
<p>As part of a pilot initiative, Samoa donated five cattle, five sheep, and over 500 oysters to American Samoa, laying the groundwork for future collaboration in livestock and aquaculture development.</p>
<p>However, the project drew criticism from members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament, who accused the previous administration of gifting 400 acres of government land to the American Samoa Government — despite the fact that the proposed cattle farm had not yet commenced.</p>
<p>“Despite the political allegations, I remain fully committed to this initiative,” Laauli declared. “It is a vital development that will benefit both countries, and I urge any future administration to continue its implementation to ensure food security for the well-being of our people.”</p>
<p>Taupau concluded the interview by turning attention to the highly anticipated Rugby League Pacific Championship final this weekend between Toa Samoa and the New Zealand Kiwis. He asked the Prime Minister whether he planned to travel to Australia to witness the match in person.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that he had received an official invitation from Australia but shared that he would not be attending due to medical advice. His doctor has advised against air travel given his current physical condition.</p>
<p>In his stead, Laauli announced that the Minister for Sports, Laumatiamanu Ringo Purcell, will represent the Government of Samoa at the match.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the sons of Samoa who have stepped forward to represent their heritage on the international stage.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that many of these gifted athletes had been offered substantial financial incentives to play for New Zealand or Australia. Yet, they chose instead to honor their roots — traveling at their own expense to don the blue jersey and represent Samoa with pride.</p>
<p>“As the Samoan proverb goes, ‘E lele le toloa ae ma’au i le vai’—the tolóa, or Pacific duck, may fly far, but it always returns to the water,” Laauli reflected. “Wherever in the world you reside, and wherever in the world you were born, Samoa is your heritage—the land of your ancestors. Thank you for your service.”</p>

This increase is all the more striking given that last year the ballot was open for almost three months, whereas this year it was only open for one.</p>

      <h1>Pacific News Briefs</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>PACIFIC LABOR MOBILITY</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/man_picking_fruit.jpg?itok=fxJ-wDaj"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/man_picking_fruit.jpg?itok=zpiDelMD" alt="A ni-Vanuatu doing seasonal work in New Zealand"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific nations have been gathering in Solomon Islands to discuss the future of labor mobility in the region.</p>
<p>Workers' rights, brain and labor drain from island countries, and abscondment and visa overstaying are some of the major issues Pacific leaders have voiced concern about in recent years.</p>
<p>The Pacific Labor Mobility Annual Meeting kicked off Monday with the PACER-Plus Forum Island Country Caucus and the Employer Forum.</p>
<p>Solomon Islands Foreign Secretary Collin Beck said the meeting allows countries to share challenges and find joint solutions.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI HOME OWNERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>Fiji's government is preparing to extend a first home ownership initiative to support families who have been evicted from informal settlements.</p>
<p>The government said the pilot will target families from Veidogo, Nabua Muslim League, and Kilikali settlements, with a combined household income of up to FJ$30,000.</p>
<p>The program will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Housing and the Housing Authority to ensure transparent assessment and allocation of social housing lots.</p>
<p>Once approved by Cabinet, it will be brought in in phases.</p>
<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS CLIMATE FUNDS</strong></p>
<p>The Cook Islands has secured US$40 million in climate finance from the Green Climate Fund.</p>
<p>The money will be used to strengthen buildings and vulnerable communities against the impacts of extreme weather events.</p>
<p>As part of it, over 2000 homes will be strengthened to meet the 2019 Cook Islands Building Code for cyclone resilience.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mark Brown said the approval reflects years of sustained effort and partnership across government, financial institutions, and the community.</p>
<p><strong>HAWAI'I E-BIKE SAFETY</strong></p>
<p>Hawai'i police and cyclists are stepping up efforts to promote e-bike safety following recent incidents.</p>
<p>An e-bike rider, who was not wearing a helmet, was critically injured in Waimanalo last week, and the previous week, a 79-year-old was killed in a collision on Maui.</p>
<p>More than 100 people have died on Hawaii roads so far this year - about a third of them on motorcycles, bicycles, or scooters.</p>
<p>Hawaii News Now reported a bike expo was held to educate riders.</p>
<p>Police also ran an operation in Ewa which netted three riders for riding without a license.</p>
<p>Officers also issued ten citations, fifteen warnings, and recovered three e-dirt bikes.</p>
<p><strong>PALAU VISITOR NUMBERS</strong></p>
<p>Visitor arrivals to Palau have increased by close to a quarter from January to September, compared to the same time last year.</p>
<p>Nearly 60,000 international visitors have gone to Palau this year, up from about 40,000 in 2024.</p>
<p>China remains the leading market with 17,000 visitors, followed by Taiwan and Japan.</p>
<p>Arrivals from Europe increased by about 60 per cent, to 3500 visitors, while there was an 86 percent increase in Australian visitors, making up nearly 2000 visitors.</p>
<p><strong>VANUATU SOLAR POWERED X-RAY</strong></p>
<p>Vanuatu's Torba Province has launched its first x-ray service, powered by solar energy.</p>
<p>The Vanuatu Daily Post reported X-rays are now available at Quatvaes Hospital.</p>
<p>The upgrade is part of an Australian project and also supported by the National Green Energy Fund and Respond Global.</p>
<p>Minister of Health, John Qetu, said with the province's first x-ray machine and reliable solar power at Quatvaes Hospital and Bemisas Health Centre, clinicians can diagnose and treat patients faster and closer to home.</p>
<p><strong>TONGA CONSTITUTION</strong></p>
<p>A colorful parade has marked the 150th anniversary of the Tonga Constitution in Nuku'alofa this week.</p>
<p>Matangi Tonga reported the float parade was led by government ministries, the diplomatic corps and residents from foreign countries living in Tonga.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA</em>— The Atoa o Samoa Talks between the governments of Samoa and American Samoa are set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand—where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, confirmed the update during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>Taupau opened the conversation by reflecting on the historic ceremony marking the official opening of the 18th Parliament of the Independent State of Samoa, held on September 16, 2025. During the occasion, the Prime Minister, members of Cabinet, and Members of Parliament were formally sworn in by the Head of State, His Highness Tuimalealiifano Vaaleto‘a Sualauvi II.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by Governor Pulaalii Nikolao Pula, Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, and House Speaker Savali Talavou Ale, representing the American Samoa Government.</p>
<p>“It was a historic moment for the Territory,” noted Taupau, “as it marked the first time a sitting Governor of American Samoa and Fono leaders were formally invited to such a prestigious occasion.”</p>
<p>He then posed the question: “What inspired your decision to extend this special invitation to the leaders of American Samoa?”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli responded that he felt it was the right thing to do not only as a courtesy from one leader to another, but also from one family member to another.</p>
<p>&quot;We are family,&quot; he declared. &quot;We speak the same language, we observe the same culture and traditions, our lineages intertwine, we are one people.</p>
<p>&quot;The Samoan salutation, 'Mai le tai samasama o le Tui Manu'a ma Malaetele, seia paia Fili ma Puletuu na tauilo ai Malo,' immortalizes the sacred geography of the Samoan islands. From the sacred islands of the Tui Manu'a, to the sacred thresholds of chiefs and ceremonial guardians in Savaii veiled in reverence.&quot;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister expressed his hope that the recent ceremony would set a meaningful precedent for future leaders of Samoa. He emphasized the importance of the Samoan people witnessing the active participation of American Samoa’s leadership in prestigious national events, describing it as a powerful gesture of mutual respect and cooperation.</p>
<p>“It was overwhelming and uplifting to hear the audience applaud and cheer when Governor Pula, Senate President Tuaolo, and Speaker Savali entered the venue,” the Prime Minister shared. “It was a sign of recognition — an affirmation of the respect between the leaders of our two countries. You see, we may be under different political jurisdictions, but we are one people.”</p>
<p>After the ceremony on Sept 16th, which was held at the Multi-Purpose Gymnasium within the government’s sports complex at Tuana’imato, Governor Pula and the Fono leaders held a meeting with Laauli later in the day. It was an especially significant meeting, because it marked the first time an American Samoa Governor and Fono leaders have met a Samoa Prime Minister inside the Cabinet Room.</p>
<p>During the discussions, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of holding regular Atoa o Samoa Talks to strengthen cooperation and address shared challenges and opportunities faced by the two Samoas.</p>
<p>&quot;Our discussion with Governor Pula and the Fono leaders was brief, owing to time constraints related to their return flight to the Territory that same day,&quot; Laauli recalled. &quot;Nevertheless, it was a highly constructive exchange, and we reached consensus on several key issues of mutual importance.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli reflected on Governor Pula’s remarks during their brief meeting noting their shared emphasis on preserving the cultural ties that bind the two Samoas.</p>
<p>“He acknowledged that while collaboration on socio-economic development is vital, it means little if we fail to prioritize the truth that we are of the same blood, flesh, and bone,” Laauli said. “But if we work together as one family, then whatever we achieve — whether great or small — we share as a family that endures hardship together. What is good for American Samoa is also good for Samoa and vice versa.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that Governor Pula extended a personal invitation for him to visit Manu‘a, which he has graciously accepted. He also shared that Senate President Tuaolo and House Speaker Savali invited him and members of the Samoa Parliament to observe sessions of the American Samoa Legislature.</p>
<p>In turn, Prime Minister Laauli extended a reciprocal invitation for American Samoa lawmakers to attend and observe proceedings of the Samoa Parliament, reinforcing a spirit of mutual respect and legislative exchange.</p>
<p>Taupau informed the Prime Minister that upon their return to the Territory, the Fono leaders introduced a concurrent resolution calling for the resumption of the Atoa o Samoa Talks. The resolution was unanimously passed by both chambers of the American Samoa Legislature.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his gratitude to the Fono leadership for their commitment to advancing the Atoa o Samoa Talks, affirming that the initiative is moving forward as previously discussed.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the history of the initiative originally known as the  2Samoa Talks when he first entered politics in 2006 — Laauli noted that nearly two decades have passed since its inception, yet no concrete policies have been implemented to address key areas of social and economic development affecting the standard of living in both countries.</p>
<p>He attributed this lack of progress to recurring conflicts with federal policies and shifting priorities among successive administrations leading the executive branch of the American Samoa Government.</p>
<p>When the Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) party first came to power five years ago under the leadership of then Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata‘afa, the 2Samoa Talks was renamed the Atoa o Samoa Talks.</p>
<p>Laauli recalled encouraging then Prime Minister Fiame to pursue deeper collaboration with the American Samoa Government, emphasizing the many potential benefits rooted in the close cultural ties shared by the two Samoas.</p>
<p>He noted that American Samoa’s unique relationship with the United States Federal Government affords it certain advantages — benefits that, through strategic cooperation, could also positively impact Samoa.</p>
<p>One such example is the remittances sent by Samoa workers employed at the canneries in American Samoa. These U.S. dollar transfers, when converted to Samoa tala, effectively double in value, providing significant economic support to families in Samoa.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli stated that his administration has been focused on stabilizing the urgent financial crisis it inherited from the previous government. The severity of the situation necessitated the adoption of an Emergency Budget under Article 105 of the Constitution, which provides for special financial measures in response to unforeseen national challenges.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the financial situation is now under control, and a short-term fiscal plan has been developed to guide the government over the next three months. With this groundwork in place, the Prime Minister affirmed that the resumption of the Atoa o Samoa Talks is now the administration’s next priority, with the exact date to reconvene the dialogue to be announced sometime at the beginning of 2026.</p>
<p>Responding to questions about the long-term plans initiated by the previous administration to establish a Samoa Consulate General's Office on land allocated by the American Samoa Government in Tafuna, Laauli confirmed that the project will proceed as planned. He further noted that Cabinet has approved amendments to the project’s scope to better align with current priorities.</p>
<p>In a gesture of reciprocity, the Samoa Government has earmarked land at Taumeasina, Moata‘a for the future construction of an American Samoa Embassy in the Independent State of Samoa — cementing a deepening commitment to diplomatic presence and bilateral cooperation between the two Samoas.</p>
<p>Laauli stated that upon his return to Samoa, he will meet with Samoa’s Consul General to American Samoa, Fata Brian Kaio, who is expected to present the feasibility study that will determine whether construction of a permanent consulate facility should proceed.</p>
<p>“I personally believe the need for a dedicated Consulate General’s Office is well justified,” Laauli explained. “Thousands of Samoan nationals work in the canneries and across various sectors in the Territory, and many have made American Samoa their permanent home.”</p>
<p>The Samoa Consulate General’s Office in American Samoa was officially established in 2005 at the Methodist Iupeli Siliva Building in Fagatogo, following approval from the U.S. State Department. On July 31, 2023, the office relocated to its current premises at Unit 108, Mosooi Business Center in Ottoville, Tafuna.</p>
<p>“It has been two decades, and we’re still renting office space,” the Prime Minister remarked. “It’s time we make this a reality — establish a permanent presence to better serve our citizens with their immigration and travel needs.”</p>
<p>He also shared that Cabinet-approved amendments to the project include the construction of additional facilities to provide housing for cannery workers from Samoa, further reinforcing the government’s commitment to supporting its diaspora in the Territory.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli stated that the timeline for construction will be guided by the recommendation of Consul General Kaio, whose long-standing residence in the Territory has given him a deep understanding of the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>However, he affirmed that the government stands ready to move forward with this important undertaking.</p>
<p>Taupau also raised concerns regarding the welfare of Samoa nationals employed at the StarKist canneries in American Samoa, emphasizing Samoa’s ongoing efforts to advocate for improved employment conditions.</p>
<p>He highlighted the need to include decent living quarters for these workers —similar to the accommodations provided for Samoa’s seasonal workers in New Zealand and Australia where housing is a standard component of their employment agreements.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his gratitude to the StarKist company for its longstanding commitment to employing Samoa nationals in American Samoa. He emphasized that the Samoa Government’s relationship with StarKist — facilitated through the support of the American Samoa Government — is a well-established partnership that predates the current Seasonal Workers Programs in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>“It has been a close and complementary relationship that has withstood the test of time and circumstance,” Laauli affirmed. “Why? Because dialogue is easy — we speak the same language and we understand each other well.”</p>
<p>However, the Prime Minister acknowledged that challenges remain. He cited data from American Samoa authorities indicating that Samoan nationals significantly outnumber U.S. nationals in the inmate population at the Tafuna Correctional Facility (TCF) — a reality he said he does not take lightly.</p>
<p>Laauli noted that many of those incarcerated are employees of the StarKist company, and that their offenses often stem from difficult living conditions and unfavorable circumstances within their immediate environment. He underscored the need for proactive measures to address these social vulnerabilities, including improved housing and support systems for Samoa workers in the Territory, and particularly the lack of affordable rental housing. He noted that many are compelled to live with relatives, where they are expected to contribute not only to daily household expenses but also to cultural obligations — fa'alavelave.</p>
<p>Laauli emphasized that this issue warrants serious and sustained discussion during the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks, as it directly affects the well-being and stability of Samoa nationals residing in the Territory.</p>
<p>He reiterated that this concern is a driving factor behind his decision to incorporate housing facilities into the development plans for the new Consulate General’s Office in Tafuna. These accommodations are intended to support Samoa workers who currently face housing insecurity. The Prime Minister also noted that StarKist management is planning a similar initiative, with proposed housing facilities in Atu‘u to better serve their workforce.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau continued with other areas of concern and interest in developing the relationship between the two Samoas — such as Sports, Agriculture, etc. Samoa News will report further on the appearance of Prime Minister Laauli on this segment this week.</p>

<p>Madang Police are working with limited resources to provide security during the Local Level Government elections. Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Robert Baim said officers are doing their best despite funding shortages and logistical challenges.</p>
<p>“Madang Police are utilizing whatever limited resources we have. We go as far as our resources can get us to. All election matters are the Electoral Commission’s responsibility — police only assist to provide security for the safety of polling officials and materials depending on funds provided,” Baim said.</p>

      <h1>US appeals court says Florida can ban Chinese citizens from buying property</h1>

(date: 2025-11-05)
      <p>
      <p>A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday cleared the way for Florida to enforce a law restricting real estate and land purchases by Chinese citizens, rejecting claims it violates federal law and discriminates against Asians. The 2-1 ruling by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could encourage other states to adopt so-called alien land laws, which were once common but fell out of favor a century ago. Lawmakers in more than 30 states have passed or introduced bills restricting foreign property ownership. The 11th Circuit said four Chinese citizens represented by the American Civil Liberties Union lacked legal standing to sue over Florida’s 2023 law because it only applies to people “domiciled” in China, and they have lived in Florida for years.</p>

      <p>President Donald Trump’s administration said on Monday it plans to partially fund November food benefits for millions of Americans, but warned it could take some states weeks or months to calculate and distribute the aid. The administration laid out the Department of Agriculture’s plan in a filing in federal court in Rhode Island after a judge ordered it on Friday to use emergency funds to at least partially cover November’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP benefits.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018913224/kids-kapa-haka-competition-kicks-off-in-south-island-for-first-time">small beginnings</a> with just over 20 rōpū, Te Mana Kuratahi has grown into a nationwide celebration of Māori excellence and identity, with the competition running all week — from Monday to Friday — to accommodate all the groups.</p>
<p>Among those taking the stage are the defending champions Te Kapa Puāwai of Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Hoani Waititi Marae from Auckland, who have competed in every Te Mana Kuratahi since it began 25 years ago, lifting the national title a record setting four times.</p>
<p>Kaiārahi o Te Kapa Puāwai Te Ora Pahewa said it was a surreal feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;I stood on that first stage in 2000 at Hopuhopu representing my kura, our entire school, our whānau, both sets of grandparents were there to tautoko. You felt like a superstar.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, to stand here as the kaiārahi, guiding our next generation, it's come full circle. The scale might be bigger, but the kaupapa hasn't changed, pride in who you are, and belief in your ao Māori.&quot;</p>
<p>Māori health coalition asked those attending Te Mana Kuratahi to <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/577329/people-going-to-tauranga-kapa-haka-event-asked-to-take-measles-precautions">take precautions to prevent measles from spreading</a>.</p>

<p><strong>RNZ PACIFIC CYCLONE WATCH SERVICE ACTIVATED</strong></p>
<p>The South Pacific cyclone season officially started Nov. 01, 2025 and will run through to April 2026.</p>
<p>Meteorologists are predicting five to nine cyclones <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/575847/up-to-nine-tropical-cycones-forecast-for-pacific-this-season">for the southwest</a> Pacific in this season.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific's Cyclone Watch Service has become an important communications lifeline for Pacific nations and territories over the years, who are affected by the ever-increasing number of tropical cyclones in the Region.</p>
<p>Our information comes from Meteorological Services in the region. We also attempt to get damage reports from local government authorities and non-governmental agencies who are active in the field, as well people on the ground, who have been affected by the Cyclone.</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific broadcasts official vital weather updates and information via our shortwave transmitter. When local power grids and transmission facilities have been rendered inoperable by a cyclone, our broadcasts may be the only updates that people in the Island nations and territories can receive.</p>

<p><strong>CONJOINED TWINS IN PNG</strong></p>
<p>The parents of conjoined twins in Papua New Guinea who had hoped to send their babies to Sydney for surgery are now desperately trying to go to Germany instead, saying Australia is too expensive.</p>
<p>Male twins Tom and Sawrong were born on 9 October in remote PNG, joined at the lower abdomen.</p>
<p>The boys share a single liver and portions of their gastrointestinal tract. One twin also has a congenital heart defect and only one kidney.</p>
<p>They are currently receiving care in Port Moresby's public hospital, which is not equipped to handle complex neonatal cases.</p>
<p>Conjoined twins are extremely rare, accounting for just one or two in every 100,000 births. Most cases result in miscarriage or stillbirth, and even when born alive the twins have a low chance of survival.</p>

      <h1>New head of Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority vows transparency, welcomes scrutiny</h1>

<p>By Talaia Mika, Cook Islands News</p>
<p>Source: Cook Is. News via RNZ Pacific</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The newly appointed Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) commissioner Beverly Stacey-Ataera says public trust and open dialogue will be at the centre of the Cook Islands' seabed minerals journey.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera told Cook Islands News she welcomes scrutiny from environmental groups and the wider community, adding that public accountability strengthens the Authority's work.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome their feedback,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have an incredibly important role, and we enjoy working with them. They need to hold us accountable and make sure that everything's being done properly, which it is, but it's good to have that additional people out there who are having an oversight so that we have the trust of the people. They do just as important a job as we do, so it's great.&quot;</p>
<p>Her comments come as debate continues over the future of the industry, with environmental advocates calling for caution while government says seabed minerals could support the nation's long-term resilience.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera stressed that no decision has been made to mine, and the priority is research, understanding and public engagement.</p>
<p>&quot;We reaffirm, we're not mining. We're not mining at all,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in exploration phase, which is just science, and quite possibly the coolest thing ever is doing the science.&quot;</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera said the Authority is focused on completing scientific studies with licence holders to better understand the seabed environment.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Cook Islands government granted licenses for exploratory work to three seabed mining companies — CIC, CIIC Seabed Resources and Moana Minerals. The exploration is now in the fourth year of a five-year phase to assess the feasibility of deep-sea mining for mineral rich polymetallic nodules.</p>
<p>Stacey-Ataera reiterated their immediate focus is &quot;completing the scientific research with our license holders&quot;.</p>
<p>She feels &quot;incredibly humbled&quot; to lead the Authority and remains committed to ensuring Cook Islanders are informed and involved.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to do the scientific research. We need to understand the environment, and then we need to share that with our people, and then our people will make a decision about what they want to do.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome everybody to come and have a chat with us. We're moving towards more consults and going out with more information, so stay tuned. We've got a lot of exciting things to share with you.&quot;</p>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>CHICAGO — The immigration agents’ tear gas grenades clinked and then exploded against the concrete, shrouding the block in plumes of white gas. The dozen or so residents at the scene only screamed louder. “We don’t want you here,” yelled Rae Lindenberg. The 32-year-old, who works in marketing, ran out of her apartment when she heard the shrill sound of whistles. “Get out of our neighborhood!” The squad of agents had appeared in Lakeview last month, an upscale neighborhood dotted with dog daycares, medical spas and vegan restaurants, hopping over a gate to chase down a construction worker who was handcuffed and shoved into a vehicle.</p>

      <h1>Bessent says high US interest rates may have caused housing recession</h1>

(date: 2025-11-03)
      <p>
      <p>Parts of the U.S. economy, particularly housing, may already be in recession because of high interest rates, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday, repeating his call for the Federal Reserve to accelerate rate cuts. “I think that we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,” Bessent said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “And the Fed has caused a lot of distributional problems with their policies.” Bessent said that, although the overall U.S. economy remains solid, high mortgage rates still hinder the real estate market. Housing, he said, is effectively in a recession that is hitting low-end consumers the hardest because they have debts, not assets. Pending home sales in the United States were flat in September, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>

<p>The report - in tandem with Te Hunga Roia Māori (the New Zealand Law Society) and the People's Action Plan Against Racism in Aotearoa reports - will be presented at the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in its 23rd and 24th periodic UN reviews in November.</p>
<p>The submission argues that the current coalition government's policies negatively impact Māori rights and remove certain protections, stating &quot;the government is actively and profoundly aggravating New Zealand's constitutionally racist foundation in a way we have not seen for at least half a century&quot;.</p>
<p>It claims that they are ignoring the impact of land confiscation and decades of systemic injustice and discrimination towards Māori - actions that in breaches the rights of Māori which CERD has described as permanent rights.</p>
<p>Te Wai Ariki co-director Professor Claire Charters (Ngāti Whakaue, Tūwharetoa, Ngā Puhi, Tainui) said the whole constitution was fundamentally opposed to, or in contradiction to, Te Tiriti o Waitangi because it keeps all power in one place.</p>
<p>'Racially discriminatory' laws highlighted in the report include the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 and Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2025.</p>
<p>A large number of rights-breaching bills and legislation have been identified by the three reports affecting equality, political rights, equal rights in employment, housing, health and education and training.</p>
<p>Some of those are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/523622/maori-wards-bill-passes-third-reading">Local Government (Electoral Legislation and Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Act</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/536600/new-three-strikes-regime-passed-into-law">Sentencing (Reinstating Three Strikes) Amendment Act</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/572763/law-changes-will-further-sideline-maori-in-health-sector-select-committee-told">The Pae Ora Amendment Act</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/536961/fast-track-bill-passes-into-law-amid-protest">Fast-track Approvals Act</a></p>
<p>&quot;What they're doing now is creating and exacerbating existing inequality... I definitely think that all these pieces of legislation are especially racially discriminatory.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no surprise when you have policy, particularly from ACT and also New Zealand First that is about, amongst other things, not recognising the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and reinterpreting what Te Tiriti o Waitangi means so that it is saying what it does not say.&quot;</p>
<p>In July, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples Albert K. Barume issued a letter to government ministers expressing a number of concerns, including about David Seymour's Regulatory Standards Bill. Seymour criticized the letter.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole constitutional structure, whereby the parliament legislature can ignore Te Tiriti o Waitangi is a treaty breach,&quot; Charters said.</p>
<p>She added that the disestablishment of the short-lived Te Aka Whai Ora, the Māori Health Authority, was also a form of a treaty breach.</p>
<p>&quot;When you take away a mechanism that is designed, at least in part, to improve those statistics so that we at least come up to the same standard as our fellow citizens, then I would say creates an inequality or exacerbates an existing inequality.&quot;</p>
<p>It came down to structural racism, where a community was disadvantaged by unfair systems, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you've got, on the collective level, that Māori are indigenous peoples and should also have some sort of authority about how we are regulated or they are regulated. Just like the Crown has its own system, or the settler state has its own kind of system.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, we live under a different peoples and states system and without any recognition of our own tikanga or our own law or our own governance. So that, at a kind of collective level, also creates inequality.&quot;</p>
<p>'There Needs To Be Some Reform Of New Zealand's Constitution'</p>
<p>Te Wai Ariki is concerned about the current government's &quot;exacerbation of racial discrimination towards Māori&quot; through unconstitutional and mass legislation changes.</p>
<p>Recommendations stated in the report call for constitutional transformation, and not incremental reform.</p>
<p>It warns that &quot;without transformation, Parliament remains unchecked and continues to pass laws in breach of Indigenous peoples' rights&quot;.</p>
<p>Constitutional transformation in Aotearoa New Zealand must be centerd on te Tiriti (and He Whakaputanga) in recognition of their status as the founding constitutional documents of this nation.</p>
<p>Such constitutional transformation would also result in greater compliance with recommendations from UN human rights treaty bodies, special procedures and other international mechanisms designed to monitor Aotearoa New Zealand's human rights record, the report states.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be some strong check on Parliament, on the Crown, so that it can't do that on its political whim of the day,&quot; Charters said.</p>
<p>She said there are many examples, or basic features, of western liberal democracies from around the world that New Zealand can take note of.</p>
<p>&quot;The most well-known is generally the US where the constitution includes freedom from discrimination, and the Supreme Court can overturn legislation that breaches those rights.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is an absolute outlier, and that we can't check our Parliament or make sure or overturn racially discriminatory laws.&quot;</p>
<p>Collectively, the reports ask the UN CERD to record that the 54th government's reforms are racially discriminatory and in breach of International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, reaffirm the constitutional status of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Waitangi Tribunal, recommend an independent investigation into racial discrimination and legislative harm in Aotearoa, urge constitutional transformation consistent with Matike Mai Aotearoa, establish enhanced UN monitoring and in-country consultations with Māori and affected communities.</p>

      <h1>Pacific islands at risk of becoming 'narco-states', crime advisor warns</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)

<p>By</p>
<p>Caleb Fotheringham, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific Island nations are at risk of becoming &quot;narco-states&quot;, the chair of New Zealand's Ministerial Advisory Group on transnational and serious organized- crime says.</p>
<p>Steve Symon told Pacific Waves that drugs pass through the Pacific region to reach lucrative markets such as New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happened is that in trying to reach New Zealand and Australia, we've opened up drug routes through the Pacific, which has seen a rise in the methamphetamine use in places such as Fiji and Tonga,&quot; Symon said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we continue with business as usual, we will continue to go backwards. Places like Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Rarotonga [which] are vulnerable because of their size and because of economic difficulties, those countries are at risk of becoming narco-states.&quot;</p>
<p>Symon said a nation becoming a narco-state would mean organized crime corrupting government organizations, like the police, customs and other border agencies.</p>
<p>The final report from the advisory group to the New Zealand government titled, Lead boldly, act decisively: Tackling and dismantling organized crime, said addressing organized crime in New Zealand would contribute positively to regional stability.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pacific region is a particular focus. It is increasingly used as a transshipment point for illicit goods destined for New Zealand,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said organized crime is &quot;one of the most significant threats&quot; to New Zealand which could not be &quot;understated or underestimated&quot;.</p>
<p>Symon said New Zealand had a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to support the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is so connected to our Pacific nation, everyone's got family or friends who are from the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're looking purely from a New Zealand centric approach, our borders really reach there. The drugs that are coming to New Zealand, Australia are passing through there. So really, we need to reach out and stop things coming through the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;There's some great work being done in the Pacific, and there's some really passionate people working in the Pacific, but we really need to help coordinate and pull them together so that we have a coordinated fight.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>CALL FOR NZ AND AUS STEP UP</strong></p>
<p>José Sousa-Santos, associate professor of practice and head of the University of Canterbury's Pacific Regional Security Hub, said there is no excuse for New Zealand and Australia to be &quot;counting dollars and cents&quot; when it comes to supporting the region amid the current drug threat.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pacific would not have this drug problem or an issue with traditional organized crime, if it wasn't for New Zealand's and Australia's drug markets and its hunger for illicit drugs,&quot; Sousa-Santos said.</p>
<p>He said Australia and New Zealand call themselves part of the Pacific family but deport criminals to the Pacific with no job prospects or cultural understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;And of course, a percentage of those deportees will turn to crime, reach back into their contacts in Australia, New Zealand, and exacerbate the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Sousa-Santos said 501 deportees who have come from Australia to New Zealand had required law enforcement agencies to strengthen their response.</p>
<p>&quot;If a country like New Zealand, with the resources that it has in law enforcement, is struggling to deal with the 501 deportees from Australia, one can only imagine the impact that deportees from New Zealand and Australia are having in small island states.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>RISK OF FENTANYL IN THE PACIFIC</strong></p>
<p>The report also warned of a &quot;new scourge&quot; in the form of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. It said New Zealand should be &quot;throwing the kitchen sink&quot; at stopping it from taking hold.</p>
<p>Between October 2023 and September 2024, there were about 87000 opioid-related deaths in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Many believe that for New Zealand it is a matter of when, not if,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Sousa-Santos said small amounts of fentanyl had already been found in wastewater testing in Fiji and Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>&quot;If you ask me one thing that will keep me up at night, it's definitely fentanyl,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most experts looking at the Pacific see fentanyl as the next wave coming to the region. I don't think the Pacific quite understands the risk and the damage that fentanyl will do.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the points that I always make is methamphetamines has an impact on communities, on society, mental health, but fentanyl kills and I think that's about as clear as one can make it.&quot;</p>
<p>Symon said the social and emotional costs of fentanyl reaching the Pacific and New Zealand would be huge.</p>
<p>&quot;I was talking to some people from America, and they were trying to give an example, saying, you know, we had concerns about covid, but fentanyl is just 100 times worse.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the lucrative market for methamphetamine was likely why fentanyl had not arrived yet in New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>'GENIE NOT OUT OF THE BOTTLE'</strong></p>
<p>Sousa-Santos does not think the Pacific is at risk of becoming narco-states, similar to what is seen in central American countries, but it could still be a semi-narco region, where criminal entities have &quot;undue influence&quot; over state institutions.</p>
<p>He said it is not too late to turn around the current state of drug use in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The genie is definitely not out of the bottle, the red flags, well and truly waving.&quot;</p>
<p>Sousa-Santos said low population numbers, in most Pacific nations, makes it easier to address drug problems.</p>
<p>He said the traditional power structures, like the church and chiefly systems is where the regions strength lies.</p>
<p>&quot;By ensuring that any response to the Pacific is grounded by Pacific led, partner supported initiatives that will give us much stronger returns.&quot;</p>

      <h1>US roasters tear through coffee stocks waiting for Brazil trade deal</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Coffee roasters in the United States are plowing through their stockpiles as they await the outcome of ongoing U.S.-Brazil trade negotiations, talks that could determine whether they have to pay much higher prices for alternative sources of coffee. Brazilian coffee, which accounts for a third of the beans consumed by the world’s largest coffee consumer, has been priced out of the American market since August when the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 50% import tariff on Brazil’s beans, in a case that mixed trade with politics. Trump has accused Brazil’s Supreme Court of unfair treatment of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro. The trade tariff on coffee among other Brazilian goods was widely viewed as punishment of the government of leftist Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro’s successor. Bolsonaro was later found guilty of organizing a coup plot. So far, the steep duty has caused havoc in the $340 billion U.S. coffee industry, leaving importers with stranded cargoes of Brazilian coffee, roasters paying a fee to cancel deliveries and consumers spending as much as 40% more for their morning brew.</p>

      <h1>Pentagon’s DOGE unit to revamp military drone program, sources say</h1>

(date: 2025-10-31)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — The Pentagon’s DOGE unit is leading efforts to overhaul the U.S. military drone program, including streamlining procurement, expand homegrown production, and acquire tens of thousands of cheap drones in the coming months, according to Pentagon officials and people with knowledge of the matter. In July, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged to cut red tape and assert U.S. drone dominance by approving hundreds of American-made drone models and launching training programs to prepare units for ‘drone wars’ - a response to the widespread use of drones on Ukraine’s battlefield, which have exposed U.S. drone limitations. The Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) involvement, which has not been previously reported, grants the unit influence over a U.S. military drone program that President Donald Trump designated a defense priority in a June executive order, five people with knowledge of the matter said.</p>

<p>Source: RNZ Pacific CNMI</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A massive latte stone from Rota has finally returned to the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) after more than seven decades overseas.</p>
<p>The stone pillar - an emblem of Chamorro identity - was purchased by a private collector in the 1950s and taken off-island.</p>
<p>Weighing more than 10,000 pounds, it was recently shipped from Hawai'i to Saipan and is now housed at the Northern Marianas Museum of History and Culture, where it will be publicly unveiled next month.</p>
<p>NMI Museum executive director Leni Leon told Marianas Press that the latte stone was first brought to the Honolulu Academy of Arts before being transferred to the Bishop Museum in 1970. It remained there for decades until a group of visiting Chamorros noticed it in 2021 and began advocating for its return.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason why they are brought over to the NMI Museum is because by law, the museum serves as the official repository and custodian of all ancient artifacts and cultural materials of the CNMI,&quot; Leon said.</p>
<p>He said efforts are underway to identify the latte stone's original site in Rota, with the long-term goal of returning it there.</p>
<p>Indigenous Affairs Office resident executive Luella Marciano, who witnessed the offloading at the Port of Saipan, described the moment as deeply emotional.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a connection for us when we receive it from another place,&quot; she said. &quot;Not only does it connect our history with our people, it also reminds us of what happened to us. Many of our islands were colonized, so this is another form of peace for us-restoration for our people.&quot;</p>
<p>Traditional healer Donald Mendiola led a blessing ceremony at the museum. &quot;I am proud that it is here. It is back at home,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Governor David Apatang's chief of staff Henry Hofschneider attended a repatriation ceremony in Hawai'i in August marking the start of the process to return Marianas artifacts from the Bishop Museum. He said this shipment represents the &quot;first wave&quot; of many cultural items coming home.</p>
<p>Museum officials say the latte stone will remain on display in Saipan for now, allowing the public-especially students-to see and touch a symbol that appears on the CNMI flag and has long represented Chamorro strength and resilience.</p>
<p>The official public ceremony to welcome the latte stone home is tentatively scheduled for November 15, when it will touch Marianas soil for the first time in 75 years.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Rarotonga doctor, who witnessed Samoa's deadly measles outbreak in 2019, is warning Cook Islands residents to stay alert and ensure vaccinations are up to date, as New Zealand reports new measles cases, raising concern for the country' s close travel ties.</p>
<p>Dr Teariki Puni, who operates private clinic Holistic Medical, said while the Cook Islands is currently dealing with a wave of acute respiratory illnesses, it is important not to overlook the risk of measles, especially with regular flights between Auckland and Rarotonga.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the key word here for us is to be very vigilant,&quot; Dr Puni said. &quot;The 2019 experience in Samoa taught me a lot and that is to get vaccinated.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Puni said the majority of cases seen at his clinic in recent months have been acute respiratory infections affecting both adults and children.</p>
<p>&quot;For the month of August, normally we're averaging about 300 but in August it was like almost 500 in terms of numbers. I would say 80 percent of those people had acute respiratory infections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He explained that during Te Maeva Nui celebrations, when many visitors were housed in crowded hostels, infections spread easily.</p>
<p>&quot;These hostels are like a breeding ground because it's open and everyone's staying together, both the ones that are unwell and the ones that are well,&quot; he said. &quot;We saw a lot of spread amongst the vaka teams as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Previously, the Health Ministry noted that Rarotonga has been struck by a &quot;wave of acute respiratory illness,&quot; with health officials urging those with symptoms to rest, hydrate and seek medical attention if conditions worsen.</p>
<p>While respiratory infections have kept local clinics busy, Dr Puni said the current measles situation in New Zealand poses a separate and potentially serious risk.</p>
<p>New Zealand's health authorities have confirmed rising measles cases this month, mostly among unvaccinated individuals, prompting vaccination drives across Auckland - the main gateway for travelers to the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there were 11 known measles cases throughout New Zealand, and the number of close contacts was about 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very close relationship with New Zealand and so we've got about almost two flights a day,&quot; Dr Puni said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you hit Auckland, that's our gateway - that's somewhat our gateway of people coming over and bringing that.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the best protection remains vaccination and basic hygiene measures.</p>
<p>&quot;Make sure that our kids, those who are supposed to be vaccinated at that age group, should be vaccinated with the measles vaccine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they're not vaccinated or they've fallen behind on their vaccinations, just contact the community health nurses to arrange for them to get that vaccination.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Puni's warning comes from personal experience. He was among Samoan doctors who travelled to Samoa to assist during the 2019 outbreak that claimed more than 80 lives, mostly children.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a hard lesson learned,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think we need to be mindful of that situation as well.&quot;</p>
<p>He recalled the tragedy in Samoa was made worse by a temporary halt in vaccinations following a death under investigation, which left many children unprotected when the outbreak struck.</p>
<p>&quot;When we had the cases picking up in New Zealand, that's where Samoa was exposed and that's where you saw the numbers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dr Puni urged Cook Islanders to apply lessons from Covid-19 and the Samoan measles outbreak by practising good hygiene and staying home when unwell.</p>
<p>&quot;The principles remain the same - if you're unwell, stay home. Avoid going to public places like the supermarket where you'll be spreading it to other people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hand washing and just coughing etiquette, covering your mouth and just remember social distancing. Those basic principles are very effective and economical because the money needed to treat people when they're really sick is a lot greater than it is in terms of prevention.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether setting up vaccination booths at the airport can be an option, Dr Puni said health authorities must balance preparedness with public confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes it might scare people because it can cause anxiety,&quot; he said. &quot;It's really about just monitoring the current situation and having that surveillance continue throughout that time.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Puni believes the Cook Islands is well positioned to respond, provided people remain alert and proactive.</p>
<p>&quot;My stance is that if we continue - it's just, again, being vigilant,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to wait and see, have the proper responses ready, and make sure our systems are prepared when it does happen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you're feeling unwell, see your GP or the Ministry of Health team. Prevention is always better than cure.&quot;</p>
<p>In a travel advisory alert update, the Ministry of Health said: &quot;Over the weekend, Health New Zealand confirmed a total of ten measles cases nationwide. One case was imported from overseas, while nine were locally acquired. Of the local cases, seven have been linked to an exposure event on the Bluebridge Cook Strait ferry on October 3.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Several hundred close contacts have been identified, including individuals at Wellington College and Wellington Girls' College connected to the ferry exposure. Health New Zealand continues to work swiftly to trace and notify all potential contacts.</p>
<p>The Ministry said it would continue to monitor the situation and keep the public informed.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents and guardians are encouraged to check that their children have received both MMR1 and MMR2 vaccinations. If unsure, please contact Tupapa Primary Care on 20066 or Public Health on 29110 for assistance.&quot;</p>

      <p>The carrier’s code and callsign will disappear by the end of this month.</p>

<p>Source: Airlinegeeks.com</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Alaska-Hawaiian merger made another big step this week with the retirement of the “Hawaiian” callsign.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2025/10/24/faa-officially-drops-hawaiian-code-callsign/%22%20%5Co%20%22FAA%20Officially%20Drops%20Hawaiian%20Code,%20Callsign%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would cancel the airline’s callsign, effective Oct. 30.</a> All Hawaiian aircraft will use the Alaska Airlines callsign and code.</p>
<p>A “Hawaiian livery” note will be placed in the flight plan remarks for its flights for 60 days, the agency said.</p>
<p><strong>LAST FLIGHT</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, an airline spokesperson confirmed to AirlineGeeks that the last flight with the long-standing ‘Hawaiian’ callsign would operate on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.</p>
<p>The last flight to use the Hawaiian callsign and code was <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/HAL866%22%20%5Co%20%22%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">HA866</a> from Pago Pago, American Samoa, to Honolulu. This flight was scheduled to land in Honolulu on Wednesday at 5:39 a.m. local time.</p>
<p>“We will retire the HA call sign following the 10/29 arrival of our American Samoa-Honolulu flight,” the spokesperson said. “While Alaska and Hawaiian airlines will soon operate under single call sign (AS), guests will continue to enjoy our distinct Alaska and Hawaiian brand experiences, brought to life by our remarkable employees, along with the reach of our expanding joint global network, and the industry-leading benefits of our Atmos™ Rewards loyalty program.”</p>
<p>Alaska has committed to preserving the Hawaiian brand on flights to, from, and between the islands. The two airlines are awaiting <a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2025/10/09/alaska-hawaiian-integrating-booking-systems/%22%20%5Co%20%22Alaska,%20Hawaiian%20Integrating%20Booking%20Systems%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">a Single Operating Certification from the FAA</a>.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Shutterstock, HONOLULU (Island News) — Hawaiian Airlines marked the end of an era as a pilot made the final transmission using the callsign HA at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>It was a bittersweet moment in Hawaiian Airlines history when a pilot called to the tower at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport and used the callsign HA for the final time, which for 95 years stood for Hawaiian Airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;For Hawaiian 866 Heavy, this will clear the act,” the pilot said during the transmission. “This makes our final transmission under the HA call sign as we turn into Alaska's family. I’d like to say mahalo for your partnership through the years as we continue to share our aloha and represent the people of Hawaii everyday on every Hawaiian Airlines flight.&quot;</p>
<p>Hawaiian Airlines flight 866 took off in Pago Pago, American Samoa and landed in Honolulu before 6 a.m. A special gate was reserved for the occasion so employees could witness the last flight under that call sign. It brings a rich history of 95 years as Hawaiian Airlines to a close.</p>
<p>&quot;There was singing and hugging, and people recognizing what incredible history this company has, and also looking to the future,&quot; shared Hawaiian Airlines CEO Diana Birkett Rakow.</p>
<p>Rakow is the new CEO of Hawaiian Airlines, today is her first official day on the job. She is also the first woman to lead the company.</p>

      <h1>Trump acknowledges constitutional limits on third term, for now</h1>

(date: 2025-10-30)
      <p>
      <p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would not seek a third term in office, a marked shift after months of teasing the idea despite constitutional limits though it was unclear whether it was his final word on the matter. Trump, who is known for changing his mind on major issues, was speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his three-country Asia tour. His flirtation with the idea has alarmed opponents and constitutional experts, who say a third term would test the 22nd Amendment, which states no person shall be elected to the presidency more than twice. “If you read it, it’s pretty clear — I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad, but we have a lot of great people,” Trump said, adding he thought Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be “unstoppable” if they ran together in 2028.</p>

The breakthrough underscores the painstaking pace of Moscow’s military advances, but if Russia eventually takes full control of Pokrovsk it would gain a strategically important bridgehead in eastern Ukraine.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — Millions of poor and disadvantaged Americans could face trouble accessing funds for home heating starting next month due to the government shutdown, lawmakers from both parties and nonprofit groups said on Wednesday. The shutdown, now in its 29th day, could prevent states from receiving about $3.6 billion under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The funds help families pay winter heating and summer cooling bills, with about 80% used in the winter months.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed news of, yet another Motion of Vote of No Confidence filed by the Opposition in Parliament, saying it is part of the democratic process and reflects the Constitutional rights of Members of Parliament to choose their Leaders freely and without coercion.</p>
<p>Speaking after Parliament was informed of the new Motion’s admission by the Private Business Committee, Prime Minister Marape said he holds no fear or resentment towards the process, stressing that he will not resort to Political Camps or “behind-the-scenes lobbying” as often seen in past political struggles.</p>

      <h1>Nvidia will build AI supercomputers for US Energy Department, wants to get back into China</h1>

(date: 2025-10-29)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington on Tuesday with a message for the Trump administration: the U.S. can win the AI battle if the world, including China’s massive developer base, runs on Nvidia systems. In his address at the first Nvidia developers’ conference held in Washington, Huang walked a fine line between praising President Donald Trump, whose “America First” agenda Huang credited with spurring greater investment in U.S. manufacturing and AI leadership, and risking further antagonism of China. Huang said the artificial intelligence chip leader will build seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy and had $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips, but also lamented that the Chinese government has shut it out of its market. Nvidia is at the core of the global AI rollout, and it is striking deals around the world while also navigating a U.S.-China trade war that could determine which country’s technology is most used around the world. Trump is touring Asia ahead of an expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday where China’s use of Nvidia’s chips could be a key issue.</p>

      <p>MEASLES VAX FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa government is urging parents and caregivers to get children under two years old immunized against measles amid reports of increasing measles cases in <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/news/elevated-measles-risk-get-protected-before-you-travel">New Zealand</a> and <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/ahpc-statement-on-measles">Australia</a>.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, eight cases of measles have been confirmed, and health officials have <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/576922/hospitals-clinics-not-equipped-for-measles-outbreak-general-practitioner">warned</a> of the risk of an outbreak.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles">measles is a highly contagious and potentially deadly airborne disease</a>, particularly for young children. It can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, brain infection and even death.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry strongly urges all parents and caregivers to ensure that children under 2 years of age receive their routine measles vaccinations without delay at your nearest health facilities,&quot; Samoa's Health Ministry said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1235945695218790&amp;set=a.226234896189880">public notice</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>It said two doses of the measles vaccine are required - the first at 12 months and the second at 15 months.</p>
<p>The Ministry added both doses must be completed for full protection.</p>

<p><strong>VANUATU DEBATE OVER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>A heated debate over constitutional rights and parliamentary privilege is unfolding in Vanuatu.</p>
<p>Local media reports, the Opposition bloc has filed an urgent application in the Supreme Court challenging recent amendments to the constitution.</p>
<p>In June last year, Vanuatu voters said yes to two changes to the country's constitution introduced by government to try and curb political instability.</p>
<p>They aimed to achieve this by ending party-hopping and forcing independent MPs to join political parties.</p>
<p>It follows a particularly turbulent few years which has seen a slew of leadership challenges - resulting in three changes of government in 2023 alone.</p>
<p>But now, a group of Opposition MPs are challenging the Republic of Vanuatu and Speaker of Parliament over the constitutional amendments, arguing they stifle the democratic process and impinge on their rights as elected representatives.</p>

<p><strong>MAN ARRESTED FOR ASSAULTING AN OFFICER IN WAIANAE</strong></p>
<p>Honolulu police arrested a man for assaulting an officer on Sunday in Waianae.</p>
<p>It happened at about 11:57 a.m., when police responded to a report of a man with a handgun arguing with a family member on Ala Hema St.</p>
<p>When police arrived, the 20-year-old suspect became combative and attempted to grab an officer’s firearm.</p>
<p>After a brief struggle, he was taken into custody.</p>
<p>The officer sustained minor injuries, and the gun was later determined to be an airsoft pistol.</p>
<p>Charges will be sought with the Dept. of the Prosecuting Attorney.</p>
<p>(Hawaii News Now)</p>
<p><strong>FIJI CYBER SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>Fiji has signed a new partnership with Israel on cyber security.</p>
<p>FBC reported a formal agreement was signed on Wednesday between the two governments, witnessed by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and Israel's deputy foreign minister Sharren Haskel, who was visiting Fiji.</p>
<p>Rabuka said the government has turned to one of the world's most advanced countries for support.</p>
<p>Haskel said Israel is expanding its interest into other areas to further strengthen relations between the two nations.</p>

<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS WATER</strong></p>
<p>Water levels are running low on one of the Cook Islands' outer islands.</p>
<p>The Aitutaki Water Service has closed two of its eight galleries until ground water levels are restored, which won't happen until decent rainfall.</p>
<p>Cook Islands News reported some households, particularly those on higher ground, will experience a drop in pressure.</p>
<p>One resident told the paper their household has been relying on tank water and they had not had any water from the main network for about three weeks.</p>
<p>(RNZ Pacific)</p>
<p><strong>PNG LAW SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p>The Papua New Guinea Law Society has been reinstated as a full member of the Law Association for Asia and the Pacific (Lawasia).</p>
<p>The National reported President Hubert Namani told a Lawasia Council Meeting in Vietnam this move reaffirms the society's commitment to the promotion of justice.</p>
<p>He said their re-admission to Lawasia opens new pathways for PNG lawyers to access high-level professional development, and contribute to critical regional discussions affecting the rule of law and fundamental rights.</p>

<p><strong>PARLIAMENT RECONSTRUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Two months after a devastating fire that had razed the parliament building, the Marshall Islands promptly picked up the pieces, kicking off the reconstruction of the government chamber known as “Nitijela.”</p>
<p>“Although we felt sorrow and anxiety when the house burned down two months ago, let us thank the Lord that we can now rebuild the house, which was old,” President Hilda Heine said.</p>
<p>Heine led Marshallese officials during the 08 October groundbreaking ceremony for the reconstruction of the Nitijela building, marking “an important step forward,” the president’s office said in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>The fire consumed the parliament building on 26 August, destroying official documents and historical resources stashed in the library and archives. While the structure is mostly still standing, the facility is considered a complete loss.</p>
<p>The Nitijela currently meets at the International Conference Centre in Majuro, which will be its temporary session hall until a new building is constructed. The U.S government has pitched in US<span class="math inline">\(13 million, supplementing the US\)</span>30 million donation from Taiwan, to cover the rebuilding costs.</p>
<p>“I would like to take this opportunity to thank President Donald Trump and the U.S government for their great support, and in these thanks, I add Ambassador Laura Stone. I would also like to express my gratitude to President Lai Ching-te and his family for their support,” Heine said.</p>
<p>She promised that the reconstruction would be completed on time.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning on Tuesday, as the company pares expenses and compensates for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, according to three people familiar with the matter. The figure represents a small percentage of Amazon’s 1.55 million total employees, but nearly 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees. This would mark Amazon’s largest job cut since late 2022, when it started to eliminate around 27,000 positions.</p>

(date: 2025-10-28)
      <p>
      <p>If the dinner problem — defined, broadly, as “what should I make for dinner?” — is difficult to solve, picture solving it every night for the choosiest audience imaginable. This audience is not composed of food critics, or exacting chefs. It’s children. Nothing in the kitchen is more reliably frustrating than trying to feed a picky one. (I say all of this with love.)</p>

      <p>Many family dinners are planned ahead of time after pulling a delicious-sounding recipe out of a cookbook and making a detailed grocery list. But there are plenty of nights when this home cook just wings it based on what’s lurking in her freezer, has ripened on the counter or — more often than I’d like to admit — is about to spoil in the refrigerator crisper.</p>

<p>The  singing of songs in tune with the beats came from a part of the ranch 300 metres away from the Okuk Highway where  28 cows bought from Sialum in Morobe province are kept in a newly constructed yard, replacing the existing yard built of bush materials and a parameter pike fence all around, all at the cost of K300, 000.</p>
