this world-record corn maze is a test of the human psyche</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;DIXON, Calif. &amp;#8212; Deep inside one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest corn mazes, where the tri-tip sandwiches and soft-serve ice cream purchased at the concession stand have become but a memory and all that can be seen in any direction are dirt paths and dead-end walls of green plants whispering in the breeze, people tend to reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

splendor of Granada</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s sunset, and I&amp;#8217;m at the place to be in Granada &amp;#8212; the breathtaking San Nicol&amp;#0225;s viewpoint overlooking the fortress of the Alhambra. Here, at the edge of the city&amp;#8217;s exotic Moorish quarter, lovers, widows, and tourists jostle for the best view of the hill-capping, floodlit fortress, the last stronghold of the Moorish kingdom in Spain. For more than 700 years, Spain, the most Catholic of countries, lived under Muslim rule, until the Christians retook the land in 1492.&lt;/p&gt;
