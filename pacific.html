<p>(BPT) - Technology is integral to Americans’ daily lives — at work,
home, school and everywhere in between. They can’t live without it and
may not even realize how much time is spent on their phones, laptops and
tablets. Deloitte’s Center for Technology, Media &amp;
Telecommunications surveyed U.S. consumers and found that the average
American spends eight hours a day online — half of waking hours. That
equates to almost 3,000 hours a year. While all that time online can
deliver positive experiences, 44% of those surveyed admit they struggle
to limit their screen time to a level they are comfortable with, up from
38% year-over-year.</p>

America</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-04, updated: 2025-06-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — The history of Chinese immigrants in America has always been
about much more than one particular ethnic group. As Michael Luo’s
“Strangers in the Land: Exclusion, Belonging and the Epic Story of the
Chinese in America” demonstrates, understanding America’s efforts to
keep Chinese laborers out, and the violence enacted against those who
stayed in, is essential to understanding the evolution of America’s
immigration system as we know it today.</p>

&amp; Stitch’ passes ‘Sinners’ to become 2nd highest grossing film of
2025</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, updated: 2025-06-03, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — “Lilo &amp; Stitch” and “Mission: Impossible — The Final
Reckoning” dominated the box office charts again after fueling a
record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada
had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony’s
family friendly “Karate Kid: Legends” and the A24 horror movie “Bring
Her Back.” According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust
$149 million post-holiday weekend that’s up over 120% from the same
timeframe last year.</p>
