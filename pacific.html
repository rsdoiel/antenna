‘Burning desire’ from inside the Cabinet</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE Governor’s bi-weekly Cabinet meeting was missing a distinct voice
this past Friday and the Governor began the meeting with a call “for a
moment of silence for the late Ross Manglona” who passed away earlier in
the week.  I didn’t know him well, but he certainly had a captivating
voice and a seemingly contagious sense of humor.  Very apparent as well
was his intellect, he was a smart guy to say the least.  My deepest
condolences to all who were close to him — I imagine the void he leaves
among those closest to him to be vast.</p>
