1, after major malfunction, is back from the brink, NASA Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Several months after a grave computer problem seemed to spell the end for Voyager 1, which for nearly a half century had provided data on the outer planets and the far reaches of the solar system, NASA announced Thursday that it had restored the spacecraft to working order.&lt;/p&gt;

Watch: A decade later, remembering the Pahoa lava flow crisis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, eruptions of Kilauea volcano on the Island of Hawaii have happened in remote regions and lava flows have not directly threatened communities. However, the approaching anniversary of a lava flow crisis a decade ago reminds us that eruptions on Kilauea have the potential to cause damage and island-wide disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

Opportunity in the Pacific</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Like many people from Hawaii Island, I was privileged to attend a small part of the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture, or FestPAC. The energy in the convention center, the range of engaging performances and displays, the diversity of people in Honolulu, all combined for an amazing experience even if I could only attend for a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

like a new morning in Belfast’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Belfast, Northern Ireland&amp;#8217;s capital city, is perhaps best known for the sectarian strife that took place here during the era of the Troubles, and as the birthplace of the Titanic (and many other ships that didn&amp;#8217;t sink). While these two claims to fame aren&amp;#8217;t too uplifting, Belfast&amp;#8217;s story is hardly a downer. This unsinkable city, just two hours away from Dublin by train, makes for a fascinating day trip.&lt;/p&gt;

above other branches</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Speaking freely at a glitzy Supreme Court Historical Society event earlier this month, Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that there are &amp;#8220;fundamental things that really can&amp;#8217;t be compromised&amp;#8221; in society, and speculated that &amp;#8220;one side or the other is going to win.&amp;#8221; The comments were recorded by a documentarian who had attended the events and surreptitiously recorded the justices as they increasingly find themselves under the microscope for tossing precedent overboard and embarking on ideologically rigid right-wing path.&lt;/p&gt;
