cure Joe – Governor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-21, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE recent malfeasant behavior and attacks by Joe Palacios are not a
cure for our Cannabis Industry and have nothing to do with our economy,
just invoking that WE the People should be satisfied with losing money
every year on a Cannabis Commission that WE don’t need. First you assert
the “race card” when I have only referred to myself as an “outsider”
when you are an outsider too Joe having come to the CNMI from Guam, duh.
Next you assert that your IQ is magically 144, which I believe is a
bold-face LIE and I dare you prove me wrong, as my 139 IQ was certified
by the State of Tenn &amp; 2 different Phycologists. You didn’t even
know anything about our Cannabis Industry when you arrived from Guam, as
you only asserted “problems with the wording in the Law” that you
read-up on before being first appointed. Joe, you haven’t done anything
that would even hint to you being a genius and the dysfunctional state
of the Cannabis Commission is PROOF you are NOT a genius, given this is
you second term and NOTHING has changed. Joe, you are only preying on
“nepotism,” and it seems to be working. I just pray the Governor is not
going to run again if he is going to let people like YOU &amp; Clyde
manipulate him against HIS People.</p>

<p>AROUND one hundred people live in the village of Adara, on the
backside of Atauro Island.  It is a small piece of land near East
Timor.  Times used to be good on Atauro. Rainfall came in abundance,
which in turn allowed farming and livestock grazing.  Many people
engaged in bringing forth food from what the land provided.</p>
