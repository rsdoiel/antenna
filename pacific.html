      (BPT) - Ever wonder what kind of food Superman grew up on? Wonder no more. Continuing a Kent Family tradition, Martha has put together an heirloom cookbook full of Clark's favorite dishes, with help from his friends and colleagues. Together, they've recreated the beef bourguignon and ketchup from Lois and Clark's first date, Cyborg's lucky game day potato skins and J'onn's Chocos. Martha even recreated Plurb, which she hears is wonderfully awful. She wasn't quite ready to taste that one herself.

      <p>
      A draft plan to award a grant to a competing company to create high-speed internet access across the CNMI has drawn criticism from Docomo Pacific, which claims it not only violates revisions to the program’s criteria but also costs a “staggering” $29 million over its own plan.

      <p>
      
				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The administration of President Donald Trump has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small minority for &#8220;support for terrorism,&#8221; a State Department official said on Monday. The move, first reported by Fox Digital, comes as the Trump administration has adopted a particularly hard-line approach toward student visas as part of its immigration crackdown, tightening social media vetting and expanding screening. Directives from the State Department this year have ordered U.S. diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the United States and with a history of political activism.</p>

      <p>
      (BPT) - In this era of instant communication and hyperconnected social media, you might think everyone feels connected to everyone else. Unfortunately, that's not the case. According to a new global study from LG on social connection, 68% of people find it harder to make real friends, and 1/3 reported having one or fewer meaningful connections in the past month — with 8% experiencing none at all. In the survey, 9 in 10 respondents also believe meaningful connections lead to a more optimistic outlook on life.

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; When President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki in 2018, the pair alarmed allies with a friendly encounter where Trump sided with the Russian leader over his own intelligence agencies on election interference. Trump flies to a meeting in Alaska with Putin today in a different public mood - impatient with the Russian&#8217;s unwillingness to negotiate an end to his war in Ukraine and angry over missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. The world is waiting to see if it will be this tougher version of Trump who shows up in Anchorage or if it will be the former real estate tycoon who has sought to ingratiate himself with the wily former KGB agent in the past.</p>
