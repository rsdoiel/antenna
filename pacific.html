The meteorological spring means there is a transition from colder to warmer weather, but could also mean a severe weather season, which lasts until May, when the jet stream becomes more volatile, and air moves north.&lt;/p&gt;

enough to dethrone “Captain America: Brave New World” after a three-week
reign.</p>
