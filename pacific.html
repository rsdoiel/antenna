				<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; President Donald Trump said Friday that Intel, the troubled Silicon Valley chipmaker, had agreed to sell the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business, worth $8.9 billion, in one of the largest government interventions in a U.S. company since the rescue of the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Less than two weeks after an Alabama Supreme Court decision upended in vitro fertilization in the state and prompted a national backlash, more than 100 conservative congressional staff members and IVF skeptics crammed into a meeting room a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. They lined the walls and spilled into the hallway, straining to hear the advice of the 25-year-old woman who would help them figure out how to respond.</p>

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov particularly criticised the role of European leaders who met U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine that could help end the three-and-a-half-year-old war.</p>

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The administration of President Donald Trump has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small minority for &#8220;support for terrorism,&#8221; a State Department official said on Monday. The move, first reported by Fox Digital, comes as the Trump administration has adopted a particularly hard-line approach toward student visas as part of its immigration crackdown, tightening social media vetting and expanding screening. Directives from the State Department this year have ordered U.S. diplomats abroad to be vigilant against any applicants whom Washington may see as hostile to the United States and with a history of political activism.</p>

      (BPT) - In this era of instant communication and hyperconnected social media, you might think everyone feels connected to everyone else. Unfortunately, that's not the case. According to a new global study from LG on social connection, 68% of people find it harder to make real friends, and 1/3 reported having one or fewer meaningful connections in the past month — with 8% experiencing none at all. In the survey, 9 in 10 respondents also believe meaningful connections lead to a more optimistic outlook on life.

      <p>
      
				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; When President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki in 2018, the pair alarmed allies with a friendly encounter where Trump sided with the Russian leader over his own intelligence agencies on election interference. Trump flies to a meeting in Alaska with Putin today in a different public mood - impatient with the Russian&#8217;s unwillingness to negotiate an end to his war in Ukraine and angry over missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. The world is waiting to see if it will be this tougher version of Trump who shows up in Anchorage or if it will be the former real estate tycoon who has sought to ingratiate himself with the wily former KGB agent in the past.</p>

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Donald Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation&#8217;s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with &#8220;bloodthirsty criminals,&#8221; even though crime numbers in Washington are falling.</p>

      <p>
      
				<p>Poppy seeds are an essential ingredient in many parts of Europe, as well in Bengali cuisine, and in Pakistani kopta, are derived from the dried seed pods of the poppy plant. The seeds themselves don&#8217;t contain opiates. However, the seed coats of unwashed or unprocessed seeds can contain opium alkaloids and codeine.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Americans just do not know how to cook green beans,&#8221; said Ann, a Bayfield Farmers Market vendor, as she handed me a sack of deep green, plump beans she picked earlier that morning. &#8220;When they&#8217;re underdone and too crisp, they just don&#8217;t have much taste. Give them a few minutes more time when you boil them. They&#8217;re tender but still firm. The little beans within the green bean [the seed] will cook, too.&#8221;</p>

      <h1>Trump signs order extending China tariff truce by 90 days, White House says</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: <a href="https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2025/08/12/nation-world-news/trump-signs-order-extending-china-tariff-truce-by-90-days-white-house-says/">Hawaii Tribune Harold</a>)
      <p>
      
				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China by another 90 days on Monday, a White House official said, staving off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods as U.S. retailers prepared for the critical end-of-year holiday season. Trump signed an executive order delaying the start of higher tariffs until mid-November shortly after giving reporters a noncommittal answer when asked at a news conference if he planned to keep the lower tariff rates in place. On Sunday, Trump demanded China quadruple its purchases of U.S. soybeans, but it remained unclear whether Beijing had agreed. The tariff truce between Beijing and Washington had been due to expire on Tuesday at 00:01 ET. The timing of the extension until early November buys crucial time for the seasonal autumn surge of imports for the Christmas season, including electronics, apparel and toys at lower tariff rates. The new order prevents U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were set to hit 125% - rates that would have resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. It locks in place &#8212; at least for now &#8212; a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, with Chinese duties on U.S. imports at 10%.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus says, “No one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined.” This powerful teaching is not just spiritual, it’s deeply practical. It warns against trying to force new solutions into old systems. [&#8230;]</p>

      LIEUTENANT Governor Dennis James C. Mendiola’s path to public service was not historically significant — except for the fact that he was born in the Generation X era. He sought the office of the Senate twice and won in the 2022 election. Since January 2023, he has been serving the first half of his term as Senate President. The untimely passing of Governor Arnold I. Palacios catapulted him into the office of Lieutenant Governor — a process too swift to fully assess his competency for the role he now occupies.

In the months since, their admonitions have grown only more pointed.</p>
