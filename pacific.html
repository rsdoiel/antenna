<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;A couple of decades ago, universities entered a new kind of competition. In addition to the academic programs, campuses were enhancing their living and recreation facilities. I still remember the first time I heard about the lazy river installed at Louisiana State University in 2017 that spelled out &amp;#8220;LSU,&amp;#8221; but they were by no means the only university that sought to woo students based on out-of-class amenities. Water parks, giant spa pools, aquatic basketball, etc. popped up at several large campuses. Predictably, there was also backlash from faculty and citizens, especially concerning these projects at public universities (see the NY Times opinion piece &amp;#8220;No College Kid Needs a Water Park to Study&amp;#8221;). Still, despite these amenities, students still come to universities to learn and to gain the credentials to make a good living, support their families, and contribute to the well-being of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
