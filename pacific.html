<p>AS we approach the midterm elections, it is crucial to reflect on the
current state of our Commonwealth and evaluate the actions taken by both
past and present administrations. Equally important is the need to hold
our Senators, Representatives, and new candidates accountable for the
plans they present moving forward.</p>

<p>JIMMY Buffett taught us that sometimes, well-told fiction is better
than reality.  Tristan Jones would have agreed.  His own life packed
enough interesting material to keep inquisitive grandchildren gathered
wide-eyed at his feet for years, yet halfway through his life’s journey
he upped the ante and reinvented himself.  Separating fact from fiction
in Tristan Jones’ life is one thing, but whatever you think of him,
there is no denying his power with the pen.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;BEIRUT (Reuters) &amp;#8212; Massive consecutive strikes hit Beirut&amp;#8217;s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, Reuters eyewitnesses said, sending booms across the city and sparking flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometers away. The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city&amp;#8217;s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. The Israeli military said it eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group&amp;#8217;s central command headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 27. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
