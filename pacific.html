<p>date: 2024-06-06, updated: 2024-06-06, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>IT frustrates me, at my age and for someone who often acts like he
knows it all, to consider just how much more I have yet to learn and how
little time (relatively speaking) I have left to figure things out…
about a lot of things, but certainly about human nature and the
complexities of our relationships with each other and with life itself. 
The ebb and flow of individual life experiences and perspectives make it
difficult to grasp in a single thought the meaning of life, much less
any certainty about the best way to live it.  Complicating matters (for
many of us) is having been raised in juxtaposing cultures — island
sea-faring, warrior poets of the Mortlocks and old-south, Confederate
good-ole-boys of Virgina for me.  You really can’t script a
juxtaposition of more complex proportions.  What may be acceptable in
one is not always correct in the other.  It’s fair to say, being mixed
up can be confusing, but there is hope in finding balance down the

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has made history in many ways over the last several years, most of it very bad. He was the first president in U.S. history to have entered the office without any prior public office or military experience. He is the first president to have ever been impeached twice, and certainly the first to have openly and explicitly attempted to subvert the peaceful transfer of power to his successor. For all his transgressions, at least Richard Nixon resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
