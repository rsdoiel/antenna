<p>JIMMY Buffett taught us that sometimes, well-told fiction is better
than reality.  Tristan Jones would have agreed.  His own life packed
enough interesting material to keep inquisitive grandchildren gathered
wide-eyed at his feet for years, yet halfway through his life’s journey
he upped the ante and reinvented himself.  Separating fact from fiction
in Tristan Jones’ life is one thing, but whatever you think of him,
there is no denying his power with the pen.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;BEIRUT (Reuters) &amp;#8212; Massive consecutive strikes hit Beirut&amp;#8217;s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, Reuters eyewitnesses said, sending booms across the city and sparking flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometers away. The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city&amp;#8217;s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. The Israeli military said it eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group&amp;#8217;s central command headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 27. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

Vance probably even won on points, if you judge these things like a high school debate meet; Walz served up a few word salads. &lt;/p&gt;
