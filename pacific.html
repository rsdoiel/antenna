<p>date: 2024-05-02, updated: 2024-05-02, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - With rising energy costs and an increasing awareness of
homeowners’ environmental impact, creating a greener home isn’t just a
trend — it’s a responsible choice for both your wallet and the earth. In
fact, homeowners who implemented energy-saving systems and products in
their home saved 8%-16% on heating and cooling bills through high use of
the scheduling feature on the Honeywell Home T5 and T6 thermostats in a
2019 study in Indiana and Ohio. Whether you’re motivated by reducing
your carbon footprint or simply looking to cut down on utility bills,
transforming your home into a “green” home may be more achievable than
you think with just a few helpful tips.</p>

By DAVID BRANDT AP Sports Writer PHOENIX (AP) — Minnesota star Anthony
Edwards noticed early in the third quarter that the Phoenix Suns
switched up their defense, playing him one-on-one most of the time
instead of using the double teams from the first half. The budding
superstar took that as a challenge. “It was like […]

<p>
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span
style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">          My fellow
citizens, on behalf of Vice President Palik, and I extend to you all
warm greetings of Kaselehlie, Ran Anim, Lenwo and Mogethin. Kamorale and
Happy National Tuna Day!</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span
style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">          May 2nd marks
the 8th year since the United Nations General Assembly adopted UNGA
Resolution A/RES/71/124 on December 7, 2016, proclaiming May 2 every
year as World Tuna Day. The FSM joins our United Nations family by
celebrating May 2 as National Tuna Day throughout the Federated States
of Micronesia.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span
style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">          This year’s
theme, ”Our Tuna, Our Legacy,” underscores our shared responsibility in
celebrating National Tuna Day. I encourage all citizens of our
respective States to join us in commemorating May 2 by organizing
various activities that highlight the importance of tuna in our lives as
a young island nation. Your active participation is crucial in making
this celebration a success.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span
style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">          Tuna is a
major source of protein for our people and a source of livelihood for
our local fishermen and national economy. On average, we generate $65
million a year from the sale of licenses to foreign and domestic fleets.
Today, we can see the impact of our Onshore investments, employment, and
other spin-off benefits visible in our states particularly in Pohnpei
and Kosrae. The adoption of the first FSM National Oceanic Fisheries
Investment Policy, which all five governments of this federation have
endorsed, now provides clear guidance to us all on how we move forward
together to increase our benefits through collective action and
cooperation to improve the investment climate in fisheries. I would like
to thank the four Governors of Pohnpei, Yap, Chuuk, and Kosrae fortheir
confidence in this policy. Your national government is ready to work
hand-in-hand to achieve new levels and greater benefits from our tuna
resources.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span
style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">          My fellow
citizens, our tuna serves as a crucial source of nutrition for our
nation and the global community, sustaining our livelihoods and ensuring
food security. Let us recognize the importance of this resource and work
together to safeguard its continued availability for generations to
come. To this end, conservation and management guided by a sustainable
development policy of our tuna ensures they remain healthy and resilient
to fishing pressure and development. Of course, we face many challenges
to achieve our long-term goals, such as the most threatening matter we
all face today: Climate Change. Climate change is not only an
existential threat to our people and islands, but also to the migration
and distribution of tunas. While there is clear evidence that climate
change will change the distribution of tuna fishing biomass over time,
we are engaged at national, regional, and international fora to protect
our rights and the rights of securing our EEZ and the benefits we enjoy
through various actions, including the permanency of our maritime
boundaries. This, I believe, will ensure that the fishing opportunities
in the coastal and tuna fishery today remain with the FSM over time as
the impact of climate change takes hold as the result of human-induced
changes.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span
style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;"> 
        This also highlights the need for a better understanding of our
tuna. I call on all our fishermen catching tuna in the FSM to be on the
lookout for tags on the tuna. Bring the tagged tuna to your fisheries
offices! Although for a small fee, your tuna will go a long way as your
contribution to improving our understanding of our tuna resources to
ensure we are able to pass on a healthy resource to the next
generation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span
style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;"> 
        My fellow citizens, today, the FSM, in partnership with the
Waitt Foundation through Blue Prosperity Micronesia, is working on
setting aside conservation areas through Marine Spatial Planning
programs, which aim to protect vulnerable marine areas and ecosystems.
It is our belief that marine spatial planning will undoubtedly assure
that our finite fisheries resources can be developed sustainably and
protect the ecosystems in which they thrive.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size:18px;"><span
style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif;">          As we
celebrate this year’s National Tuna Day, I encourage all citizens to
actively engage in all National Tuna Day activities organized by your
respective States and contribute to ensuring greater understanding and
appreciation of the legacy we must chart for ourselves and for the
future generations of the FSM.</span></span>

<p>date: 2024-04-29, updated: 2024-04-29, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE classic tale of Cinderella is a familiar story to many
individuals: Cinderella wants to go to the ball, but her evil stepmother
forbids it; she magically turns into a princess, and in the end, she
gets the prince. It’s cute, really. I just wished it didn’t ironically
mirror the situation in the CNMI. And no, we have not obtained the
prince. We were never meant to, and if we continue to be oblivious to
this reality, the greater our islands’ socioeconomic status will suffer,
and youth will be left unaware. Escape the fairytale, reject the
fable.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-28, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The production of maps to track the progress of ongoing eruptions has long been part of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory mission to inform the public about volcanic hazards in Hawaii. The methods used to collect, interpret, and disseminate map data have been evolving ever since HVO&amp;#8217;s founding in 1912, and a digital tool newly available to the public continues that legacy of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll never forget the moments after I&amp;#8217;d jumped ship in Mykonos: While enjoying a glass of ouzo in a tiny taverna, I watched my mighty cruise ship sail away and take with it the 3,000 tourists who had inundated the charming port just an hour before. Having pushed their postcard racks back indoors, it seemed the shopkeepers were satisfied that they&amp;#8217;d made their money for the day, and suddenly a sleepy charm blanketed both the locals and the visitors who remained on perhaps the most famed island in the Aegean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

Plenty has been said and written about the Paris Summer Olympics (and will be in the coming months), but here I will set that massive event to the side and focus instead on other reasons to visit France this year.&lt;/p&gt;
