<h2 id="rethinking-hawaiis-conveyance-tax">Rethinking Hawaii’s
conveyance tax</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Hawaii grapples with a daunting challenge: the urgent need for 4,000 to 5,000 affordable rental units annually over the next five years to tackle our lack of affordable housing. This acute shortage of housing drives both the houselessness and outmigration crises. The state Legislature has a pivotal opportunity to address this situation by reevaluating conveyance tax rates on the sale of multimillion dollar investment properties.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With a one-two punch, the incumbent president made a strong case for his reelection &amp;#8212; especially given that the alternative is a man who seeks to overturn the results of democratic elections, who&amp;#8217;s champing at the bit to punish his political enemies and who says immigrants are vermin.&lt;/p&gt;
