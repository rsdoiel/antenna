workers to strike at multiple US warehouses during busy holiday
season</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Amazon.com workers will walk off the job on Thursday morning, in the crucial final days of the holiday season, after union officials said the retailer failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. The strike is a challenge to Amazon&amp;#8217;s operations as it races to fulfill orders during its busiest season of the year, although union-represented facilities represent only about 1% of Amazon&amp;#8217;s hourly workforce. In the New York City area, for example, the company has multiple warehouses and smaller delivery depots. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said unionized workers at facilities in New York City; Skokie, Illinois; Atlanta, San Francisco and southern California will join the picket line to seek contracts guaranteeing better wages and work conditions. The Teamsters union has said it represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the company&amp;#8217;s U.S. facilities. Workers at seven of those facilities will walk out on Thursday, the Teamsters said. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — News junkies will find much to love in “September 5,” a
fictionalized account of ABC’s live coverage of the hostage crisis
during the 1972 Munich Olympics. There are spirited debates about
reporting with only one source, use of words like “terrorism” and what
to do if violence breaks out during a live shot. There are negotiations
with rival networks over satellite usage, disguises and fake badges made
to get reels of 16mm film in and out of the locked down Olympic village
and plenty of confused men (and a few women) trying to keep up with an
ever-escalating situation.</p>

But today, only a few survive. I finally reached my destination, deep in the rugged Pyrenees Mountains. Before me stretched the principality of Andorra.&lt;/p&gt;
