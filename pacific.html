signs order extending China tariff truce by 90 days, White House
says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON &amp;#8212; President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China by another 90 days on Monday, a White House official said, staving off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods as U.S. retailers prepared for the critical end-of-year holiday season. Trump signed an executive order delaying the start of higher tariffs until mid-November shortly after giving reporters a noncommittal answer when asked at a news conference if he planned to keep the lower tariff rates in place. On Sunday, Trump demanded China quadruple its purchases of U.S. soybeans, but it remained unclear whether Beijing had agreed. The tariff truce between Beijing and Washington had been due to expire on Tuesday at 00:01 ET. The timing of the extension until early November buys crucial time for the seasonal autumn surge of imports for the Christmas season, including electronics, apparel and toys at lower tariff rates. The new order prevents U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were set to hit 125% - rates that would have resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. It locks in place &amp;#8212; at least for now &amp;#8212; a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, with Chinese duties on U.S. imports at 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

Raynor. “The better fish recover inside protected areas, the more
attractive they become to poachers.”</p>

service (2)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, updated: 2025-08-10, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT Governor Dennis James C. Mendiola’s path to public service
was not historically significant — except for the fact that he was born
in the Generation X era. He sought the office of the Senate twice and
won in the 2022 election. Since January 2023, he has been serving the
first half of his term as Senate President. The untimely passing of
Governor Arnold I. Palacios catapulted him into the office of Lieutenant
Governor — a process too swift to fully assess his competency for the
role he now occupies.</p>
