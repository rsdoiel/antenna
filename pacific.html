      <h1>Guarding the Public Purse: Accountability Must Begin at Home</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>Letter to the Fono – Part 3</p>
<p><em>Honorable Leaders and Members of the Fono</em>,</p>
<p>In Letter #1, I warned that the Fund cannot survive without honesty about the $13.9 million debt and the principle of fiduciary duty. In Letter #2, I outlined reforms aimed at restoring fairness and sustainability.</p>
<p>This third letter turns to the heart of governance: the budget process itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE ZERO-SUM REALITY</strong></p>
<p>Every year, as the Fono reviews the Administration’s budget, revenues are allocated across competing needs. But revenues are finite. Every dollar directed to one purpose is a dollar denied to another. When pensions, education, or healthcare are shortchanged, it is not because revenues vanished — it is because choices were made.</p>
<p>In this zero-sum reality, government indulgence is paid for by public sacrifice. When the Fono protects its own allowances, travel, or discretionary spending while insisting others “tighten their belts,” it sends a dangerous message: rules for you, exceptions for us.</p>
<p>This contradiction was on full display in recent hearings. The Attorney General was questioned for receiving taxable housing and utility benefits that were merely intended to restore her previous judicial salary. Yet members of the Fono themselves receive a $65,000 “office allowance” — often without actual offices — which they may treat as non-taxable or convert into pensionable compensation. This means legislators effectively enjoy $90,000 to $95,000 in income, while criticizing others for far lesser benefits. That is not accountability; it is hypocrisy.</p>
<p><strong>WHO REVIEWS THE FONO’S BUDGET?</strong></p>
<p>As the Fono meticulously questions the Administration’s departments, the question arises: who applies the same scrutiny to the Fono’s own budget? In practice, the Fono reviews itself. This undermines credibility. Oversight that spares itself but spares no one else is not oversight — it is self-dealing.</p>
<p>Consider also the treatment of the Treasurer. When pressed on the $14 million now owed to the Fund, he was faulted for not recommending that the Governor use ARPA interest earnings to repay the debt. Yet the Treasurer correctly noted that ARPA has its own director, who administers ARPA funds per strict federal guidelines. Instead of addressing the real problem — the government’s chronic failure to meet its obligations — the Senate leadership appears to have shifted blame to one individual. The Treasurer has since been removed from his position.</p>
<p>This pattern — criticizing others for practices that pale next to legislative privileges, or shifting blame away from structural failures — is not accountability. It is narrative manipulation: a repetition of claims designed to distract from reality and make the public question what they see plainly before them.</p>
<p><strong>THE PENSION EQUATION IN CONTEXT</strong></p>
<p>As I reminded in Letter #1: C + I = B + E. Contributions plus investments must equal benefits plus expenses. This equation is universal, not optional. When contributions fall short, investments stagnate, or expenses balloon, the balance is disrupted.</p>
<p>The same truth applies to the government budget. Revenues + Grants = Services +</p>
<p>Obligations. Overspending on operations inevitably starves obligations, such as pensions. That is the disease. Political justifications, temporary stimulus, or creative accounting are only symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY IN ACTION</strong></p>
<p>I urge the Fono to act on five fronts:</p>
<ol>
<li>         Apply equal scrutiny to itself — review legislative allowances, salaries, and pension treatment with the same rigor demanded of the Administration.</li>
<li>         Integrate actuarial evidence into budget law — let contribution rates be driven by actuarial necessity, not political negotiation.</li>
<li>        Prioritize debt repayment — set aside revenues specifically for retiring the $14 million owed, whether through Enterprise (ASPA, ASTCA, others) surpluses, dedicated tax streams, or phased transfers.</li>
<li>         End the Allowance Loophole — Amend the law so that the $65,000 office allowance is treated as salary. This would result in member salaries of $90,000 and leadership salaries of $95,000 — transparent, equitable, and fully taxable, like every other government paycheck. 5. Respect the Separation of Powers — The Senate leadership and legal counsel should focus on their legislative duties and step aside from direct roles in ASGERF governance. The Fund must be overseen independently, free from conflicts of interest, so that trustees can act solely in the best interests of active members, retirees, and beneficiaries. Restoring this separation will strengthen both the Senate and the Fund.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SIGNS OF PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p>It is essential to acknowledge that the Fono has taken some constructive steps during recent hearings. In a House Committee on the Retirement Fund hearing, House leadership corrected the Fund’s Executive Director after he tried to shift blame for the contribution rate increase onto the previous Governor, affirming that it was the Fund itself that asked for higher contributions. House leadership also pressed the Fund’s Vice Chair on my removal, reminding both him and the Executive Director that the Board has no legal authority to terminate a trustee — only the Governor does.</p>
<p>During budget hearings, the Fono also displayed diligence in addressing the</p>
<p>Administration’s flawed submission. The proposed budget blurred the lines between established departments, semi-autonomous authorities, and line agencies, with inconsistent salaries and titles. Faced with this confusion, the Fono worked diligently to request clarifications, sort through the confusion, and adjust salaries in a manner it deemed more consistent and justifiable.</p>
<p>In addition, the House demonstrated proper accountability by paying for the expenses of its Retirement Committee Chairman to attend the recent NCPERS conference. This is as it should be: Fund-related travel by Fono members should be covered by the Fono’s own budget, not the Retirement Fund budget. This practice rightly places responsibility with the legislature and avoids burdening the Fund with costs unrelated to its fiduciary obligations. These examples prove the Fono can exercise oversight when it chooses to. The challenge — and the opportunity — is to apply that same rigor to itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE STAKES</strong></p>
<p>Markets rise and fall — but for three straight fiscal years (ending September 30, 2025), the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have delivered double-digit gains. The Fund, which reflects the performance of the financial markets, has posted positive gains over the past three years. Yet despite these gains, the Fund’s net position has been stagnant for over a decade. The threat is not Wall Street — it is Fagatogo and Utulei.</p>
<p>The promise of retirement is not a favor; it is an earned right. If leaders cannot model accountability, how can they expect the public to make sacrifices?</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Letter #1 called out fiduciary breaches. Letter #2 laid out reforms. Letter #3 makes plain: accountability must begin at home.</p>
<p>The Fono must lead by example. Anything less would betray the trust of those who built this government and still depend on it.</p>

      <p>KINSHASA — Former Democratic Republic of Congo president Joseph Kabila was sentenced to death in absentia on Tuesday by a military court that convicted him of war crimes, treason, and crimes against humanity. The case stems from his alleged role in backing the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in Congo’s volatile east. Kabila, who led Congo from 2001 to 2019, has denied wrongdoing and said the judiciary has been politicized.</p>

      <h1>Trump has lost credibility worldwide, at huge cost</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>Credibility, like trust and a good reputation, is hard to earn, easy to lose. It’s also ruinously expensive once it’s gone, especially in international relations. So it is no small matter that Donald Trump, eight months into his second term as U.S. president, has squandered whatever credibility America had left in foreign and security policy.</p>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The trumped up criminal indictment of former FBI Director Jim Comey, as expressly ordered by the president, is a legal nullity and hopefully will be dispatched by a federal judge. But the damage is done, as Donald Trump has thoroughly corrupted the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em>(September 30, 2025) A State of Emergency has been declared in Samoa, effective from September 30 to October 29, 2025, to authorize the release of funds from the Treasury to address an ongoing economic emergency.</p>
<p>The proclamation was signed on Sept 26 by the Head of State, His Highness Tuimalealiifano Vaaletoa Sualauvi II, and enacted under Article 105 of the Constitution of the Independent State of Samoa.</p>
<p>The use of an Emergency Budget was approved by Cabinet during its first meeting on Sept 17, 2025, the day after the official opening of the 18th Parliament and formal swearing-in of the Prime Minister and newly elected Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>Following Cabinet consultation under directive F.K. (25) 36, Samoa’s Head of State has declared a grave economic emergency, citing threats to the nation’s financial stability due to an internal disturbance. The crisis stems from the government’s inability to lawfully access Treasury funds after Parliament failed to pass an Appropriation Bill for the current financial year.</p>
<p>Since the budget’s collapse in May, the caretaker administration has been operating on just 25% of the previous year’s allocation, approximately $250 million tala, leaving critical services and obligations under strain.</p>
<p>Acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mulipola Anarosa Ale Molio’o last Friday revealed that when the new administration assumed office on Sept 16, available funds for public sector salaries were only sufficient to cover one more week, excluding overtime payments that had already been delayed for several months.</p>
<p>In response, the Government advised the Head of State to invoke Article 105 of the Constitution, enabling emergency access to Treasury funds to ensure salaries are paid and essential operations continue. The Ministry of Finance is now preparing an interim budget to be presented to Parliament, aimed at sustaining government functions until the full national budget is introduced in June 2026.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mulipola told reporters that the current State of Emergency is not expected to extend beyond Oct 29, as Parliament is anticipated to pass a new budget before that date.</p>
<p>She outlined the Cabinet’s funding priorities under the Emergency Budget, which include public sector salaries and overtime, pensions for the elderly, disability benefits, overseas medical referrals, ongoing contractual projects, the national scholarship program, pharmaceutical supplies, core government operations, and agricultural initiatives in Atele and Savaii.</p>

      <p>TONGA AIRPORT UPGRADE</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/tonga_airport.jpg?itok=8zWIQh5W"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/tonga_airport.jpg?itok=xK7j4npM" alt="Tonga airport" /></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Japan is providing Tonga with a US$17.7million airport upgrade.</p>
<p>PMN reported the initial request for the upgrade was made by Tonga in 2022, following a detailed study by Japan. A grant aid of US$17.7m was approved in August for Fua'amotu International Airport in Tongatapu.</p>
<p>The upgrade includes expanding and renovating the passenger terminal building and a passenger boarding air-bridge and elevator.</p>
<p>The international apron will also be expanded.</p>
<p>Japan is also giving Tonga a US$6m e-passport grant.</p>
<p><strong>TAIWAN PROMISE</strong></p>
<p>Taiwan media is reporting a promise to assist Palau in preparing for next year's Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said Taiwan would do so as part of the diplomatic allies prosperity project, to showcase the results of bilateral cooperation to the world.</p>
<p>Lin said Palau is Taiwan's closest diplomatic-ally.</p>
<p>Taiwan has diplomatic relations with 11 UN member states.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Lowy Institute in January, nearly three-quarters of countries supported Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI BRIBERY ARREST</strong></p>
<p>A 41-year-old man has been arrested in Fiji after allegedly trying to bribe a police officer.</p>
<p>The man was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped for a routine check, and is accused of offering FJ$200 to the officer to release the vehicle.</p>
<p>A search resulted in the discovery of dried leaves believed to be marijuana.</p>
<p>The seized substances were sent for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>PALAU ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>Koror State voters in Palau will head to the polls in mid-November to elect members of the state's Legislature and the governor.</p>
<p>The Island Times reported this has been confirmed by the Palau Election Commission</p>
<p>The Legislature is made up of one representative from each hamlet and five at-large seats, totaling 17.</p>
<p>The governor's race will also be on the ballot, with incumbent governor Eyos Rudimch seeking re-election against challenger Alan Marbou, a former contender for the seat.</p>
<p>As of 24 September there were 5,971 registered voters in Koror</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA’S CLIMATE VISION</strong></p>
<p>Samoa has validated its third nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment CEO Lealaisalanoa Frances Brown-Reupena said it's not just a policy exercise but &quot;a shared vision for a resilient, low-carbon Samoa&quot;.</p>
<p>She said Samoa's emissions are less than 0.01 percent of global totals, but by advancing a credible, inclusive, and ambitious NDC, the country strengthens its moral authority in international climate negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>CLIMATE, CONFLICT AND PEACE</strong></p>
<p>Pacific Island leaders took turns addressing the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, speaking on a range of issues — from local to global — that impact their countries.</p>
<p>From stating their positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict to deep sea mining, climate change and plastic pollution, the region's heads of government spoke about the issues that matter most to them and their people.</p>
<p>Samoa Deputy Prime Minister Toelupe Poumulinuku Onesemo said Samoa's geographical isolation and insularity no longer shields or protects it from the increasingly complex and dynamic security challenges.</p>
<p>These challenges include transnational crime especially drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, challenges to sovereignty, growing geopolitical tensions in our region and humanitarian crises.</p>
<p>He said the rules based international system is being bent out of shape.</p>
<p>The deputy prime minister said continuous inaction on climate change means detrimental effects on all aspects of Samoan life.</p>
<p>&quot;Climate change remains the greatest existential threat to Samoa and other Pacific SIDS. Its impacts are more extensively felt by SIDS due to our special circumstances, and the lack of capacity to respond quickly and effectively.&quot;</p>
<p>He said energy is both a driver and accelerator for Samoa's sustainable development ambition.</p>
<p>He noted digital transformation — including AI and data analytics — offer real opportunities to drive an inclusive, just energy transition, particularly through off-grid solutions and smarter energy planning.</p>
<p>&quot;However, Samoa's level of indebtedness, often worsened by natural disasters, remains a pressing challenge.&quot;</p>
