<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Photography has been a crucial part of volcano monitoring in Hawaii going back to the start of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. In 1911, Frank Perret spent a summer capturing stunning black and white photos of Kilauea&amp;#8217;s summit lava lake in Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u crater. Fast forward a century, and webcams are scattered across the island, snapping images of the volcanoes 24/7 in 4K resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
