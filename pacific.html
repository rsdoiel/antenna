<h2 id="sails-plots-a-course-for-its-future">500 Sails plots a course
for its future</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, updated: 2024-11-14, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>WITH an entire decade of experience under its hulls, 500 Sails is set
to continue sailing into new horizons as a nonprofit organization.
 Incorporated in 2014, 500 Sails has since set up a boatyard facility in
Lower Base to locally fabricate sailing canoes, among other notable
accomplishments. In Susupe, it has the Guma Sakman—literally “canoe
house” in Chamorro—where their completed canoes are stored in between
programmatic activities. On top of that are many community activities
that build on the group’s original vision to revive the seafaring
traditions of the islands.To celebrate its 10-year milestone, 500 Sails
hosted a celebratory gala last November 15 at the Crowne Plaza Resort
Saipan.  According to the organization’s CEO, Milton “Junior” Coleman,
“big dreams” moving forward for the organization include building the
sailing capacity of island residents, voyages well beyond the Saipan
Lagoon, and creating around 20 new canoes—all in support of 500 Sails’
strategic mission to “revive, promote, and preserve the maritime
cultural traditions of the Marianas Islands through community engagement
in canoe culture values and activities.”  In a November 13 interview,
Coleman told Marianas Variety that 500 Sails is connecting with
organizations in the CNMI and beyond in order to encourage more island
residents to sail these waters.For example, the Northern Marianas
College announced on November 8 that it was offering the Basic
Traditional Seamanship Lalayak Certificate Program starting November 23.
 The 10-week course teaches participants to sail Chamorro canoes and
offers “both historical insights and hands-on skills that have guided
seafarers for generations,” a news release states.500 Sails is
organizing programs in order to create more large canoes that can be
used for voyages to Pagan or Taiwan, Coleman said. As part of the
development of these canoes, capacity building would go hand in hand
with canoe building.“That would be the ultimate goal—to continue to
build skilled sailors to get the skills and learn how to operate the
vessels so when the longer voyages come around we can see from a larger
pool of people who may be interested in doing different legs,” he said.
“We have big goals to sail to Taiwan and Japan, really reconnecting with
the ancestral lands.”Coleman adds that in the near future, perhaps this
coming year, 500 Sails will be testing out a double-hull canoe
configuration by lashing together their leklek—or 26-foot-long canoes.
The organization has four lekleks, and the results of the experiments
will guide them on how to design and build large double-hulled canoes.
These double-hulled vessels could be in excess of 40 feet in length and
would be used for interisland transportation or cargo
ferrying.Additionally, 500 Sails hopes to create enough leklek-sized
canoes to support the hotel industry; plans may include giving tourists
rides around the Saipan Lagoon.  As the organization turns 10, 500 Sails
co-founder Emma Perez is feeling “happy, optimistic, and grateful.”
 She’s looking most forward to “well-paying culturally based jobs on the
water for sailors and captains on traditional sailing canoes [that
offer] rides for visitors, transportation, and cargo between our Mariana
Islands.”Of the various programs 500 Sails has operated in the past
decade, the three she’s most proud of are the Gamsun Project, which
teaches teens to swim in order to obtain lifeguard certification
courses; the Sirena Project, an all-female swim class held weekly at the
Guma Sakman; and Lalayak, the organization’s in-house sailing course.
 Coleman says that learning to sail is character development,
underscoring the value of the organization’s work.“I’ve seen the value
of gaining these kinds of skills to help you in other aspects of your
life,” he said. “It will help you in every part of your life. …You have
better focus and [will] be more appreciative of the environment and
nature. And also, on a canoe, the people on board have to operate like a
family. Everybody has to take care of each other, help each other out.
We can use those same skills to nurture our children and strengthen our
families so our voyage in life will be successful. It will make them a
better person and help them be proud of our Chamorro and Carolinian
heritage and just elevate all of these islands to the level that our
ancestors were, where they lived in harmony with nature and they
survived for a very long time because they had deep respect for this
place.”Congratulations on 10 years of impacting the community, 500
Sails!</p>

<h2 id="the-canoes-of-500-sails">The canoes of 500 Sails</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, updated: 2024-11-14, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>CANOES are at the heart of 500 Sails’ organization. The nonprofit was
established in 2014 and has since sought to make canoes a part of the
everyday lives of the people of the Marianas.According to its
organizational strategic plan, 500 Sails’ name was inspired by the
arrival of the Spanish galleon San Pedro in Guam in 1565. The vessel was
met at sea and escorted to the coast by hundreds of Chamorro sailing
canoes. An observer on the San Pedro that day wrote that he counted
400-500 canoes around the ship.500 Sails creates canoes on Saipan at its
boatyard in Lower Base based on the “Anson Drawing,” which is a document
that records the dimensions of one of the last known Chamorro sailing
canoes, captured off the coast of Tinian in 1742 by the crew of British
Commodore George Anson.500 Sails has the following vessels in its
fleet:1. Che’luChe’lu is a true sakman. These days, the word sakman has
come to encompass every Chamorro sailing canoe, but in the historic
record it refers to oceangoing canoes that are between 40 and 50 feet
long. Che’lu is 47 feet long. Her name means “sibling” in Chamorro. Her
story begins in 2006 when Pete Perez, of Sakman Chamorro, Inc. on
Saipan, and Mario Reyes Borja, of Che’lu, Inc. in San Diego, decided to
combine their efforts to build a sakman based on the 1742 “Anson
Drawing” of a Chamorro canoe. Sakman Chamorro contributed research and
funding to start the build that was led by Mario Borja, an expert
carpenter and engineer. The canoe was built in San Diego, California in
2011 from a redwood log, with plenty of “happy labor” from the Chamorro
community there. Che’lu has participated in the Festival of the Pacific
Arts and Culture in Guam in 2016 and in Hawaii in 2024. Having called
San Diego, Guam, and now Saipan home, Che’lu has huge cultural and
historic significance to Chamorros throughout the Marianas and the
Diaspora.2. NeniNeni is 500 Sails’ first locally built canoe and the
first Chamorro sailing canoe on Saipan for hundreds of years. She is 26
feet long with a main hull and outrigger hull made of fiberglass lashed
to bamboo spars. In Micronesia, canoes are traditionally made of lemmai
and other wood, but 500 Sails wanted to build many canoes fast and
economically, so the decision was made to use modern materials. Neni was
mostly fabricated in New Zealand by a 500 Sails crew from Saipan and
Guam under the direction of yacht builder Derek Kelsall. After the canoe
was completed on Saipan, Neni was carried into the water by island youth
where she touched water for the first time, alongside the Carolinian
canoe Makalili Teenager. Neni was sailed for the first time by the crew
that built her. The word “neni” means “baby” in Chamorro. She’s 500
Sails’ “first-born child.”3. Richard SemanRichard Seman is named after
the late former lawmaker and Secretary of the Department of Lands and
Natural Resources. Mr. Seman was an early supporter of 500 Sails and
helped the organization secure the warehouse in Lower Base that houses
the 500 Sails boatyard. He also secured the Guma Sakman, 500 Sails’
canoe house, on the beach at Civic Center. When Mr. Seman passed away
suddenly and unexpectedly, the organization named its second locally
built canoe in his honor. Richard Seman has the distinction of being the
first 500 Sails canoe fabricated entirely on Saipan. The 500 Sails
Boatyard that Mr. Seman helped secure has been the birthplace of all
subsequent canoes in the fleet.4. Anaguan500 Sails’ third 26-foot canoe,
Anaguan, was commissioned by the Indigenous Affairs Office and named to
honor the ancient village of Anaguan that once stood near the shore in
Garapan. The remains of 700 Chamorro individuals were unearthed at the
Anaguan village site during the construction of Imperial Pacific
International’s casino. When the remains of the villagers were
reinterred, the community held an hours-long burial ceremony, after
which Anaguan was among four Chamorro canoes that symbolically sailed
from the shore with the spirts of the deceased.5. Aunty ObaThe
26-foot-long canoe Aunty Oba is named after the late Jacoba Seman, who
lived near the shoreline in Susupe, just north of the Guma Sakman.
Ms. Seman was also known as “Oba.” When she passed, her family requested
the new canoe be named in her honor. This beautiful canoe features a red
stripe painted beneath its gunwale and black and red ocean motifs that
are based on pottery designs from the pre-Latte Era of Marianas history.
The motifs call to mind ocean waves. Her outrigger is also painted
black, white, and red—the colors of Chamorro canoes, according to
historical records. On both mata of Aunty Oba (the front part of the
canoe) is an illustration of a Chamorro woman—from the oldest known
drawn portrait of a Chamorro. Sailors on Aunty Oba have remarked that
the canoe picks up speed whenever they pass Aunty Oba’s house!6. Dee
Dee500 Sails transitioned into a new phase of building with Dee Dee,
their first 15-foot canoe—one that can easily be sailed by one person.
Chamorros were noted in the historic record as having specific models of
canoes of various lengths. Dee Dee’s design is based on the description
of a small Chamorro sailing canoe called a “duding.” The canoe is named
in memory of the late Deloris Perez, the mother of the boat’s designer
and builder, Pete Perez.7. AnimuyiAnimuyi is the second “duding” built
by 500 Sails. The canoe was commissioned by James and Penelope
Hofschneider, who share the canoe for use in 500 Sails’ community
programs. Like Aunty Oba, Animuyi’s hull is beautifully painted. Animuyi
also has some design changes that grew from experience in sailing Dee
Dee. The canoe was displayed for a time in the lobby of the Bank of
Saipan as part of an exhibit of Chamorro and Carolinian maritime
traditions, followed by a public ceremony that ended with members of the
canoe sailing community carrying Animuyi to the lagoon for her launch.8.
Den Yo PoviDen YoPovi is 500 Sails’ newest “duding.” It is owned by
long-time 500 Sails volunteer and lifelong peskadot and talayeru,
Jeremiah Benavente. The canoe reflects his Chamorro and Native American
heritage. Like her predecessors, Den Yo Povi is a Chamorro-designed
vessel; however, Benavente personally painted the canoe with designs and
motifs that reflect his mother’s Hopi heritage. In his mother’s
language, Den Yo Povi means “blue spruce blossom.”9. MikaelaMikaela is
500 Sail’s first Carolinian canoe. Its builder is master navigator Mario
Benito, of Poluwat. He and his family members, alongside 500 Sails
staff, crafted Mikaela. At 22 feet long, Mikaela follows the design
lines of the voyaging canoe Mikael that was built by Mario’s
grandfather. Mikaela’s hull and outrigger are built of modern fiberglass
materials, while its spars, mast, and boom are made of wood. Mikaela was
launched just in time to join the 13th Festival of the Pacific Arts and
Culture in Hawaii.10. LadahaoLadahao’s journey into the 500 Sails fleet
is unique. This 41-foot canoe is made of aviation plywood and fiberglass
and was fabricated in 1968 in Chicago, Illinois. At that time, the
boat’s name was Roberta L. It was fabricated by steelworkers who wanted
to win a 330-mile yacht race in the Great Lakes. Upon researching fast
boat designs, they came across the Anson Drawing, built the canoe, and
entered the canoe in the race. With a top speed of over 30 miles per
hour, Roberta L beat the second-place boat by five hours. Nearly 50
years later, the canoe showed up for sale on Craigslist. The owner
agreed to donate the canoe to 500 Sails so that it could be restored and
sailed in Chamorro waters. After the restoration, the canoe got a
second, Chamorro name, Ladahao, after a Chamorro Magalahi, or chief, on
Saipan who was noted for his valor in the Chamorro-Spanish Wars.</p>
