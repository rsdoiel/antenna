      <p>
      (BPT) - In this era of instant communication and hyperconnected social media, you might think everyone feels connected to everyone else. Unfortunately, that's not the case. According to a new global study from LG on social connection, 68% of people find it harder to make real friends, and 1/3 reported having one or fewer meaningful connections in the past month — with 8% experiencing none at all. In the survey, 9 in 10 respondents also believe meaningful connections lead to a more optimistic outlook on life.

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; When President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki in 2018, the pair alarmed allies with a friendly encounter where Trump sided with the Russian leader over his own intelligence agencies on election interference. Trump flies to a meeting in Alaska with Putin today in a different public mood - impatient with the Russian&#8217;s unwillingness to negotiate an end to his war in Ukraine and angry over missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. The world is waiting to see if it will be this tougher version of Trump who shows up in Anchorage or if it will be the former real estate tycoon who has sought to ingratiate himself with the wily former KGB agent in the past.</p>

      <h1>Trump signs order extending China tariff truce by 90 days, White House says</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: <a href="https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2025/08/12/nation-world-news/trump-signs-order-extending-china-tariff-truce-by-90-days-white-house-says/">Hawaii Tribune Harold</a>)
      <p>
      
				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China by another 90 days on Monday, a White House official said, staving off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods as U.S. retailers prepared for the critical end-of-year holiday season. Trump signed an executive order delaying the start of higher tariffs until mid-November shortly after giving reporters a noncommittal answer when asked at a news conference if he planned to keep the lower tariff rates in place. On Sunday, Trump demanded China quadruple its purchases of U.S. soybeans, but it remained unclear whether Beijing had agreed. The tariff truce between Beijing and Washington had been due to expire on Tuesday at 00:01 ET. The timing of the extension until early November buys crucial time for the seasonal autumn surge of imports for the Christmas season, including electronics, apparel and toys at lower tariff rates. The new order prevents U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from shooting up to 145%, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods were set to hit 125% - rates that would have resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries. It locks in place &#8212; at least for now &#8212; a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, with Chinese duties on U.S. imports at 10%.</p>

      <h1>A humble path to public service (2)</h1>

      LIEUTENANT Governor Dennis James C. Mendiola’s path to public service was not historically significant — except for the fact that he was born in the Generation X era. He sought the office of the Senate twice and won in the 2022 election. Since January 2023, he has been serving the first half of his term as Senate President. The untimely passing of Governor Arnold I. Palacios catapulted him into the office of Lieutenant Governor — a process too swift to fully assess his competency for the role he now occupies.

      ON Thursday, Aug. 7 at 12:45 noon, IT&amp;E encountered a service-related issue that intermittently affected our landline customers, and those calling our customers, in the CNMI. Specifically, customers were having difficulty making and receiving calls from landline phones. As of 5:30 p.m., the issue was resolved, and landline services have been fully restored. Internet and mobile services were not affected and continue to operate normally.

      DURING the recent storm surge caused by Tropical Storm Krosa significant erosion and flooding occurred along Micro Beach.  During this event old foundations were broken apart exposing WWII unexploded ordnance.  DFEMS was alerted, the area of concern has been cordoned off, and an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team will be arriving to assess and remove anything that poses a danger to the community.
