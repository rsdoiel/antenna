<p>By</p>
<p>Captain Katy Manning</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Australian Army vocalist Musician Miella Sartori sang in Samoa with US and Canadian musicians during Exercise Pacific Partnership 2025.</p>
<p>A Townsville native, she usually sings with the band of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR).</p>
<p>For Pacific Partnership 2025, she joined a multinational band in Samoa, sharing music across schools, local communities and at the National University of Samoa, where crowds sang and danced along to every song.</p>
<p>“Our days here are really beautiful,” Musician Sartori said.</p>
<p>“We get to do lots of community engagements, and people are so warm and welcoming.”</p>
<p>She described the mission as not just performing but connecting with people and collaborating with international partners.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to see how music brings everyone together, no matter where you are,” Musician Sartori said.</p>
<p>“Working alongside American and Canadian musicians, sharing songs with local communities and seeing people join in really shows the power of music and how that connects us.</p>
<p>“My highlight here supporting Pacific Partnership was performing for the Samoa Victim Support Group at the Campus of Hope.”</p>
<p>The children’s joy and energy left a lasting impression, showing how music can lift spirits and bring people together.</p>
<p>She said learning a few Samoan songs made those moments even more special, as audiences would light up and join in.</p>
<p>“It’s not just performing – it’s about connecting. You give energy and it comes right back to you. That’s what makes it so special.”</p>
<p>Musician Sartori said she was proud to represent Australia while sharing music and seeing the difference the mission makes.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s really incredible to be part of this,” she said.</p>

      <p>AEDES MOSQUITOES WORKSHOPS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/aedes_mosquito.jpg?itok=9aMvyKQf"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/aedes_mosquito.jpg?itok=MkWrAmod" alt="Aedes mosquito"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Health leaders from 16 Pacific countries gathered in Honiara earlier this month for a workshop on Aedes mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes carry dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya.</p>
<p>PMN reports the training was part of the Pacific Mosquito Surveillance Strengthening for Impact program.</p>
<p>Participants did field work, lab analysis, and strategy planning so they could return home better prepared.</p>
<p>A long-term goal of the workshop is to build up regional health security, by sharing data on mosquito populations and how they respond to insecticides.</p>
<p>Dr Nemia Bainivalu from the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health says mosquito-borne diseases are re-emerging threats, intensified by climate change, rapid urbanization, and increased human mobility.</p>
<p>Multiple people have died from dengue fever in the region this year.</p>
<p><strong>CNMI MOURNS PASSING</strong></p>
<p>A long-serving lawmaker of the Northern Marianas, Diego Tenorio Benavente, has died aged 66.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with acute leukemia about three months ago.</p>
<p>Pacific Daily News reported Benavente was first elected into office in 1989 as a member of the CNMI House of Representatives.</p>
<p>He served for six consecutive terms — three of those as House speaker.</p>
<p>Benavente was elected lieutenant governor in 2001.</p>
<p>The CNMI's delegate to Congress, Kimberlyn King-Hinds, said Benavente was an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>She said they remember &quot;a pioneer whose strength, vision, and heart shaped our community for the better&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>FIJI PM SHIFTS GOVT</strong></p>
<p>Fiji's Prime Minister says it's his prerogative to choose who stands in for him while he is overseas.</p>
<p>Sitiveni Rabuka was responding to questions from the Fiji Times about why the deputy prime minister, Viliame Gavoka, was not chosen as acting PM while Rabuka was in Japan.</p>
<p>Rabuka's nephew, Filimoni Vosarogo, the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, was acting Prime Minister instead.</p>
<p>The query follows recent shifts in the coalition government leadership, leaving Gavoka as the sole deputy prime minister.</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA PM DEFENDS OBSERVER BAN</strong></p>
<p>Samoa's prime minister has defended the decision to ban the Samoa Observer from press conferences in response to a joint letter from two media organisations.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands News Association and the Pacific Freedom Forum have urged La'aulialemalietoa Polataivao Schmidt to reverse the ban.</p>
<p>A statement from the office of the Prime Minister acknowledged concerns raised by the media watchdogs.</p>
<p>It said the criticism was 'respected and understood' but urged them &quot;to seek full information before forming conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>It said &quot;this is not a ban on media freedom — it is a response to persistent unprofessional and unethical conduct.&quot;</p>
<p>It added that the action taken relates solely to the Samoa Observer.</p>

      <h1>Indigenous chefs connect through kai at WIPCE</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)

      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/foraging.jpeg?itok=tcyB2Ixj"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/foraging.jpeg?itok=zDQc2Fyd" alt="indigenous educators "></a></p>
<p>By</p>
<p>by Pokere Paewai, RNZ Maori issues reporter</p>
<p>November 19, 2025 — A collective of indigenous chefs are using WIPCE as a springboard for cultural connection through kai.</p>
<p>The group includes Māori chefs Kārena and Kasey Bird, Joe McLeod and Kia Kanuta, as well as Hawaiian Kealoha Domingo, Native American Crystal Wahpepah and Samoan Henry Onesemo.</p>
<p>Nearly 4000 delegates from indigenous nations around the world have descended on Auckland for the education conference held once every three years.</p>
<p>Chef Joe McLeod told RNZ the idea to collaborate was born at a food festival in Hawai'i where the Hawaiian chefs suggested showcasing their kai [food] together at WIPCE.</p>
<p>&quot;So, it's a partnership between New Zealand, Hawai'i, Canada, Australia, Samoa, Tonga... There's only a handful of us for now, so we're kick-starting this group to hopefully expand it out over time as we progress moving forward. But the whole purpose of the kaupapa is to show off the best of our cultural food. Our culinary cultural identity.&quot;</p>
<p>The events the collective is running at WIPCE include an exclusive dinner where international chefs were paired with Māori chefs to create dishes like Kangaroo Laab, roasted turkey and Hapuka Hinu-kōhue.</p>
<p>The dinner was sold out but McLeod said in &quot;typical Māori&quot; fashion he added an extra four seats for his whānau.</p>
<p>It hasn't all gone to plan as well with some of the suitcases not making it on to the plane, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So, it's been a real dog's breakfast of a nightmare trying to sort it out. So, I don't think we're going to get the food that's part of their luggage that was supposed to come over yesterday with our guests coming over from Hawaii.&quot;</p>
<p>McLeod said meeting for WIPCE was the first time the collective had all met each other, so he thanked the conference for kick starting the journey.</p>
<p>It's just the start of the initiative and he is hopeful it will continue to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been in the industry almost 56 years, so this is not new to me, but to our young ones coming through, oh mate, it's stunning to watch them get all excited like how I used to 50 years ago. But my role now is mainly kaumātua rangatira, leader, and someone who can open a lot of doors for the next generation.&quot;</p>
<p>McLeod said that is his gift to the next generation of Māori chefs, to open doors for them once they decide where their vision lies.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Chef Kealoha Domingo told RNZ it's &quot;been nothing short of amazing&quot; to connect with the other chefs.</p>
<p>Domingo said he is fortunate to have fallen into the role of reconnecting indigenous people in Hawai'i with their traditional foods.</p>
<p>&quot;It's motivating me to continue the work and to connect with other people who are doing the same, to just build the bonds and build the strength and, you know, increase everything exponentially as the network grows.&quot;</p>
<p>The Chefs also had the chance to visit Velskov native forest farm in the Waitākere Ranges, ostensibly to relax amongst the hustle of WIPCE but also a chance for the international chefs to forage for native plants.</p>
<p>Head of Tourism at Tātaki Auckland Unlimited Karen Thompson-Smith said Velskov is a fantastic new venture that allows tourists to learn a little bit more about kai Māori.</p>
<p>It's fantastic to see indigenous chefs from around the world visit Auckland and be able to utilise local produce, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Auckland is a melting pot. We have so many different cultures that make up Auckland. So we've got this incredible, different cuisine that's been built on the back of our indigenous people being the Māori people and how they prepare their food.</p>
<p>&quot;There's this real cross-pollination coming through. And what we're seeing in our food scene here in Auckland is just this development of different food offerings.&quot;</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape says his government will not remain silent on human rights concerns affecting Melanesians, including the people of West Papua, and has consistently raised these matters with Indonesia.</p>
<p>Mr Marape said PNG’s foreign policy “is not being overshadowed or manipulated by Indonesia” and that concerns over alleged human rights abuses in West Papua have been communicated in multiple bilateral and regional meetings over the years.</p>

<p>The Utu Health Centre, serving 14 wards across the Ambenob and Transgogol Local Level Governments in Madang District, has received a graceful donation valued at K12,000 through a partnership-driven initiative.</p>
<p>On November 24th, the Madang Rural Development Foundation (MRDF), led by Managing Director Mr. Kurere Matanzana, officially handed over a solar lighting system and essential skin disease medical supplies to the facility. This is a transformative step for the health centre, which has long operated off-grid, severely limiting its operational hours and critical functions.</p>

      <p>AEDES MOSQUITOES WORKSHOPS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/mosquito.jpg?itok=PDbeZKLH"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/mosquito.jpg?itok=w2qxDYi2" alt="Aedes mosquito"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Health leaders from 16 Pacific countries gathered in Honiara earlier this month for a workshop on Aedes mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes carry dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya.</p>
<p>PMN reports the training was part of the Pacific Mosquito Surveillance Strengthening for Impact program.</p>
<p>Participants did field work, lab analysis, and strategy planning so they could return home better prepared.</p>
<p>A long-term goal of the workshop is to build up regional health security, by sharing data on mosquito populations and how they respond to insecticides.</p>
<p>Dr Nemia Bainivalu from the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health says mosquito-borne diseases are re-emerging threats, intensified by climate change, rapid urbanization, and increased human mobility.</p>
<p>Multiple people have died from dengue fever in the region this year.</p>
<p><strong>CNMI MOURNS PASSING</strong></p>
<p>A long-serving lawmaker of the Northern Marianas, Diego Tenorio Benavente, has died aged 66.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with acute leukemia about three months ago.</p>
<p>Pacific Daily News reported Benavente was first elected into office in 1989 as a member of the CNMI House of Representatives.</p>
<p>He served for six consecutive terms — three of those as House speaker.</p>
<p>Benavente was elected lieutenant governor in 2001.</p>
<p>The CNMI's delegate to Congress, Kimberlyn King-Hinds, said Benavente was an extraordinary man.</p>
<p>She said they remember &quot;a pioneer whose strength, vision, and heart shaped our community for the better&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Fiji PM SHIFTS GOVT</strong></p>
<p>Fiji's Prime Minister says it's his prerogative to choose who stands in for him while he is overseas.</p>
<p>Sitiveni Rabuka was responding to questions from the Fiji Times about why the deputy prime minister, Viliame Gavoka, was not chosen as acting PM while Rabuka was in Japan.</p>
<p>Rabuka's nephew, Filimoni Vosarogo, the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, was acting Prime Minister instead.</p>
<p>The query follows recent shifts in the coalition government leadership, leaving Gavoka as the sole deputy prime minister.</p>
<p><strong>SAMOA PM DEFENDS OBSERVER BAN</strong></p>
<p>Samoa's prime minister has defended the decision to ban the Samoa Observer from press conferences in response to a joint letter from two media organisations.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands News Association and the Pacific Freedom Forum have urged La'aulialemalietoa Polataivao Schmidt to reverse the ban.</p>
<p>A statement from the office of the Prime Minister acknowledged concerns raised by the media watchdogs.</p>
<p>It said the criticism was 'respected and understood' but urged them &quot;to seek full information before forming conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>It said &quot;this is not a ban on media freedom - it is a response to persistent unprofessional and unethical conduct.&quot;</p>
<p>It added that the action taken relates solely to the Samoa Observer.</p>

<p>During the delivery of the 2026 Budget in Parliament today, Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey pointedly attributed the inherited budget deficit to former Prime Minister Peter O’Neill.</p>
<p>Treasurer Stuckey highlighted that, despite record levels of revenue and relatively low budget expenditures, the country faces a budget deficit of K1,607 million.</p>
<p>He explained that the government is still spending about K150 more per person than the country’s revenue.</p>
<p>Stuckey acknowledged that opposition critics believe this deficit is too high but emphasized that it has improved significantly compared to the inherited situation.</p>
<p>“This K150 per person deficit is better than the K520 per person deficit inherited from the Other Guy,” referring to O’Neill.</p>
<p>He further noted that the deficit per person under O’Neill was 250% higher than in the 2026 Budget.</p>
<p>The Treasurer confirmed that this high deficit figure was verified through thorough work, including assessments by international partners such as the IMF, which uncovered discrepancies in previous budgets.</p>
<p>Stuckey also criticized the previous administration for misusing the expected benefits of the PNG LNG project, which came online in 2014.</p>
<p>He accused O’Neill’s government of wasting this resource’s potential, citing the 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) as evidence.</p>

      <p>HAWAIIAN VAKA MAKES HISTORIC RETURN TO NZ</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Hawaiian vaka was on display for people to see at Mangonui's main wharf in Northland this past Sunday.</p>
<p>Hikianalia is accompanying vaka Hōkūleʻa to take part in celebrations to mark 40 years since Hōkūleʻa visited.</p>
<p>It sparked the revival of building ocean-going vaka and traditional navigation, led by <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2018820446/sir-hek-busby-he-was-the-bridge-builder-of-oceania">the late Sir Hek Busby</a>.</p>
<p>Hikianalia was on display until 2pm, and then headed to a dry dock in Auckland for maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>CRITICAL ASSESSMENT UNDERWAY FOR PNG'S CONJOINED TWINS</strong></p>
<p>A medical team from Australia is in Papua New Guinea assessing tiny conjoined twins who are fighting for survival.</p>
<p>The parents of six-week-old Tom and Sawong are desperate for their boys to be surgically separated, despite previous medical advice against it.</p>
<p>The twins, whose combined weight is only 2.9kg, were born in Morobe province on 9 October, joined at the abdomen.</p>
<p>They were flown by helicopter to Port Moresby General Hospital, where they received basic care in the neo-natal unit for five weeks.</p>
<p>Doctors had explored the possibility of flying them to Sydney for specialist care, but various plans fell through.</p>
<p>The hospital then did a u-turn earlier this month and advised the parents to stay in PNG, or risk one of both of them dying.</p>
<p>The family launched a global appeal for help and a week ago, the twins were moved to an intensive care unit at Paradise Private Hospital.</p>

<p><strong>PUBLIC REMINDED TO WEAR SEAT BELTS</strong></p>
<p>Drivers are being urged to wear their seat belts after car crashes that took the lives of two women and nearly killed another.</p>
<p>None of them were buckled up during the incidents on Oahu and Maui over the past week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Co%20%22https:/www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Kyra Anne Tyquiengco, 29, was killed on the H-3 Freeway</a> Thursday evening, after a 19-year-old driver rear-ended her.</p>
<p>Tyquiengco became Oahu’s 75th traffic death of the year, compared to 43 at the same time last year. She was not wearing a seat belt during the time of the collision.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate, especially this time of year. It happens, but it doesn’t have to happen as long as you take the proper safety precautions. Cars nowadays have tremendous safety features that are built in, but they don’t work if you don’t use them,” retired Maui Police Department traffic commander Lt. William Hankins said.</p>
<p>In light of Tyquiengco’s death, Hankins is reminding drivers to keep themselves and others safe.</p>
<p>“Simple things as far as buckling up your seat belt, staying off your phone, staying sober when you’re driving, following the speed limit,” Hankins added. “The basic things that you’re supposed to do will help keep you alive.”</p>
<p>On Maui last Saturday, <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/17/woman-dies-after-single-vehicle-crash-maui/%22%20%5Co%20%22https:/www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/17/woman-dies-after-single-vehicle-crash-maui/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Hilalia Villanueva-Langi, 21, lost her life in a rollover crash</a> in Kula.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Co%20%22https:/www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/11/22/woman-critically-injured-after-partial-rollover-crash/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">on Friday in the same district, an 84-year-old woman</a> had life-threatening injuries in yet another rollover collision.</p>
<p>Neither of the drivers was wearing a seat belt.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest things that people need to be aware of with crashes and not wearing your seat belt is the likelihood, and especially in a rollover, of you getting thrown out the vehicle is extremely high,” Hankins said.</p>
<p>Hankins also explained that wearing a seat belt could be particularly crucial in a rollover, when someone could be ejected.</p>

<p><strong>PROBE LAUNCHED INTO POLICE BRIBE VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>A video circulating on social media showing a Samoa police officer receiving money from a driver at a roadside checkpoint has sparked debate in Samoa and prompted the Acting Police Commissioner to order an investigation.</p>
<p>The footage has been widely shared across Facebook and TikTok, with some users claiming the exchange reflects a “common practice” in Samoa, while others argue the driver, not the officer, is at fault.</p>
<p>Acting Police Commissioner Leiataua Samuelu Afamasaga confirmed the video had been brought to his attention but said investigators are still trying to determine key details, including when and where it was filmed.</p>
<p>“People sent it to me (the video), asking if I know this incident. That type of behaviour is unacceptable,” he said. “But if you look closely, it’s also an allegation against the person who tried to give the money to the police officer.” The video shows a driver handing $10 to a uniformed officer.</p>
<p>Leiataua said he had seen the video online and had no confirmed information on when or where it was recorded. “We don’t know if this is yesterday, today, last year, or even 10 years ago,” he said.</p>
<p>Leiataua confirmed that accepting money in this manner is improper. “But the police officer accepted that money, which he should not have accepted,” he said.</p>
<p>Leiataua also noted that identifying the people in the video is difficult. “There’s no clear face of the driver or our officer. They never show his face. People post it online to generate negative opinions about our service,” he said.</p>
<p>The commissioner said the investigation would determine whether the act constitutes bribery or misconduct. “If the investigation comes back and he did accept it and it’s bribery, then we file a criminal charge,” Leiataua explained. “If I’m not satisfied with the evidence for a criminal charge, then we charge him with misconduct.”</p>
<p>The video has been widely shared across social media this week, attracting significant attention. Some viewers have described it as a “common practice in Samoa,” while others have defended the police, suggesting the &quot;driver is at fault.&quot;</p>
<p>Leiataua did not confirm the location of the checkpoint or whether he is familiar with the area shown in the video.</p>

<p>However, those who are in the employment sector face great challenges as well.</p>

<p>Specific information on joining the meeting, instructions for connecting to the Webex and providing oral public comments during the meeting will be posted on the Council website at: <a href="http://www.wpcouncil.org/event/205th-council-meeting-virtual-2">www.wpcouncil.org/event/205th-council-meeting-virtual-2</a>.</p>
<p>The Council will consider and may take action on the issues summarized below, including any public comments on them. Written public comments on final action items should be received by the Council's executive director by 5 p.m. (HST), Thursday, December 11, 2025, via postal mail, fax or email as indicated at end of the end of the article.</p>
<p>Summary of Action Items at the 205th Council Meeting</p>
<p>1. ACL Specifications for CNMI BMUS for 2026 to 2029 (Final Action)</p>
<p>At its 203rd meeting in June 2025, the Council received the 2025 Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) bottomfish management unit species (BMUS) stock  assessment update (Bohaboy and Matthews 2025) that found the fishery was not overfished or  experiencing overfishing. The stock assessment was updated with boat-based creel survey  interviews from 2018 to 2023. The Council accepted it as the best scientific information  available on the status of the fishery and directed staff to develop potential acceptable biological  catches (ABCs) and annual catch limits (ACLs) for initial action at the 204 t h  meeting.</p>
<p>The current ACL and annual catch target (ACT) for fishing years 2024 to 2025 were  specified at a 39% and 34% risk of overfishing, respectively. This accounts for the assessment  information, uncertainty characterization, stock status, productivity and susceptibility and the  social, economic, ecological and management uncertainties related to the CNMI BMUS fishery.  The catch associated with the ACL and ACT is 82,000 pounds and 75,000 pounds, respectively.  The average catch from the commercial and non-commercial sectors in fishing years 2021 to 2023 was 44,054 pounds, which is 54% of the ACL.</p>
<p>At its 205th meeting, the Council will consider taking final action on an alternative to specify ACLs and accountability measures (AMs) for the CNMI BMUS fishery for fishing years  2026 to 2029.  The Council will consider the following  alternatives:</p>
<p>No Action, do not specify ACLs and AMs</p>
<p>2.        Status quo, specify an ACL and ACT of 82,000 lbs and 74,000 lbs (Langseth et  al. 2019)</p>
<p>3.        Specify ACL (72,000 lbs) and ACT (66,000 lbs) based on the revised P* and  SEEM scores (P*=40% and 35%) (  Preliminary Preferred  )</p>
<p>4.        Specify ACL (&lt;72,000 lbs) and ACT (&lt;66,000 lbs) below the revised P* and  SEEM scores (P*&lt;40% and 35%)</p>
<p>Recommendations for Commercial Fishing Regulations in the Pacific Islands Heritage</p>
<p>On April 17, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Presidential Proclamation 10918,</p>
<p>“Unleashing American Commercial Fishing in the Pacific,” in which the President found that</p>
<p>“managed commercial fishing would not put objects of scientific and historic interest within the  PRIMNM at risk” and that “a prohibition on commercial fishing is not, at this time, necessary for  the proper care and management of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument</p>
<p>(PRIMNM, since changed to Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument via  Presidential Memorandum January 2, 2025) or the objects of historic or scientific interest  therein.” The Proclamation states that the Secretary of Commerce shall not prohibit commercial fishing within 50-200 nm of the boundaries of the monument.  It also directs the Secretary of Commerce, through NOAA, to expeditiously publish new proposed rules in the  Federal Register  to amend or repeal all burdensome regulations that restrict commercial fishing in the PRIMNM.</p>
<p>In order to meet the Proclamation, NOAA will need to publish new proposed rules regarding commercial fishing in the expanded areas of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine  National Monument (PIHMNM) including Wake and Johnston Atolls and Jarvis Island.  Fishing  regulations are promulgated through the process described in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act, and therefore the Council may provide recommendations on RAMNM, PMNM, and MTMNM in order to expedite the process.  The Council will review options that may include:</p>
<p>1. No Action - Do not remove commercial fishing prohibitions;</p>
<p>2. Restore commercial fishing by removing existing prohibitions;</p>
<p>3. Revising existing fisheries management measures to restore commercial fishing and include new or additional measures.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa Customs officers have intercepted 1.4 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken, after a targeted operation on Saturday uncovered the illicit shipment arriving from American Samoa.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Ministry of Customs and Revenue confirmed the discovery was made on Saturday and described the concealment method as another example of the tactics used by organized criminal groups.</p>
<p>“The concealment method demonstrates the continued attempts by criminal syndicates to smuggle dangerous drugs into Samoa through seemingly ordinary goods,” the Ministry said.</p>
<p>Customs officers secured the shipment immediately and followed standard enforcement procedures. The man who imported the consignment was detained and later handed over to the Ministry of Police, Prisons and Corrections Service together with the seized drugs “for further investigation and prosecution,” according to the Ministry.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Samoa News should point out that local lawmakers have recently been upset about Samoa’s stance that American Samoa is one of the main routes/ or suppliers of meth to Samoa. They have asked for proof or an apology.]</em></p>

<p>Rice has become a staple food in Papua New Guinea. According to the National Research Institute nearly 98 percent of the rice consumed in the country is imported. Against this backdrop, more than 600 bags of Rigo Rice, a 100 per cent PNG-owned product, were delivered to the villages of Keapara, Alukuni and Karawa in the Rigo District.</p>
<p>Among the three villages, Keapara and Karawa have access to land where they cultivate crops for their community’s sustenance.</p>

<p>Minister for Energy and Member for Kairuku, Peter Namea Isoaimo, has issued an urgent call to the Ministry of Works to immediately intervene in a road emergency along the Hiritano Highway at Tubu in the Nara area of Kairuku District.</p>
<p>The Minister said the situation is now critical, with the damaged section posing an imminent risk of cutting off the people of Kerema, Kairuku, and Goilala from essential travel, trade, and services.</p>
<p>Minister Isoaimo's appeal is directly to Minister for Works, Solon Mirisin, urging him to instruct Secretary David Holemba and relevant technical teams to immediately assess and respond to the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>“This is an emergency. Our people will now be completely cut off if Works does not intervene quickly,” Minister Isoaimo stressed, adding that continuous rainfall has worsened the deterioration of the affected road segment.</p>
<p>He said restoring accessibility on this vital national highway is crucial to avoid disruptions in the movement of goods, government services, and emergency response operations.</p>
<p>The Minister also called for a coordinated approach involving provincial and district authorities to ensure swift mobilisation of machinery and resources.</p>
<p>“We must act now to prevent a total shutdown of the route. The lives and livelihoods of thousands depend on it,” Minister Isoaimo said.</p>

<p>THE people of Dapera village, who were once forcefully displaced by the Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) and Rio Tinto, have celebrated the 50th anniversary.</p>
<p>8th July 1975 is a date Dapera people will never forget when they were forcefully removed from their homes, leaving behind. When the mine expanded, these were the first people affected physically, and it's in their expense and in their suffering and sacrifice that PNG gained independence in 1975, and yet nothing has been done to appreciate and compensate them.</p>

<p>At a global moment of rampant authoritarianism, emboldened tech oligarchs, media funding freezes, and both cyber and physical attacks on journalists, Ressa used her keynote address to warn that many press freedoms may only have one year left before they could be forever lost. But she recounted her own personal experience of persecution in the Philippines to show how a relentless commitment to hold powerful actors accountable — even in the face of repression — can lead to sustainable revenue and justice.</p>

      <h1>Samoa welcomes first electric fire trucks as part of green transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)

<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> The Government of Samoa and Japan and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) celebrated a major national milestone with the launch last week of Samoa’s first fully electric fire fighting vehicles, and the handover of new, specialized rescue emergency equipment under the Climate Action Pathways for Island Transport (CAP-IT) Project.</p>
<p>This landmark achievement reflects the strength of the tripartite partnership and Samoa’s ongoing commitment to advancing climate-resilient, low-emission technologies while significantly enhancing the nation’s emergency response capacity.</p>
<p>The ceremony was led and blessed by Reverend Semikueva Fa’atoafe of the EFKS Moata’a, who encouraged the nation to view these new assets as symbols of peace, service, and protection for all communities in Samoa.</p>
<p>The Minister for Fire and Emergency Services, Seve Te’i Fuimaono, commended the collaboration behind this historic development.</p>
<p>“Today marks a historic step forward for Samoa’s resilience and emergency readiness. The introduction of these electric firefighting vehicles and specialised equipment demonstrates how innovation, sustainability, and strong partnerships can directly improve the safety of our people. We thank Japan and UNDP for their steadfast support in modernizing SFESA and advancing our green transformation.”</p>
<p>Funded through a grant from the Government of Japan and implemented by UNDP in close partnership with the Government of Samoa, the CAP-IT Project has enabled the conversion of two fully electric Ford F-150 Lightning into first-responder fire trucks in a world-first adaptation of electric vehicle technology for island emergency services.</p>
<p>In addition to the vehicles, Japan has provided over USD 100,000 in specialized fire fighting rescue equipment, including Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), heavy-duty cutting and spreading tools, a positive pressure ventilation fan, as well as additional equipment arriving in December, such as thermal imaging cameras and lifting and stabilization tools.</p>
<p>The Ambassador of Japan to Samoa reaffirmed Japan’s commitment to sustainable development and safety in the Pacific:</p>
<p>“Japan is honored to partner with Samoa and UNDP through CAP-IT to deliver innovative, low-carbon solutions that strengthen emergency services. These electric fire trucks are not only climate-friendly but also represent ground-breaking technology for small island states. Our partnership reflects Japan’s commitment to supporting Samoa’s national decarbonization goals and building safer, more resilient communities.”</p>
<p>UNDP Resident Representative, Aliona Niculita, further emphasized that:</p>
<p>“By deploying clean technology in essential public services, Samoa is showing the world that climate innovation can directly improve lives — protecting families, homes, and communities while contributing to national emission reduction goals.”</p>
<p>SFESA Commissioner, Tanuvasa Oloapu Petone Mauga, expressed gratitude for the support, and emphasized its impact on frontline readiness:</p>
<p>“This investment directly supports the safety of our fire-fighters and the communities we serve. Our teams respond to emergencies every day, and having reliable, modern tools including EV-based fire trucks strengthens our readiness and ensures we can protect lives with greater effectiveness.”</p>
<p>Chairperson of the SFESA Board of Directors, Aiono Meresaini Siaosi, who officiated the ribbon cutting ceremony, underscored the long-term significance of the partnership:</p>
<p>“This partnership demonstrates what is possible when nations and development partners work together with shared purpose. These vehicles and equipment represent progress, protection, and hope for our people. On behalf of the Board, we extend our sincere gratitude to Japan, UNDP, and the Government of Samoa.”</p>
<p>The fully electric fire fighting vehicles and specialised equipment will now be deployed to support SFESA’s operational duties nationwide, strengthening Samoa’s capacity in fire suppression, rescue operations, and hazardous incident response.</p>
<p>This joint achievement reinforces the shared commitment of Samoa, Japan, and UNDP to advancing green technology, protecting communities, and building a safer, more climate-resilient future for Samoa.</p>

<p>He barred the <em>Samoa Observer</em> from all ministerial press conferences on Monday, just days after returning on a private jet from New Zealand.</p>
<p>He also stopped his Cabinet ministers from talking to the newspaper, following an ugly scene outside his house on Saturday.</p>
<p>Journalists from the <em>Observer</em> and the <em>BBC</em> claim they <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/579330/samoa-editor-responds-as-pm-la-aulialemalietoa-bans-newspaper-over-coverage">did not enter</a> the Prime Minister's compound, but were accused of trespassing by his security guards.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa said the incident outside the PM's house and the media ban that ensued were &quot;inappropriate&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Well it is telling the world, that the present government in Samoa is hiding things that they should have disclosed. It's a govenrment that does not recognise the rule of law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa claims the government is covering up the true nature of La'auli's illness.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumours are that he should have both legs cut (amputated), he had an accident, a fall, and his legs are absolutely useless, that's what I am told,&quot; he said.</p>
<p><em>Pacific Waves</em> has attempted to contact the Prime Minister repeatedly for a response.</p>
<p>In a text message on Thursday, La'auli said: &quot;Don't worry about Tuilaepa, I have far more better duties to serve Samoa.&quot;</p>
<p>In a social media video message while in Auckland, he said that his leg was injured while campaigning for the election in August, and that the &quot;trip for treatment was long overdue&quot;.</p>
<p>He said it was &quot;not something the country should be worried about&quot;.</p>
<p>However, Tuilaepa claims that most Samoans know the Prime Minister is unwell.</p>
<p>&quot;It is well known to all Samoans, 100 percent, although those who support the Prime Minister prefer not to know,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In our constitution, when a prime minister is unable to run the country, he ought to resign. That's where we are now, he is very sick.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/573087/watch-i-ll-be-staying-on-for-the-next-five-years-fiame-naomi-mata-afa">former Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa</a> believes the media ban was &quot;reactionary&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think its an unwise position to take to have a ban, I don't think it serves the government well or the public for that matter. Especially since the <em>Observer</em> is the only print media that we have,&quot; Fiame said.</p>
<p>She said the optics for the government are not good.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now getting comments from outside sources condemning the actions taken, so I think the external scrutiny will be there for our government and that's not a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She believes there was a definite lack of transparency while the Prime Minister was on medical leave.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought the government would have been a lot more 'onto it', and kept the public informed, given the timing of the trip and the length of time he was away,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I had thought that they had a better media sense, all it really required was for a spokesperson to keep people updated. I mean if he's unwell, he's unwell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All they (the PM's team) needed to say was that he had arrived safely, that he needed to rest and that he would meet the media at a designated time.&quot;</p>
<p>Fiame admitted that while she had her own squirmishes with the newspaper while Prime Minister, she never sought to ban it.</p>

      <h1>Labubu and ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ to dazzle at Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/thanksgiving_day_float_.jpeg?itok=L9Zcd47F"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/thanksgiving_day_float_.jpeg?itok=fXUfhgPl" alt="Thanksgiving Day float "></a></p>
<p><em>NEW YORK (AP) —</em> Two things that made massive cultural splashes this year — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/labubu-viral-plushy-influencers-2de46ecf0b2101a16ef6df4e46f4bc48">Labubu</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-summer-smash-surprise-b1f1a0390c303fb46959f6cf6e77b5ff">“KPop Demon Hunters”</a> — will fill the sky and streets of New York when the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off this year.</p>
<p>The Nov. 27 parade begins rain or shine on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances. It will feature 34 balloons, four mini-balloons, 28 floats, 33 clown groups and 11 marching bands — all leading the way for Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Here’s key things to know about the parade and how to watch it.</p>
<p>It starts at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and airs at that time in all time zones.</p>
<p>What channel is the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade on?</p>
<p>It will be on NBC, available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers.</p>
<p>What if I want to stream it?</p>
<p>For cord cutters, the parade is being simulcast on Peacock and an encore telecast begins at 2 p.m. EST/PST. A Spanish language simulcast will also be on Telemundo.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/macys-thanksgiving-parade-jennifer-hudson-billy-porter-56d790dadc0485add54148d71c82f0fe">Last year,</a> more than 31 million people tuned in on NBC and Peacock, up 10% from the previous year and marking the biggest audience ever for the parade.</p>
<p>What’s the weather going to be like?</p>
<p>The Weather Channel predicts a high of 52 degrees and a partly cloudy day, with winds up to 10 mph. AccuWeather also predicts 52 degrees with intervals of clouds and sunshine and a passing shower and winds at 6 mph. New York City law prohibits Macy’s from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 23 mph or wind gusts are over 35 mph.</p>
<p>Who are some of the stars performing?</p>
<p>“Wicked” star <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/cynthia-erivo">Cynthia Erivo</a> will kick off a starry show. <a href="https://apnews.com/video/insane-success-for-huntrx-and-kpop-demon-hunters-0000019926d2da74a3bfffdf19390000">Audrey Nuna, EJAE and Rei Ami</a> of HUNTR/X, the fictional girl group at the heart of the Netflix hit <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-summer-smash-surprise-b1f1a0390c303fb46959f6cf6e77b5ff">“KPop Demon Hunters,”</a> will feature alongside Ciara, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/foreigner-rock-hall-2024-f94bf35191fd280b505bde1d4c1d05d4">Foreigner,</a> Lil Jon, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kool-gang-rock-hall-2024-7020e2baef66b90b4020267879b3ef85">Kool &amp; the Gang,</a> Busta Rhymes, <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/mickey-guyton">Mickey Guyton</a> and Teyana. An eclectic group of stars — from ballet dancer Tiler Peck to YouTube’s “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans — will join the annual holiday kick-off.</p>
<p>Broadway will be represented by cast members from “Buena Vista Social Club,” “Just in Time” and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lincoln-center-ragtime-4f44f7c418c7643e8a572d66652481f3">“Ragtime,”</a> while the Radio City Rockettes will be there and some serious athletes — three-time U.S. national champion figure skater Ilia Malinin and U.S Paralympian Jack Wallace. Alumni and students at LaGuardia High School in New York City — the school featured in the movie and TV series “Fame” — will help celebrate the 50th anniversary of “A Chorus Line.”</p>
<p>Others on hand will be Jewel, Debbie Gibson, Drew Baldridge, Matteo Bocelli, Colbie Caillat, Gavin DeGraw, Meg Donnelly, Christopher Jackson, Darlene Love, Roman Mejia, Taylor Momsen, Calum Scott, Shaggy, Lauren Spencer Smith and Luísa Sonza.</p>

On Telemundo, the hosts will be Andrea Meza, Aleyda Ortiz and Clovis Nienow.</p>
<p>What are the new balloons?</p>
<p>This year, four new featured character balloons will debut, including Buzz Lightyear, Pac-Man, Mario from Super Mario Brothers and a 32-foot-tall (9.8-meter) balloon onion carriage featuring eight characters from the world of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-8232980005">“Shrek.”</a> “KPop Demon Hunters” will also be represented in the sky with the characters Derpy Tiger and Sussie.</p>
<p>What about new floats?</p>
<p>Several new floats will debut this year, including the first Pop Mart float, with Labubu, Skullpanda, Peach Riot, Dimoo, Molly, Duckoo and Mokoko. There will also be floats from Holland America Line, Lego, Lindt chocolates, “Stranger Things” featuring members of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/foreigner-rock-hall-2024-f94bf35191fd280b505bde1d4c1d05d4">Foreigner</a>, and a bunch of whimsical sheep trying to get to sleep courtesy of Serta. The fish-shaped snack Goldfish is returning to the parade with a tiny float that measures just 14 Goldfish crackers long.</p>
<p>The marching bands will hail from South Carolina, California, Texas, Arizona, New Hampshire, Mississippi, Alabama, Pennsylvania and Santiago, Panama. The New York Police Department’s marching band will also join. There will also be dancers and cheerleaders from Spirit of America Dance and Spirit of America Cheer.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — The nation bade farewell Thursday to former Vice President Dick Cheney, a taciturn man of the West who went from being a lineman for the county to the second most powerful person in the country and dedicated his life to defeating those he saw as enemies of America, at home and abroad.</p>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — U.S. employment growth accelerated in September, but the labor market remained sluggish and failed to keep pace with new job-seekers as employers dealt with fallout from import tariffs and integrated artificial intelligence into some positions. The jobless rate rose to 4.4%, its highest level in four years, from 4.3% in August, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Thursday. The August payrolls data was revised to show employers shedding jobs for the second time this year, underscoring the labor market softness.</p>

      <h1>US judge moves to halt Trump’s National Guard deployment in Washington, D.C.</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>A federal judge on Thursday moved to halt President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., a temporary legal setback to Trump’s efforts to send the military to American cities over objections of local leaders. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to enforce the law in the nation’s capital without approval from its mayor. However, she paused her ruling until Dec. 11 to allow the administration to appeal. The legal fight is playing out alongside several others across the country as Trump presses against longstanding but rarely tested constraints on presidents using troops to enforce domestic law.</p>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — President Donald Trump on Thursday removed his 40% tariffs on Brazilian food products, including beef, coffee, cocoa and fruits that were imposed in July to punish Brazil over the prosecution of its former president, Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. The move follows a similar order by the administration last Friday to remove tariffs on several agricultural products as the White House makes a U-turn on some tariffs that have increased the cost of food in the United States.</p>

      <p>Dozens of countries, including both developed and developing nations, have mounted a push for a roadmap setting out how countries should transition away from fossil fuels. Others, including some fossil fuel-producing nations, are resisting.</p>

      <h1>Pasifika smoking rate is still twice the national average in NZ</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Kaya Selby, RNZ Pacific journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A health leader has labelled the latest Pasifika smoking rates &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;, despite the New Zealand government celebrating them.</p>
<p>Associate Health Minister Casey Costello said in a press release that, over the last six years, the Pacific peoples smoking rate has halved.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the survey data shows a continuation of the great progress that's been made in the last few years — especially with falling numbers of Pacific peoples' smokers and very low rates of youth smoking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Auckland University professor Sir Collin Tukuitonga said Costello was being &quot;very generous&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's dropped, no question, but it's still twice the rate as the rest of New Zealand. In other words, it's unacceptable that we have significant inequities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To claim that it's halved in the last six years is, I think, a bit generous with the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>The data that the minister referred to — from the latest New Zealand Health Survey — showed that between the 2019- 20 and 2024- 25 fiscal years, the Pasifika daily smoking rate decreased from 18 to 10.3 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Further, &quot;heavy smokers&quot; as part of the daily smoker population among Pasifika increased in that time, from 4.6 to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>Costello's office clarified to RNZ Pacific that they meant the 2018/ 19 fiscal year, which showed a drop of slightly more than half from 21 percent.</p>
<p>Pasifika smoking rates did see slight decreases from the last fiscal year in current and daily smoking rates.</p>
<p>While it showed an improvement, Sir Collin said it falls within a broader trend, and still falls well above the general population.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a long term trend downwards as a result of successive governments, not just this government policy, but educational programs and efforts by Pacific providers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So it's been a long term decline. It's just that the rate of decline is very slow compared with the rest of New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Costello said the latest results showed &quot;great progress&quot; across the whole of Aotearoa.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand has made some of the best progress in reducing smoking rates in the world — these latest survey results show adult daily smoking has halved in the last decade,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Conversely, daily vaping rates have increased more than threefold from 3.5 percent in 2019-20 to 11.7 percent in 2024-25 for the general population.</p>
<p>For Pasifika, daily vaping has increased by more than five times during that same period, from 3.9 to 20 percent.</p>
<p>Other key indicators for Pasifika health, such as mental health and obesity, have worsened over the last six years.</p>
<p>Rates of high or very high psychological distress have more than doubled from 9.7 to 23.8 percent, while 16.2 percent of Pasifika report unmet needs for mental health and addiction care.</p>
<p>Alongside a 5.6 percent decrease in physical activity, obesity has increased from 63.8 percent to 69.5 percent, while Pasifika living with high blood pressure and high cholesterol have increased slightly.</p>
<p>The rate of ischaemic heart disease (or coronary heart disease) among Pasifika has more than doubled to 5.7 percent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hazardous drinking has seen an improvement, declining from 25.1 to 17.5 percent, and weekly heavy episodic drinking halving from 14.7 to 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Fewer Pasifika are smoking cannabis (-3.1 to 12.7 percent), while more are using cocaine (+1 to 1.7 percent) and sedatives or sleeping pills (+1.3 to 1.8 percent).</p>

      <p>HEALTH EATING FOR DIABETES</p>
<p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/healthy_eating.jpeg?itok=KDnVT_Um"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/healthy_eating.jpeg?itok=tFcsy2aT" alt="Reduce sugar intake and stay active"></a></p>
<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><strong>DIABETES CRISIS</strong></p>
<p>Deputy Minister for Public Health Minister Rennier Gadabu says diabetes is a national crisis in the country.</p>
<p>The government paper reported Rennier Gadabu attended the World Diabetes Day earlier this month.</p>
<p>Gadabu said diabetes weakens Nauru's workforce and drains its health system.</p>
<p>He said Nauru has one of the highest diabetes rates in the world, with more than one in five adults living with the disease.</p>
<p>The minister urged citizens to choose healthier meals, reduce sugar intake and stay active.</p>
<p>He also called on the government to increase and dedicate funding for non-communicable diseases, saying it is an investment in Nauru's future.</p>
<p><strong>UNITED STATES VISAS</strong></p>
<p>The United States is strengthening health screenings for immigrant visas, including for conditions like obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>The US Embassy in Wellington said they are doing strict vetting to prevent immigration of those who cannot cover their own living expenses, including medical costs.</p>
<p>NPR reported a new directive to embassies, which expands the criteria by which a visa may be denied to include more health issues and age.</p>
<p>The embassy said each application will continue to be subject to individual review from consular officers.</p>
<p><strong>PACIFIC CLIMATE</strong></p>
<p>Climate Minister Simon Watts has called on other states to back a Pacific COP hosted by Australia next year.</p>
<p>It is still unknown who will host COP31 in 2026, with both Australia and Turkey wanting to host.</p>
<p>Watts said climate change in the Pacific is not a distant threat but a lived reality.</p>
<p>He said having the climate meeting in Australia will be an opportunity to deliver global climate solutions.</p>
<p><strong>WWII MEDALS</strong></p>
<p>Families of Cook Islanders who served in the Cook Islands Local Defense Force (CILDF) but never received their Second World War medals can now apply for them.</p>
<p>While more than half the CILDF personnel were issued medals in the early 1950s, others were deemed ineligible, largely due to being discharged from service before the end of the war for minor disciplinary infractions.</p>
<p>After reviewing past medal-issuing processes, the New Zealand Defence Force has confirmed that these veterans, or their next of kin, should be eligible.</p>
<p>Researchers identified 85 Cook Islanders who qualify for medals, including the War Medal 1939-1945, the New Zealand War Service medal, and for some cases, the Defence Medal.</p>
<p>Surviving CILDF members or their families can request an application form, and families must agree on who will claim each medal and provide the required documentation.</p>
<p><strong>VANUATU NEGOTIATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Vanuatu government is preparing for the first round of formal negotiations with France on sovereignty over Umaenupne and Umaeneg, otherwise known as Matthew and Hunter Islands.</p>
<p>Permanent maritime boundaries between Vanuatu and New Caledonia are also set to be raised.</p>
<p>Local media reported Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat has appointed the Deputy PM Johnny Koanapo Rasou as lead negotiator.</p>
<p>A delegation from France, led by Special Envoy Director Benoît Guidée arrived in Port Vila on Wednesday for two days of talks.</p>
<p>This first round of negotiations follows a working visit to Paris by Prime Minister Napat in July to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>The government has appointed DLA Piper to represent Vanuatu's legal interests as it pursues sovereignty over the islands and its permanent maritime boundaries.</p>
<p>As part of the visit, the Government will host a formal dinner to welcome the French delegation.</p>
<p><strong>TUVALU  TREATY</strong></p>
<p>Tuvalu has signed a new treaty with Taiwan, elevating their bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Local media reported the Kaitasi Treaty makes it more difficult for both parties to unilaterally exit the relationship.</p>
<p>On his first state visit to Taiwan, Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Teo said it's a significant historical moment.</p>
<p>He said it sets a relationship of cooperation between Tuvalu and Taiwan for the first time, with a legal platform giving rise to legal commitments instead of mere political commitments.</p>
<p>Tuvalu and Taiwan also signed two other agreements in an effort to enhance sport and fisheries.</p>
<p><strong>NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS MINING</strong></p>
<p>Discussions over potential seabed mining in the Northern Marianas are intensifying.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's governor is urging residents to weigh in as the United States advances early steps toward possible deep-ocean mineral exploration in the region.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has released a 'request for information and interest' on mineral leasing across the CNMI's Outer Continental Shelf - which is seen as the starting point for any future commercial activity.</p>
<p>Marianas governor David Apatang is calling on the community to respond, saying broad participation is critical as Washington considers how to handle the issue.</p>
<p><strong>SOLOMON ISLANDS ECOSYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>A new initiative in Solomon Islands aims to help businesses grow in ways that protect coral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overfishing, coastal development, and land-based pollution continue to threaten reefs.</p>
<p>The 'reef-positive finance' pilot is supported by multiple organisations including the World Wildlife Fund, the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the Global Fund for Coral Reefs.</p>
<p>Susan Gardner, from the Global Fund for Coral Reefs' executive board, said this project will help local businesses grow in ways that protect reefs and strengthen community resilience in the face of the climate crisis.</p>
<p>New Zealand High Commissioner to Solomon Islands Jonathan Curr said Solomon Islanders depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods, cultures and for resilience.</p>
<p><strong>COOK ISLANDS REGISTRY</strong></p>
<p>Maritime Cook Islands has reiterated that its ship registry complies with international sanctions.</p>
<p>The ship registry has come under increased scrutiny of late, after Cook Islands-flagged tanker Eagle S was seized by Finnish authorities about a year ago on suspicion of ripping up sub sea cables.</p>
<p>The ship was also thought to be part of Russia's shadow fleet used to avoid international oil sanctions.</p>
<p>A Maritime Cook Islands spokesperson said vessels under the nation's flag comply with all UN sanctions and are prohibited from trading in Russian, Iranian, or Venezuelan petroleum products.</p>

      <h1>Little Tips, Big Purpose — Cosmetology student uses tips to support local youth athletes</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Abcde Tupa'i, a young woman from the villages of Pago Pago and Mapusaga Fou is making a meaningful difference far beyond her salon chair. Now living in the US, Tupa'i is both a cosmetology and an undergraduate student, saving every tip she earns from clients at her cosmetology school to support a group of student athletes.</p>
<p>According to Ms Tupa’i, these athletes, young boys from American Samoa, have been selected to play high school football in Santa Barbara, California, a life-changing move that, like Tupa'i's own journey, requires courage, sacrifice, and leaving behind everything familiar.</p>
<p>She told Samoa News, via email, that understanding these struggles firsthand, compelled her to support them in some way.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not easy to leave home, especially a place as comfortable as Samoa, for somewhere that demands so much of you. I know how it feels to step into the unknown to chase your dreams, and I know many of our people can relate to that too,&quot; she said</p>
<p>Inspired by the stories of these athletes and their families, Tupa'i wrote that she decided to set aside all her client tips to make a meaningful contribution. But she also acknowledged that this effort was never hers alone.</p>
<p>Support poured in from other families, friends, and especially from the boys' live-in guardian, Lele Malaki, whose daily dedication, guidance, and care have helped make the boys' transition smoother and their dreams possible.</p>
<p>The tips were used to create custom football training shirts, a small reminder that they are seen, supported, and celebrated.</p>
<p>&quot;It might not be a lot,&quot; Tupa'i says, &quot;but my motivation comes from the Samoan proverb: 'O le tele o sulu e maua ai figota, e mama se avega pe a ta amo fa'atasi,' meaning 'My strength does not come from me alone, but from many.&quot;</p>
<p>She added, &quot;We often wait to cheer for our people once they've made it. But we need to support them from the very beginning, all the way until they succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Tupa'i believes it is essential for leaders in our communities to invest in youth early on, not just after they've found success.</p>
<p>&quot;The dream was always to come to the U.S., learn all I can, and give back to American Samoa one day. But I've learned that I don't have to wait, I can start giving back now,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She encourages young Samoans to dream boldly and without limitation: &quot;You don't have to choose just one path. You can do many things at once if you work hard. And if you're intimidated by the thought that you're the only Samoan in your field, remember that you're not alone, you're the first. Be proud of that!&quot;</p>
<p>Tupa'i applauds the young athletes for daring to dream big and stepping out of their comfort zone in pursuit of their goals. She also deeply admires their families, whose prayers and love continue to nurture the boys' journey from afar and at home.</p>
<p>It's not easy to be apart from the people and places you love, but their collective sacrifice speaks volumes. She wants to give these boys the recognition they truly deserve, reminding them that they are not alone on this journey. There is a whole community behind them, proud of their courage, inspired by their determination, and cheering them on every step of the way.</p>
<p>In her quiet, determined way, Abcde Tupa'i is proving that small acts rooted in love, culture, and purpose can carry a big message: “Real change begins when we show up for each other, one tip at a time”.</p>

The overall decline put the price of the meal at $55.18, 5% down from 2024, the lowest since 2021, driven lower by a 16.3% decline that shoppers found in what retailers were charging for a 16-pound turkey, the American Farm Bureau Federation reported in its annual survey of holiday meal prices.</p>

      <h1>Non-profit calls for stronger action on illegal fishing and high seas transshipment</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Iliesa Tora, RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Pew Charitable Trust believes the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) needs to do more on port side measures in order to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</p>
<p>And getting transshipment in the high seas management also needs urgent attention, WCPFC international fisheries officer Glen Holmes told RNZ Pacific.</p>
<p>Three weeks out from the WCPFC 22nd Regular Session in Manila, Holmes said the two issues are of great importance and should be receiving a lot more attention now.</p>
<p>Member countries and stakeholders will meet from 1 to 5 December.</p>
<p>Holmes said while there is progress on the important South Pacific Albacore tuna fisheries, with a management procedure expected to be adopted at the meeting, Pew believes IUU fishing and transshipment in the high seas needs equal attention.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always multiple issues to be discussed in any Commission meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things that we are particularly concerned about is the various management cracks that allow for IUU fishing to occur.</p>
<p>&quot;One of those is, for example, is port state measures management. We would like to see an improvement on that, there has been a little bit of progress intersessionally on improving the port space measures agreement, but we would like to see much more progress on that.</p>
<p>&quot;We would we would have liked to have seen something adopted this year but I don't think that is going to happen and I would like to see some progress towards strengthening that measure for next year, if it can't be done this year.&quot;</p>
<p>He pointed to the continuing problem of transshipment in the high seas as well, being one that has been discussed over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>A pending report to be released on the issue, Holmes said, has the WCPFC lagging behind the other four tuna fisheries focused Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) in the world in the management of high seas transshipment.</p>
<p>The other four tuna RFMOs are the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT).</p>
<p>Holmes said the improvement of the WCPFC transshipment measure has been a a hot topic of debate for quite a number of years now.</p>
<p>&quot;It will again be discussed in detail this year and I know that there is a benchmarking exercise that is about to be released that shows that WCPFC has the worst transshipment management of all the tuna RFMOS now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every other tuna RFMO has lifted its game and brought its individual management arrangements close to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) guidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;WCPFC is currently the laggard, so it's time for the the Commission to agree to improve its transshipment measures.&quot;</p>
<p>On why agreeing to an efficient management plan for high seas transshipment, Holmes said it is critical that member countries come to an agreement on the best way forward.</p>
<p>He said this was the major cause for delay.</p>
<p>&quot;It essentially comes down to different points of view between the members, between various Members within the Commission, as to what the problem is and, or whether a problem even exists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said there are a group of members who believe that high seas transshipment should be banned altogether.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a group of members who believe that high seas transshipment shouldn't be allowed to occur, that all the Pacific is geographically structured in such a way that ports are always relatively close to, no matter where you are in the convention area, and so vessels should be required to go into port, offload their catch where they can be observed and the catch can be verified and everything can be shown to be above board.</p>
<p>&quot;Having vessels transship onto carriers in the high seas, there's not as much oversight and so there is more opportunities for IUU activity and other illegal activity to occur.</p>
<p>&quot;Other members believe that high seas transshipment has enough oversight, saying currently there are observers on carriers, for example, and that everything is fine and there's no requirement to ban it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said these differing opinions don't seem to be heading to a compromise position in WCPFC.</p>
<p>Other RFMOS have been able to agree on what they need to do, on the other hand.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just that there has been no agreement in WCPFC, even though there has been detailed discussions every year for the last eight years now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hopeful that finally an agreement can be made to improve the transshipment measure this year.&quot;</p>
<p>OBSERVER ISSUES</p>
<p>Holmes said another critical issue that Pew has been working on with governments and partner organizations is observer coverage on long line fisheries.</p>
<p>He said the current five percent coverage is too low and needs to be changed to help improve compliance by fishing companies, adding that a one hundred percent coverage is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission only requires five percent coverage for long line on the high seas and that's not enough to one get a representative picture of what's happening from an independent source,.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And it's also not enough to really incentivize any improvement in compliance. So, there really needs to be a substantial increase in long line observer coverage and that's been our position for a number of years and it continues to be our our position.</p>
<p>&quot;It should really be at 100 percent requirement.&quot;</p>
<p>Pew also wants independent observers on the compliance review process.</p>
<p>Observers are currently not allowed, and Holmes said the WCPFC is the only Tuna commission that does not allow independent observers to sit in the compliance review processes of of the RFMO.</p>
<p>He said the Commission should open up the compliance monitoring review to allow observers to observe what's going on and therefore gain the level of transparency and give confidence to the public.</p>
<p>ALL FOR ALBACORE PLAN</p>
<p>Holmes said Pew is in agreement with WCPFC chair Josie Tamate, who told RNZ Pacific two weeks ago the adoption of a management procedure (MP) for South Pacific albacore at the upcoming WCPFC meeting is her target.</p>
<p>Tamate said Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) members who are involved in South Pacific albacore tuna fisheries have come to an agreement, which, she hopes, would lead to the adoption of a plan.</p>
<p>Holmes said Pew supports that move.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with the chair that South Pacific albacore management procedure is going to be one of the major issues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission has been working on a management arrangement for South Pacific Albacore for well over a decade now, so it's time to finally agree to something.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm actually also confident that a management procedure will be adopted and that will mean good progress for the Commission in moving towards a modernized management approach for South Pacific albacore.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a really important fishery, particularly for a lot of the islands, so that'll be really good progress if we can get that across the line.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there are other aspects that Pew want to see progress on, like the development of the big eye management procedure and how yellowfin will eventually be met.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to see progress on that as well as and there are always room for improvement and so anywhere we can make those improvements we push for,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>WCPFC chair Tamate had also confirmed in her earlier interview that a management plan for big-eye Tuna fisheries will be the next step.</p>

      <h1>Jamaica faces $9.5 billion finance gap to rebuild after Melissa</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>BELEM, Brazil — Jamaica spent years building a pot of money to handle climate-fuelled disasters. It turned out to be enough to cover just 5% of the cost wrought by one storm. Hurricane Melissa has left the island nation with bills totalling <span class="math inline">\(10 billion — only \)</span>500 million of which it can cover with climate-preparation reserves stockpiled to deal with disasters, Jamaican cabinet minister Matthew Samuda told Reuters. Jamaica is asking wealthy countries at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, to urgently offer grants, investment and concessional finance. What it does not want are commercial-rate loans that saddle the country with more debt as it faces a future expected to deliver increasingly severe climate impacts such as heatwaves, droughts, rising seas and catastrophic storms. “We don’t come as mendicants. We come as victims of the actions of others,” Samuda said in an interview at the summit, referring to the fact Jamaica has done little to cause the planet-warming emissions that are driving climate change. He said Jamaica had spent three decades improving its financial health and inching closer to an investment grade credit rating.</p>

<p>The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) is seeking K100 million from the 2026 national budget to fully establish and operationalise its new elite anti-terrorism unit, Kumul 23.</p>
<p>Aimed at combating escalating armed violence, tribal warfare, and organised criminal threats across the country, the unit has been activated after the first group ended their training and they now form part of the government’s sweeping counter-terror strategy introduced under the newly passed Counter Terrorism Act.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa's Prime Minister La'aulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Schmidt, has banned the country's only daily newspaper, the Samoa Observer, from all ministerial press conferences.</p>
<p>The move has raised serious concerns among industry stakeholders about media freedom as he faces growing political and legal pressure.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa announced the ban on Monday at his first press conference in two months, held just days after returning from medical treatment in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He told journalists that the ban also applies to his Cabinet ministers. The decision follows a tense confrontation on Saturday, when journalists from Samoa Observer and the BBC went to the Prime Minister's home to confirm his return.</p>
<p>The journalists claim they remained on the public roadside but were approached by men from the PM's property, who accused them of trespassing and of behaving disrespectfully.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't respect me as the Prime Minister. In my time in New Zealand, I never saw any reporters writing so disrespectfully about leaders,&quot; La'aulialemalietoa told reporters in his office on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I was in my home for ten minutes when they arrived. They argued with the Police. They were told to leave as I was only just reuniting with my family and trying to say a prayer. My home is a private home, not a public place.&quot;</p>
<p>In a report published on Saturday, Observer editor Shalveen Chand alleges he was assaulted during the Saturday exchange, in full view of police officers nearby.</p>
<p>He says when he asked police for help, he was told to lodge a complaint at the station. He has since filed a formal report.</p>
<p>BBC journalist Dr Mandeep Rai, who witnessed the incident, says the Samoa Observer team acted &quot;carefully and respectfully&quot;, and that the hostile response was surprising. She says the difficulty in simply confirming a national leader's safe arrival raises questions about transparency and access.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister linked the ban to what he described as &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;disrespectful&quot; reporting, including stories published during his medical leave.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was away, I saw numerous reports that were wrong… especially the story about a meeting between the Deputy PM and my CEOs. A meeting that never happened.&quot;</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa says that as Faatuatua i le Atua Samoa ua Tasi (FAST) chairperson, he had previously banned the Observer from party events, but lifted that ban when he became Prime Minister at the request of senior government officials.</p>
<p>The ban intensifies an already tense political climate in Samoa. In October, former Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa filed a ST<span class="math inline">\(1.1 million (\)</span>NZ698,000) defamation case against him, alleging he falsely linked her to interference in the murder investigation of American Samoan academic Dr Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard. The case is now before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>There are also ongoing election-related disputes, public service tensions, and growing scrutiny about the government's commitment to transparency.</p>
<p>REGIONAL PRESSURE ALSO RISING</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa's return to Samoa follows an unofficial meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in Auckland earlier this month, his first public political engagement in weeks.</p>
<p>The two leaders discussed major issues, including health infrastructure, drug-trafficking in the Pacific, and labor mobility.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa confirmed plans for new hospitals in Tuanaimato and Savai'i and reiterated his support for the Pacific Justice campaign, which seeks visa-on-arrival access to New Zealand for Pacific citizens.</p>
<p>At the start of Monday's press conference, La'aulialemalietoa asked the Samoa Observer's reporter to leave his office. The exchange happened in front of the President of the Journalists Association of Samoa (JAWS) and other senior media members.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Next week, legal experts from U.S. Territories will come together for a virtual panel hosted by Right to Democracy to discuss the recent statement by Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas that the Territories Clause, “rightly understood,” does not “endow the federal government with plenary power … within the Territories.”</p>
<p>Moderated by Neil Weare, co-director of Right to Democracy, the panel includes Columbia Law Professor Christina Ponsa-Kraus, Rutgers Law Professor Rose Cuison-Villazor, Cesar Lopez-Morales, Counsel at Orrick, and Anthony Ciolli, co-author of the forthcoming legal casebook Law of U.S. Territories.</p>
<p>The Virtual Panel will take place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday, November 24th at 5pm EST, 6pm AST, and 11am in American Samoa</li>
<li>Tuesday, November 25th at 8am in Guam/ Northern Mariana Islands</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the questions the panel will address includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where does the “plenary power” doctrine come from, and what does it mean for congressional power over U.S. territories?</li>
<li>Does the text and history of the Territories Clause support the perpetual exercise of plenary power of people in U.S. territories?</li>
<li>If not, what limits on congressional power might exist?</li>
<li>What does this all mean for the future of democracy, self-determination, and the protection of Indigenous/cultural rights in U.S. territories?</li>
</ol>
<p>This conversation is timely as we approach the 250th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and 125th Anniversary of the Insular Cases next year and explore how the current undemocratic colonial framework governing U.S. territories is in tension with foundational U.S. values like “consent of the governed” and “all … created equal.”</p>

<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Win Daki has reaffirmed that all businesses reserved for Papua New Guineans must be operated exclusively by citizens.</p>
<p>He said although a business reserved list already exists, successive governments and ministers have failed to update and enforce it, allowing foreign operators to enter and dominate sectors meant solely for Papua New Guineans.</p>

<p>With the 2026 National Budget set to be tabled next week, Papua New Guineans are again bracing themselves for promises of change, particularly around law and order, a sector repeatedly identified as key to driving economic growth and improving public safety yet still besieged by structural neglect and chronic under-performance.</p>

<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Samoa Prime Minister La'aulialemalietoa Leuatea Schmidt has returned home after an eight-week absence for medical treatment in New Zealand.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa departed Apia for Auckland on a private jet just days after being sworn in as Samoa's eighth prime minister on September 16.</p>
<p>The Samoa government had previously said he was expected to return to the country in a week after receiving treatment for a leg injury.</p>
<p>The Samoa Observer confirmed his arrival on Saturday after visiting his residence in Siusega.</p>
<p>However, attempts by reporters to seek comment from the prime minister were stopped by his supporters, who told them to leave.</p>
<p>The situation escalated when the Samoa Observer editor was allegedly assaulted by two men in the presence of police officers.</p>
<p>He has since lodged a formal complaint with the police.</p>
<p>La'aulialemalietoa later told reporters to come back on Monday.</p>

<p>Source: Samoa Govt press release</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Samoa Ministry of Health has issued new travel advisories for all travelers entering Samoa, effective from the 3rd of this month requiring <em>all</em> travelers from infants aged 12 months and above, to have received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine at least two weeks before, or no later than 14 days prior to arrival into Samoa.</p>
<p>The advisory is part of Samoa’s swift response to the increasing number of measles cases reported in New Zealand and other neighboring countries, said Acting Director-General of Health, Tagaloa Dr. Robert Thompson.</p>
<p>“Samoa’s response aims to prevent the potential importation of measles into the country,” said Dr Thompson.</p>
<p>The advisory outlines the following key measures:</p>
<p>• All travelers, including infants aged 12 months and above, are strongly advised to have received at least one dose of a measles-containing vaccine at least two weeks before, or no later than 14 days prior to arrival in Samoa.</p>
<p>• Infants under 12 months of age and pregnant mothers are exempted from this requirement.</p>
<p>• Any person showing symptoms of measles — including fever, dry cough, red or watery eyes, runny nose, or a blotchy rash — is strongly advised to defer travel until fully recovered.</p>
<p>• Travelers identified with symptoms of measles upon arrival at any point of entry will be assessed and detained as required under public health regulations.</p>
<p>• All travelers are strongly advised to carry a legitimate vaccination certificate as proof of measles immunization.</p>
<p>The Acting Director-General of Health, Tagaloa Dr. Robert Thompson, said there are currently no plans for a lockdown, however, the Ministry will impose restrictions if an outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>Travelers who develop symptoms consistent with measles after arrival — including fever, cough, red or watery eyes, runny nose, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body — should isolate immediately at home or in their accommodation, and seek prompt medical attention.</p>

<p>compiled by Samoa News staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Samoa woman in her late 20s freed herself after she says she was kidnapped, assaulted, and tied to an iron pole.</p>
<p>After members of her husband’s family, who were her alleged captors fell asleep, she managed to escape.</p>
<p>She reportedly then fled to a nearby household whose residents hid her and guided her to the main road to catch an early morning bus. She later reached a friend, a police officer, who accompanied her to Faleata Police Station to lodge a formal complaint.</p>
<p>The following morning, a black minivan carrying several family members reportedly returned to the house. Three women allegedly confronted her at the back of the kitchen, slapping, punching, kicking, and stomping her before putting her inside the vehicle. She reported she was also beaten with a stick and struck with an iron rod. One older female relative allegedly cut her hair with scissors, while others tied her to an iron pole. During the assault, a suspect reportedly threatened her, saying, “There is no family in Samoa that can challenge us. You will see when we get to kuā, we are going to mark you like an animal.”</p>
<p>Police said the assault followed a dispute at the victim’s home. According to her account, the confrontation began on October 30 when her sister-in-law allegedly punched her and called other relatives, claiming she had been attacked.</p>
<p>The circulation of a video showing the incident on social media has provided police with further evidence. Acting Police Commissioner Leiataua Samuelu Afamasaga confirmed the footage was recorded by the family and said the victim is now under the care of the Samoa Victim Support Group (SVSG).</p>
<p>Leiataua said the suspects are already known to police and are relatives of a notorious criminal. “The video, together with witness statements and the victim’s account, provides sufficient evidence to file charges,” he said.</p>

      <h1>Wall Street tumbles as Nvidia slides, investors fret that Fed may slow rate cuts</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday, with steep losses in Nvidia and other AI heavyweights, as investors scaled back expectations of interest rate cuts due to inflation worries and divisions among central bankers about the U.S. economy’s health. All three major U.S. stock indexes posted their steepest daily percentage declines in over a month. The U.S. government reopened after a record 43-day shutdown that had worried investors and disrupted the flow of economic data. A growing number of Federal Reserve policymakers in recent days have signaled hesitation about further interest rate cuts, pushing financial market-based odds of a reduction in borrowing costs in December to near even. Fed officials who spoke recently cited worries about inflation and signs of relative stability in the labor market after two U.S. interest rate cuts this year.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — American sailors and personnel from nine other nations recently wrapped up a two-week exercise in the South Pacific island nation of Samoa as part of an annual U.S. Navy humanitarian mission. The sailors, along with personnel from Samoa, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore and the United Kingdom, rehearsed a mass rescue in the islands, according to an Australian Defense Department news release last week Wednesday.</p>
<p>Samoa is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the drill sought to improve disaster readiness and the ability of South Pacific nations to work together, the release said. Five to nine named tropical cyclones could occur in the Southwest Pacific between this month and April, New Zealand’s National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research reported Oct. 8.</p>
<p>The expeditionary sea base USS John L. Canley arrived in Samoa on Oct. 21, the Samoan News Hub website. The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Steve Koehler, attended the closing ceremony for the exercise aboard the French patrol vessel Auguste Bénébig docked at Apia, according to the report. The Navy’s work in Samoa was part of Pacific Partnership, an annual deployment conceived after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that involves port calls in developing nations throughout the region.</p>
<p>This year’s mission, involving more than 1,500 personnel, included stops in Papua New Guinea, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Philippines, Fiji, and Tonga, according to a July 9 Navy news release. The dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor began its Pacific Partnership voyage on July 8 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.</p>
<p>The operation, led by the commander of Destroyer Squadron 31, Capt. Mark Stefanik, is focused on engineering, disaster management and medical support, according to the Navy release.</p>
<p>“This enduring mission provides us the opportunity to build on our relationships, share expertise, and learn from one another,” he said in the release. “Our shared experiences help create more resilient communities, and I’m proud to lead a team committed to strengthening partnerships across the Indo-Pacific.”</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Margo Staunton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific senior journalist</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Child and adolescent obesity is soaring in Polynesia and there is no quick fix, according to an eminent Pacific health leader.</p>
<p>The most obese 5-19-year-olds globally live in three Pacific Island nations, a UNICEF report found.</p>
<p>The report, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children 2025, reveals that Niue — with a population of 1600 — tops the lot, with nearly 40 percent of children and youth being obese.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands came second with 37 percent and Nauru followed with 33 percent.</p>
<p>The report said 2025 marks an historic turning point as it is the first time global obesity has surpassed those who are underweight in the 5-19-year-old age group.</p>
<p>One fifth of the world's children and adolescents are now overweight and half of them are obese.</p>
<p>The report said global obesity was mainly driven by a shift from traditional diets to cheap, imported, ultra-processed foods and soft drinks.</p>
<p>Auckland University professor Sir Collin Tukuitonga said obesity is not a region-wide issue in the Pacific.</p>
<p>&quot;Overweight and obesity is more of a problem in Polynesia and to a certain extent Micronesia,&quot; Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in Melanesia — Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, under-nutrition, iron and micronutrient deficiency is still a major problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sir Collin said many people now live in urban or peri-urban areas with no access to land to grow food, and convenience was a major factor.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that people will return to growing their own staples and catching fish, I don't see that as being realistic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What needs to happen is better information and support so people moderate or reduce their consumption of ultra-processed foods.&quot;</p>
<p>He said another major factor in the trend was a rapid decline in breast feeding in the region.</p>
<p>While many mothers breastfed initially, this dropped dramatically after three months, due to pressures to return to work or church and village commitments.</p>
<p>Associated with that was a change in what he called &quot;weaning foods&quot;.</p>
<p>“Traditionally it was like fresh staples and fish, but things have changed and kids are weaned off the breast on sugar and processed food items,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Countries had put a lot of effort into trying to prevent adult obesity but the focus should now be on youth, Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given our limited capacity and resources we should put more of an effort into educating and informing young people about healthy diets... then we might in fact end up with a generation that is able to respond to the causes of it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said young obese people can later face health problems in adulthood, such as type-2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a burden of disease, that's the jargon, particularly diabetes, which then leads to kidney failure and blindness, and the social and economic costs to families and nations is enormous.&quot;</p>
<p>The way children were growing up had also changed, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have become more sedentary, using devices, families have more money to buy imported food items, and fresh fruit and vegetables are not widely eaten.&quot;</p>
<p>While there is good data on adult obesity, research into children and adolescents is relatively recent, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always been the debate over whether the Body Mass Index (BMI) is an appropriate measure for children, so there are methodological issues, but that doesn't change the findings,&quot; Sir Collin said.</p>
<p>He said while obesity is a major concern in the Pacific, finding solutions won't be easy.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the best efforts of a whole lot of people, we don't seem to have found any way of curbing the rapid rise in overweight and obesity in children and young people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One possible solution was for governments to impose a tax on unhealthy food stuffs, including soft drinks.</p>
<p>The report stated that children are considered to be overweight when they are significantly heavier than what is healthy for their age, sex and height.</p>
<p>UNICEF defines overweight as a body mass index greater than one standard deviation above the World Health Organization's median for healthy growth.</p>
<p>Obesity is more than two standard deviations above and leads to a higher risk of developing life-threatening diseases.</p>
<p>The report warns that ultra-processed and fast foods - high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives - are shaping children's diets through unhealthy food environments, rather than personal choice.</p>
<p>It said these products dominate shops and schools, where digital marketing gives the food and beverage industry powerful access to young people.</p>
<p>Without interventions to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, countries could face lifetime health and economic impacts exceeding, for example, US$210 billion in Peru, due to obesity-related health issues.</p>
<p>By 2035, the global economic impact is expected to surpass US$4 trillion annually.</p>

      <h1>'Love letter to Mum' shares dementia journey</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Susan Suisuiki, Pacific Waves presenter</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> A Samoan caregiver is using social media to highlight the realities of caring for someone with dementia.</p>
<p>Sapini Unoi and his mother Mutalau have gained thousands of followers on their TikTok account.</p>
<p>Unoi describes their online platform as his &quot;love letter to Mum&quot;, sharing snippets of their daily routine and conversations.</p>
<p>Speaking to Pacific Waves, Unoi said when his mother was diagnosed with dementia eight years ago, he automatically assumed the role of caring for her due to being the youngest child and identifying as fa'afafine.</p>
<p>Mutalau Unoi migrated to New Zealand from Samoa as an adolescent, attending Kelston Girls in West Auckland before heading into nursing school when she was 19 years old.</p>
<p>She spent 25 years as a nurse before she made the switch to teaching. Unoi said his mum's love of serving people at church as a Sunday school teacher inspired her to make the move.</p>
<p>However, things took a turn when Unoi noticed his mother repeating questions every hour or so. He said his mother's condition progressively got worse when she retired from teaching and when the Covid pandemic had hit.</p>
<p>Recently, Unoi made the decision to leave his full-time role to focus solely on his mother, but while it does add another level of complexity, he said he won't trade any precious time with her for a career that would still be there when his mother dies.</p>
<p>He set up a Givealittle page to raise money for living costs and bills.</p>
<p>Unoi said discussions about who will care for relatives with dementia should be normalized within Pacific families, as it wasn't the case for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost like, I'd like to say, an inheritance,&quot; Unoi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I inherited this role because of my place in my family, and because of my lifestyle and because of, again, my lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>&quot;It needs to be normalized. Because to not have the discussion, and then to expect someone to deal with what they're dealing with and then have to add on, having to be a caregiver, and then all of the emotions, the roller coaster of emotions and the exhaustion; the list goes on.&quot;</p>
<p>Unoi noted that while there are support systems and resources for people with dementia, there's barely any help for caregivers particularly those in the Pacific community.</p>
<p>The challenges of being a caregiver led to Unoi creating a Tiktok account as well as an online forum for other Pasifika caregivers.</p>
<p>He said he's been overwhelmed with the responses and messages on Tiktok.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very surreal ... although I'm very bubbly and out the gate and very outspoken, I'm still getting used to people stopping us and talking to us and noticing mum because she's the star of the show, you know, not me.&quot;</p>
<p>Unoi said reading the comments on their social media page pulls at his heartstrings.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm crying in my quiet times because how touched I am at these messages,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what pops out the most and I think again, is the scary thing which should not be scary and should be challenged, is the amount of people that are doing it by themselves, no family or family present, and no family help.&quot;</p>
<p>For other Pacific families who are coping with dementia, Unoi stresses the importance of talanoa.</p>
<p>&quot;Start to rally up as a family and start to talk about, 'what if?' What if this happens to our parents? Who is going to do it?</p>
<p>&quot;Start normalizing the conversations that need to be had, because they're vital.&quot;</p>

<p>The Port Moesby General Hospital tells us that between April and June each year, up to 50 babies are delivered every day. That amounts to a whopping 15,000 babies in just three months of the year alone. And these births are recorded every year for a while now.</p>
<p>The number will become frightening when the total annual number of births are added to this number, or when you add the number being born at all health facilities around the country or at homes. The number will run to hundreds of thousands.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will hear arguments on January 21 in President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a move without precedent that challenges the central bank’s independence. The justices said in October that they would hear arguments in the case before deciding a Justice Department request to lift a judge’s order that temporarily blocked the Republican president from removing Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden. That action effectively left Cook in place for the time being.</p>

In letters released Wednesday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and 39 other Democratic lawmakers urged like-minded governors to ensure that their residents’ data wasn’t being vacuumed up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become the speartip of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program.</p>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Justice Department has provided a legal justification that makes clear that U.S. military personnel involved in strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels are immune from prosecution, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Since early September, the U.S. military has carried out at least 19 strikes against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coast of Latin America, killing at least 76 people. Legal experts and Democratic lawmakers have questioned the legality of the strikes and many say they do not adhere to the laws of war.</p>

      <h1>Supreme Court Justices speak up: The Constitution does not grant Congress “Plenary Power” over U.S. territories</h1>

(date: 2025-11-12)

<p>By</p>
<p>Right to Democracy staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> U.S. Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas joined together on Monday to issue a written opinion disputing the view that the “Territories Clause” of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress with “plenary power” over residents of U.S. territories.</p>
<p>The opinion was issued in dissent to the Supreme Court’s decision not to review <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-5191.html%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Veneno v. United States</a>, in which the defendant, Quentin Veneno, Jr., <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-5191/320898/20240726123005099_Petition%20for%20Certiorari%20-%20Veneno.pdf%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">challenged</a> the Court’s 1886 decision in United States v. Kagama and “the constitutional authority [of Congress] to criminalize the conduct of Indians on Indian land.” Justices Gorsuch and Thomas would have granted review to consider whether “the federal government enjoys ‘plenary power’ over the internal affairs of Native American Tribes.” The petition for Supreme Court review in Veneno had been pending for over a year, since July 26, 2024.</p>
<p>“The idea that Congress has unrestricted plenary power over U.S. territories is not grounded in the text or history of the U.S. Constitution. But until now the federal government’s reliance on this near-unlimited power has never been questioned by any federal judge, much less a Supreme Court Justice. It is significant to have two Justices now calling into question this unrestrained congressional authority over people in U.S. territories,” said Attorney Neil Weare, co-director of <a href="https://www.righttodemocracy.us/%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">Right to Democracy</a>, which works to advance democracy, equity, and self-determination in U.S. territories.</p>
<p>Monday’s opinion critiqued the idea that the Territories Clause might serve as a basis for Congress to criminalize the conduct of Indians on tribal land, stating that “[The Territories Clause” affords Congress only the power to make ‘needful Rules and Regulations’ for ‘Territor[ies] … belonging to the United States.” It then concluded that “[the Territories] Clause, rightly understood,” did not “endow the federal government with plenary power even within the Territories themselves.”</p>
<p>In support of that proposition, the opinion cited to Justice Gorsuch’s earlier concurring opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=304826987936580518&amp;q=vaello+madero&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000006%22%20%5Co%20%22This%20external%20link%20will%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">United States v. Vaello Madero</a>, in which he explained: “Monarchical and despotic governments may possess the power to act unrestrained by written constitutions. But our Nation's government has no existence except by virtue of the Constitution, and it may not ignore that charter in the Territories any more than it may in the States.”</p>
<p>“People across all five U.S. territories have consistently rejected the exercise of undemocratic, unchecked power over our communities by the federal government. The repudiation of this plenary power by these two conservative Justices is timely as we approach the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and consider what ‘consent of the governed’ means for people in U.S. territories who have been denied self-determination for over 125 years,” said Dr. Adi Martinez Román, co-director of Right to Democracy, an organization that does not take a position on political status.</p>
<p>“As concerns about authoritarian rule grow across the United States, these cautionary words about the breathtakingly expansive scope of congressional power over tribal communities and people in U.S. territories deserves more attention,” Weare added.</p>
<p>Right to Democracy will be convening a panel of legal experts to discuss these important developments later this month.</p>

<p>A former primary school teacher and principal has won his wrongful termination case against Porgera SDA International Primary School after the National Court found that he was unfairly dismissed over a misappropriation allegation that was later withdrawn.</p>
<p>Justice Graham Ellis, sitting in Wabag, ruled last Friday that Samson Aipita was wrongfully terminated in 2012 and ordered the school, formally known as Porgera International School Inc, to pay him K28,781.91, inclusive of interest, plus costs on an indemnity basis.</p>

<p>Surgeons and theatre staff at Angau Memorial Hospital have told the Special Parliamentary Committee inquiry into the Morobe Provincial Health Authority that constant power cuts and a faulty steriliser are forcing the hospital to cancel almost half of its scheduled operations.</p>
<p>Clinicians revealed that 40 to 45 percent of surgeries are now being postponed — nearly three times higher than the World Health Organisation’s safe surgery benchmark of 15 percent. They blamed the high cancellation rate on repeated steriliser breakdowns, inconsistent power supply, and shortages of sutures and other vital consumables.</p>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration returned to the Supreme Court on Monday in another attempt to halt full federal funding for food stamps, seeking to stymie the nation’s largest anti-hunger program even as the government shutdown neared its end.</p>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Monday approved a compromise that would end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, breaking a weeks-long stalemate that has disrupted food benefits for millions, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers unpaid and snarled air traffic. The 60-40 vote passed with the support of nearly all of the chamber’s Republicans and eight Democrats, who unsuccessfully sought to tie government funding to health subsidies that are due to expire at the end of the year. While the agreement sets up a December vote on those subsidies, which benefit 24 million Americans, it does not guarantee they will continue.</p>

      <h1>Trump says US faces ‘economic disaster’ if Supreme Court rules against tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday the United States faced an economic and national security disaster if the Supreme Court ruled against his use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs against nearly every country. Trump said his administration planned to issue a $2,000 payment to lower- and middle-income Americans using the tariff dividends, while using the remaining proceeds to lower U.S. debt. Trump, who has previously floated the idea of using tariff revenues to pay what he calls a “dividend” to lower-earning Americans, repeated it in a Truth Social post on Sunday and during remarks to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday.</p>

      <p>Last week I wrote about mashed potatoes but did not include the recipe. I was guilty of boiling potatoes in a pot of water, which, after the potatoes are drained, flavors as well as the starches that add creaminess, are all going down the drain. This recipe from Milk Street has only 1-1/2 cups of water to 3 cups of potatoes which is just enough water to cook the potatoes without drowning it.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — A feral rooster lands upon a Range Officer for a sip from his water bottle at the Koko Head Public Shooting Range in Hawaii Kai, Hawaii.</p>

<p>In a historical similar local connection, the Western Samoa Shooting Association was created, in part as an alternative sporting outlet, to redirect from the rampart slaughter of fruit bats, beyond the needs of individual hunters.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Pacific civil society groups say 2025 has been a big year for the ocean.</p>
<p>Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) representative Maureen Penjueli said the Pacific Ocean is being hyper-militarized and there is a desire for seabed minerals to be used to build-up military capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;Critical minerals, whether from land or from the deep ocean itself, have a military end use, and that's been made very clear in 2025,&quot; Penjueli said during the Pacific Network on Globalization (PANG) 2025 State of the Ocean webinar.</p>
<p>&quot;They're deemed extremely vital for defense industrial base, enabling the production of military platforms such as fighter aircraft, tanks, missiles, submarines.</p>
<p>&quot;2025 is the year where we see the link between critical minerals on the sea floor and use [in the] military.&quot;</p>
<p>PANG's Joey Tau said one of the developments has been the increase in countries calling for a moratorium or pause on deep sea mining, which is now up to 40.</p>
<p>&quot;Eight of which are from the Pacific and a sub-regional grouping the MSG (Melanesian Spearhead Group) still holds that political space or that movement around a moratorium.&quot;</p>
<p>Tau said it comes as the UN-sanctioned International Seabed Authority tries to come to an agreement on deep-sea mining rules at the same time as the United States is considering its own legal pathway.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bad precedent setting by the US, we hope that the ISA both assembly and the council would hold ground and warn the US.&quot;</p>
<p>He said unlike US, China spoke about the importance of multilateralism and it for global partners to maintain unity within the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) agreement which has not been ratified by the United States.</p>
<p>Also in February was the deep sea minerals talanoa, where Pacific leaders met to discuss deep sea mining.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of our countries sit on different sides of the table on this issue. You have countries who are sponsoring and who are progressing the agenda of deep-sea mining, not only within their national jurisdiction, but also in the international arena,&quot; Tau said.</p>
<p>In May, UN human rights experts expressed concern about the release of treated nuclear wastewater.</p>
<p>Japan's government has consistently maintained the release meets international safety standards, and monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency shows there is no measurable impact beyond Japan's coastal waters.</p>
<p>However, Ocean Vision Legal's Naima Taafaki-Fifita said as well as being an environmental issue, it is also a legal and moral problem.</p>
<p>&quot;By discharging these radioactive contaminants into the Pacific, Japan risks breaching its obligations under international law,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;[The UN special rapporteurs] caution that this may pose grave risks to human rights, particularly the rights to life, health, food and culture, not only in Japan, but across the Pacific.&quot;</p>
<p>Taafaki-Fifita said it was a &quot;deeply personal&quot; issue for Pacific people who live with the nuclear legacy of testing.</p>
<p>In September, what is known as the &quot;High Seas Treaty&quot; received its 60th ratification which means it will now be legally effective in January 2026.</p>
<p>The agreement allows international waters - which make up nearly two-thirds of the ocean - to be placed into marine protected areas.</p>
<p>Taafaki-Fitita said it was important that Pacific priorities are visible and heard as the treaty gets implemented.</p>

<p>Viriolo is a small coastal village about four hours’ drive from Port Moresby, nestled at the mouth of a river and sharing its shores with neighbouring Kapari in the Abau District of Central Province. To reach Viriolo, one must take a dinghy across the river to the village that quite literally floats on water.</p>
<p>This is where the story of Kumul #322, Gairo Voro, begins, a name now well-known in rugby league circles across Central Province and Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p>At a time when uncertainty grips the U.S. government and U.S. federal operations slow to a crawl, one Samoan attorney has chosen a path of certainty — service to her people. Maj Louise Lafitaga, a United States Air Force Attorney (JAG), is leaving behind an active-duty career in the U.S. Air Force, returning home with her family to American Samoa to join the Office of the Attorney General, determined to give back to the community that raised her.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Ensign Alexis VanBuren,</p>
<p>Commander, Logistics Group Western Pacific</p>
<p><em>APIA, Samoa —</em> Pacific Partnership 2025 hosted a Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) key leadership symposium, Oct. 23-24, bringing together Samoan national leaders and representatives from partner nations including Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>This two-day conference focused on incorporating the contributions and specific needs of women into planning for disaster management, improving access to health care, preventing violence against vulnerable populations, and strengthening civil society.</p>
<p>“Pacific Partnership is about preparing in calm to respond together in crisis,” said Capt. Mark Stefanik, mission commander of Pacific Partnership 25. “That spirit of readiness extends beyond disaster response – it includes strengthening the systems that protect and empower every member of society.”</p>
<p>Loau Donina Tili Vaa, Chief Executive Officer of Samoa’s Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development, delivered opening remarks on behalf of the Samoan government. She spoke about the country’s progress and ongoing challenges in advancing gender equality.</p>
<p>Vaa noted that while Samoans have seen significant improvements in girls’ performance in secondary education, women’s participation in the workforce remains disproportionately low. Domestic and sexual violence are also persistent concerns.</p>
<p>Addressing the Pacific Partnership nations present at the symposium, Ms. Vaa said, “Your collaboration reaffirms that peace is not the absence of conflict but the presence of cooperation. In Samoa, when cyclones strike or disasters unfold, it is the women’s committees and village representatives who mobilize first — assessing needs, coordinating food, and caring for children and elders long before the formal response arrives.”</p>
<p>“WPS ties together all of the Pacific Partnership lines of effort – medical, engineering, disaster management, and host nation outreach and engagement – to ensure that our efforts are having a whole-of-population impact,” said Capt. Laura Gilstrap, Women’s Affairs Advisor for Pacific Partnership 25 and the lead organizer of the event. Pacific Partnership is all about working by, with, and through local partners, and that can only be effective if we’re working with the entire population.”</p>
<p>The WPS framework, established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted Oct. 31, 2000, established the WPS framework, which reaffirms the essential role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, humanitarian response, and post-conflict reconstruction. On Oct. 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017, requiring the U.S. Government to integrate women’s participation into its foreign policy, national security, and development efforts in conflict zones. In 2019, the U.S. Government released the U.S. WPS Strategy, making the United States the first country to adopt both a comprehensive law and whole-of-government strategy on WPS.</p>
<p>Pacific Partnership is the largest annual multinational humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted in the Indo-Pacific. The mission fosters multilateral cooperation and strengthens collective capacity to respond to crises while promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region grounded in shared respect and partnership.</p>

      <h1>New short story collection especially for young people searching for stories that reflect their lives</h1>

<p>Source: press release</p>
<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em> Samoa has an exciting new literary voice with the upcoming publication of Am I There Yet?, the debut short story collection by Samoan poet, educator, and proud fa’afafine author Nicki Perese <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The collection takes its name from the opening story, a piece that sets the emotional tone and guiding question that echoes throughout the book: “Am I there yet?” - a phrase that speaks not only to a physical journey, but to the deeper, personal movement toward identity, belonging, purpose, and self-understanding. The title becomes a metaphor for navigating life’s turning points, challenges, and quiet triumphs.</p>
<p>Although the stories in this collection are fictional, they are firmly rooted in experiences, themes, and realities familiar to Samoan and Pacific communities. Perese’s writing draws from everyday life in Samoa. Moments of humor, hardship, cultural responsibility, faith, love, identity, and the unseen emotional currents that shape who we become. Her storytelling captures voices and experiences that are often felt but rarely spoken aloud, weaving narrative with empathy and cultural memory.</p>
<p>Perese shares that her motivation for writing the collection grew from observing the world around her, conversations within villages, the vibrancy of family life, unspoken struggles between friends, and the unique spirit of Samoa’s youth. She believes storytelling is not new to Samoan people; it is part of who we are. From fāgogo shared at night, to family stories, village humor, household gossip, and everyday reflections, Samoans are natural storytellers. What she hopes this collection will encourage is the confidence for Samoans to see their stories as worthy of being written, studied, and celebrated.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her writing journey, Perese notes, “Writing is about the process, you must trust it, grow through it, and enjoy it,” spoken with the warm laughter and humility she is known for.</p>
<p>This collection is particularly meaningful as it is written by a Samoan author, for Samoan readers especially young people searching for stories that reflect their lives, their families, their language, and their dreams. It also speaks to the Samoan diaspora who continue to carry home within them, no matter where they live.</p>
<p>Am I There Yet? will be launched later this month on TalaSamoa.com, and available worldwide in both ebook and then print format.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Caleb Fotheringham &amp; Tiana Haxton</p>
<p>RNZ Pacific journalists</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> There is still not enough known about the seafloor to decide if deep sea mining can start in the Cook Islands, an ocean scientist with the government authority in charge of seabed minerals says.</p>
<p>The Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA) returned last week from a 21-day deep-sea research expedition on board the United States exploration vessel EV Nautilus.</p>
<p>The trip was also funded by the United States and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>High-resolution imagery and data were collected in a bid to better understand what lives on the seafloor.</p>
<p>SBMA knowledge management officer Dr John Parianos said the findings would guide decisions about seabed mining.</p>
<p>&quot;One day someone will have to make a decision about what to do and it's clear today we don't know enough to make a decision,&quot; Parianos said.</p>
<p>On its return, EV Nautilus was confronted by a group of kayakers holding signs that read: &quot;Don't mine the moana&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the protesters, Louisa Castledine told RNZ Pacific she is conscious both NOAA and Nautilus had a reputation for being &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; but is concerned about research being &quot;weaponized&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This research is being used to help enable and guide decision making towards deep-sea mining,&quot; Castledine said who is the spokesperson for Ocean Ancestors.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the guise in which this research is being utilized, and it's who sent them is the challenge, because who sent them is quite clear on their intent in mining.</p>
<p>In August, the US and the Cook Islands agreed to work closer in the area of seabed minerals to &quot;advance scientific research and the responsible development of seabed mineral resources&quot;.</p>
<p>It came off the back of the Cook Islands signing a five-year agreement with China to cooperate in exploring and researching seabed minerals.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Trainer, a geopolitical analyst with Terra Global Insights, said both countries are interested in the metals to enhance military capabilities but it's not the primary market.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes are greater for other industries such as the renewable energy sectors and in China there's huge demand for electric vehicles.&quot;</p>
<p>Trainer said China is ahead of the US in obtaining critical minerals through land mining and mineral processing.</p>
<p>&quot;The US is seeming to choose to start with the supply side of things, get the minerals, and then perhaps work up the knowledge of production and refining.&quot;</p>
<p>Castledine said the region is in the middle of a &quot;geopolitical storm&quot; with the US and China vying for control over deep-sea minerals.</p>
<p>&quot;The USA's building their military might within the Pacific and this is one of those ways in which their reach is moving more into the Pacific and more specifically into Cook Islands waters.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nautilus expedition focused on discovery and the chance to test new deep-sea technology.</p>
<p>Expedition lead Renato Kane said bad weather threatened the mission, however it cleared up in time to send their ROVs down.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had six really successful dives to the sea floor. We're diving these vehicles down to over 5000 meters depth and the length of these dives were on average, about 30 hours each. So we've got a lot of high definition video footage for scientific observation on the sea floor.&quot;</p>
<p>Central to the expedition's success was the testing of a new, ultra-high-resolution camera, the MxD SeaCam, designed for deep-sea research at depths of up to 7000 metres.</p>
<p>The camera combines a compact broadcast camera with custom-built titanium housing to capture 4K images with remarkable clarity.</p>
<p>Dr John Parianos said it is some of the best footage ever recorded several kilometres below the surface.</p>
<p>He said footage would help create the Cook Islands first public catalogue of deep-sea life.</p>
<p>&quot;We've benefited from probably the highest resolution images ever taken at these depths in the whole world ever.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to make a catalogue of the types of life in the Cook Islands seabed so that researchers in the future can reference it. Having such high-quality images means that the catalogue will be even better quality than what exists internationally today.&quot;</p>
<p>Tanga Morris, who was responsible for logging data of both biological and geological discoveries on the expedition, said she was in awe of the various life forms they observed.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main ones that's quite dominant down in the deep sea would be deep-sea sponges. We've seen them in different species, morphotypes, and sizes, even a whole garden of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Other creatures found were sea stars, anemones, octopi and eels - some of which have possibly never been seen before.</p>
<p>&quot;A few people have asked questions like, 'have you guys spotted any unidentified species?' And I think we have come across a few, but then it will take a while to really be sure. But if so, what a great milestone it is for us to acknowledge that within our Cook Island waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr Antony Vavia, a senior research fellow at Te Puna Vai Marama, the Cook Islands Centre for Research, said the opportunity to go onboard and study deep-sea organisms firsthand was an eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that I've seen down there has been a bit of a wow for me, [I'm] just amazed at how much life is down there. I was talking to my former supervisor, and he described us as the astronauts of the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>A notable feature of the EV Nautilus was its 24/7 online livestream.</p>
<p>He said people from around the world tuned in during dives to see the deep-sea discoveries for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Being able to show what our ROV - what is ROV, the little Hercules, is seeing in real time, and so having the wholesome thought that we're not on this exploration journey alone, but the fact that we can broadcast it to anyone that is interested and invested in learning more about our deep sea environments is incredibly rewarding, because you feel like you're pulling in others to be a part of this discovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Vavia who is also a lecturer at the Auckland University of Technology, said many schools and university groups got involved, broadcasting the deep-sea right into their classrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunities to reach out to schools from a primary school level all the way up to university has been a great opportunity to showcase the science that we're doing here, and hopefully to inspire younger generations and those that are already in the pursuit of careers in marine science or doing work on board research vessels such as the EV Nautilus.&quot;</p>
<p>The EV Nautilus crew said this element of the voyage helps to answer the public's questions on what life is found on the seabed.</p>
<p>Crew member and journalist Madison Dapcevich said they hope their passion inspires future scientists.</p>
<p>&quot;Something that's really great about Nautilus is we do have this like childlike wonder. We do get really excited about sponges, which most people are not that excited about. And then it's also a great pathway for early career professionals. So, we do have an internship and fellowship program, and those applications are open right now through the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The teams findings that will form their first public catalogue of deep-sea life will be a foundation for future research and one day, the difficult decisions about what lies beneath.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Asi Andrew Fa'asau</p>
<p><a href="mailto:andrew@samoanews.com">andrew@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Speaking from Auckland, New Zealand — where he has been receiving scheduled medical treatment for a leg injury since September 21st — Prime Minister of Samoa, Hon. Laaulialemalietoa Leuatea Polataivao Fosi Schmidt, updated the public on the Atoa o Samoa Talks — set to resume in early 2026, with the exact date to be confirmed in the coming weeks — during a Monday night interview with local podcaster Taupau Tauleave Toluono.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s appearance on My View, Your Take — a segment of the Talatala Le Ta'ui podcast hosted by Taupau — marked the launch of a weekly program dedicated to exploring issues that strengthen ties and foster development between the two Samoas through mutual collaboration.</p>
<p>This is Part II of the segment, reported in Samoa News on Wednesday, November 5, 2025.</p>
<p>During the podcast, Taupau raised the importance of fostering sporting exchanges between the two Samoas, emphasizing their potential to elevate the standard of national teams ahead of international competitions, promote genuine sportsmanship, and revive traditional sports that once served as powerful unifiers across communities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed full support for the proposal, affirming that it deserves a place on the agenda of the upcoming Atoa o Samoa Talks. He specifically highlighted the decline of traditional sports in Samoa, noting that the iconic Fautasi races — once a source of national pride — have largely faded from the local sporting landscape, while they continue to thrive in American Samoa.</p>
<p>“American Samoa is so far ahead in Fautasi racing,” Laauli remarked. “Villages are rowing state-of-the-art fautasi made of fiberglass and equipped with sliding seats, costing close to a million dollars. In Samoa, the opposite is happening — villages no longer want to row their old wooden fautasi.”</p>
<p>With a touch of humor, the Prime Minister suggested inviting five or six fautasi crews from American Samoa to compete during Samoa’s Independence celebrations, and playfully proposed that their hosts offer to sell the boats at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Laauli lamented the decline of Samoan kirikiti (cricket) in Samoa, where the sport was first introduced by missionaries in the 19th century and once flourished as a national pastime. He recalled that village matches often spanned two to three days, drawing crowds and fostering community spirit.</p>
<p>“Now, it is practically a dead sport in Samoa because everyone is playing international cricket,” Laauli remarked. “The benefits of international cricket are all very well, but Samoan kirikiti used to be our national sport — and it needs to be revived.”</p>
<p>He noted that, like fautasi racing, kirikiti remains vibrant in American Samoa and among Samoan diaspora communities in New Zealand, Australia, Hawai‘i, and the U.S. mainland. “But in Samoa, where it all began, it’s practically extinct. That’s very sad, and something must be done to bring it back.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the golden era of sports in both Samoas, the Prime Minister reminisced about the excitement of inter-island competitions across rugby, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and especially boxing.</p>
<p>“Those were the golden years of boxing in both Samoas,” he recalled. “We produced formidable boxers like George Tanoa, Aso Paletaoga, Vai, my cousin Fosi Schmidt, Monty Betham, and William White. Samoan boxers were a force to be reckoned with—and they were respected throughout the Pacific region.”</p>
<p>Following the discussion on sports, Taupau shifted the dialogue to joint agricultural initiatives, specifically livestock development aimed at providing consumers in American Samoa with access to fresh meat sourced from Samoa.</p>
<p>The proposal has sparked considerable controversy, with critics — including members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament.</p>
<p>Taupau asked Prime Minister Laauli whether he plans to revisit the matter when the Atoa o Samoa Talks resume next year.</p>
<p>In response, Laauli acknowledged the complexity of launching a cattle farming operation, noting that such an undertaking would only be viable as a joint venture. He proposed a collaborative model involving the purchase of up to 2,000 cattle from Australia, to be divided between the two governments.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister emphasized that the primary goal is to make fresh meat more accessible to consumers in American Samoa, in contrast to the current reliance on meat that has been refrigerated for extended periods. He further claimed that the practice of importing fresh meat from Samoa — once approved by the USDA — was abruptly discontinued following the September 11 terrorist attacks, citing heightened security and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>Laauli affirmed that key agricultural exports —i ncluding taro, bananas, fish, and vegetables — have already received approval for trade between Samoa and American Samoa. He noted that following the FAST party’s rise to power in 2021, he personally advocated for a joint agricultural venture between the two governments to strengthen regional food security.</p>
<p>As part of a pilot initiative, Samoa donated five cattle, five sheep, and over 500 oysters to American Samoa, laying the groundwork for future collaboration in livestock and aquaculture development.</p>
<p>However, the project drew criticism from members of the public and the Opposition in the Samoa Parliament, who accused the previous administration of gifting 400 acres of government land to the American Samoa Government — despite the fact that the proposed cattle farm had not yet commenced.</p>
<p>“Despite the political allegations, I remain fully committed to this initiative,” Laauli declared. “It is a vital development that will benefit both countries, and I urge any future administration to continue its implementation to ensure food security for the well-being of our people.”</p>
<p>Taupau concluded the interview by turning attention to the highly anticipated Rugby League Pacific Championship final this weekend between Toa Samoa and the New Zealand Kiwis. He asked the Prime Minister whether he planned to travel to Australia to witness the match in person.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed that he had received an official invitation from Australia but shared that he would not be attending due to medical advice. His doctor has advised against air travel given his current physical condition.</p>
<p>In his stead, Laauli announced that the Minister for Sports, Laumatiamanu Ringo Purcell, will represent the Government of Samoa at the match.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Laauli expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the sons of Samoa who have stepped forward to represent their heritage on the international stage.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that many of these gifted athletes had been offered substantial financial incentives to play for New Zealand or Australia. Yet, they chose instead to honor their roots — traveling at their own expense to don the blue jersey and represent Samoa with pride.</p>
<p>“As the Samoan proverb goes, ‘E lele le toloa ae ma’au i le vai’—the tolóa, or Pacific duck, may fly far, but it always returns to the water,” Laauli reflected. “Wherever in the world you reside, and wherever in the world you were born, Samoa is your heritage—the land of your ancestors. Thank you for your service.”</p>
