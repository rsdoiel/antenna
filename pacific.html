NIH’s words matter, especially to long COVID patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate&amp;#8217;s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has proposed allocating $1 billion annually for 10 years to the National Institutes of Health for long COVID research. One potential stumbling block to this good idea is bipartisan criticism of the NIH&amp;#8217;s sluggishness in producing useful results from the initial $1.15 billion allocated to long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>“NO good deed goes unpunished.” This idiom conveys the idea even when
we do something with the best of intentions, it doesn’t always guarantee
that the outcome will be positive. Despite initial efforts to do good
the recipients of the good intentions may find themselves facing
unanticipated challenges, resentment or ingratitude. This is certainly
true of the disaster grants awarded to the CNMI by the U.S. Department

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON &amp;#8212; President Joe Biden on Saturday signed legislation reauthorizing a key U.S. surveillance law after divisions over whether the FBI should be restricted from using the program to search for Americans&amp;#8217; data nearly forced the statute to lapse. Barely missing its midnight deadline, the Senate had approved the bill by a 60-34 vote hours earlier with bipartisan support, extending for two years the program known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Biden thanked congressional leaders for their work.&lt;/p&gt;
