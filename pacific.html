<p>(NAPSI)—Behind every sip of Anheuser-Busch’s industry-leading beers
is a farmer who worked hard to grow the high-quality rice, barley, corn,
or hops inside that beer. This National Farmer’s Day, Anheuser-Busch is
raising a toast to the more than 700 farmers across the country who make
our beers possible.</p>
