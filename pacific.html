<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> December 19, 2025) Pavaia’i Elementary School has received national recognition through the America Celebrates display, as artwork created by students from Ms. Loimata Siona’s 4th grade class were selected for exhibition at the White House. The program features handcrafted ornaments representing every U.S. state, territory, and the District of Columbia, all showcased around the iconic National Christmas Tree.</p>
<p>The ornaments submitted by Ms. Siona’s elementary class were designed during the previous school year, reflecting the culture, pride, and unique identity of American Samoa.</p>
<p>Each year, the America Celebrates program provides students across the nation with an opportunity to represent their home state or territory through original artwork that becomes part of a holiday tradition in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>The National Christmas Tree, along with the accompanying state and territory ornaments, will remain on display at the White House through January 1, 2026.</p>
<p>Visitors from around the world will have the opportunity to admire the creativity, talent, and cultural expression of young artists from across the United States and its territories.</p>

<p>“May God especially bless and each of them and these families, with ‘many happy returns’ to our island home. This Christmas, we keep our Toa o Samoa especially in our prayers – thank you to each one for your service and sacrifice!

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> In observance of the New Year holiday, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula has announced that the government will officially take two days off — Thursday, January 1, 2026 and Friday, January 2nd. However, Wednesday, while not a holiday, will be a half day, with an early release from work at 12p.m.</p>
<p>As per usual on a government holiday all government offices will be closed, and normal operations will be suspended. Employees of the American Samoa Government who are not required to perform essential services shall be excused from duty. Those employees whose duties are essential and are required to work on these holidays shall receive holiday compensation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>“Government operations shall resume under normal business hours on Monday, January 5th 2026.</p>
<p>“The New Year marks a time of renewal, reflection, and hope as we look ahead to new opportunities and responsibilities. It is also a moment to give thanks for God’s guidance and blessings throughout the past year. Employees are encouraged to spend this time with family and loved ones, reflect on the yer past, and prepare for the year ahead with renewed purpose, unity, and commitment in serving our community.”</p>
<p>Governor Puaali’i extends his sincere appreciation for their continued service and dedication to the people of the Territory. “May the New Year bring you good health, success, and prosperity.</p>
<p>Samoa News should note that the governor is currently off island, with no return date currently announced.</p>
<p>The US Post Office Service will be closed New Year’s Day, returning on Friday, Jan. 2nd, as per normal federal holiday.</p>
<p>The Territorial Bank of American Samoa (TBAS) will close early at 12 pm, on Wednesday, December 31, 2025; on Thursday, Jan 1, 2026 it will be closed; and, it will be open on Friday, Jan. 2nd for full service.</p>
<p>Don’t forget American Samoa is the last “inhabited” country to ring in the New Year — if you want to see the last sunset of 2025 in the Territory, take a ride out to Poloa. On the other hand, if you want to experience the first New Year celebration in the world, you need to fly to Samoa, with the holidays experiencing some of the the busiest flight times for the inter-island airlines.</p>
<p>For StarKist Samoa its cannery shutdown continues for the Christmas and New Year holidays. The shutdown allows for major maintenance work and prepares the cannery for the new year, with the company slated to begin production of pet food in 2026.</p>
<p>With more than 80% of the cannery workforce of more than 2,000 being from Samoa, they have headed home for the holidays. The cannery did arrange for a charter of the Lady Samoa ferry to take its employees to Samoa during Christmas week. It’s unknown if a return-trip ferry has been chartered.</p>
<p>The company’s first day of production for 2026 is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 5th.</p>
<p>Usually New Year in the Territory highlights its NY Eve’s church services before the bars begin to fill to ring in the brand new year.</p>
<p>On New Year Day, look for family or company barbecues at the public beaches and parks. Most grocery stores will be open, with specialty stores and companies usually closing on that day, with all returning to full service on Friday.</p>
<p>According to the National Weather Service- Pago Pago, the weather forecast for New Year’s Day is partly cloudy, isolated showers, highs in the upper 80s, and variable winds up to 10 mph. It looks like mostly a sunny day.</p>
<p>From Thursday night through to Friday, its still partly cloudy however, scattered showers are forecast.</p>
<p>Friday night through Sunday, the weather is mostly cloudy with numerous showers — definitely expect rain throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>For the public’s safety, the police are continuing their Enforcement initiative that began about 2 weeks ago, marking the beginning of a focused effort to enhance road safety during the busy festive season.</p>
<p>Commissioner of Public Safety Taaga Saite Moliga announced the Enforcement initiative noting the deployment of strategically placed roadblocks throughout the community to identify and evaluate drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He noted these roadblocks would be strategically placed in response to real-time traffic patterns, focusing on high-traffic areas during peak travel periods to maximize visibility and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The DPS is maintaining its Holiday Enforcement program, through Saturday, January 3, 2026.</p>
<p>Samoa News will have an issue tomorrow, December 31st, New Year’s eve day and will be off on Thursday, Jan 1st and Friday, Jan. 2nd, returning on Monday, Jan 5th, 2026.</p>
<p>Happy New Year — American Samoa. Be safe, and with God’s grace may we ring in the New Year remembering to be kind to one another.</p>

<p>An Australian tourist says her visit to Papua New Guinea was memorable but ended earlier than planned after the cruise vessel Coral Adventurer ran aground off the Finschhafen coast.</p>
<p>“We visited some remote islands in Papua New Guinea and found everyone extremely friendly and welcoming,” the tourist said. “We loved visiting the villages, meeting the children, and seeing the schools. The snorkelling was amazing, with beautiful reefs and fish. Unfortunately, our adventure ended due to the vessel incident.”</p>

Judge Tony Graf made his two rulings ​on media requests during a video hearing that suspect Tyler Robinson attended by audio link. Robinson spoke only once, replying “yes, your honor,” when asked by Graf whether he was present.</p>

      <h1>Judge grants injunction blocking US from detaining British anti-disinformation activist</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from detaining British anti-disinformation campaigner Imran Ahmed, after the U.S. permanent resident sued officials over an entry ban for his role in what Washington argues is online censorship. Washington imposed visa bans on Tuesday on Ahmed and four Europeans, including French ‍former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accuses them of working to censor freedom of speech or unfairly target U.S. tech giants with burdensome regulation. Ahmed lives in Washington and is believed to be the only of the five currently in the country. The move sparked an outcry from European governments ​who argue regulations and the work of monitoring groups made the internet safer by ​highlighting false information and compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.</p>

<p>During a year-end press conference, the Prime Minister revealed that the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) has already collected 97% of its total 2025 forecast. These collections are K700 million higher than the same period last year.</p>

      <h1>White House orders military to focus on ‘quarantine’ of Venezuela oil</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — ‌The White House has ordered U.S. military forces to focus almost exclusively on enforcing a “quarantine” of Venezuelan oil for at least the next two months, a U.S. official told Reuters, indicating Washington is currently more interested in using economic rather than military means to pressure Caracas. “While military options still exist, the ‍focus is to first use economic pressure by enforcing sanctions to reach the outcome the White House is looking (for),” the official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. While President Donald Trump has been publicly coy about his precise aims regarding Venezuela, he has privately pressured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to ​flee the nation, Reuters has reported. Trump said on Monday it would be ​smart for Maduro to leave power.</p>

      <p>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Democratic senators ‌urged President Donald Trump on Wednesday to reverse a recall of nearly 30 career ambassadors, ‌warning the move leaves a dangerous leadership vacuum that allows adversaries like Russia and China to expand their influence.</p>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Packaged food makers and fast-food restaurants may ‌be forced to overhaul more of their products next year as newly approved, appetite-suppressing GLP-1 pills become available in January, analysts say. More Americans are expected to try the drugs as a pill rather than as a shot because the medication will be cheaper and many patients are hesitant to inject themselves. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy GLP-1 pill on ‍Monday, sending shares of food companies down on Tuesday. Eli Lilly’s rival medication is expected to gain approval from regulators next year.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Son of American Samoa – Francis Mauigoa from the village of Ili’ili, continues to wreak havoc on the football field with the University of Miami “Hurricanes” (No.10), who defeated the Texas A&amp;M (No.7) in a historic 10 - 3 victory this past weekend. They are now scheduled to face the Ohio State ‘Buckeyes’ (No.2) in the Cotton Bowl that is set to kick off on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 2025.</p>
<p>Mauigoa was named Consensus All-American, by the NCAA last Friday. The 6’6, 335lbs anchors a 11-2 Miami Hurricanes team who have much improved from their 10-3 record from last season.</p>
<p>To be named a Consensus All-American, a student-athlete must receive First Team All-America honors from at least three of the five NCAA-recognized selectors: the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.</p>
<p>According to the University of Florida’s recent media release, Mauigoa, received First Team honors from The Sporting News, the Associated Press and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. He anchored an offensive line that powered one of the ACC’s most productive rushing attacks, as Miami totaled 2,456 rushing yards while averaging 188.9 yards per game and 5.7 yards per carry. The Hurricanes also scored 30 rushing touchdowns and limited negative plays, allowing just 203 yards lost on the ground throughout the season.</p>
<p>Francis graduated earlier this month with his Bachelor of Science degree in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s in just three years. Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive.</p>

<p><strong><em>University of Miami graduate Francis Mauigoa, posing with his parent Fa’alialia and Telesia Mauigoa, during his graduation earlier this month, (December 11, 2025). Francis graduated with his Bachelor’s of Science in Communication, earning his Bachelor’s degree in three years – Most college students take four to five years to complete their degree, which makes this accomplishment even more impressive. [photo: courtesy]</em></strong></p>
<p>Mauigoa who is rumored to be a first round draft pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, is the son of Telesia and Fa’alialia Mauigoa of Ili’ili. His older brother and former teammate, Francisco Mauigoa currently plays linebacker for the New York Jets Football Team.</p>

<p>Adding to the significant changes within the University of Miami football program is another Son of Samoa, Keiki Misipeka. Misipeka works in recruiting and personnel and has been part of the program for nearly a year.</p>
<p>During his career, Misipeka has helped and assisted numerous student-athletes from American Samoa, guiding them to Division I and junior college football opportunities. He previously served as the General Manager of Football at the University of Hawaiʻi, taking over the role for the Rainbow Warriors in 2024 after spending two seasons as the running backs coach.</p>
<p>Prior to his time coaching in the Mountain West Conference, Misipeka served as an NFL International Scout for the International Player Pathway (IPP) Program, where he was responsible for scouting the Pacific region, including American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Misipeka is the son of the late Kelemete and Iolani Misipeka of Fagatogo.</p>

<p>IT was the night before Christmas, when of all the places to speed around a bend from, this driver decided to speed into the drain just outside our office. An alcohol fuelled mishap that caused him to skid into our drain ready for our cameras on Christmas coverage operations. Only thing going for him this Christmas was the cops eventually letting him off the hook to recover what looked like a very brand new slick ride now wrecked beyond recognition. We hope the cops are not as forgiving of other naughty motorists tonight.</p>

<p>Community leaders in Gerehu 3A are sounding the alarm on a sophisticated new tactic being used by car thieves, even as local volunteer efforts successfully drive down overall crime rates. According to community leader Penny Son, criminals have moved away from traditional methods and are now using hired taxis to infiltrate the neighborhood undetected.</p>
<p>These suspects reportedly use the cabs to scout for target vehicles and execute thefts, attempting to blend in with normal traffic to bypass security.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s AI hiring campaign draws interest from 25,000 hopefuls</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Roughly 25,000 people have ​expressed ‌interest in joining the ‌Trump administration’s cadre of engineers known as Tech Force, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, as the ‍U.S. government looks to install staff with artificial intelligence expertise in federal roles. The Trump administration will use that ​list to recruit software and ​data engineers, in addition to other tech roles, said Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of ‍Personnel Management, in a post on X. ​Reuters could not independently verify the 25,000 figure. The interested candidates will compete for 1,000 spots in the first Tech Force cohort. The recruits will spend two years working on technology projects inside federal agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, among other government offices, Kupor said previously.</p>

<p>In his Christmas message to the people of Papua New Guinea and Wau-Waria District, Mr Narewec described 2025 as one of the most challenging years for the infant district, with law and order remaining its biggest obstacle to development.</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea’s Golden Jubilee year has been marked not only by celebration but by a bold national reset. Prime Minister James Marape declared 2025 “one of the most consequential years in our history,” unveiling RESET@50, a long‑term roadmap designed to shape the nation’s next two decades.</p>
<p>Launched during the 50th anniversary of Independence, RESET@50 is framed as a generational project. It reviews the country’s first half‑century of nationhood and sets out a 20‑year plan (2025–2045) to strengthen governance, diversify the economy, and investment in human capital. “Fifty years is not the end of a journey. It is the moment we choose whether the next fifty will be better than the first,” Marape told citizens during the Jubilee reflections.</p>

<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Department of Public Safety officially launched its Holiday Enforcement initiative last Friday, marking the beginning of a focused effort to enhance road safety during the busy festive season.</p>
<p>The sobriety roadblock was held in front of the CBT building in Nu’uuli, where close to 20 police officers were working.</p>
<p>Commissioner of Public Safety Taaga Saite Moliga has announced the deployment of strategically placed roadblocks throughout the community to identify and evaluate drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>These roadblocks will be strategically placed in response to real-time traffic patterns, focusing on high-traffic areas during peak travel periods to maximize visibility and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The last weekend before Christmas typically sees a surge in social gatherings, as numerous businesses host their annual holiday parties and end-of-year celebrations. This increase in festivities correlates with a heightened risk of impaired driving, underscoring the importance of vigilance during this critical time.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, Commissioner Moliga is urging all community members to collaborate in fostering a culture of safety and awareness. The goal is to ensure the holiday season remains celebratory while minimizing the risks of impaired driving.</p>
<p>To support this initiative, the Department of Public Safety will maintain its Holiday Enforcement program, which will extend through January 3, 2026.</p>
<p>DPS says this initiative underscores its unwavering commitment to safeguarding public safety throughout the festive season and beyond, ensuring that all community members can enjoy a joyous, accident-free holiday period.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape says 2026 will mark a major transition year for Papua New Guinea, with the Government moving decisively to use artificial intelligence (AI) and information and communications technology (ICT) as core tools to strengthen governance, transparency and efficiency across the public service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Government will begin positioning AI as the “engine room” of government decision-making, supporting critical functions such as public service recruitment and selections, contract awards, project proposal assessments, policy development and the overall performance of government systems.</p>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing ​for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 ‌with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm ‌elections. Trump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status. ICE and Border Patrol will get <span class="math inline">\(170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 — a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about \)</span>19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July. Administration officials say they ‍plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.</p>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>NIIGATA, Japan — The Japanese region of Niigata is expected to endorse a ‌decision to restart the world’s largest nuclear power plant today, a watershed moment in the country’s pivot back to nuclear since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, located about 220 km (136 miles) northwest of Tokyo, was among 54 reactors shut after a massive earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Since then, Japan has restarted 14 of ‍the 33 that remain operable, as it tries to wean itself off imported fossil fuels. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa will be the first operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co, which ran the doomed Fukushima plant.</p>

      <h1>NICTA announces release of Draft SIM Card Registration Regulation 2026</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)

<p>The National Information and Communications Technology Authority (NICTA) of Papua New Guinea has announced the release of the Draft SIM Card Registration (Amendment and Consolidation) Regulation 2026 for public consultation. This initiative is being carried out under Sections 229 and 230 of the National Information and Communications Technology Act 2009, marking an important step in strengthening the country’s telecommunications framework.</p>
<p>Authorized by the acting CEO of NICTA Polume Lume, the proposed regulation seeks to update and consolidate the existing SIM Card Registration Regulation 2016. Key amendments include the integration of digital identity systems, enhanced identity verification processes, and stronger provisions for cybersecurity and data protection. These measures aim to ensure that SIM card registration is secure, reliable, and aligned with modern technological standards. Additionally, the draft introduces certification requirements for SIM registration agents, ensuring accountability and professionalism in the registration process. Recognizing the unique challenges faced in rural and remote areas, the regulation also outlines mechanisms for offline registration, making the process more accessible to communities across Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p>In the 1800s up to1960, in both the German New Guinea and British Papua, the natives were barred from taking alcohol and it was in 1963 that the legislations were introduced to allow Papua New Guineans over 18 years of age to consume alcohol.</p>

      <p>On Dec. 23, 2024, a unique eruption began in Kilauea’s Halema‘uma‘u crater, with a style of activity not seen for nearly 40 years. The eruption, characterized by high lava-fountaining episodes, has continued for nearly a year.

<p>“Every business is having a very hard time, but as a citizen of Lae and Morobe, I can say we have the best police force in the country,” Mr Parker said. “Whenever you call the police for help, they are always on alert and usually the first on the scene.

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA  —</em> The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of American Samoa, a leader in youth development and leadership programs, was recently awarded two prestigious awards from Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) at the Pacific Region Leadership Conference that was held in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>The “100 Club Award” is a recognition given by BGCA to local clubs that are 100% committed to the goals of “Operation Impact” and have demonstrated dedication to implementing this strategic plan and setting bold goals for their future and the youth they serve. Operation Impact was launched in 2024 and key aspects include increasing membership; growing teen participation; boosting average daily attendance; and creating exceptional Club experiences for every young person.</p>
<p>At a luncheon held for Board Members and Executive Leadership, BGCA Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer Lorraine Orr presented the “S.O.A.R. Award”, which is the highest level of recognition given to an organization’s Board of Directors who achieve Gold status for three consecutive years. This distinguished accolade not only recognizes sustained excellence in board engagement but also serves as a testament to the organization’s unwavering commitment to driving the Boys &amp; Girls Club’s mission forward.</p>
<p>This past January, the Chairman of the BGCAS Board of Directors and Chief Volunteer Officer, Mrs. Mary A.T. Tulafono was honored with an official appointment as an “Operation Impact Ambassador” for the Pacific Region. Mrs. Tulafono was formally recognized at the Opening Session of the Pacific Region Leadership Conference for her role and contributions to the BGCA Movement. Mrs. Tulafono, along with BGCAS Executive Director, Sailipea Kennison Barber, accepted both awards on behalf of the local organization.</p>

      <h1>US Senate unanimously approves military helicopter safety legislation</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to toughen military helicopter safety rules and rescind a provision in the annual defense bill that critics said would have weakened aviation safety. Republican Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz on Wednesday won unanimous consent to approve a revised version of legislation that would require aircraft operators by the end of 2031 to equip their fleets with an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system, also known as ADS-B. The bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, also boosts oversight of commercial jet and helicopter traffic and flight routes near commercial airports. Aviation safety in the Washington area has come under scrutiny after the January 29 collision near Reagan Washington National Airport of an American Airlines regional jet and Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people. Cruz said the bill will save lives and “be a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River.”</p>

      <h1>Trump prosecutor Jack Smith defends probes in House testimony</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Jack Smith, the former U.S. Justice Department special counsel who brought two now-dropped criminal cases against President Donald Trump, defended his investigation before a House of Representatives panel on Wednesday, telling lawmakers that the basis for the prosecutions “rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.” Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the Justice Department and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s probe and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system. Smith and his team secured indictments in 2023, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents following his first term in office and plotting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election.

<p>Air Niugini is positioning its new Airbus A220 aircraft as a key strategic tool for expanding its international reach and increasing market competition, particularly on the busy Australian routes.

<p>It has been an inspiring and rewarding journey over the past 50 days as we connected with you through our 50 Days of Integrity campaign. Throughout this series, we have explored critical issues—from corruption trends to the importance of International Anti-Corruption Day—aimed at fostering awareness and accountability. As we wrap up this series, it’s worth pausing to reflect on a key question at the heart of our discussions: What exactly is “corrupt conduct,” and when does ICAC have the authority to act?</p>

<p>Governor Pulaali’i delivered remarks honoring educators for their vital role in shaping the future of the territory’s youth. Addressing teachers directly, the Governor emphasized the significance of their work, stating that, “Each of you carries a responsibility that is both powerful and deeply meaningful”.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday there are no plans to release the full unedited video of the September 2 strikes on a suspected drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean that fueled concerns about the Trump administration’s plans for Venezuela. Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio conducted briefings on Tuesday for every member of the Senate and House of Representatives, responding to lawmakers’ demands for more information about a 3-1/2-month campaign of more than 20 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that have killed more than 80 people.

<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em>(December 15, 2025) A combined total of 6.173 kilograms of methamphetamine, smuggled from American Samoa, was intercepted by Samoa Customs officials in two separate operations at the independent state’s international air and sea ports over the weekend.</p>
<p>In a joint press release issued by the Ministry of Customs and Revenue and the Samoa Police, it was revealed that the first incident involved a targeted operation in which Customs officials identified a suspect upon arrival on the final flight from American Samoa on Friday, December 12, 2025.</p>
<p>A body search was initiated under the legal provisions of the Customs Act, with police assistance required due to the suspect’s reluctance to cooperate. During the search, officers discovered a small bag concealed inside the suspect’s underwear containing five packages. All packages subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine, with a combined weight of 141 grams.</p>

<p>Authorities noted that the successful interception highlights the determination of criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa using any concealment method, including hiding substances in private areas.</p>
<p>The suspect, a 32‑year‑old male from Vaitele and Nu’u, has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of methamphetamine carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The second incident occurred on Saturday morning, December 13, 2025, when Customs officials intercepted 6.032 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken at Matautu Wharf. The shipment, which originated from American Samoa, had been flagged for inspection based on intelligence.</p>
<p>During the search, officers uncovered two vacuum‑packed packages of methamphetamine hidden within the frozen chicken. Authorities noted that this concealment method reflects the continued attempts by criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa disguised as ordinary goods.</p>
<p>A 59‑year‑old male from To’omatagi has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of Class A narcotics carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>These two cases represent the seventh methamphetamine interception at Samoa’s borders this year, following the historic seizure of 9.4 kilograms of methamphetamine in January.</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of Customs and the Commissioner of Police jointly expressed deep concern over the continued attempts to smuggle methamphetamine into Samoa. They emphasized the devastating impact of the drug on families, particularly young people, noting that addiction is escalating and can result in severe harm and even fatalities.</p>
<p>Both leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to protecting Samoa’s borders and safeguarding the well-being of its people.</p>
<p>“Customs and Police remain steadfast in our determination to identify and dismantle drug networks,” they declared in the joint press release. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all those responsible face justice, and to secure a safe, secure, and prosperous Samoa.”</p>
<p>They cautioned individuals involved in illicit drug activities to desist from bringing narcotics into the country, warning that anyone who persists will face severe penalties, including lengthy prison terms.</p>
<p>These operations underscore the importance of close interagency collaboration in combating transnational crime, as highlighted in the joint campaign “Say No to Illegal Drugs / Tete’e atu i Fuala’au Fa’asaina.”</p>
<p>Both leaders commended the professionalism and vigilance demonstrated by all officers involved, noting that the successful operations reflect the continued effectiveness of Samoa’s joint border security efforts.</p>
<p>Of the seven methamphetamine interceptions recorded by Samoan authorities in 2025, four were linked to shipments from American Samoa, while the others originated from the United States.</p>
<p>November 27, 2025: 10 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a can of milk powder (Coffee Mate) were discovered in a shipment from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
<p>November 28, 2025: 99 grams of methamphetamine were intercepted during a routine cargo inspection of goods from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
<p>The other two American Samoa cases — the 141 grams concealed in underwear and the 6.032 kilograms hidden in frozen chicken — are detailed earlier in this article.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that methamphetamine smuggling into Samoa from the Territory had been occurring for some time before the first official interception on November 27, 2025.</p>
<p>This speculation may have prompted then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo to remark to the media in July this year, that American Samoa was the most common route for methamphetamine entering the country. However, he did not provide specific details or evidence to substantiate his claims.</p>
<p>The remarks by Samoa’s former Police Commissioner did not sit well with Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, who argued that the government should investigate the matter thoroughly. He emphasized that such claims reflect poorly on American Samoa and must not go unchallenged.</p>
<p>The issue was also raised in the House of Representatives, prompting the Chairman of the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Avagafono Vaimaga Maiava, to write to Samoa’s then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo. In his letter, Rep. Avagafono stressed that “such claims are serious and, unless supported by concrete evidence, are highly damaging to the reputation of American Samoa, a United States territory that upholds strict drug enforcement policies and border control procedures.”</p>
<p>Rep. Avagafono, himself a former Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, noted in his August 11 letter that the Commissioner’s “comments unfortunately appear to be baseless and not grounded in verifiable facts.” He informed Samoa’s Police leadership that the Legislature had convened a hearing to investigate the claims, during which testimony was received from relevant government departments, including Customs, Public Safety, and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“It was clearly stated that American Samoa is neither a producer of methamphetamine nor a known point of origin for its export to Samoa or any other country,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Despite his criticism, Rep. Avagafono urged cooperation rather than division between the two Samoas in tackling the drug problem.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we believe this shared issue of transnational drug trafficking requires deeper cooperation, not division, between the two Samoas. We encourage the establishment of structured and regular consultations between our respective law enforcement and customs agencies. Collaboration, intelligence sharing, and joint task force efforts are far more effective than unilateral public statements.”</p>
<p>“The fight against drugs is a mutual responsibility that requires trust, open dialogue, and coordinated action. We hope this matter can serve as an opportunity to strengthen our working relationship, rather than weaken it,” Rep. Avagafono concluded.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will replace the fully electric F-150 Lightning with a new extended-range electric model that uses a gas-powered engine to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.</p>

      <p>The oil and gas industry must be legally bound to cut methane emissions. With climate tipping points approaching, time is running out</p>
<p>• Mia Mottley is the prime minister of Barbados</p>
<p>The timing is brutal. Just as the world celebrates the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary">10th anniversary</a> of the adoption of the Paris climate agreement this month, new evidence shows that the world is crashing through the main defence that was constructed against climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>The three-year temperature average is – for the first time – set to exceed the Paris guardrail of 1.5C above preindustrial levels. According to the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record">Copernicus Climate Change Service</a>, 2025 will join 2023 and 2024 as the three warmest since the Industrial Revolution, reflecting the accelerating pace of the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — (December 12, 2025) The American Samoa Department of Health (DOH) proudly celebrated the official re-opening of the Amouli Community Health Center after an extensive period of renovations and upgrades. The ceremony marked a significant milestone for healthcare access on the east side, honoring the clinic’s deep-rooted history dating back to the early 1920s.</p>
<p>Master of Ceremonies, Deputy Director of Health Talalelei Vesi Fautanu welcomed honored guests, including representatives from ASG departments, American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), LBJ Tropical Medical Center, Hollister General Services, and community partners. The opening prayer was delivered by Reverend Catechist Toni Tavite Lolesio of the Amouli Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr. delivered special remarks emphasizing the vital role the Amouli Clinic has served in the community for generations. In particular, he pointed out that the clinic stands as a physical promise to the people of the east side, guaranteeing that healthcare services remain accessible, dependable, and within reach of every family. He expressed sincere appreciation for the doctors, nurses and healthcare providers who travel daily to ensure consistent care for the community.</p>
<p>Project contractor Mr. William Hollister, CEO of Hollister General Services, spoke of his gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to a modernized facility for the east side. The upgrades include a new guard rail and triage room, expanded trauma and prenatal areas, a renovated dental clinic, and numerous interior enhancements. Exterior improvements included critical structural repairs and the addition of a generator shelter for emergency backup power.</p>
<p>DOH Director Dr. Saipale Fuimaono acknowledged the many individuals and agencies whose work made the renovation project possible. He confirmed that this project is one among several initiatives the DOH will complete to ensure equitable access to healthcare resources throughout American Samoa.</p>
<p>The ceremony featured a ribbon cutting led by House Representative Dr. Va’asā Uluiva Simanu, followed by a celebratory cake cutting with Miss American Samoa, Tofoipūpū Unutoa.</p>
<p>Appreciation and acknowledgement was given for all who contributed to the project and a clear indication of the Department of Health’s ongoing commitment to expanding resources and strengthening healthcare services for communities throughout American Samoa.</p>

<p>THE Papua New Guinea Defence Force continues to play a vital role in the country’s security and the Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara reminded the force to remain healthy and fit last Friday during the Chief of Defence Force end of year parade at Murray Barracks, Port Moresby.</p>
<p>“As I always emphasise, stay healthy and fit, eat well and get plenty of rest. Our line of work is demanding and I expect you all to maintain your health and fitness,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that every year the government tasks the PNGDF to support security efforts particularly in the highlands and staying fit and healthy is vital in the force.</p>

      <h1>’tis the Season! ASG Christmas Caroling officially opens</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> ASG’s annual public Christmas celebration kicked off on Wednesday this week at the pavilion in Fagatogo. Officially called “Christmas Caroling” — the program is a 3- day-evening event of choirs composed of employees from different government departments and agencies singing Christmas songs in Samoan and English.</p>
<p>In previous years, there were ‘international’ community choirs that were invited to perform as part of the celebration, however this year it’s government only.</p>
<p>The official lighting of the Territory’s Christmas Tree is still very much a part of the annual celebration — and this year, First Lady Dr. Lois Pula did the honors, on opening night, Wednesday, Dec. 10th.</p>
<p>Each night Caroling begins at 6 pm.</p>
<p>For Wednesday, Welcoming remarks from Lealaisalanoa Alofaga Salanoa, who is the Master of Ceremonies throughout the 3-night program, was followed by the opening hymn performed by the TAOA Choir. Both Invocation &amp; Benediction were offered by Fagatogo CCCAS Rev. Iasepi Ulu.</p>
<p>After the Christmas tree was officially lit by the First Lady, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula gave opening remarks.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s program included 5 choirs comprising 16 different government entities —  Samoan Affairs &amp; Feleti Barstow Public Library; Procurement, Property Management, Public Defender, ALJ &amp; Legal Affairs; DBAS, DMWR, Port Admin &amp; Visitor’s Bureau; DHS &amp; ASCC; and, DPS, Dept of Corrections &amp; Search &amp; Rescue.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful aspects of the annual celebration is the costumes worn by each choir — highlighting the Samoan culture’s love of color and style presented as a unique uniform — puletasi for the women and i’e faitaga &amp; aloha-type shirts for the men — with each choir/ group having their own — becoming a part of the living pulse of the community at that moment.</p>
<p>Of note, the nightly event is a ‘must-attend’ for government department and agency heads or their deputies, as outlined in a memorandum sent out from the Governor’s Office, December 5th. The public often chooses to enjoy the program from home, as usually KVZK-TV streams it live.</p>
<p>Thursday’s Caroling program had 7 choirs: Fono; LBJ &amp; Office of Protection &amp; Advocacy; Administrative Services &amp; DPW; ASTA, Election Office &amp; TEO; DOA, Parks &amp; Rec &amp; Retirement Office; and, Treasury &amp; the Shipyard.</p>
<p>Invocation and Benediction were offered by Father (Patele) Pio Afu of the Amanve Parish.</p>
<p>Friday, tonight is the last night of the ASG Christmas Caroling program and will feature 6 choirs: Office of the Governor &amp; All Line Agencies; DHSS &amp; ASEPA; Dept of Commerce, KVZK &amp; Planning &amp; Budget Office; DHR &amp; DYWA; DoH; and, DOE.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks will be given by a Fono representative (not yet announced).</p>
<p>Invocation and Benediction are to be offered by Rev. Tagiilima Lavilavi of the Methodist- Nuuuli.</p>
<p>Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, American Samoa — May you be Safe and Kind to one another during these festive holidays.</p>

      <p>BOSTON — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unlawfully terminated a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program designed to protect states and communities against natural disasters before they occur. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston sided with 20 mostly Democratic-led states in finding that the Republican president’s administration lacked authority to end the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program and use money Congress approved to support it for other purposes.</p>

<p>“For years, we have struggled to bring our coffee to quality markets in Lae. Most villages are in remote areas without proper roads, which limits how far our coffee can reach. Despite this, we continue to contribute to the national economy through coffee production,” he said.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> “Our elders are the pillars upon which our island stands,” Gov. Pulaali'i Tuiteleleapaga Nikolao Pula declared as he and Lt. Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr. and the American Samoa Government hosted the annual TAOA Christmas Celebration, on Tuesday, December 9, 2025 — a gathering dedicated to honoring the wisdom, prayers, and enduring leadership of American Samoa’s senior citizens.</p>
<p>“Their wisdom lights the path for future generations, and their prayers sustain the strength of our people.”</p>
<p>The celebration began with an invocation and spiritual guidance from Penaia Faali’i, whose words carried the weight of faith and tradition, reminding all present that the elders are the living vessels of prayer and strength who we all seek as a community.</p>
<p>Governor Pulaali’i, in his opening remarks, commended the elders for their devotion, recognizing them as the very leaders whom the government and people alike seek for guidance. “Our elders are the pillars upon which our island stands,” he declared. “Their wisdom lights the path for future generations, and their prayers sustain the strength of our people.”</p>
<p>Distinguished guests included President of the Senate Tuaolo Manaia Fruean and his wife, and Speaker of the House Savali Talavou Ale and his wife, who joined in honoring the elders.</p>
<p>Adding to the event were beautiful hymns performed by the Department of Human and Social Services. Cabinet members joined the Governor and Lt. Governor in serving the festive meal.</p>
<p>Closing remarks were delivered by the Lt. Governor who thanked the elders for their continued devotion to families, villages, and churches, reminding all that their presence is both a gift and a guiding light.</p>
<p>Special recognition was given to elders aged 90 to 101 years old, with a highlight on Mrs. Pouiva Reid, the oldest elder in American Samoa, celebrated for reaching a remarkable milestone.</p>
<p>Pouiva Tauoa Reid- 101 years old</p>
<p>Solialofi Vaili- 94 years old</p>
<p>Pisavale Tialavea Tauai- 92 years old</p>
<p>Pagofie Aloe- 90 years old</p>
<p>Teuaililo Bird- 90 years old</p>
<p>Senator Si’i Noaese- 90 years old</p>
<p>Shang Shung- 90 years old</p>
<p>As the event drew to a close, the Governor, Lt. Governor, and cabinet members presented each elder with a gift, a heartfelt gesture of gratitude that echoed the important value that honoring our elders is honoring the very foundation of our island.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa National Women’s Team has just completed the most successful international season in its history, triumphing in both matches of the recent FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 Oceania Round One Qualifiers in the Cook Islands and advancing for the first time beyond the opening stage.</p>
<p>From November 28 to December 01, 2025, the CIFA Academy in Rarotonga hosted Round One of the qualifiers, where the four lowest‑ranked Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) nations — American Samoa, Cook Islands, Tahiti, and Tonga — battled for the coveted spot in Round Two.</p>
<p>For a team that had never scored a single goal in five previous World Cup qualifying campaigns dating back to 1998, this new‑look American Samoa side — built largely around off‑island based talent — delivered a stunning breakthrough. In just two matches, they netted seven goals without conceding, rewriting their footballing story.</p>
<p>Their historic run began with a commanding 3–0 victory over Tonga, before sealing the title with a resounding 4–0 win against tournament hosts Cook Islands — the largest victory ever recorded by the American Samoa women’s team on the international stage.</p>
<p>In their first match against Tonga, American Samoa finally broke through history, recording their first-ever goals in a FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifier since debuting in 1998. Forward Cassidy Pamela Drago delivered both strikes, etching her name into the record books and igniting a new era for the team.</p>
<p>Drago, a California native of Samoan descent, plays her club soccer in Temecula, California. She is part of a new generation of American Samoa players, many based off-island, who are elevating the team’s competitive profile from low-ranked mediocrity to a revitalized squad that now carries itself with confidence and ambition, proving they are capable of far greater things on the international stage.</p>
<p>American Samoa’s third goal against Tonga came from Aaliyah Tu‘ua, a California‑born midfielder of Samoan descent, who surged forward from the middle of the park to strike decisively in stoppage time. Her late finish not only sealed the 3–0 victory but also etched her name into history, as it confirmed American Samoa’s first-ever win in a FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>With confidence and composure, American Samoa powered past the Cook Islands with a commanding 4–0 victory at the CIFA Academy in Rarotonga, securing progression to the second stage of OFC qualifying. Three of their four goals came in the opening half, setting the tone for a dominant performance in which they pressed the hosts relentlessly and controlled the contest from start to finish.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came from Morgan Patea, a California‑raised forward of Samoan descent. The 23‑year‑old from Anaheim represents American Samoa through her father, Robert Patea, who was born and raised in Vatia before moving to Los Angeles.  Patea had already caught attention at the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament Oceania Qualifier in Apia last year, where despite the team’s struggles she stood out with her pace, technical ability, and attacking flair. OFC media hailed her as a “football star in the making,” recognizing her capacity to shine even in a team that was outclassed.</p>
<p>Team captain Alma Mana’o doubled the advantage just 15 minutes later, unleashing a long‑range strike into the bottom‑left corner. The Woodinville, Washington‑born midfielder — who followed her sisters Ava and Ina in representing American Samoa — debuted in 2011 and has since become the team’s most capped player.</p>
<p>With her longevity and experience, Mana’o is regarded as the heartbeat of the squad, providing leadership, organization, and stability in midfield. Her goal symbolized not only her enduring influence but also the resilience of a team finally breaking through decades of struggle.</p>
<p>Alayna Fuamatu‑Ma‘afala struck just before halftime, adding American Samoa’s third goal in the dying minutes of the first half. The dynamic forward — celebrated for her sharp attacking instincts and clinical finishing — is an alumna of Sacramento State University, where she honed her skills competing in NCAA Division I women’s soccer.</p>
<p>The momentum carried into the second half, as Mattyn Summers delivered the fourth and final blow only four minutes after the restart. Summers capitalized brilliantly on a perfectly placed header from Cassidy Pamela Drago, timing her run to perfection and slotting home inside the penalty area.</p>
<p>American Samoa now advances to join Group A of FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 OFC Round Two Qualifying in February 2026, alongside New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa.</p>

<p>The PNG Investment Conference in Sydney, Australia ended yesterday. Is this yet another talkfest?</p>
<p>We are informed a huge PNG delegation, including government officials and ministers were in Sydney for the four-day conference. This should cost the PNG tax payers some money.</p>
<p>Last year, another huge delegation was also in Sydney, for a similar conference. In fact, every year, the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy organise these conferences and hosted between PNG and Australia.</p>

<p>As Papua New Guinea celebrates its 50th Independence Golden Jubilee, New Porgera Limited (NPL), operator of the Porgera Mine in Enga Province, is marking the milestone by investing in the next generation of leaders in the global mining sector.</p>
<p>One of those emerging leaders is Mining Engineer Naomi Gamoga, who earlier this year began a secondment at the Valedero Mine in Argentina through the Barrick Secondment Program. The initiative, driven by Barrick Corporation—operator of the Porgera Mine—aims to elevate Papua New Guinean professionals across its worldwide operations.</p>

      <h1>Divided Fed lowers rates, signals pause and one 2026 cut as growth rebounds</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday in another divided vote, but signaled it will likely pause further reductions in borrowing costs as the U.S. central bank looks for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that “remains somewhat elevated.” New projections issued after the Fed’s two-day meeting showed the median policymaker sees just one quarter-percentage-point cut in 2026, the same outlook as in September, with inflation expected to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%. “In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,” the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions — an outlook at odds with market expectations, which remained locked into two rate cuts next year even after the Fed issued its statement.</p>
