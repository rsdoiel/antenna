      <h1>White House orders military to focus on ‘quarantine’ of Venezuela oil</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — ‌The White House has ordered U.S. military forces to focus almost exclusively on enforcing a “quarantine” of Venezuelan oil for at least the next two months, a U.S. official told Reuters, indicating Washington is currently more interested in using economic rather than military means to pressure Caracas. “While military options still exist, the ‍focus is to first use economic pressure by enforcing sanctions to reach the outcome the White House is looking (for),” the official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. While President Donald Trump has been publicly coy about his precise aims regarding Venezuela, he has privately pressured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to ​flee the nation, Reuters has reported. Trump said on Monday it would be ​smart for Maduro to leave power.</p>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>NEW YORK — Packaged food makers and fast-food restaurants may ‌be forced to overhaul more of their products next year as newly approved, appetite-suppressing GLP-1 pills become available in January, analysts say. More Americans are expected to try the drugs as a pill rather than as a shot because the medication will be cheaper and many patients are hesitant to inject themselves. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy GLP-1 pill on ‍Monday, sending shares of food companies down on Tuesday. Eli Lilly’s rival medication is expected to gain approval from regulators next year.</p>

<p>In a historic breakthrough for the Motu-Koitabu people, more than ten homebrew producers in Hanuabada have voluntarily surrendered their distillation equipment, marking a major step toward ending the village’s long-standing struggle with illicit alcohol.</p>
<p>The voluntary surrender followed a targeted operation spearheaded by the Chairman of the Motu-Koitabu Assembly (MKA), Russell S. Wavik, aimed at dismantling the rampant sale of &quot;faiya-wara&quot; and the illegal display of alcohol at the Hanuabada roadside market.</p>

<p>IT was the night before Christmas, when of all the places to speed around a bend from, this driver decided to speed into the drain just outside our office. An alcohol fuelled mishap that caused him to skid into our drain ready for our cameras on Christmas coverage operations. Only thing going for him this Christmas was the cops eventually letting him off the hook to recover what looked like a very brand new slick ride now wrecked beyond recognition. We hope the cops are not as forgiving of other naughty motorists tonight.</p>

<p>Community leaders in Gerehu 3A are sounding the alarm on a sophisticated new tactic being used by car thieves, even as local volunteer efforts successfully drive down overall crime rates.

      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Roughly 25,000 people have ​expressed ‌interest in joining the ‌Trump administration’s cadre of engineers known as Tech Force, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, as the ‍U.S. government looks to install staff with artificial intelligence expertise in federal roles. The Trump administration will use that ​list to recruit software and ​data engineers, in addition to other tech roles, said Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of ‍Personnel Management, in a post on X. ​Reuters could not independently verify the 25,000 figure. The interested candidates will compete for 1,000 spots in the first Tech Force cohort. The recruits will spend two years working on technology projects inside federal agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, among other government offices, Kupor said previously.</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea’s Golden Jubilee year has been marked not only by celebration but by a bold national reset. Prime Minister James Marape declared 2025 “one of the most consequential years in our history,” unveiling RESET@50, a long‑term roadmap designed to shape the nation’s next two decades.</p>
<p>Launched during the 50th anniversary of Independence, RESET@50 is framed as a generational project. It reviews the country’s first half‑century of nationhood and sets out a 20‑year plan (2025–2045) to strengthen governance, diversify the economy, and investment in human capital. “Fifty years is not the end of a journey. It is the moment we choose whether the next fifty will be better than the first,” Marape told citizens during the Jubilee reflections.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Department of Public Safety officially launched its Holiday Enforcement initiative last Friday, marking the beginning of a focused effort to enhance road safety during the busy festive season.</p>
<p>The sobriety roadblock was held in front of the CBT building in Nu’uuli, where close to 20 police officers were working.</p>
<p>Commissioner of Public Safety Taaga Saite Moliga has announced the deployment of strategically placed roadblocks throughout the community to identify and evaluate drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>These roadblocks will be strategically placed in response to real-time traffic patterns, focusing on high-traffic areas during peak travel periods to maximize visibility and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The last weekend before Christmas typically sees a surge in social gatherings, as numerous businesses host their annual holiday parties and end-of-year celebrations. This increase in festivities correlates with a heightened risk of impaired driving, underscoring the importance of vigilance during this critical time.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, Commissioner Moliga is urging all community members to collaborate in fostering a culture of safety and awareness. The goal is to ensure the holiday season remains celebratory while minimizing the risks of impaired driving.</p>
<p>To support this initiative, the Department of Public Safety will maintain its Holiday Enforcement program, which will extend through January 3, 2026.</p>
<p>DPS says this initiative underscores its unwavering commitment to safeguarding public safety throughout the festive season and beyond, ensuring that all community members can enjoy a joyous, accident-free holiday period.</p>

<p>Prime Minister James Marape says 2026 will mark a major transition year for Papua New Guinea, with the Government moving decisively to use artificial intelligence (AI) and information and communications technology (ICT) as core tools to strengthen governance, transparency and efficiency across the public service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the Government will begin positioning AI as the “engine room” of government decision-making, supporting critical functions such as public service recruitment and selections, contract awards, project proposal assessments, policy development and the overall performance of government systems.</p>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing ​for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 ‌with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm ‌elections. Trump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status. ICE and Border Patrol will get <span class="math inline">\(170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 — a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about \)</span>19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July. Administration officials say they ‍plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.</p>

      <h1>Japan prepares to restart world’s biggest nuclear plant, 15 years after Fukushima</h1>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>NIIGATA, Japan — The Japanese region of Niigata is expected to endorse a ‌decision to restart the world’s largest nuclear power plant today, a watershed moment in the country’s pivot back to nuclear since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, located about 220 km (136 miles) northwest of Tokyo, was among 54 reactors shut after a massive earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Since then, Japan has restarted 14 of ‍the 33 that remain operable, as it tries to wean itself off imported fossil fuels. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa will be the first operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co, which ran the doomed Fukushima plant.</p>

<p>The National Information and Communications Technology Authority (NICTA) of Papua New Guinea has announced the release of the Draft SIM Card Registration (Amendment and Consolidation) Regulation 2026 for public consultation. This initiative is being carried out under Sections 229 and 230 of the National Information and Communications Technology Act 2009, marking an important step in strengthening the country’s telecommunications framework.</p>
<p>Authorized by the acting CEO of NICTA Polume Lume, the proposed regulation seeks to update and consolidate the existing SIM Card Registration Regulation 2016. Key amendments include the integration of digital identity systems, enhanced identity verification processes, and stronger provisions for cybersecurity and data protection. These measures aim to ensure that SIM card registration is secure, reliable, and aligned with modern technological standards. Additionally, the draft introduces certification requirements for SIM registration agents, ensuring accountability and professionalism in the registration process. Recognizing the unique challenges faced in rural and remote areas, the regulation also outlines mechanisms for offline registration, making the process more accessible to communities across Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA  —</em> The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of American Samoa, a leader in youth development and leadership programs, was recently awarded two prestigious awards from Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) at the Pacific Region Leadership Conference that was held in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>The “100 Club Award” is a recognition given by BGCA to local clubs that are 100% committed to the goals of “Operation Impact” and have demonstrated dedication to implementing this strategic plan and setting bold goals for their future and the youth they serve. Operation Impact was launched in 2024 and key aspects include increasing membership; growing teen participation; boosting average daily attendance; and creating exceptional Club experiences for every young person.</p>
<p>At a luncheon held for Board Members and Executive Leadership, BGCA Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer Lorraine Orr presented the “S.O.A.R. Award”, which is the highest level of recognition given to an organization’s Board of Directors who achieve Gold status for three consecutive years. This distinguished accolade not only recognizes sustained excellence in board engagement but also serves as a testament to the organization’s unwavering commitment to driving the Boys &amp; Girls Club’s mission forward.</p>
<p>This past January, the Chairman of the BGCAS Board of Directors and Chief Volunteer Officer, Mrs. Mary A.T. Tulafono was honored with an official appointment as an “Operation Impact Ambassador” for the Pacific Region. Mrs. Tulafono was formally recognized at the Opening Session of the Pacific Region Leadership Conference for her role and contributions to the BGCA Movement. Mrs. Tulafono, along with BGCAS Executive Director, Sailipea Kennison Barber, accepted both awards on behalf of the local organization.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to advance a <span class="math inline">\(901 billion bill setting policy for the Pentagon, sending the massive piece of legislation to the White House, which has said President Donald Trump will sign it into law. The fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, is a compromise between separate measures passed earlier this year in the House of Representatives and Senate. It authorizes a record \)</span>901 billion in annual military spending, with a 4% pay raise for the troops. It also authorizes reforms to the system for acquiring military equipment and includes efforts to boost competitiveness with U.S. archrivals China and Russia.</p>

      <h1>US Senate unanimously approves military helicopter safety legislation</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to toughen military helicopter safety rules and rescind a provision in the annual defense bill that critics said would have weakened aviation safety. Republican Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz on Wednesday won unanimous consent to approve a revised version of legislation that would require aircraft operators by the end of 2031 to equip their fleets with an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system, also known as ADS-B. The bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, also boosts oversight of commercial jet and helicopter traffic and flight routes near commercial airports. Aviation safety in the Washington area has come under scrutiny after the January 29 collision near Reagan Washington National Airport of an American Airlines regional jet and Army Black Hawk helicopter killed 67 people. Cruz said the bill will save lives and “be a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River.”</p>

      <h1>Trump prosecutor Jack Smith defends probes in House testimony</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Jack Smith, the former U.S. Justice Department special counsel who brought two now-dropped criminal cases against President Donald Trump, defended his investigation before a House of Representatives panel on Wednesday, telling lawmakers that the basis for the prosecutions “rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.” Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the Justice Department and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s probe and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system. Smith and his team secured indictments in 2023, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents following his first term in office and plotting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Smith dropped both cases after Trump won the 2024 election, citing a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.</p>

<p>It has been an inspiring and rewarding journey over the past 50 days as we connected with you through our 50 Days of Integrity campaign. Throughout this series, we have explored critical issues—from corruption trends to the importance of International Anti-Corruption Day—aimed at fostering awareness and accountability. As we wrap up this series, it’s worth pausing to reflect on a key question at the heart of our discussions: What exactly is “corrupt conduct,” and when does ICAC have the authority to act?</p>

<p>Governor Pulaali’i delivered remarks honoring educators for their vital role in shaping the future of the territory’s youth. Addressing teachers directly, the Governor emphasized the significance of their work, stating that, “Each of you carries a responsibility that is both powerful and deeply meaningful”.</p>
<p>He further expressed his appreciation, adding, “thank you for your time, talent, and sacrifice. And most importantly, thank you for giving our students the tools they need to shape their futures”.</p>

He credited the guidance of his peers and leaders, as well as the encouragement and support of his family, for helping him achieve this milestone.</p>

<p><em>Apia, SAMOA —</em>(December 15, 2025) A combined total of 6.173 kilograms of methamphetamine, smuggled from American Samoa, was intercepted by Samoa Customs officials in two separate operations at the independent state’s international air and sea ports over the weekend.</p>
<p>In a joint press release issued by the Ministry of Customs and Revenue and the Samoa Police, it was revealed that the first incident involved a targeted operation in which Customs officials identified a suspect upon arrival on the final flight from American Samoa on Friday, December 12, 2025.</p>
<p>A body search was initiated under the legal provisions of the Customs Act, with police assistance required due to the suspect’s reluctance to cooperate. During the search, officers discovered a small bag concealed inside the suspect’s underwear containing five packages. All packages subsequently tested positive for methamphetamine, with a combined weight of 141 grams.</p>

<p>Authorities noted that the successful interception highlights the determination of criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa using any concealment method, including hiding substances in private areas.</p>
<p>The suspect, a 32‑year‑old male from Vaitele and Nu’u, has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of methamphetamine carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The second incident occurred on Saturday morning, December 13, 2025, when Customs officials intercepted 6.032 kilograms of methamphetamine concealed inside a box of frozen chicken at Matautu Wharf. The shipment, which originated from American Samoa, had been flagged for inspection based on intelligence.</p>
<p>During the search, officers uncovered two vacuum‑packed packages of methamphetamine hidden within the frozen chicken. Authorities noted that this concealment method reflects the continued attempts by criminals to smuggle illicit drugs into Samoa disguised as ordinary goods.</p>
<p>A 59‑year‑old male from To’omatagi has been charged with Possession of Narcotics (methamphetamine) and Importation of Prohibited Goods. Under Samoa’s laws, a conviction for possession of Class A narcotics carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>These two cases represent the seventh methamphetamine interception at Samoa’s borders this year, following the historic seizure of 9.4 kilograms of methamphetamine in January.</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of Customs and the Commissioner of Police jointly expressed deep concern over the continued attempts to smuggle methamphetamine into Samoa. They emphasized the devastating impact of the drug on families, particularly young people, noting that addiction is escalating and can result in severe harm and even fatalities.</p>
<p>Both leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to protecting Samoa’s borders and safeguarding the well-being of its people.</p>
<p>“Customs and Police remain steadfast in our determination to identify and dismantle drug networks,” they declared in the joint press release. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all those responsible face justice, and to secure a safe, secure, and prosperous Samoa.”</p>
<p>They cautioned individuals involved in illicit drug activities to desist from bringing narcotics into the country, warning that anyone who persists will face severe penalties, including lengthy prison terms.</p>
<p>These operations underscore the importance of close interagency collaboration in combating transnational crime, as highlighted in the joint campaign “Say No to Illegal Drugs / Tete’e atu i Fuala’au Fa’asaina.”</p>
<p>Both leaders commended the professionalism and vigilance demonstrated by all officers involved, noting that the successful operations reflect the continued effectiveness of Samoa’s joint border security efforts.</p>
<p>Of the seven methamphetamine interceptions recorded by Samoan authorities in 2025, four were linked to shipments from American Samoa, while the others originated from the United States.</p>
<p>November 27, 2025: 10 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a can of milk powder (Coffee Mate) were discovered in a shipment from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
<p>November 28, 2025: 99 grams of methamphetamine were intercepted during a routine cargo inspection of goods from American Samoa at Matautu Wharf.</p>
<p>The other two American Samoa cases — the 141 grams concealed in underwear and the 6.032 kilograms hidden in frozen chicken — are detailed earlier in this article.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that methamphetamine smuggling into Samoa from the Territory had been occurring for some time before the first official interception on November 27, 2025.</p>
<p>This speculation may have prompted then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo to remark to the media in July this year, that American Samoa was the most common route for methamphetamine entering the country. However, he did not provide specific details or evidence to substantiate his claims.</p>
<p>The remarks by Samoa’s former Police Commissioner did not sit well with Senate President Tuaolo Manaia Fruean, who argued that the government should investigate the matter thoroughly. He emphasized that such claims reflect poorly on American Samoa and must not go unchallenged.</p>
<p>The issue was also raised in the House of Representatives, prompting the Chairman of the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Avagafono Vaimaga Maiava, to write to Samoa’s then Police Commissioner Auapa’au Logoitino Filipo. In his letter, Rep. Avagafono stressed that “such claims are serious and, unless supported by concrete evidence, are highly damaging to the reputation of American Samoa, a United States territory that upholds strict drug enforcement policies and border control procedures.”</p>
<p>Rep. Avagafono, himself a former Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, noted in his August 11 letter that the Commissioner’s “comments unfortunately appear to be baseless and not grounded in verifiable facts.” He informed Samoa’s Police leadership that the Legislature had convened a hearing to investigate the claims, during which testimony was received from relevant government departments, including Customs, Public Safety, and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“It was clearly stated that American Samoa is neither a producer of methamphetamine nor a known point of origin for its export to Samoa or any other country,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Despite his criticism, Rep. Avagafono urged cooperation rather than division between the two Samoas in tackling the drug problem.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we believe this shared issue of transnational drug trafficking requires deeper cooperation, not division, between the two Samoas. We encourage the establishment of structured and regular consultations between our respective law enforcement and customs agencies. Collaboration, intelligence sharing, and joint task force efforts are far more effective than unilateral public statements.”</p>
<p>“The fight against drugs is a mutual responsibility that requires trust, open dialogue, and coordinated action. We hope this matter can serve as an opportunity to strengthen our working relationship, rather than weaken it,” Rep. Avagafono concluded.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will replace the fully electric F-150 Lightning with a new extended-range electric model that uses a gas-powered engine to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.</p>

      <p>The oil and gas industry must be legally bound to cut methane emissions. With climate tipping points approaching, time is running out</p>
<p>• Mia Mottley is the prime minister of Barbados</p>
<p>The timing is brutal. Just as the world celebrates the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/12/paris-climate-treaty-anniversary">10th anniversary</a> of the adoption of the Paris climate agreement this month, new evidence shows that the world is crashing through the main defence that was constructed against climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>The three-year temperature average is – for the first time – set to exceed the Paris guardrail of 1.5C above preindustrial levels. According to the <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record">Copernicus Climate Change Service</a>, 2025 will join 2023 and 2024 as the three warmest since the Industrial Revolution, reflecting the accelerating pace of the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — (December 12, 2025) The American Samoa Department of Health (DOH) proudly celebrated the official re-opening of the Amouli Community Health Center after an extensive period of renovations and upgrades. The ceremony marked a significant milestone for healthcare access on the east side, honoring the clinic’s deep-rooted history dating back to the early 1920s.</p>
<p>Master of Ceremonies, Deputy Director of Health Talalelei Vesi Fautanu welcomed honored guests, including representatives from ASG departments, American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), LBJ Tropical Medical Center, Hollister General Services, and community partners. The opening prayer was delivered by Reverend Catechist Toni Tavite Lolesio of the Amouli Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr. delivered special remarks emphasizing the vital role the Amouli Clinic has served in the community for generations. In particular, he pointed out that the clinic stands as a physical promise to the people of the east side, guaranteeing that healthcare services remain accessible, dependable, and within reach of every family. He expressed sincere appreciation for the doctors, nurses and healthcare providers who travel daily to ensure consistent care for the community.</p>
<p>Project contractor Mr. William Hollister, CEO of Hollister General Services, spoke of his gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to a modernized facility for the east side. The upgrades include a new guard rail and triage room, expanded trauma and prenatal areas, a renovated dental clinic, and numerous interior enhancements. Exterior improvements included critical structural repairs and the addition of a generator shelter for emergency backup power.</p>
<p>DOH Director Dr. Saipale Fuimaono acknowledged the many individuals and agencies whose work made the renovation project possible. He confirmed that this project is one among several initiatives the DOH will complete to ensure equitable access to healthcare resources throughout American Samoa.</p>
<p>The ceremony featured a ribbon cutting led by House Representative Dr. Va’asā Uluiva Simanu, followed by a celebratory cake cutting with Miss American Samoa, Tofoipūpū Unutoa.</p>
<p>Appreciation and acknowledgement was given for all who contributed to the project and a clear indication of the Department of Health’s ongoing commitment to expanding resources and strengthening healthcare services for communities throughout American Samoa.</p>

<p>THE Papua New Guinea Defence Force continues to play a vital role in the country’s security and the Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara reminded the force to remain healthy and fit last Friday during the Chief of Defence Force end of year parade at Murray Barracks, Port Moresby.</p>
<p>“As I always emphasise, stay healthy and fit, eat well and get plenty of rest. Our line of work is demanding and I expect you all to maintain your health and fitness,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that every year the government tasks the PNGDF to support security efforts particularly in the highlands and staying fit and healthy is vital in the force.</p>

      <h1>’tis the Season! ASG Christmas Caroling officially opens</h1>

<p>By</p>
<p>Samoa News staff</p>
<p><a href="mailto:reporters@samoanews.com">reporters@samoanews.com</a></p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> ASG’s annual public Christmas celebration kicked off on Wednesday this week at the pavilion in Fagatogo. Officially called “Christmas Caroling” — the program is a 3- day-evening event of choirs composed of employees from different government departments and agencies singing Christmas songs in Samoan and English.</p>
<p>In previous years, there were ‘international’ community choirs that were invited to perform as part of the celebration, however this year it’s government only.</p>
<p>The official lighting of the Territory’s Christmas Tree is still very much a part of the annual celebration — and this year, First Lady Dr. Lois Pula did the honors, on opening night, Wednesday, Dec. 10th.</p>
<p>Each night Caroling begins at 6 pm.</p>
<p>For Wednesday, Welcoming remarks from Lealaisalanoa Alofaga Salanoa, who is the Master of Ceremonies throughout the 3-night program, was followed by the opening hymn performed by the TAOA Choir. Both Invocation &amp; Benediction were offered by Fagatogo CCCAS Rev. Iasepi Ulu.</p>
<p>After the Christmas tree was officially lit by the First Lady, Governor Pulaali’i Nikolau Pula gave opening remarks.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s program included 5 choirs comprising 16 different government entities —  Samoan Affairs &amp; Feleti Barstow Public Library; Procurement, Property Management, Public Defender, ALJ &amp; Legal Affairs; DBAS, DMWR, Port Admin &amp; Visitor’s Bureau; DHS &amp; ASCC; and, DPS, Dept of Corrections &amp; Search &amp; Rescue.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful aspects of the annual celebration is the costumes worn by each choir — highlighting the Samoan culture’s love of color and style presented as a unique uniform — puletasi for the women and i’e faitaga &amp; aloha-type shirts for the men — with each choir/ group having their own — becoming a part of the living pulse of the community at that moment.</p>
<p>Of note, the nightly event is a ‘must-attend’ for government department and agency heads or their deputies, as outlined in a memorandum sent out from the Governor’s Office, December 5th. The public often chooses to enjoy the program from home, as usually KVZK-TV streams it live.</p>
<p>Thursday’s Caroling program had 7 choirs: Fono; LBJ &amp; Office of Protection &amp; Advocacy; Administrative Services &amp; DPW; ASTA, Election Office &amp; TEO; DOA, Parks &amp; Rec &amp; Retirement Office; and, Treasury &amp; the Shipyard.</p>
<p>Invocation and Benediction were offered by Father (Patele) Pio Afu of the Amanve Parish.</p>
<p>Friday, tonight is the last night of the ASG Christmas Caroling program and will feature 6 choirs: Office of the Governor &amp; All Line Agencies; DHSS &amp; ASEPA; Dept of Commerce, KVZK &amp; Planning &amp; Budget Office; DHR &amp; DYWA; DoH; and, DOE.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks will be given by a Fono representative (not yet announced).</p>
<p>Invocation and Benediction are to be offered by Rev. Tagiilima Lavilavi of the Methodist- Nuuuli.</p>
<p>Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, American Samoa — May you be Safe and Kind to one another during these festive holidays.</p>

      <p>BOSTON — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unlawfully terminated a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program designed to protect states and communities against natural disasters before they occur. U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston sided with 20 mostly Democratic-led states in finding that the Republican president’s administration lacked authority to end the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program and use money Congress approved to support it for other purposes.</p>

<p>“For years, we have struggled to bring our coffee to quality markets in Lae. Most villages are in remote areas without proper roads, which limits how far our coffee can reach. Despite this, we continue to contribute to the national economy through coffee production,” he said.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> “Our elders are the pillars upon which our island stands,” Gov. Pulaali'i Tuiteleleapaga Nikolao Pula declared as he and Lt. Governor Pulumataala Ae Ae Jr. and the American Samoa Government hosted the annual TAOA Christmas Celebration, on Tuesday, December 9, 2025 — a gathering dedicated to honoring the wisdom, prayers, and enduring leadership of American Samoa’s senior citizens.</p>
<p>“Their wisdom lights the path for future generations, and their prayers sustain the strength of our people.”</p>
<p>The celebration began with an invocation and spiritual guidance from Penaia Faali’i, whose words carried the weight of faith and tradition, reminding all present that the elders are the living vessels of prayer and strength who we all seek as a community.</p>
<p>Governor Pulaali’i, in his opening remarks, commended the elders for their devotion, recognizing them as the very leaders whom the government and people alike seek for guidance. “Our elders are the pillars upon which our island stands,” he declared. “Their wisdom lights the path for future generations, and their prayers sustain the strength of our people.”</p>
<p>Distinguished guests included President of the Senate Tuaolo Manaia Fruean and his wife, and Speaker of the House Savali Talavou Ale and his wife, who joined in honoring the elders.</p>
<p>Adding to the event were beautiful hymns performed by the Department of Human and Social Services. Cabinet members joined the Governor and Lt. Governor in serving the festive meal.</p>
<p>Closing remarks were delivered by the Lt. Governor who thanked the elders for their continued devotion to families, villages, and churches, reminding all that their presence is both a gift and a guiding light.</p>
<p>Special recognition was given to elders aged 90 to 101 years old, with a highlight on Mrs. Pouiva Reid, the oldest elder in American Samoa, celebrated for reaching a remarkable milestone.</p>
<p>Pouiva Tauoa Reid- 101 years old</p>
<p>Solialofi Vaili- 94 years old</p>
<p>Pisavale Tialavea Tauai- 92 years old</p>
<p>Pagofie Aloe- 90 years old</p>
<p>Teuaililo Bird- 90 years old</p>
<p>Senator Si’i Noaese- 90 years old</p>
<p>Shang Shung- 90 years old</p>
<p>As the event drew to a close, the Governor, Lt. Governor, and cabinet members presented each elder with a gift, a heartfelt gesture of gratitude that echoed the important value that honoring our elders is honoring the very foundation of our island.</p>

<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa National Women’s Team has just completed the most successful international season in its history, triumphing in both matches of the recent FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 Oceania Round One Qualifiers in the Cook Islands and advancing for the first time beyond the opening stage.</p>
<p>From November 28 to December 01, 2025, the CIFA Academy in Rarotonga hosted Round One of the qualifiers, where the four lowest‑ranked Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) nations — American Samoa, Cook Islands, Tahiti, and Tonga — battled for the coveted spot in Round Two.</p>
<p>For a team that had never scored a single goal in five previous World Cup qualifying campaigns dating back to 1998, this new‑look American Samoa side — built largely around off‑island based talent — delivered a stunning breakthrough. In just two matches, they netted seven goals without conceding, rewriting their footballing story.</p>
<p>Their historic run began with a commanding 3–0 victory over Tonga, before sealing the title with a resounding 4–0 win against tournament hosts Cook Islands — the largest victory ever recorded by the American Samoa women’s team on the international stage.</p>
<p>In their first match against Tonga, American Samoa finally broke through history, recording their first-ever goals in a FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifier since debuting in 1998. Forward Cassidy Pamela Drago delivered both strikes, etching her name into the record books and igniting a new era for the team.</p>
<p>Drago, a California native of Samoan descent, plays her club soccer in Temecula, California. She is part of a new generation of American Samoa players, many based off-island, who are elevating the team’s competitive profile from low-ranked mediocrity to a revitalized squad that now carries itself with confidence and ambition, proving they are capable of far greater things on the international stage.</p>
<p>American Samoa’s third goal against Tonga came from Aaliyah Tu‘ua, a California‑born midfielder of Samoan descent, who surged forward from the middle of the park to strike decisively in stoppage time. Her late finish not only sealed the 3–0 victory but also etched her name into history, as it confirmed American Samoa’s first-ever win in a FIFA Women’s World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>With confidence and composure, American Samoa powered past the Cook Islands with a commanding 4–0 victory at the CIFA Academy in Rarotonga, securing progression to the second stage of OFC qualifying. Three of their four goals came in the opening half, setting the tone for a dominant performance in which they pressed the hosts relentlessly and controlled the contest from start to finish.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came from Morgan Patea, a California‑raised forward of Samoan descent. The 23‑year‑old from Anaheim represents American Samoa through her father, Robert Patea, who was born and raised in Vatia before moving to Los Angeles.  Patea had already caught attention at the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament Oceania Qualifier in Apia last year, where despite the team’s struggles she stood out with her pace, technical ability, and attacking flair. OFC media hailed her as a “football star in the making,” recognizing her capacity to shine even in a team that was outclassed.</p>
<p>Team captain Alma Mana’o doubled the advantage just 15 minutes later, unleashing a long‑range strike into the bottom‑left corner. The Woodinville, Washington‑born midfielder — who followed her sisters Ava and Ina in representing American Samoa — debuted in 2011 and has since become the team’s most capped player.</p>
<p>With her longevity and experience, Mana’o is regarded as the heartbeat of the squad, providing leadership, organization, and stability in midfield. Her goal symbolized not only her enduring influence but also the resilience of a team finally breaking through decades of struggle.</p>
<p>Alayna Fuamatu‑Ma‘afala struck just before halftime, adding American Samoa’s third goal in the dying minutes of the first half. The dynamic forward — celebrated for her sharp attacking instincts and clinical finishing — is an alumna of Sacramento State University, where she honed her skills competing in NCAA Division I women’s soccer.</p>
<p>The momentum carried into the second half, as Mattyn Summers delivered the fourth and final blow only four minutes after the restart. Summers capitalized brilliantly on a perfectly placed header from Cassidy Pamela Drago, timing her run to perfection and slotting home inside the penalty area.</p>
<p>American Samoa now advances to join Group A of FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 OFC Round Two Qualifying in February 2026, alongside New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa.</p>

<p>The PNG Investment Conference in Sydney, Australia ended yesterday. Is this yet another talkfest?</p>
<p>We are informed a huge PNG delegation, including government officials and ministers were in Sydney for the four-day conference. This should cost the PNG tax payers some money.</p>
<p>Last year, another huge delegation was also in Sydney, for a similar conference. In fact, every year, the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy organise these conferences and hosted between PNG and Australia.</p>

<p>As Papua New Guinea celebrates its 50th Independence Golden Jubilee, New Porgera Limited (NPL), operator of the Porgera Mine in Enga Province, is marking the milestone by investing in the next generation of leaders in the global mining sector.</p>
<p>One of those emerging leaders is Mining Engineer Naomi Gamoga, who earlier this year began a secondment at the Valedero Mine in Argentina through the Barrick Secondment Program. The initiative, driven by Barrick Corporation—operator of the Porgera Mine—aims to elevate Papua New Guinean professionals across its worldwide operations.</p>

      <h1>Divided Fed lowers rates, signals pause and one 2026 cut as growth rebounds</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday in another divided vote, but signaled it will likely pause further reductions in borrowing costs as the U.S. central bank looks for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that “remains somewhat elevated.” New projections issued after the Fed’s two-day meeting showed the median policymaker sees just one quarter-percentage-point cut in 2026, the same outlook as in September, with inflation expected to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%. “In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data,” the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions — an outlook at odds with market expectations, which remained locked into two rate cuts next year even after the Fed issued its statement.</p>

      <h1>Am Samoa secures landmark victory, securing long-term future of the albacore fishery</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p><a href="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_normal_image/public/field/image/22nd_regular_session_fisheries.png?itok=oFI0sBWW"><img src="https://www.samoanews.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow/public/field/image/22nd_regular_session_fisheries.png?itok=vryGzAh4" alt="participants at the 2nd Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission"></a></p>
<p><em>MANILA, Philippines —</em> (December 9, 2025) The 22nd Regular Session of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC22) meeting concluded this past Friday with a unanimous decision securing the long-term future of the South Pacific albacore fishery, a major gain for the American Samoa longline fishery managed by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council.</p>
<p>By consensus, WCPFC members adopted a new management procedure (MP) that could reduce overall South Pacific albacore catch by about 10-12% from recent years to approximately 56,000 metric tons in commission waters. The decision is expected to ease oversupply and improve market conditions for small island fleets, including American Samoa, which saw some of the worst economic conditions on record in 2024.</p>
<p>It also meets a key requirement to maintain Marine Stewardship Council certification that allows the American Samoa longline fishery to sell albacore to the local StarKist cannery at a premium price.</p>
<p>“This management procedure has been nearly a decade in the making, and the U.S. Pacific territories took it over the top with their steadfast support,” said Kitty Simonds, Council executive director. “It is a critical step to stabilize the albacore fishery and the island economies and food security that depend on it.”</p>
<p>Council member Nathan Ilaoa, director of the American Samoa Department of Marine and Wildlife Resources, championed a more conservative approach during negotiations. “When operational costs are high and catch rates are low, the only fleets that can continue to operate are those receiving substantial subsidies,” Ilaoa said. “That creates a critical inequity for the American Samoa longline fleet and other small island domestic fleets.”</p>
<p>Representatives from Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands supported American Samoa and other Pacific Island delegations. “These positions are consistent with protecting island food security and economies,” said Council member Chelsa Muña, director of Guam’s Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Next year, WCPFC members will negotiate an implementing measure and catch allocations to fully operationalize the new albacore MP.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation, led by NOAA’s Drew Lawler, advanced priorities for Council-managed fisheries, including work toward a bigeye tuna management procedure that considers purse seine as well as longline impacts, and a commitment to adopt a conservation and management measure on electronic monitoring in 2026.</p>
<p>“Members of the U.S. and territorial delegations viewed his leadership as a vast improvement over previous years and said this year’s delegation presented a much stronger unified front,” Simonds said.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Tafuna JROTC staff</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The Tafuna High School Army JROTC program made history by hosting American Samoa’s first-ever Aerial Drone Competition, bringing together cadet drone teams from Manu’a, Faga’itua, Samoana, Tafuna, and Leone High Schools. The inaugural event was held at the Mafutaga Tina CCCAS Hall in Kanana Fou under the Robotics Education &amp; Competition Foundation (RECF) Aerial Drone Competition program.</p>
<p>Ten teams, two from each high school, with five cadets per team, took on this season’s game, Time Warp. The game features four missions that challenge different aspects of drone STEM skills: Teamwork Mission (alliance match play), Piloting Skills Mission (individual piloting), Autonomous Flight Mission (coding and sensor-based flight), and Communications Mission (logbook and interview).</p>
<p><strong>TAFUNA’S TOA DRONES CROWNED ALL AROUND CHAMPION</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna High School’s Team 96799A – TOA DRONES – Army JROTC earned the tournament’s top honor as All Around Champion. This award recognizes a team that demonstrates excellence both in judged categories and on-field performance, including strong communications, professionalism, and sportsmanship. Toa Drones is made up of the following members:</p>
<p>Team Captain and Programmer- Loraine Steckert</p>
<p>Co-Captain and Teamwork Mission Pilot- Everett Painter</p>
<p>Co-Pilot for Teamwork Mission- Atonio Miller</p>
<p>Pilot for Piloting Skills Mission- Taylor Lemo</p>
<p>Visual Observer for Skills and Teamwork Mission- Schoemacher Puletasi</p>
<p>As All-Around Champion, Team 96799A has qualified for the All-Services Aerial Drone Championship in Fort Benning, Georgia, where they will compete against JROTC teams from across the United States and from all service branches, Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. This will be the team’s second appearance at the All-Services Championship. At last year’s event in Batesville, Mississippi, 96799A brought home the Coding Award from a field of more than 100 JROTC teams.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER MISSION AWARDS AND SPECIAL RECOGNITION</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna’s two TOA Drone teams and Samoana’s cadets led the way in the mission-based and judged awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>       Teamwork Mission Champion – Alliance of</li>
</ul>
<p>96799A – TOA DRONES</p>
<p>96799B – TOA DRONES II</p>
<p>Both from Tafuna High School Army JROTC in Pago Pago. The Teamwork Mission Champion title is awarded to the two-team alliance that finishes first after the finals matches.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Skills Missions Champion –</li>
</ul>
<p>96799B – TOA DRONES II – Tafuna High School. This award goes to the team with the highest combined score in Piloting Skills and Autonomous Flight Missions, highlighting both a steady pilot and strong coding.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Communications Mission Champion –</li>
</ul>
<p>1946B – Samoana High School. This award honors a team whose logbook and team interview demonstrate clear, organized, and professional communication, along with positive conduct and sportsmanship.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Judges Award –</li>
</ul>
<p>96799B – TOA DRONES II – Army JROTC, Tafuna High School. The Judges Award is presented to a team that stands out for its perseverance, effort, and accomplishments throughout the season and at the event.</p>
<p>CLOSE BATTLES ON THE FIELD</p>
<p>All five high schools brought their “A game” to the Time Warp field, resulting in exciting alliance selections and close scores throughout the playoffs.</p>
<p>Teams advancing to the semi-finals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>      Tafuna High School: 96799A and 96799B, who chose each other as alliance partners.</li>
<li>       Leone High School: 2811A, who allied with Manu’a’s 63729Z – Matasaua Drones.</li>
<li>       Samoana High School: 1946A and 1946B, who formed a Samoana alliance.</li>
<li>       Faga’itua High School: 1684V, who partnered with Manu’a’s second team 63729C.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, two alliances reached the finals: Tafuna’s alliance of 96799A and 96799B, and the alliance between 2811A (Leone) and 63729Z (Manu’a). The championship match came down to just two points, with Tafuna taking the Tournament Championship 190–188, a finish that kept cadets, instructors, and spectators on the edge of their seats.</p>
<p><strong>MONTHS OF PREPARATION AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>Tafuna High School JROTC spent months preparing to host this first island-wide Aerial Drone Competition. The staff coordinated with community volunteers who contributed an estimated 15 hours each, six hours of online training to serve as head referee and judge advisors, 7.5 hours during the competition itself, plus additional time in meetings, scrimmages, and a pre-event drone workshop.</p>
<p>Leading up to the tournament, Tafuna hosted a scrimmage and a Drone Workshop to help all participating teams across the island become more familiar with the Time Warp game, safety procedures, and tournament expectations. These efforts helped ensure that every team arrived ready to compete at a high level and that the event was both competitive and educational.</p>
<p><strong>SPONSORS AND VOLUNTEERS MAKE IT POSSIBLE</strong></p>
<p>The success of this inaugural competition depended on strong community partnerships and sponsorship.</p>
<ul>
<li>       ASTCA – Special thanks to CEO Folasaitu Thomas and her team for providing high-speed, robust internet connectivity for the event. Their support made it possible to run the RECF Tournament Manager system and transmit real-time results to the Robotics Education &amp; Competition Foundation throughout the day.</li>
<li>       McDonald’s and ASTCA – Both organizations helped present awards and have been long-time supporters of Tafuna JROTC’s off-island STEM and robotics competitions.</li>
<li>       OceaniaCDN – Provided tablets used by scorekeeper referees and the event tech coordinator, helping the tournament run smoothly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organizers also extend heartfelt thanks to the volunteers whose “heart of service” for the youth of American Samoa made the competition possible:</p>
<p>Dr. Reupena Lesa, Isalei Liaiga, Ladenia Lavata’i, Claire Baucus, Maricel Balbuena, Patricia Su’esu’e, Fiafia Sunia, Fa’amasino Galoia, Jody Osterbrink, Jordanna Maga, Agnes Tipi, and Judy Tuna.</p>
<p>These community members served as referees, scorekeepers, judges, and event tech coordinators, giving cadets a professional, well-run first experience in aerial drone competition.</p>
<p>To recognize this service, the Director of Army Instruction, COL John Tulifua, presented each volunteer with an American Samoa Multiple School Unit coin in appreciation for their time and support of this landmark event.</p>
<p><strong>SCHOOL AND JROTC LEADERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>The competition also highlighted the vision and support of educational leaders who continue to push STEM opportunities forward in the territory.</p>
<ul>
<li>       Principal Tutuila Togilau of Tafuna High School was recognized for her ongoing support of all JROTC initiatives, not only for THS cadets but also for providing a platform that serves every JROTC program in American Samoa.</li>
<li>       Tafuna’s JROTC instructor team, MAJ Siimoa Galoia, MSG Acania Puletasi, and SFC Lei Solaita, were thanked for pioneering and expanding STEM pathways, from VEX robotics to aerial drones, and for working tirelessly to secure competition opportunities off-island for cadets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This first Aerial Drone Competition marks an important step for American Samoa’s youth as they explore STEM, aviation, and technology careers through hands-on learning and friendly competition. With strong community support and dedicated cadet leaders, the future of drone STEM education in the territory is off to a powerful start.</p>

<p>Despite millions and billions of kina poured into the education department over the years, most schools particularly in rural areas across the country do not receive enough funding support and are still struggling with limited facilities and poor academic resources.</p>
<p>Bubia Primary School Principal James Timping has raised strong concerns that schools across Papua New Guinea are not receiving the money they need because most of the national budget funding is being eaten up by administrative costs before it reaches classrooms.</p>

<p>Independent Commission Against Corruption, Acting Commissioner, Thomas Eluh, has issued one of his strongest warnings yet, declaring that corruption has become a “well-oiled system” that is crippling Papua New Guinea’s development and future.</p>

He said corruption has evolved into a sophisticated network affecting every level of government, from Parliament to commodity boards and district authorities.</p>

<p>James Kneubuhl, ASCC Press Officer</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> The American Samoa Community College (ASCC) will hold its 83rd Commencement Ceremony on Friday, December 12th, beginning at 10 a.m. at the Kanana Fou Gymnasium. At press time, 121 ASCC students are slated to receive their degrees and certificates from the College, although the final number will subject to examination results. The presiding pastor for the ceremony will be Reverend Peter Schuster, Synod Leader of the Tutuila Methodist Church. The keynote speech will be given by Ammon Fepulea’i, an ASCC alumnus and former faculty member who currently serves as Executive Director for the American Samoa Council on Arts, Culture, &amp; Humanities.</p>
<p>As an educator, artist, and community leader Fepulea’i’s work has significantly shaped the artistic and academic landscape of American Samoa. Born to Ali‘itasi and Paulo Fepulea‘i, Ammon is a proud alumnus of Samoana High School, graduating with the Class of 2005. He continued his academic journey at ASCC, where he earned his Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts in 2007. With a growing passion for mathematics, he pursued further studies at the University of Wyoming, graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. His commitment to education later led him to the University of Hawai‘i, where he completed a Master of Education in Curriculum Studies in 2019.</p>
<p>Fepulea’i began his professional career as a mathematics teacher at Samoana High School, serving from 2010 to 2020. His dedication to student learning and academic excellence then brought him back to ASCC, where he served as a mathematics instructor from fall 2020 through fall 2024. During his time at the College, he also played a vital role as an advisor to the House of Flying Daggers Club, a dynamic student group known for producing creative and influential musical productions in American Samoa. Fepulea’i continues to support and collaborate with these students, fostering artistic expression and community engagement.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2025, Fepulea’i was appointed Executive Director for the American Samoa Council on Arts, Culture, &amp; Humanities, a position in which he continues to expand opportunities, resources, and visibility for artists throughout the islands. He also serves as the President of the Agency for Better Living Endeavors (ABLE) and as the lead for Moso‘oi, two organizations dedicated to community enrichment and creative advancement</p>
<p>Through his leadership, artistry, and unwavering dedication to service, Fepulea‘i remains a driving force in cultivating a thriving and vibrant artistic future for American Samoa. A multidisciplinary artist, Ammon has contributed countless artworks across the territory, using his talents to celebrate culture, uplift communities, and empower young creators. His advocacy for youth development and his commitment to learning from and collaborating with local artists have solidified his reputation as a champion for the arts.</p>
<p>“ASCC is proud to see our alumnus and colleague Ammon leading the effort to promote and facilitate artistic expression here in the Territory,” said ASCC Dean of Student Services Dr. Emilia Le’i. “We look forward to him sharing his story and his insights with our fall 2025 graduating class.” For more information on the Fall 2025 ASCC Commencement Ceremony, contact the Division of Student Services at 699-9155, extension 0004.</p>

<p>NCDC Alcohol Licensing Board and Moresby-Northeast MP John Kaupa says authorities will launch a major crackdown on the production, sale and consumption of homebrew across the city, warning that the illegal alcohol trade has continued to be one of the city’s biggest law-and-order challenge.</p>
<p>Mr Kaupa said homebrew is still illegal and poses significant risks to public safety, yet many communities continue to brew and sell it openly, particularly at hotspot areas like Hanuabada, Erima, 8-Mile and 9-Mile.</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — White House border czar Tom Homan on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, saying the state is home to a large illegal Somali community despite local officials’ comments that the vast majority of Somalis in the U.S. are American citizens. Homan denied, however, that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had stepped up its deportation campaign in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in response to Trump’s comments last week about Somali immigrants, whom the president called “garbage” that should be removed from the country. Homan also said ICE agents are not targeting people based on their appearance.</p>

<p>The National Doctors Association (NDA) of Papua New Guinea has issued a strong public appeal to the government, calling on Prime Minister James Marape and Health Minister Elias Kapavore to urgently appoint a permanent Secretary for the Department of Health. The position has remained vacant for over a year, creating a significant leadership gap.</p>
<p>In a letter released from their Boroko office, the NDA noted that the Department of Health has operated without a confirmed leader for 13 to 14 months. The tenure of the current acting Secretary, Mr Ken Wai, whom the NDA describes as a &quot;seasoned Health Administrator&quot; who has &quot;performed very well&quot;, expired on November 11, 2025, leaving the department without a gazetted acting head for 27 days as of the letter’s issue.</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority (ICSA) has announced two major initiatives designed to modernize passport services and improve convenience for citizens following the recent passage of the Passport Bill 2025 by Parliament.</p>
<p>The first innovation, the Passport Status Online Tracker, allows applicants to check the progress of their passport applications from the comfort of their homes. By visiting the official website at <a href="http://www.ica.gov.pg">www.ica.gov.pg</a> or directly accessing status.ica.gov.pg, citizens can enter their application receipt number to view updates. Status information becomes available within 24 hours of lodging an application. Once the tracker indicates readiness, applicants may collect their passports at the Passport Office.</p>

<p>The National Court in Kokopo has imposed a four-year jail sentence—wholly suspended—on a 40-year-old woman who was convicted of sexually touching a 13-year-old boy at Tabuna Plantation in Bitapaka, East New Britain Province.</p>
<p>Mathilda Peter, from Sarakolok village in West New Britain, was convicted after trial on August 4 this year for sexual touching under Section 229B(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. She was initially charged with the more serious offence of sexual touching with aggravating circumstances but was instead found guilty of the lesser charge.</p>

<p>By</p>
<p>Justin Siliva</p>
<p><em>Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA —</em> Back home in American Samoa, Christmas is more than a holiday. It’s the heart of the year and a season that brings families, churches, and whole villages together. The music, the laughter, the faith, and the smell of food cooking from early morning all make the island come alive.</p>
<p>This will be my third Christmas away from home since starting college. School will be on break, but I have to stay in Hawaii for work. Even after doing it twice before, it still feels strange spending the holidays somewhere else. Each year I spend the holidays away, I find myself holding onto the memories of Christmas back home more tightly. I miss the joy, the noise, and that feeling you can only get when your own people surround you.</p>
<p>When I am home, December feels alive. Here, it feels quiet. Most days, I stay in my room or go to work if I am scheduled. Some Christmas mornings feel like any other day. There is no choir practice, no neighbors dropping by, and no kids playing outside. The feeling reminds me that I am very far away from home.</p>
<p>I am 100 percent sure that other students and islanders spend Christmas away from home, too. Some of us work during the holidays or stay where we are because traveling back home is too “expensive.” We try to keep our island spirit alive wherever we go, but it never feels the same. The quiet days remind us how much family, faith, and home really mean.</p>
<p>Being away has shown me what Christmas is really about. It’s not the lights, gifts, or even the break from school. It is the love, faith, and togetherness that make the season real. When those things are missing, the holiday feels empty, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>Growing up, Christmas was all about community. Every church came alive in the evenings as families gathered to rehearse dances and choir songs for the Christmas Day service. The sound of voices and instruments carried through the villages, blending with laughter, music, and the spirit of joy that filled every neighborhood.</p>
<p>Even government offices, local businesses, and churches join in. They rehearse songs and dances for the government’s annual Christmas Music Festival at a center in the town of Utulei, with a population of less than 500 people. People from all over the island gather to share music, faith, and laughter in the lead-up to Christmas Day. It’s one of the biggest celebrations of the season, showcasing the island’s strong sense of community.</p>
<p>American Samoa’s traditions are rooted in faith and community, and those values shape the way my people celebrate. The island’s customs, from music to family gatherings, reflect a culture centered on connection and respect. <a href="https://www.visitamericansamoa.org/our-culture">Visit American Samoa’s</a> page on our culture, shows how these traditions continue to guide daily life across the island.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.polynesia.com/christmas-traditions%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=Umu,%20a%20traditional%20Samoan%20ground,other%20delicious%20local%20Samoan%20food.">Polynesian Cultural Center</a>, Christmas in American Samoa combines faith, food, and family into a single, extended celebration. For many Samoans, it’s a season built on giving, not getting, and a time when the island spirit truly shines.</p>
<p>Christmas morning back home starts early. Families prepare the “umu,” the traditional ground oven used to cook breadfruit, taro, bananas, chicken, and often an “umu pua’a”(Pig Roast). Some make “oka,” which is raw fish mixed with coconut milk, or “palusami,” a dish of coconut milk wrapped in taro leaves. Others cook fai’ai fe’e, octopus simmered in coconut milk, or barbecue in their yards while that island reggae music plays in the background.</p>
<p>The smell of smoke and food fills the air, spreading from house to house. No one cooks just for themselves. Families share with their neighbors and the whole village. The joy comes from good food, good company, and giving back. Even without snow, it still feels like Christmas. The island’s heat doesn’t stop anyone from decorating homes, churches, and palm trees with colorful lights.</p>
<p>Being away from that feels different. December in college feels quiet and distant compared to home. The lights and songs are still there, but the “spirit” behind them is missing. I miss the choirs, the rehearsals, and the laughter that always came with family and food. Calls and video chats help for a moment, but they’ll never match the feeling of being home with my family.</p>
<p>Spending Christmas alone has taught me a lot about what truly matters. It made me realize how much I took those moments for granted. Back home, I never gave much thought to the long evenings of dance practice or the hours spent helping in the kitchen. Now I see how much those traditions shaped me. They continue to guide me, whether I’m home or somewhere else.</p>

<p><em>Justin’s home during the Christmas season back in American Samoa. [photo: Justin Siliva]</em></p>
<p>Christmas away from American Samoa will always feel different. But it reminds me that the real meaning of the holiday is not about where you are. It’s about love, faith, and people who make you feel at home. Even when I am far away, I carry that island vibe with me, and that’s what keeps my Christmas alive.</p>

      <h1>Are Americans drinking less? New data says yes, but not by much</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Americans say they are drinking less alcohol than ever before. But new data shows the number of drinks U.S. adults have per week has in fact not changed by much for decades. The data from drinks market research firm IWSR, shared exclusively with Reuters, shows that the number of weekly drinks per U.S. adult has hovered between 10 and 12 since 1975. While it is currently at its lowest since 1995, this reflects a decline of around 1.1 servings per person per week from a recent peak of 11.5 drinks in 2021. Surveys indicating a historic shift away from drinking, steep declines in alcohol sales, and falling drinking rates among young people have all fed a debate in recent years about whether drinking might be in long-term decline, especially in the key U.S. market. Possible drivers include a trend towards healthier lifestyles.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>LONDON — Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018, in a “reckless” display of power that led to the death of an innocent woman, a UK public inquiry concluded on Thursday. Skripal was found along with his daughter Yulia slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March 2018 after Novichok was applied to the front door handle of his nearby home. About four months later, mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died from exposure to the poison after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which Russian spies had used to smuggle the military-grade nerve agent into the country, the inquiry said.</p>
