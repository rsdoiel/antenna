<em>During Black History Month, we are highlighting outstanding
employees who make a difference at the Bureau of Land Management Arizona
and beyond. These employees, such as Alexia Williams, strengthen our
mission to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public
lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“For me, Black History Month means celebrating the accomplishments
of the Black Americans that came before us, and those who continue to
break barriers, persist, and excel despite the obstacles,” Williams
said.</em>
</p>
<div>
<p>
<em>From Wyoming to California to Arizona, Williams makes a difference
in her stewardship of America’s public lands and resources.</em>
</p>
<p>
The sun rises against the Imperial Sand Dunes in El Centro, California.
</p>
<p>
The early mornings – with 5 and 6 a.m. start times – bring a small crew
closer together. The group is scouring survey plots for purple flowers,
Peirson’s milkvetch, which are popping up across the sand. Peirson’s
milkvetch, a California endangered plant species, is a flower that is
endemic to southern Arizona and northern Mexico.
</p>
<p>
Among them, Alexia Williams.
</p>
<p>
At BLM California, Williams, who was an outdoor recreation planner, was
driven by a love of public lands to help wherever she could, even in
areas beyond her title.
</p>
<p>
Williams was an outdoor recreation planner for seven years at BLM
California’s El Centro Field Office, from 2016 to 2023. “When I was
thinking about my career and where it was going, I wanted to seek out
more project management opportunities,” she said.
</p>
<p>
That led her back to Tucson, where she also earned her Bachelor of
Science in ecology and evolutionary biology, along with a minor in
conservation biology, from the University of Arizona in 2014.
</p>
<p>
“Back when I graduated college, I actually did not know what the BLM
was. But an internship opportunity came up, and I didn’t know what I was
going to do,” she said. “It was an awesome opportunity for all of us who
applied.” That summer after graduating she was an outdoor recreation
planner at the BLM Kemmerer Field Office through the
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/direct-hire-program">DHA-RAI
program</a>.
</p>
<p>
“After two years, I decided Wyoming was a little too cold, and my
parents lived in Yuma, Arizona, after military service,” she said. El
Centro is only about an hour away from Yuma.
</p>
<p>
“When I was in El Centro, I did a lot of visitor contacts out in the
Imperial Sand Dunes and a couple of other open OHV areas, and I got the
question a lot about how to get into the federal government. It came up
more times than I can count,” she said. “I explained to everyone that I
had gotten in through an internship, but there are a variety of ways to
get into public service.”
</p>
<p>
“My advice for those interested in working in the federal government is
to keep an open mind,” Williams said. At the BLM, there are a variety of
ways to get into federal service, including through an internship like
Williams did. “Many of us started as seasonal employees, interns,
contractors, etc., and typically even volunteer experience counts
towards the qualifications.”
</p>
<p>
After her own stints at BLM Wyoming and BLM California, Williams is now
a project manager focused on Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation
Reduction Act-funded projects in the Bureau of Land Management Arizona’s
Gila District.
</p>
<p>
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act funds
about 50 projects in the Gila District on BLM-managed public lands.
These projects would not be successful without the passion and hard work
of project managers like Williams.

<p>
These projects that Williams works on include a lot of collaboration,
she said. Often, there are multiple agencies, cities, and even states
collaborating on different projects, she explained. For example, the
Gila District cooperates with several local cities, counties, and
friends’ groups in water management such as groundwater and surface
water monitoring and modeling.
</p>
<p>
“In seeing that kind of collaboration, you would have no idea it is
taking place if you’re not involved in it,” she said. “That is an
interesting aspect of this position.”
</p>
<p>
The Bureau of Land Management’s Gila District alone encompasses the
management of over two million acres of desert, mountains, and
grasslands in eastern and southeastern Arizona – and this management is
supported by countless partnerships and other agencies. The BLM partners
with many diverse organizations to carry out our multiple-use mission.
</p>
<p>
“Managing for multiple uses definitely poses a challenge, but hopefully
the decisions now will lead to a more sustainable future,” she said.<br>
<br> “I love that public lands support a variety of activities such as
free camping and hiking, fee sites with amenities such as boat launches,
filming and photography, birdwatching, picnicking, orienteering,
rocket-launching, etc., and the fact that there are landscapes that are
protected such as Wilderness Areas,” she said. “Visitors come from all
over the world to take advantage of these opportunities, and it would be
awesome if more Americans were aware of these resources right here at
home.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. <a name="_Hlk63258156">—</a>
<a name="_Hlk147304979"></a><a name="_Hlk147843450">The Bureau of Land
Management </a>welcomes Elizabeth Meyer-Shields as the new Deputy State
Director, Resources. In her new position, Meyer-Shields will oversee
resource and sustainable use programs for 15 million acres of public
lands in California.
</p>
<p>
“I am thrilled to have Liz join our leadership team at the California
State Office,” said Acting State Director for BLM California Gordon R.
Toevs. “Her expertise and guidance will be critical to fulfilling our
mission to manage important natural resources on public lands.”
</p>
<p>
Meyer-Shields started her federal career in 2009 in the BLM Washington
Office as a Presidential Management Fellow in the Division of Decision
Support, Planning and NEPA, and in 2011, moved to Sacramento as a
Planning and Environmental Coordinator in the California State Office.
In 2018, she moved up the hill to the Mother Lode Field Office as field
manager. In 2022, Meyer-Shields returned to the California State Office
as the Branch Chief for Lands, Planning, Recreation, and Cultural.
</p>
<p>
Meyer-Shields will oversee programs including wildlife, aquatics,
special status species, wild horse and burro, hydrology, ecology, air,
range, vegetation management, botany, cultural/paleontological
resources, soils, recreation, lands and realty, National Conservation
Lands/Wilderness/Wild and Scenic Rivers, land use planning, National
Environmental Policy Act compliance, renewable energy (solar and wind),
and partnerships.
</p>
<p>
Meyer-Shields grew up in Anchorage, Alaska, where she fell in love with
public lands, hiking, skiing, fishing, and camping.  She attended Oregon
State University, where she received a B.S. in Environmental Science and
the University of Denver School of Law. In her spare time, Meyer-Shields
enjoys watercolor painting and spending time outside with her family.
