Parks Were Pro Football Teams?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: California State Parks blog</p>

Canyon National Park to Reopen South Rim Hotels September 5</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park will reopen hotels on the park’s South Rim
beginning Thursday, September 5 and transition down to Stage 3 water
restrictions.</p>
<p>Park water utility crews successfully completed complex repairs to
the Transcanyon Waterline late last week and resumed pumping water
without identifying any new breaks. The park will operate under Stage 3
water restrictions until the water storage tanks have adequate capacity
to return to routine water conservation practices.

Canyon National Park to Temporarily Close Overnight Hotel Accommodations
Beginning August 29</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park will implement Stage 4 water restrictions
on the South Rim starting the afternoon of Thursday, August 29, due to a
series of four significant breaks in the 12½ mile-long Transcanyon
Waterline that supplies water from the canyon for use in the park. Since
July 8, the park has faced challenges with water supply, and currently,
no water is being pumped to either the South or North Rim.
