<p>
June is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. A person who has
difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying
event can develop PTSD, a serious and sometimes debilitating mental
health condition. Symptoms can include nightmares, unwanted memories,
avoidance of certain situations, heightened reactions, anxiety, or
depression. It can last months or years and triggers can cause
flashbacks accompanied by intense emotional and physical reactions.
Medical intervention, including psychotherapy and medications, are often
warranted.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement officers, military Veterans, first responders, and
others in high-stress occupations experience higher rates of PTSD as
these jobs are more likely to cross paths with trauma. According to the
<a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp">National
Center for PTSD</a>, a program of the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, about six out of 100 adults will experience PTSD at some point
in their lives. By contrast, about 23 out of every 100 veterans using
the VA Healthcare System experience PTSD at some point. This rate may be
even higher when veterans using private care—or seeking no care—are
considered. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of BLM law enforcement, an added stressor comes from the
fact that officers often work alone in remote areas where backup is
hours away.

The

Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017</a> recognizes that
law enforcement agencies need and deserve support to protect their
employees’ mental health and wellbeing.
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/31/2022-11810/advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and">Executive
Order 14074</a> requires those agencies to develop their own wellness
practices and policies for Federal officers.
</p>
<p>
Andrew Prys, Senior Special Agent, is on a detail to do just that as the
BLM Law Enforcement Wellness Coordinator in the Office of Law
Enforcement and Security. With nearly two decades in law enforcement and
partnering with the National Interagency Fire Center, other DOI
agencies, and the U.S. Forest Service, he’s developing the BLM Law
Enforcement Wellness Program. Goals include reducing cultural stigma
within the law enforcement community against getting help and
strengthening protections against stressors, trauma, and poor health
outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The program integrates BLM law enforcement officers’ physical,
emotional, mental, and spiritual health; it includes improvements in
hiring, retention, diversity, and inclusion. The theme is
connectivity–connecting to nature and connecting to each other.

While nature is a great healer, sometimes something stronger is needed.
Andrew explains that BLM active and retired law enforcement officers and
their families have access to
<a href="https://www.cordico.com/">Cordico</a>, a wellness app that
provides access to licensed clinicians, peer supports, chaplains, and
fitness incentives. It features videos and self-assessments for stress
reduction, sleep improvement, suicide prevention, financial education,
better nutrition, and more. Healthy officers have effective interactions
with the public, which in turn positively affects their view of BLM law
enforcement.
</p>
<p>
BLM employees, regardless of their job title, also have access to a free
health and wellness app, called Headspace. This app allows users to
explore guided mindfulness activities and events, including getting
better sleep, quieting your mind, being present, or managing stress and
anxiety. To learn more about it, enroll in the
<a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/blm-NTC-Course-and-Training-Information/Announcements/SitePages/Headspace(1).aspx?CT=1718642561665&amp;OR=OWA-NT-Mail&amp;CID=fd732644-5bde-93dc-5389-bbdedc00f6ac">virtual
Headspace training</a> through the National Training Center.
</p>
<p>
Military Veterans, like law enforcement officers, not only are more
likely than civilians to have PTSD, but their suicide rate is 1.5 times
higher.
<a href="https://braveheartsriding.org/services/">BraveHearts</a>
understands this more than most and uses horses to help veterans connect
with their emotions. As Winston Churchill once said, “no hour of life is
lost that is spent in the saddle.”
</p>
<p>
Since 2007, BraveHearts has been nationally recognized for providing
equine-assisted services to Veterans across the country, but primarily
in Illinois and Wisconsin. They are the largest equine-assisted services
program for Veterans in the country, serving more than 1,000 Veterans in
the last year.
</p>
<p>
Imagine spending years away from home, in one unfamiliar location or
many, surrounded by people who would sacrifice their lives for you as
much as you’d sacrifice yours to protect them. All the while you spend
your time in this tight-knit community with your days and your tasks
highly structured, following a clear command structure. Then imagine
you’re back home with few or no support structures, surrounded by people
who may have difficulty relating to that world.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine a Veteran, almost giving up hope of ever feeling normal
again, finding commonality with a mustang. Both are intelligent,
independent, hypervigilant, slow to trust, wary, loyal, and strong.
Meggan Hill-McQueeney, President and Chief Operating Officer of
BraveHearts, adopted four horses from BLM in 2013 to teach Veterans how
to gentle the wild mustangs. Four years later, these mustangs, who began
their lives on BLM land, participated in the Trail to Zero ride in New
York City. Trail to Zero is a 20-mile ride on horseback through major
cities to bring attention to Veterans’ high suicide rate and the
benefits of using equine-assisted services for healing.
</p>
<p>
Last year Laura Steiglitz, former U.S. Navy Corpsman, rode her favorite
mustang, Oatie, in the Trail to Zero ride in New York City, carrying the
ribbons of six veterans who died by suicide.

<p>
“Oatie and I really helped each other. When I felt overwhelmed and
overstimulated, he helped ground and calm me, and I did the same for
him,” she said. “Mustangs and Veterans – we’re both hypervigilant, so
when I see my horse standing calm, it reminds me there’s no immediate
danger, so I can relax and breathe.”
</p>
<p>
Laura’s confidence carries beyond the ranch as she learns how to use her
gifts to best help others, including demonstrating the benefits of
working with mustangs to a group of Mounted Police Officers.
</p>
<p>
BraveHearts is training their third group of mustangs and is now
mentoring five other centers on using mustangs to work with Veterans.
They only work with centers that are accredited through the Professional
Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International
(<a href="https://pathintl.org/">PATH Int.</a>).
</p>
<p>
“What works best for our program is we pace ourselves by the mustang’s
time and the Veteran’s time, rather than rushing our efforts based on
others’ expectations.” said Meggan. “Slow and safe.”
</p>
<p>
Connectivity. Community. Mindfulness. Slow and safe. Useful regardless
of your profession—military or civilian, law enforcement or fire, and
whether you’ve experienced trauma or simply the challenges of everyday
life.

While nature is a great healer, sometimes something stronger is needed.
Andrew explains that BLM active and retired law enforcement officers and
their families have access to
<a href="https://www.cordico.com/">Cordico</a>, a wellness app that
provides access to licensed clinicians, peer supports, chaplains, and
fitness incentives. It features videos and self-assessments for stress
reduction, sleep improvement, suicide prevention, financial education,
better nutrition, and more. Healthy officers have effective interactions
with the public, which in turn positively affects their view of BLM law
enforcement.
</p>
<p>
BLM employees, regardless of their job title, also have access to a free
health and wellness app, called Headspace. This app allows users to
explore guided mindfulness activities and events, including getting
better sleep, quieting your mind, being present, or managing stress and
anxiety. To learn more about it, enroll in the
<a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/blm-NTC-Course-and-Training-Information/Announcements/SitePages/Headspace(1).aspx?CT=1718642561665&amp;OR=OWA-NT-Mail&amp;CID=fd732644-5bde-93dc-5389-bbdedc00f6ac">virtual
Headspace training</a> through the National Training Center.
</p>
<p>
Military Veterans, like law enforcement officers, not only are more
likely than civilians to have PTSD, but their suicide rate is 1.5 times
higher.
<a href="https://braveheartsriding.org/services/">BraveHearts</a>
understands this more than most and uses horses to help veterans connect
with their emotions. As Winston Churchill once said, “no hour of life is
lost that is spent in the saddle.”
</p>
<p>
Since 2007, BraveHearts has been nationally recognized for providing
equine-assisted services to Veterans across the country, but primarily
in Illinois and Wisconsin. They are the largest equine-assisted services
program for Veterans in the country, serving more than 1,000 Veterans in
the last year.
</p>
<p>
Imagine spending years away from home, in one unfamiliar location or
many, surrounded by people who would sacrifice their lives for you as
much as you’d sacrifice yours to protect them. All the while you spend
your time in this tight-knit community with your days and your tasks
highly structured, following a clear command structure. Then imagine
you’re back home with few or no support structures, surrounded by people
who may have difficulty relating to that world.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine a Veteran, almost giving up hope of ever feeling normal
again, finding commonality with a mustang. Both are intelligent,
independent, hypervigilant, slow to trust, wary, loyal, and strong.
Meggan Hill-McQueeney, President and Chief Operating Officer of
BraveHearts, adopted four horses from BLM in 2013 to teach Veterans how
to gentle the wild mustangs. Four years later, these mustangs, who began
their lives on BLM land, participated in the Trail to Zero ride in New
York City. Trail to Zero is a 20-mile ride on horseback through major
cities to bring attention to Veterans’ high suicide rate and the
benefits of using equine-assisted services for healing.
</p>
<p>
Last year Laura Steiglitz, former U.S. Navy Corpsman, rode her favorite
mustang, Oatie, in the Trail to Zero ride in New York City, carrying the
ribbons of six veterans who died by suicide.

<p>
“Oatie and I really helped each other. When I felt overwhelmed and
overstimulated, he helped ground and calm me, and I did the same for
him,” she said. “Mustangs and Veterans – we’re both hypervigilant, so
when I see my horse standing calm, it reminds me there’s no immediate
danger, so I can relax and breathe.”
</p>
<p>
Laura’s confidence carries beyond the ranch as she learns how to use her
gifts to best help others, including demonstrating the benefits of
working with mustangs to a group of Mounted Police Officers.
</p>
<p>
BraveHearts is training their third group of mustangs and is now
mentoring five other centers on using mustangs to work with Veterans.
They only work with centers that are accredited through the Professional
Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International
(<a href="https://pathintl.org/">PATH Int.</a>).
</p>
<p>
“What works best for our program is we pace ourselves by the mustang’s
time and the Veteran’s time, rather than rushing our efforts based on
others’ expectations.” said Meggan. “Slow and safe.”
</p>
<p>
Connectivity. Community. Mindfulness. Slow and safe. Useful regardless
of your profession—military or civilian, law enforcement or fire, and
whether you’ve experienced trauma or simply the challenges of everyday
life.

<p>
June is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. A person who has
difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying
event can develop PTSD, a serious and sometimes debilitating mental
health condition. Symptoms can include nightmares, unwanted memories,
avoidance of certain situations, heightened reactions, anxiety, or
depression. It can last months or years and triggers can cause
flashbacks accompanied by intense emotional and physical reactions.
Medical intervention, including psychotherapy and medications, are often
warranted.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement officers, military Veterans, first responders, and
others in high-stress occupations experience higher rates of PTSD as
these jobs are more likely to cross paths with trauma. According to the
<a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp">National
Center for PTSD</a>, a program of the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, about six out of 100 adults will experience PTSD at some point
in their lives. By contrast, about 23 out of every 100 veterans using
the VA Healthcare System experience PTSD at some point. This rate may be
even higher when veterans using private care—or seeking no care—are
considered. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of BLM law enforcement, an added stressor comes from the
fact that officers often work alone in remote areas where backup is
hours away.

The
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ113/PLAW-115publ113.pdf">Law
Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017</a> recognizes that
law enforcement agencies need and deserve support to protect their
employees’ mental health and wellbeing.
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/31/2022-11810/advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and">Executive
Order 14074</a> requires those agencies to develop their own wellness
practices and policies for Federal officers.
</p>
<p>
Andrew Prys, Senior Special Agent, is on a detail to do just that as the
BLM Law Enforcement Wellness Coordinator in the Office of Law
Enforcement and Security. With nearly two decades in law enforcement and
partnering with the National Interagency Fire Center, other DOI
agencies, and the U.S. Forest Service, he’s developing the BLM Law
Enforcement Wellness Program. Goals include reducing cultural stigma
within the law enforcement community against getting help and
strengthening protections against stressors, trauma, and poor health
outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The program integrates BLM law enforcement officers’ physical,
emotional, mental, and spiritual health; it includes improvements in
hiring, retention, diversity, and inclusion. The theme is
connectivity–connecting to nature and connecting to each other.

<p>
June is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. A person who has
difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying
event can develop PTSD, a serious and sometimes debilitating mental
health condition. Symptoms can include nightmares, unwanted memories,
avoidance of certain situations, heightened reactions, anxiety, or
depression. It can last months or years and triggers can cause
flashbacks accompanied by intense emotional and physical reactions.
Medical intervention, including psychotherapy and medications, are often
warranted.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement officers, military Veterans, first responders, and
others in high-stress occupations experience higher rates of PTSD as
these jobs are more likely to cross paths with trauma. According to the
<a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp">National
Center for PTSD</a>, a program of the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, about six out of 100 adults will experience PTSD at some point
in their lives. By contrast, about 23 out of every 100 veterans using
the VA Healthcare System experience PTSD at some point. This rate may be
even higher when veterans using private care—or seeking no care—are
considered. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of BLM law enforcement, an added stressor comes from the
fact that officers often work alone in remote areas where backup is
hours away.

The
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ113/PLAW-115publ113.pdf">Law
Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017</a> recognizes that
law enforcement agencies need and deserve support to protect their
employees’ mental health and wellbeing.
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/31/2022-11810/advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and">Executive
Order 14074</a> requires those agencies to develop their own wellness
practices and policies for Federal officers.
</p>
<p>
Andrew Prys, Senior Special Agent, is on a detail to do just that as the
BLM Law Enforcement Wellness Coordinator in the Office of Law
Enforcement and Security. With nearly two decades in law enforcement and
partnering with the National Interagency Fire Center, other DOI
agencies, and the U.S. Forest Service, he’s developing the BLM Law
Enforcement Wellness Program. Goals include reducing cultural stigma
within the law enforcement community against getting help and
strengthening protections against stressors, trauma, and poor health
outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The program integrates BLM law enforcement officers’ physical,
emotional, mental, and spiritual health; it includes improvements in
hiring, retention, diversity, and inclusion. The theme is
connectivity–connecting to nature and connecting to each other.

While nature is a great healer, sometimes something stronger is needed.
Andrew explains that BLM active and retired law enforcement officers and
their families have access to
<a href="https://www.cordico.com/">Cordico</a>, a wellness app that
provides access to licensed clinicians, peer supports, chaplains, and
fitness incentives. It features videos and self-assessments for stress
reduction, sleep improvement, suicide prevention, financial education,
better nutrition, and more. Healthy officers have effective interactions
with the public, which in turn positively affects their view of BLM law
enforcement.
</p>
<p>
BLM employees, regardless of their job title, also have access to a free
health and wellness app, called Headspace. This app allows users to
explore guided mindfulness activities and events, including getting
better sleep, quieting your mind, being present, or managing stress and
anxiety. To learn more about it, enroll in the
<a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/blm-NTC-Course-and-Training-Information/Announcements/SitePages/Headspace(1).aspx?CT=1718642561665&amp;OR=OWA-NT-Mail&amp;CID=fd732644-5bde-93dc-5389-bbdedc00f6ac">virtual
Headspace training</a> through the National Training Center.
</p>
<p>
Military Veterans, like law enforcement officers, not only are more
likely than civilians to have PTSD, but their suicide rate is 1.5 times
higher.
<a href="https://braveheartsriding.org/services/">BraveHearts</a>
understands this more than most and uses horses to help veterans connect
with their emotions. As Winston Churchill once said, “no hour of life is
lost that is spent in the saddle.”
</p>
<p>
Since 2007, BraveHearts has been nationally recognized for providing
equine-assisted services to Veterans across the country, but primarily
in Illinois and Wisconsin. They are the largest equine-assisted services
program for Veterans in the country, serving more than 1,000 Veterans in
the last year.
</p>
<p>
Imagine spending years away from home, in one unfamiliar location or
many, surrounded by people who would sacrifice their lives for you as
much as you’d sacrifice yours to protect them. All the while you spend
your time in this tight-knit community with your days and your tasks
highly structured, following a clear command structure. Then imagine
you’re back home with few or no support structures, surrounded by people
who may have difficulty relating to that world.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine a Veteran, almost giving up hope of ever feeling normal
again, finding commonality with a mustang. Both are intelligent,
independent, hypervigilant, slow to trust, wary, loyal, and strong.
Meggan Hill-McQueeney, President and Chief Operating Officer of
BraveHearts, adopted four horses from BLM in 2013 to teach Veterans how
to gentle the wild mustangs. Four years later, these mustangs, who began
their lives on BLM land, participated in the Trail to Zero ride in New
York City. Trail to Zero is a 20-mile ride on horseback through major
cities to bring attention to Veterans’ high suicide rate and the
benefits of using equine-assisted services for healing.
</p>
<p>
Last year Laura Steiglitz, former U.S. Navy Corpsman, rode her favorite
mustang, Oatie, in the Trail to Zero ride in New York City, carrying the
ribbons of six veterans who died by suicide.

<p>
June is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. A person who has
difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying
event can develop PTSD, a serious and sometimes debilitating mental
health condition. Symptoms can include nightmares, unwanted memories,
avoidance of certain situations, heightened reactions, anxiety, or
depression. It can last months or years and triggers can cause
flashbacks accompanied by intense emotional and physical reactions.
Medical intervention, including psychotherapy and medications, are often
warranted.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement officers, military Veterans, first responders, and
others in high-stress occupations experience higher rates of PTSD as
these jobs are more likely to cross paths with trauma. According to the
<a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp">National
Center for PTSD</a>, a program of the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, about six out of 100 adults will experience PTSD at some point
in their lives. By contrast, about 23 out of every 100 veterans using
the VA Healthcare System experience PTSD at some point. This rate may be
even higher when veterans using private care—or seeking no care—are
considered. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of BLM law enforcement, an added stressor comes from the
fact that officers often work alone in remote areas where backup is
hours away.

Enforcement and Security. With nearly two decades in law enforcement and
partnering with the National Interagency Fire Center, other DOI

The program integrates BLM law enforcement officers’ physical,
emotional, mental, and spiritual health; it includes improvements in

While nature is a great healer, sometimes something stronger is needed.
Andrew explains that BLM active and retired law enforcement officers and
their families have access to
<a href="https://www.cordico.com/">Cordico</a>, a wellness app that
provides access to licensed clinicians, peer supports, chaplains, and
fitness incentives. It features videos and self-assessments for stress
reduction, sleep improvement, suicide prevention, financial education,
better nutrition, and more. Healthy officers have effective interactions
with the public, which in turn positively affects their view of BLM law
enforcement.
</p>
<p>
BLM employees, regardless of their job title, also have access to a free
health and wellness app, called Headspace. This app allows users to
explore guided mindfulness activities and events, including getting
better sleep, quieting your mind, being present, or managing stress and
anxiety. To learn more about it, enroll in the
<a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/blm-NTC-Course-and-Training-Information/Announcements/SitePages/Headspace(1).aspx?CT=1718642561665&amp;OR=OWA-NT-Mail&amp;CID=fd732644-5bde-93dc-5389-bbdedc00f6ac">virtual
Headspace training</a> through the National Training Center.
</p>
<p>
Military Veterans, like law enforcement officers, not only are more
likely than civilians to have PTSD, but their suicide rate is 1.5 times
higher.
<a href="https://braveheartsriding.org/services/">BraveHearts</a>
understands this more than most and uses horses to help veterans connect
with their emotions. As Winston Churchill once said, “no hour of life is
lost that is spent in the saddle.”
</p>
<p>
Since 2007, BraveHearts has been nationally recognized for providing
equine-assisted services to Veterans across the country, but primarily
in Illinois and Wisconsin. They are the largest equine-assisted services
program for Veterans in the country, serving more than 1,000 Veterans in
the last year.
</p>
<p>
Imagine spending years away from home, in one unfamiliar location or
many, surrounded by people who would sacrifice their lives for you as
much as you’d sacrifice yours to protect them. All the while you spend
your time in this tight-knit community with your days and your tasks
highly structured, following a clear command structure. Then imagine
you’re back home with few or no support structures, surrounded by people
who may have difficulty relating to that world.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine a Veteran, almost giving up hope of ever feeling normal
again, finding commonality with a mustang. Both are intelligent,
independent, hypervigilant, slow to trust, wary, loyal, and strong.
Meggan Hill-McQueeney, President and Chief Operating Officer of
BraveHearts, adopted four horses from BLM in 2013 to teach Veterans how
to gentle the wild mustangs. Four years later, these mustangs, who began
their lives on BLM land, participated in the Trail to Zero ride in New
York City. Trail to Zero is a 20-mile ride on horseback through major
cities to bring attention to Veterans’ high suicide rate and the
benefits of using equine-assisted services for healing.
</p>
<p>
Last year Laura Steiglitz, former U.S. Navy Corpsman, rode her favorite
mustang, Oatie, in the Trail to Zero ride in New York City, carrying the
ribbons of six veterans who died by suicide.

<p>
“Oatie and I really helped each other. When I felt overwhelmed and
overstimulated, he helped ground and calm me, and I did the same for
him,” she said. “Mustangs and Veterans – we’re both hypervigilant, so
when I see my horse standing calm, it reminds me there’s no immediate
danger, so I can relax and breathe.”
</p>
<p>
Laura’s confidence carries beyond the ranch as she learns how to use her
gifts to best help others, including demonstrating the benefits of
working with mustangs to a group of Mounted Police Officers.
</p>
<p>
BraveHearts is training their third group of mustangs and is now
mentoring five other centers on using mustangs to work with Veterans.
They only work with centers that are accredited through the Professional
Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International
(<a href="https://pathintl.org/">PATH Int.</a>).
</p>
<p>
“What works best for our program is we pace ourselves by the mustang’s
time and the Veteran’s time, rather than rushing our efforts based on
others’ expectations.” said Meggan. “Slow and safe.”
</p>
<p>
Connectivity. Community. Mindfulness. Slow and safe. Useful regardless
of your profession—military or civilian, law enforcement or fire, and
whether you’ve experienced trauma or simply the challenges of everyday
life.

While nature is a great healer, sometimes something stronger is needed.
Andrew explains that BLM active and retired law enforcement officers and
their families have access to
<a href="https://www.cordico.com/">Cordico</a>, a wellness app that
provides access to licensed clinicians, peer supports, chaplains, and
fitness incentives. It features videos and self-assessments for stress
reduction, sleep improvement, suicide prevention, financial education,
better nutrition, and more. Healthy officers have effective interactions
with the public, which in turn positively affects their view of BLM law
enforcement.
</p>
<p>
BLM employees, regardless of their job title, also have access to a free
health and wellness app, called Headspace. This app allows users to
explore guided mindfulness activities and events, including getting
better sleep, quieting your mind, being present, or managing stress and
anxiety. To learn more about it, enroll in the
<a href="https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/blm-NTC-Course-and-Training-Information/Announcements/SitePages/Headspace(1).aspx?CT=1718642561665&amp;OR=OWA-NT-Mail&amp;CID=fd732644-5bde-93dc-5389-bbdedc00f6ac">virtual

<p>
Military Veterans, like law enforcement officers, not only are more
likely than civilians to have PTSD, but their suicide rate is 1.5 times
higher.
<a href="https://braveheartsriding.org/services/">BraveHearts</a>
understands this more than most and uses horses to help veterans connect
with their emotions. As Winston Churchill once said, “no hour of life is
lost that is spent in the saddle.”
</p>
<p>
Since 2007, BraveHearts has been nationally recognized for providing
equine-assisted services to Veterans across the country, but primarily
in Illinois and Wisconsin. They are the largest equine-assisted services
program for Veterans in the country, serving more than 1,000 Veterans in
the last year.
</p>
<p>
Imagine spending years away from home, in one unfamiliar location or
many, surrounded by people who would sacrifice their lives for you as
much as you’d sacrifice yours to protect them. All the while you spend
your time in this tight-knit community with your days and your tasks
highly structured, following a clear command structure. Then imagine
you’re back home with few or no support structures, surrounded by people
who may have difficulty relating to that world.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine a Veteran, almost giving up hope of ever feeling normal
again, finding commonality with a mustang. Both are intelligent,
independent, hypervigilant, slow to trust, wary, loyal, and strong.
Meggan Hill-McQueeney, President and Chief Operating Officer of
BraveHearts, adopted four horses from BLM in 2013 to teach Veterans how
to gentle the wild mustangs. Four years later, these mustangs, who began
their lives on BLM land, participated in the Trail to Zero ride in New
York City. Trail to Zero is a 20-mile ride on horseback through major
cities to bring attention to Veterans’ high suicide rate and the
benefits of using equine-assisted services for healing.
</p>
<p>
Last year Laura Steiglitz, former U.S. Navy Corpsman, rode her favorite
mustang, Oatie, in the Trail to Zero ride in New York City, carrying the
ribbons of six veterans who died by suicide.

“Oatie and I really helped each other. When I felt overwhelmed and
overstimulated, he helped ground and calm me, and I did the same for
him,” she said. “Mustangs and Veterans – we’re both hypervigilant, so
when I see my horse standing calm, it reminds me there’s no immediate
danger, so I can relax and breathe.”
</p>
<p>
Laura’s confidence carries beyond the ranch as she learns how to use her
gifts to best help others, including demonstrating the benefits of
working with mustangs to a group of Mounted Police Officers.
</p>
<p>
BraveHearts is training their third group of mustangs and is now
mentoring five other centers on using mustangs to work with Veterans.
They only work with centers that are accredited through the Professional

<p>
June is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. A person who has
difficulty recovering after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying
event can develop PTSD, a serious and sometimes debilitating mental
health condition. Symptoms can include nightmares, unwanted memories,
avoidance of certain situations, heightened reactions, anxiety, or
depression. It can last months or years and triggers can cause
flashbacks accompanied by intense emotional and physical reactions.
Medical intervention, including psychotherapy and medications, are often
warranted.
</p>
<p>
Law enforcement officers, military Veterans, first responders, and
others in high-stress occupations experience higher rates of PTSD as
these jobs are more likely to cross paths with trauma. According to the
<a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_adults.asp">National
Center for PTSD</a>, a program of the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, about six out of 100 adults will experience PTSD at some point
in their lives. By contrast, about 23 out of every 100 veterans using
the VA Healthcare System experience PTSD at some point. This rate may be
even higher when veterans using private care—or seeking no care—are
considered. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of BLM law enforcement, an added stressor comes from the
fact that officers often work alone in remote areas where backup is
hours away.

The
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ113/PLAW-115publ113.pdf">Law
Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017</a> recognizes that
law enforcement agencies need and deserve support to protect their
employees’ mental health and wellbeing.
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/31/2022-11810/advancing-effective-accountable-policing-and-criminal-justice-practices-to-enhance-public-trust-and">Executive
Order 14074</a> requires those agencies to develop their own wellness
practices and policies for Federal officers.
</p>
<p>
Andrew Prys, Senior Special Agent, is on a detail to do just that as the
BLM Law Enforcement Wellness Coordinator in the Office of Law
Enforcement and Security. With nearly two decades in law enforcement and
partnering with the National Interagency Fire Center, other DOI
agencies, and the U.S. Forest Service, he’s developing the BLM Law
Enforcement Wellness Program. Goals include reducing cultural stigma
within the law enforcement community against getting help and
strengthening protections against stressors, trauma, and poor health
outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The program integrates BLM law enforcement officers’ physical,
emotional, mental, and spiritual health; it includes improvements in
hiring, retention, diversity, and inclusion. The theme is
connectivity–connecting to nature and connecting to each other.
