Canyon National Park Initiates Water Conservation Measures—Nov. 26,
2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-26, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park is implementing mandatory water
conservation measures for the South Rim, effective immediately. These
measures are in response to a pipeline break along the North Kaibab
Trail, which has impacted the park’s water supply.</p>
<p>To help conserve water, all residents, visitors, and park operations
are urged to reduce water usage wherever possible, including in homes,
hotel rooms, and campgrounds. These efforts are critical to maintaining
water availability while still ensuring public health and safety.
