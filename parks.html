This year’s Smokey Bear Days featured two days of events, food and
music, as well as talks about the nearby Fort Stanton Cave by Knutt
Peterson, a cave and karst specialist for the Bureau of Land Management
Roswell Field Office.
</p>
<p>
Peterson gave two talks on May 4 at the Capitan Public Library,
highlighting educational outreach and scientific projects in the cave,
recreation opportunities at the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave
National Conservation Area, and BLM’s sinkhole cleanup activities in the
area. He included many photos, maps and informational slides to
illustrate the talks.
</p>
<p>
Firefighters found the original Smokey Bear cub near Capitan in 1950,
and the U.S. Forest Service’s Smokey Bear Ranger District surrounds much
of Capitan and the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National
Conservation Area. The village holds the celebration every five years.
In addition to Peterson’s talks, the BLM staffed an informational table
May 3 and 4.

<p>
Fort Stanton Cave, which receives its name from the nearby historic
military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United
States and the 62nd longest cave in the world, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
“It has more mapped passage than Carlsbad Caverns,” Peterson told
visitors at the 11:15 a.m. talk May 4. “If you’ve been in Carlsbad
Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”
</p>
<p>
The Snowy River Passage, within Fort Stanton Cave, is composed of white
calcite deposited by water that sometimes flows through the cave,
Peterson said. When traveling on Snowy River Passage, which is about 13
miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.
</p>
<p>
The BLM has kept Fort Stanton Cave closed to recreational caving for
about 10 years due to white-nose syndrome, a contagious fungal infection
that kills about 90% of bats it infects, it is only open for educational
and scientific use.
</p>
<p>
The BLM limits entries into the cave to 350 a year, Peterson said. About
100 of those entries are for youths entering the cave for educational
purposes, and the rest are for scientific entries.

<p>
The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s
climate and soil contents, Peterson said. They also continue to map the
cave and restore it from damage due to past recreational use.
</p>
<p>
The Roswell Field Office is a leader in white-nose decontamination,
Peterson said.  The use of dedicated gear at Fort Stanton Cave also
helps stop the potential for the human spread of white-nose syndrome to
and from the cave. Every time cavers use the Fort Stanton Cave gear,
Peterson and others wash and decontaminate it.
</p>
<p>
“Because we can ‘decon’ large quantities of gear we’ve taken the ‘decon’
station to major caving events around the country and talk about
decontaminating cave gear,” Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
Although Fort Stanton Cave is closed to recreation, the rest of the NCA
has many other recreational opportunities, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
The NCA includes two campgrounds, Cave Campground and Rob Jaggers
Campground, and 70 miles of trails that are open to hikers, equestrians
and mountain bikers, Peterson said. There are also opportunities for
visiting cultural and historical sites, picnicking, hunting, wildlife
viewing, nature study and photography.
</p>
<p>
The BLM also has a program that removes trash from sinkholes in the
Sacramento Gypsum Plains north of Capitan, Peterson said. Most of the
projects involve volunteers, but some are too large and require the BLM
to hire contractors to remove trash.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future of Fort Stanton Cave, Peterson said the BLM plans
to continue exploration, restoration and public outreach efforts as much
as possible.

Canyon National Park to lift Stage 2 Fire Restrictions Monday, July
1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>Effective on Monday, July 1 at 8 a.m., Stage 2 fire restrictions are
rescinded for the entire Grand Canyon National Park. Increased monsoonal
activity throughout northern Arizona has significantly lowered the fire
danger risk within the last week.</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park will remain in Stage 1 fire restrictions
which requires that a campfire always be in a designated fire ring
within a maintained campground.

military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United

<p>
This year’s Smokey Bear Days featured two days of events, food and
music, as well as talks about the nearby Fort Stanton Cave by Knutt
Peterson, a cave and karst specialist for the Bureau of Land Management
Roswell Field Office.
</p>
<p>
Peterson gave two talks on May 4 at the Capitan Public Library,
highlighting educational outreach and scientific projects in the cave,
recreation opportunities at the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave
National Conservation Area, and BLM’s sinkhole cleanup activities in the
area. He included many photos, maps and informational slides to
illustrate the talks.
</p>
<p>
Firefighters found the original Smokey Bear cub near Capitan in 1950,
and the U.S. Forest Service’s Smokey Bear Ranger District surrounds much
of Capitan and the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National
Conservation Area. The village holds the celebration every five years.
In addition to Peterson’s talks, the BLM staffed an informational table
May 3 and 4.

<p>
Fort Stanton Cave, which receives its name from the nearby historic
military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United
States and the 62nd longest cave in the world, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
“It has more mapped passage than Carlsbad Caverns,” Peterson told
visitors at the 11:15 a.m. talk May 4. “If you’ve been in Carlsbad
Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”
</p>
<p>
The Snowy River Passage, within Fort Stanton Cave, is composed of white
calcite deposited by water that sometimes flows through the cave,
Peterson said. When traveling on Snowy River Passage, which is about 13
miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.
</p>
<p>
The BLM has kept Fort Stanton Cave closed to recreational caving for
about 10 years due to white-nose syndrome, a contagious fungal infection
that kills about 90% of bats it infects, it is only open for educational
and scientific use.
</p>
<p>
The BLM limits entries into the cave to 350 a year, Peterson said. About
100 of those entries are for youths entering the cave for educational
purposes, and the rest are for scientific entries.

<p>
The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s
climate and soil contents, Peterson said. They also continue to map the
cave and restore it from damage due to past recreational use.
</p>
<p>
The Roswell Field Office is a leader in white-nose decontamination,
Peterson said.  The use of dedicated gear at Fort Stanton Cave also
helps stop the potential for the human spread of white-nose syndrome to
and from the cave. Every time cavers use the Fort Stanton Cave gear,
Peterson and others wash and decontaminate it.
</p>
<p>
“Because we can ‘decon’ large quantities of gear we’ve taken the ‘decon’
station to major caving events around the country and talk about
decontaminating cave gear,” Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
Although Fort Stanton Cave is closed to recreation, the rest of the NCA
has many other recreational opportunities, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
The NCA includes two campgrounds, Cave Campground and Rob Jaggers
Campground, and 70 miles of trails that are open to hikers, equestrians
and mountain bikers, Peterson said. There are also opportunities for
visiting cultural and historical sites, picnicking, hunting, wildlife
viewing, nature study and photography.
</p>
<p>
The BLM also has a program that removes trash from sinkholes in the
Sacramento Gypsum Plains north of Capitan, Peterson said. Most of the
projects involve volunteers, but some are too large and require the BLM
to hire contractors to remove trash.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future of Fort Stanton Cave, Peterson said the BLM plans
to continue exploration, restoration and public outreach efforts as much
as possible.

Fort Stanton Cave, which receives its name from the nearby historic
military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United
States and the 62nd longest cave in the world, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
“It has more mapped passage than Carlsbad Caverns,” Peterson told
visitors at the 11:15 a.m. talk May 4. “If you’ve been in Carlsbad
Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”

miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.

The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s
climate and soil contents, Peterson said. They also continue to map the
cave and restore it from damage due to past recreational use.
</p>
<p>
The Roswell Field Office is a leader in white-nose decontamination,
Peterson said.  The use of dedicated gear at Fort Stanton Cave also
helps stop the potential for the human spread of white-nose syndrome to
and from the cave. Every time cavers use the Fort Stanton Cave gear,
Peterson and others wash and decontaminate it.
</p>
<p>
“Because we can ‘decon’ large quantities of gear we’ve taken the ‘decon’
station to major caving events around the country and talk about
decontaminating cave gear,” Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
Although Fort Stanton Cave is closed to recreation, the rest of the NCA
has many other recreational opportunities, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
The NCA includes two campgrounds, Cave Campground and Rob Jaggers
Campground, and 70 miles of trails that are open to hikers, equestrians
and mountain bikers, Peterson said. There are also opportunities for
visiting cultural and historical sites, picnicking, hunting, wildlife
viewing, nature study and photography.
</p>
<p>
The BLM also has a program that removes trash from sinkholes in the
Sacramento Gypsum Plains north of Capitan, Peterson said. Most of the
projects involve volunteers, but some are too large and require the BLM
to hire contractors to remove trash.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future of Fort Stanton Cave, Peterson said the BLM plans
to continue exploration, restoration and public outreach efforts as much
as possible.

This year’s Smokey Bear Days featured two days of events, food and
music, as well as talks about the nearby Fort Stanton Cave by Knutt
Peterson, a cave and karst specialist for the Bureau of Land Management
Roswell Field Office.
</p>
<p>
Peterson gave two talks on May 4 at the Capitan Public Library,
highlighting educational outreach and scientific projects in the cave,
recreation opportunities at the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave
National Conservation Area, and BLM’s sinkhole cleanup activities in the
area. He included many photos, maps and informational slides to
illustrate the talks.
</p>
<p>
Firefighters found the original Smokey Bear cub near Capitan in 1950,
and the U.S. Forest Service’s Smokey Bear Ranger District surrounds much
of Capitan and the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National
Conservation Area. The village holds the celebration every five years.
In addition to Peterson’s talks, the BLM staffed an informational table
May 3 and 4.

Fort Stanton Cave, which receives its name from the nearby historic
military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United
States and the 62nd longest cave in the world, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
“It has more mapped passage than Carlsbad Caverns,” Peterson told
visitors at the 11:15 a.m. talk May 4. “If you’ve been in Carlsbad
Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”
</p>
<p>
The Snowy River Passage, within Fort Stanton Cave, is composed of white
calcite deposited by water that sometimes flows through the cave,
Peterson said. When traveling on Snowy River Passage, which is about 13
miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.
</p>
<p>
The BLM has kept Fort Stanton Cave closed to recreational caving for
about 10 years due to white-nose syndrome, a contagious fungal infection
that kills about 90% of bats it infects, it is only open for educational
and scientific use.
</p>
<p>
The BLM limits entries into the cave to 350 a year, Peterson said. About
100 of those entries are for youths entering the cave for educational
purposes, and the rest are for scientific entries.

<p>
The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s
climate and soil contents, Peterson said. They also continue to map the
cave and restore it from damage due to past recreational use.
</p>
<p>
The Roswell Field Office is a leader in white-nose decontamination,
Peterson said.  The use of dedicated gear at Fort Stanton Cave also
helps stop the potential for the human spread of white-nose syndrome to
and from the cave. Every time cavers use the Fort Stanton Cave gear,
Peterson and others wash and decontaminate it.

“Because we can ‘decon’ large quantities of gear we’ve taken the ‘decon’

</p>
<p>
Although Fort Stanton Cave is closed to recreation, the rest of the NCA
has many other recreational opportunities, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
The NCA includes two campgrounds, Cave Campground and Rob Jaggers
Campground, and 70 miles of trails that are open to hikers, equestrians
and mountain bikers, Peterson said. There are also opportunities for
visiting cultural and historical sites, picnicking, hunting, wildlife
viewing, nature study and photography.
</p>
<p>
The BLM also has a program that removes trash from sinkholes in the
Sacramento Gypsum Plains north of Capitan, Peterson said. Most of the
projects involve volunteers, but some are too large and require the BLM
to hire contractors to remove trash.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future of Fort Stanton Cave, Peterson said the BLM plans
to continue exploration, restoration and public outreach efforts as much
as possible.

Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”
</p>
<p>
The Snowy River Passage, within Fort Stanton Cave, is composed of white
calcite deposited by water that sometimes flows through the cave,
Peterson said. When traveling on Snowy River Passage, which is about 13
miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.
</p>
<p>
The BLM has kept Fort Stanton Cave closed to recreational caving for
about 10 years due to white-nose syndrome, a contagious fungal infection
that kills about 90% of bats it infects, it is only open for educational
and scientific use.
</p>
<p>
The BLM limits entries into the cave to 350 a year, Peterson said. About
100 of those entries are for youths entering the cave for educational
purposes, and the rest are for scientific entries.

<p>
The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s
climate and soil contents, Peterson said. They also continue to map the
cave and restore it from damage due to past recreational use.
</p>
<p>
The Roswell Field Office is a leader in white-nose decontamination,
Peterson said.  The use of dedicated gear at Fort Stanton Cave also
helps stop the potential for the human spread of white-nose syndrome to
and from the cave. Every time cavers use the Fort Stanton Cave gear,
Peterson and others wash and decontaminate it.
</p>
<p>
“Because we can ‘decon’ large quantities of gear we’ve taken the ‘decon’
station to major caving events around the country and talk about
decontaminating cave gear,” Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
Although Fort Stanton Cave is closed to recreation, the rest of the NCA
has many other recreational opportunities, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
The NCA includes two campgrounds, Cave Campground and Rob Jaggers
Campground, and 70 miles of trails that are open to hikers, equestrians
and mountain bikers, Peterson said. There are also opportunities for
visiting cultural and historical sites, picnicking, hunting, wildlife
viewing, nature study and photography.
</p>
<p>
The BLM also has a program that removes trash from sinkholes in the
Sacramento Gypsum Plains north of Capitan, Peterson said. Most of the
projects involve volunteers, but some are too large and require the BLM
to hire contractors to remove trash.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future of Fort Stanton Cave, Peterson said the BLM plans
to continue exploration, restoration and public outreach efforts as much
as possible.

<p>
This year’s Smokey Bear Days featured two days of events, food and
music, as well as talks about the nearby Fort Stanton Cave by Knutt
Peterson, a cave and karst specialist for the Bureau of Land Management
Roswell Field Office.
</p>
<p>
Peterson gave two talks on May 4 at the Capitan Public Library,
highlighting educational outreach and scientific projects in the cave,
recreation opportunities at the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave
National Conservation Area, and BLM’s sinkhole cleanup activities in the
area. He included many photos, maps and informational slides to
illustrate the talks.
</p>
<p>
Firefighters found the original Smokey Bear cub near Capitan in 1950,
and the U.S. Forest Service’s Smokey Bear Ranger District surrounds much
of Capitan and the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National
Conservation Area. The village holds the celebration every five years.
In addition to Peterson’s talks, the BLM staffed an informational table
May 3 and 4.

Fort Stanton Cave, which receives its name from the nearby historic
military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United
States and the 62nd longest cave in the world, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
“It has more mapped passage than Carlsbad Caverns,” Peterson told
visitors at the 11:15 a.m. talk May 4. “If you’ve been in Carlsbad
Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”
</p>
<p>
The Snowy River Passage, within Fort Stanton Cave, is composed of white
calcite deposited by water that sometimes flows through the cave,
Peterson said. When traveling on Snowy River Passage, which is about 13
miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.
</p>
<p>
The BLM has kept Fort Stanton Cave closed to recreational caving for
about 10 years due to white-nose syndrome, a contagious fungal infection
that kills about 90% of bats it infects, it is only open for educational
and scientific use.
</p>
<p>
The BLM limits entries into the cave to 350 a year, Peterson said. About
100 of those entries are for youths entering the cave for educational
purposes, and the rest are for scientific entries.

The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.

<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s

<p>
Peterson gave two talks on May 4 at the Capitan Public Library,
highlighting educational outreach and scientific projects in the cave,
recreation opportunities at the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave
National Conservation Area, and BLM’s sinkhole cleanup activities in the
area. He included many photos, maps and informational slides to
illustrate the talks.

Firefighters found the original Smokey Bear cub near Capitan in 1950,
and the U.S. Forest Service’s Smokey Bear Ranger District surrounds much
of Capitan and the BLM’s Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National
Conservation Area. The village holds the celebration every five years.
In addition to Peterson’s talks, the BLM staffed an informational table
May 3 and 4.

Fort Stanton Cave, which receives its name from the nearby historic
military fort run by the State of New Mexico, includes more than 44
miles of mapped passage, and is the 10th longest cave in the United
States and the 62nd longest cave in the world, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
“It has more mapped passage than Carlsbad Caverns,” Peterson told
visitors at the 11:15 a.m. talk May 4. “If you’ve been in Carlsbad
Caverns, [Fort Stanton Cave] is a bigger cave. There may be bigger rooms
[at Carlsbad Caverns]. There may be more formations there, but as far as
extent of passage, this one is much bigger. This is just as spectacular
in its own way.”
</p>
<p>
The Snowy River Passage, within Fort Stanton Cave, is composed of white
calcite deposited by water that sometimes flows through the cave,
Peterson said. When traveling on Snowy River Passage, which is about 13
miles long, cavers must wear elbow and kneepads because the surface of
the formation is extremely abrasive.
</p>
<p>
The BLM has kept Fort Stanton Cave closed to recreational caving for
about 10 years due to white-nose syndrome, a contagious fungal infection
that kills about 90% of bats it infects, it is only open for educational
and scientific use.
</p>
<p>
The BLM limits entries into the cave to 350 a year, Peterson said. About
100 of those entries are for youths entering the cave for educational
purposes, and the rest are for scientific entries.

The BLM’s educational outreach program features Caver Quest Academy, in
partnership with the nonprofit Public Lands Interpretive Association,
which teaches local seventh graders about Fort Stanton Cave in the
classroom, includes a realistic video game about caving, and culminates
in a trip to the cave for many of them, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
In terms of scientific entries, scientists monitor bats, the cave’s
climate and soil contents, Peterson said. They also continue to map the
cave and restore it from damage due to past recreational use.
</p>
<p>
The Roswell Field Office is a leader in white-nose decontamination,
Peterson said.  The use of dedicated gear at Fort Stanton Cave also
helps stop the potential for the human spread of white-nose syndrome to
and from the cave. Every time cavers use the Fort Stanton Cave gear,
Peterson and others wash and decontaminate it.
</p>
<p>
“Because we can ‘decon’ large quantities of gear we’ve taken the ‘decon’
station to major caving events around the country and talk about
decontaminating cave gear,” Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
Although Fort Stanton Cave is closed to recreation, the rest of the NCA
has many other recreational opportunities, Peterson said.
</p>
<p>
The NCA includes two campgrounds, Cave Campground and Rob Jaggers
Campground, and 70 miles of trails that are open to hikers, equestrians
and mountain bikers, Peterson said. There are also opportunities for
visiting cultural and historical sites, picnicking, hunting, wildlife
viewing, nature study and photography.
</p>
<p>
The BLM also has a program that removes trash from sinkholes in the
Sacramento Gypsum Plains north of Capitan, Peterson said. Most of the
projects involve volunteers, but some are too large and require the BLM
to hire contractors to remove trash.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future of Fort Stanton Cave, Peterson said the BLM plans
to continue exploration, restoration and public outreach efforts as much
as possible.
