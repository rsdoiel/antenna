analysis aims to optimize solar energy development throughout the
West</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Bureau of Land Management, California</p>
<div class="field contact-block -teaser-image">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/styles/teaser/public/images/2024-01/53166029462_7a10f04ae9_c.jpg?h=96046cf0&itok=o0BpyNWE" width="150" height="100" alt="angled solar panels" typeof="foaf:Image" />
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WASHINGTON &lt;/b&gt;— The Department of the Interior today announced an updated roadmap for solar energy development across the West, designed to expand solar energy production in more Western states and make renewable energy siting and permitting on America’s public lands more efficient. The Bureau of Land Management also announced the next steps on several renewable projects in Arizona, California and Nevada, representing more than 1,700 megawatts of potential solar generation and 1,300 megawatts of potential battery storage capacity. &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Together, these milestones represent continued momentum from President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda – a key pillar of Bidenomics – which
is working to accelerate the clean energy and transmission buildout to
lower consumers’ energy costs, prevent power outages in the face of
extreme weather, create good-paying union jobs, tackle the climate
crisis, advance the priorities of clean air and environmental justice
for all, and achieve the President’s goal of a 100 percent clean
electricity grid by 2035. During the Biden-Harris administration, the
BLM has approved 47 clean energy projects and permitted 11,236 megawatts
of wind, solar and geothermal energy on public lands – enough to power
more than 3.5 million homes. 
</p>
<p>
“The Interior Department’s work to responsibly and quickly develop
renewable energy projects is crucial to achieving the Biden-Harris
administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 –
and this updated solar roadmap will help us get there in more states and
on more lands across the West,” said <b>Acting Deputy Secretary Laura
Daniel-Davis</b><b>. </b>“Through historic investments from President
Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the Interior Department is helping
build modern, resilient climate infrastructure that protects our
communities from the worsening impacts of climate change.” 
</p>
<p>
“Our public lands are playing a critical role in the clean energy
transition – and the progress the Bureau of Land Management is
announcing today on several clean energy projects across the West
represents our continued momentum in achieving those goals,” said <b>BLM
Director Tracy Stone-Manning</b>. “Investing in clean and reliable
renewable energy represents the BLM’s commitment to building a clean
energy economy, tackling the climate crisis, promoting American energy
security, and creating jobs in communities across the country.” 
</p>
<h2>
<b>Updated Roadmap for Solar Energy Development on Public Lands</b> 
</h2>
<p>
The Department today published a draft analysis of the Utility-Scale
Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (known as the
updated Western Solar Plan), which would streamline the BLM’s framework
for siting solar energy projects in order to support current and future
national clean energy goals, long-term energy security, climate
resilience, and improved conservation outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
The proposal is an update of BLM’s
<a data-auth="VerificationFailed" data-linkindex="0" href="https://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Obama-Administration-Approves-Roadmap-for-Utility-Scale-Solar-Energy-Development-on-Public-Lands" originalsrc="https://doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Obama-Administration-Approves-Roadmap-for-Utility-Scale-Solar-Energy-Development-on-Public-Lands" rel="noopener noreferrer" shash="LlA92BVPvW6f1wk6l6HK1rbld4LAUNBYGe6WFIxijGY21dljM+aPGXMeI/psmt0wTBv3lFqL2ZhVhfG5D6ZGCFvAUR6a4z2uABS+0vMRNvI7rdN2uKhzcvkhJFmtT2abqKLFpBgXoXphy4rzjwyfeMnD/aja3EtinwRK2g9uuz8=" target="_blank" title="">2012
Western Solar Plan</a>, which identified areas in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah with high solar potential and low
resource conflicts in order to guide responsible solar development and
provide certainty to developers. Following months of stakeholder
engagements – including 15 public scoping meetings – the updated roadmap
refines the analysis in the original six states and expands it to
include Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming. 
</p>
<p>
In considering updates to the Western Solar Plan, the BLM worked closely
with the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory to
examine forecasts for national clean energy needs and determined that
approximately 700,000 acres of public lands would be needed to meet
those goals. The BLM’s preferred alternative in the updated Western
Solar Plan would provide approximately 22 million acres of land open for
solar application, giving maximum flexibility to reach the nation’s
clean energy goals.  
</p>
<p>
By directing development to areas that have fewer sensitive resources,
less conflict with other uses of public lands, and close proximity to
transmission lines, the BLM can permit clean energy more efficiently
while maintaining robust public and Tribal engagement, which are central
features of all BLM reviews of individual projects. 
</p>
<p>
BLM utilized $4.3 million from the
<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="1" href="https://www.doi.gov/inflation-reduction-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Inflation
Reduction Act</a> to invest in these important updates to the Western
Solar Plan. This investment is helping improve the solar development
application process by providing developers with better predictability,
while also maintaining sufficient flexibility to address site-specific
resource considerations. This planning work also seeks to provide
updates that respond to changes, like advances in technology, that have
occurred since the BLM’s last programmatic solar development planning
effort over a decade ago. 
</p>
<p>
The analysis announced today evaluates six alternatives, each proposing
to make different amounts of public land available to solar development
applications under different criteria such as proximity to transmission
infrastructure, designated critical habitat, or other important
ecological and cultural resources. Public input will inform a Final
Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision. The
public can submit written comments through April 18, 2024. More details
are available on

<h2>
<b>Continued Progress on Onshore Renewable Energy Development</b> 
</h2>
<p>
The BLM today also announced next steps on several onshore renewable
projects throughout the West, representing significant progress on
projects that will help achieve the President’s goal of a 100 percent
clean electricity grid by 2035. 
</p>
<p>
In Nevada, the BLM is advancing four proposed solar projects: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The BLM released a draft environmental impact statement for the proposed
Libra Solar Project in Mineral and Lyon counties, which, if approved,
will generate and store up to 700 megawatts of photovoltaic solar energy
that would power approximately 212,233 homes.  
</li>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;The BLM released a draft environmental impact statement for the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project, which, if approved, will add 400 megawatts of clean solar photovoltaic power to the grid, enough to power approximately 121,276 homes. The proposed project would also include a 700-megawatt battery energy storage system.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The BLM announced a Notice of Intent for the Dodge Flat II Solar project in Nevada, which, if approved, will generate up to 200 megawatts of photovoltaic solar energy on approximately 700 acres of public lands in Washoe county. This would be enough to power approximately 60,638 homes.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The BLM released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blm.gov/press-release/bureau-land-management-seeks-comments-proposed-dry-lake-east-energy-center-solar&quot;&gt;draft environmental assessment for the Dry Lake East Energy Center Solar Project&lt;/a&gt;, which would build a 200 MW photovoltaic solar facility with 200 MW of battery energy storage and an additional 400 MW battery energy storage facility. &lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
</ul>
<p>
In California, the BLM will release in the coming days a Notice to
Proceed for the Camino Solar Project in Kern County, allowing
construction to begin on a 44-megawatt photovoltaic solar facility on
233 acres of public land that will power approximately 13,340 homes.  
</p>
<p>
In Arizona, the BLM today announced that construction of the White Wing
Ranch Solar Project has been completed. White Wing Ranch is a
179-megawatt solar photovoltaic project located on private lands in Yuma
County with a generation interconnection (gen-tie) line across
approximately 3.5 miles of BLM administered land. This project has the
potential to power 54,271 homes.  
</p>
<p>
The BLM also announced that construction on the Harquahala Valley (HV)
Sunrise gen-tie line in Arizona will begin in February. It will connect
the HV Sun solar project, which is a 150-megawatt solar photovoltaic
project located on 1,000 acres of private lands in Maricopa County, with
a gen-tie transmission line across approximately 1.1 miles of BLM
administered land. This project will power approximately 45,479 homes. 
</p>
<p>
The BLM is currently processing 67 utility-scale onshore clean energy
projects proposed on public lands in the western United States. This
includes solar, wind, and geothermal projects, as well as gen-tie lines
that are vital to clean energy projects proposed on non-federal land.
These projects have the combined potential to add more than 37 gigawatts
of renewable energy to the western electric grid. The BLM is also
undertaking the preliminary review of over 195 applications for solar
and wind development, as well as 97 applications for solar and wind
energy site area testing.
