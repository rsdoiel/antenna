Fort Stanton Cave restoration crews will have eight volunteer Capitan
High School athletes to thank when they’re cleaning formations within
the cave this summer.
</p>
<p>
Fort Stanton Cave is within the Bureau of Land Management’s Fort Stanton
– Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area, and Knutt Peterson, a
cave specialist for the BLM Roswell Field Office, coordinated the
students, who either belong to the track team or run cross country, to
bring 140 liters (37 gallons) of water a mile into the cave for this
summer’s restoration projects.

The effort not only helps with cave restoration but allows local youths
to gain an appreciation for caving. On the first trip in May, Carrin
Rich, volunteer restoration coordinator, and Aleksandr Knapowski, a BLM
geologist, led the trip, and on June 3, Rich and Minori Yoshida, a
volunteer cave restorer, led a second trip.
</p>
<p>
Water is a precious commodity during cave restoration trips, Peterson
said. The restoration sites are about a mile into the cave, so running a
hose is impossible, and there are not any natural in-cave sources of
water, so people need to haul all their water into the cave.
</p>
<p>
While volunteers who participate in cave restoration projects normally
bring three to 10 liters of water with them, that amount only lasts
about eight hours, Peterson said. The extra water the students bring in
allows them to extend their restoration work another four hours on each
trip. This cache of water will support restoration trips this season and
into the future.

</p>
<p>
Jewel Joy, a senior, said the experience has made her into a caver.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s really fun,” Joy said. “I really want to get into it now.
It’s just cool – all the formations, to think about how it formed.”
</p>
<p>
Tegan Uller, who recently graduated, said hauling the water was tough at
times, and his knees were burning from the crawling, but it was a good
experience overall. “Besides that, it was really fun,” he said. “I would
recommend it.”
</p>
<p>
Kainin DeSalvo, a sophomore, said he really likes crawling and
navigating tight spaces in caves. “Not everybody can do it,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Rich said she has been caving at Fort Stanton Cave for 10 years and
really appreciates the work the students did on the trips.
</p>
<p>
“They were amazing,” Rich said. “The kids were absolutely amazing. They
did great today. Because they’re already teammates as athletes, they
have a great teamwork ethic, and they have a good camaraderie among
them.”
</p>
<p>
The work was physically difficult, Rich said, and the students did it
happily.
</p>
<p>
“I think as athletes, they’re used to the suffering,” Rich said.
“They’re used to working through pain, so you could push them, and they
could get through stuff that I think people who don’t have an athletic
background couldn’t necessarily do.”

Fatality along the River Trail within Grand Canyon National Park</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>On June 29 at approximately 7 p.m., the Grand Canyon Regional
Communications Center received a report of a semi-conscious hiker on the
River Trail, approximately halfway between the Silver Bridge and Black
Bridge near Phantom Ranch.</p>
<p>The hiker became unresponsive shortly thereafter and bystanders
initiated CPR as three National Park Service (NPS) paramedics responded
from Phantom Ranch. All attempts by bystanders and NPS personnel to
resuscitate the individual were unsuccessful.
