The Banded Burrowing Owl
</h1>
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BLM wildlife biologist’s recent sighting of a banded bird in his field office area led to a remarkable example of inter-agency collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Craig Miller, who works for the BLM’s Havre Field Office, was conducting
sage-grouse surveys in a remote area of the Upper Missouri River Breaks
in north-central Montana when he noticed some burrowing owls on a small
prairie dog town. One of the owls was pretty close to the two-track dirt
road he was traveling, and he thought he may have seen an identifying
band on its legs.

<p>
Bird banding is an important technique used by professional wildlife
researchers for studying and identifying individual birds. Scientists
put aluminum or colored bands on birds’ legs. And, much like the license
plate on a car, each metal band is engraved with a unique set of
numbers.
</p>
<p>
“As I was grabbing the binoculars, I thought to myself, there is no way
I would be able to see a small band on an owl with the naked eye,” said
Miller. “Much to my surprise, BINGO, banded owl.”

Miller took several photos of the banded owl using a spotting scope. He
was only able to see a blueish-colored band with an R and a couple of 2s
on it, as well as some numbers on a silver band on the bird’s other leg.
He wasn’t certain how to find out more about the owl, so he reached out
to a former colleague at the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service</a>. 
</p>
<p>
A few emails later, the email group network had expanded to include
almost a dozen wildlife professionals from the BLM, U.S. FWS, the
<a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/">University of Idaho</a>, a global owl
conservation organization and an owl researcher in Canada.
</p>
<p>
“With the help of all of the experts on the email chain, we were able to
identify the banded individual owl,” Miller said. “It was a pretty cool
experience.”
</p>
<p>
David H. Johnson, founder of the
<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/global_owl_project/owl_paintings.html">Global
Owl Project</a>, who works with 450 people in 65 countries to research,
track and preserve owl habitat, got drawn into the email chain. Among
Johnson’s professional contacts in Canada, researchers identified the
owl as one that had been banded in Alberta.
</p>
<p>
“That BUOW (burrowing owl) was banded July 11, 2022, by Conservation
&amp; Science team members working for the Wilder Institute. It was
captured as a nestling, in the wild, inside an artificial nest-burrow,”
Dr. Troy Wellicome, senior species-at-risk biologist with the Canadian
Wildlife Service,
<a href="http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html">Environment
and Climate Change Canada</a>, and adjunct professor at the
<a href="ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a>, Department
of Biological Sciences, in Edmonton, Canada, wrote. “Both of the
nestling’s parents were unbanded, wild BUOWs (i.e., did not spend any
time in human care).” 
</p>
<p>
“The nestling was banded an estimated 30 days after it had hatched
(based on flight feather lengths)…a few miles west of Suffield,
Alberta,” Graham Dixon-MacCallum, a population ecologist at the
<a href="wilderinstitute.org/">Wilder Institute</a> in Alberta, Canada,
wrote. “This nestling was banded with a blue A-Craft aluminum band on
its left leg, with the letter R over the number 22 etched into the blue
anodized band.” 
</p>
<p>
The distance between the burrow in Montana where the blue-banded adult
female was most-recently sighted is about 185 miles (as the owl flies)
from its natal burrow where it was banded.
</p>
<p>
“Importantly now, will be to see if this female nests and produces young
at its current site in Montana,” Johnson noted. 
</p>
<p>
“Make sure to give those burrowing owls a second look,” Miller
suggested. “You never know if they might be part of someone’s important
research.”

Canyon National Park</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>Beginning Friday, June 21, the Bright Angel Point Trail on the North
Rim leading to Bright Angel Point will be closed for construction. This
closure is necessary for the protection of staff and visiting public
during an extensive repair effort to the Bright Angel Point Trail.</p>
<p>The trail will be closed to all pedestrian traffic as National Park
Service (NPS) personnel replace asphalt, move large rocks, and operate
equipment in these areas.

<p>
Craig Miller, who works for the BLM’s Havre Field Office, was conducting
sage-grouse surveys in a remote area of the Upper Missouri River Breaks
in north-central Montana when he noticed some burrowing owls on a small
prairie dog town. One of the owls was pretty close to the two-track dirt
road he was traveling, and he thought he may have seen an identifying
band on its legs.

<p>
Bird banding is an important technique used by professional wildlife
researchers for studying and identifying individual birds. Scientists
put aluminum or colored bands on birds’ legs. And, much like the license
plate on a car, each metal band is engraved with a unique set of
numbers.
</p>
<p>
“As I was grabbing the binoculars, I thought to myself, there is no way
I would be able to see a small band on an owl with the naked eye,” said
Miller. “Much to my surprise, BINGO, banded owl.”

Miller took several photos of the banded owl using a spotting scope. He
was only able to see a blueish-colored band with an R and a couple of 2s
on it, as well as some numbers on a silver band on the bird’s other leg.
He wasn’t certain how to find out more about the owl, so he reached out
to a former colleague at the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service</a>. 
</p>
<p>
A few emails later, the email group network had expanded to include
almost a dozen wildlife professionals from the BLM, U.S. FWS, the
<a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/">University of Idaho</a>, a global owl
conservation organization and an owl researcher in Canada.
</p>
<p>
“With the help of all of the experts on the email chain, we were able to
identify the banded individual owl,” Miller said. “It was a pretty cool
experience.”
</p>
<p>
David H. Johnson, founder of the
<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/global_owl_project/owl_paintings.html">Global
Owl Project</a>, who works with 450 people in 65 countries to research,
track and preserve owl habitat, got drawn into the email chain. Among
Johnson’s professional contacts in Canada, researchers identified the
owl as one that had been banded in Alberta.
</p>
<p>
“That BUOW (burrowing owl) was banded July 11, 2022, by Conservation
&amp; Science team members working for the Wilder Institute. It was
captured as a nestling, in the wild, inside an artificial nest-burrow,”
Dr. Troy Wellicome, senior species-at-risk biologist with the Canadian
Wildlife Service,
<a href="http://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html">Environment
and Climate Change Canada</a>, and adjunct professor at the
<a href="ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a>, Department
of Biological Sciences, in Edmonton, Canada, wrote. “Both of the
nestling’s parents were unbanded, wild BUOWs (i.e., did not spend any
time in human care).” 
</p>
<p>
“The nestling was banded an estimated 30 days after it had hatched
(based on flight feather lengths)…a few miles west of Suffield,
Alberta,” Graham Dixon-MacCallum, a population ecologist at the
<a href="wilderinstitute.org/">Wilder Institute</a> in Alberta, Canada,
wrote. “This nestling was banded with a blue A-Craft aluminum band on
its left leg, with the letter R over the number 22 etched into the blue
anodized band.” 
</p>
<p>
The distance between the burrow in Montana where the blue-banded adult
female was most-recently sighted is about 185 miles (as the owl flies)
from its natal burrow where it was banded.
</p>
<p>
“Importantly now, will be to see if this female nests and produces young
at its current site in Montana,” Johnson noted. 
</p>
<p>
“Make sure to give those burrowing owls a second look,” Miller
suggested. “You never know if they might be part of someone’s important
research.”
