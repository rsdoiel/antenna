      Almost every week – especially during the summer – we get messages from readers who want help with an upcoming trip. They are headed to Kalamazoo, Michigan, and would like a list of woodworking stuff in the area that they can visit. For me, answering these questions is time-consuming. I have to go back and...

      This comb-back chair is based on the chair on the cover of “The Stick Chair Book,” with some modifications detailed below. The finish is fresh milk paint (a recipe from a forthcoming book) tinted with a French mineral pigment called “saffron.” This particular chair is set up for lounging. This summer, I have been tweaking...

      The following is excerpted from “The Intelligent Hand,” by David Binnington Savage. It’s a peek into a woodworking life that’s at a level that most of us can barely imagine. The customers are wealthy and eccentric. The designs have to leap off the page. And the craftsmanship has to be utterly, utterly flawless. Personally, this...

that I’m making. I’ve been wanting to build myself a solid body, short-scale
bass guitar for a while and now’s the time! If you’re a regular visitor to my blog,
you would have noticed a few bass side-projects in amongst all the mandolins.
In that case, you’ll remember that I restored a vintage Kay bass about a year
ago and that’s been the inspiration for this one’s design. In this video I look
