<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Every chair class Chris teaches seems to develop its own
gravitational pull. It’s inevitable – if you orbit within 50 feet of a
class taught by Chris Schwarz you will get sucked in. Now getting sucked
into a class can mean many different things: Perhaps it means assisting
students taper chair legs by hand until…</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Note: If you’re planning on coming to town next month for our Chair
Show and Open Day, here are some restaurants to try. There’s a reason
Cincinnati is one of the fattest cities in the USA. Megan and I often
joke that next year we’re going to flip the script on our classes at

<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>The following is excerpted from Derek Jones’ new book “Cricket
Tables.” Simplicity, necessity and ingenuity are the three key
principles for making cricket tables. This traditional three-legged
table exists in a variety of forms and woods – no two are the same. So
making them follows an organic process – your tools and materials
dictate…</p>

<p>You can now order the carefully chosen wooden parts needed for the
Hobbit-y Chair from The Stick Chair Journal No. 2. The kits are $295 and
are in red elm, my favorite chairmaking wood. You can order a kit here
from Alexander Brothers in Virginia. Shea Alexander and his employees
have been supplying me with…</p>

International Woodworking Festival (LIWF), so Chris I are are busy

<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>I’ve never shown my work in a gallery. I’ve been asked a few times,
but my problem is this: I don’t want to give up 50 percent of the sales
price to the gallery. I’d rather skip the glory of cheese and boxed wine
