Spokeshaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Last week I walked into work to a brand-new Veritas spokeshave
sitting on my bench. Chris had ordered several for students and kindly
ordered an extra for me. (I’m spoiled, I know.) Grateful, I took a
picture of my new tool and posted it to my social media account, not
thinking much of it. The…</p>

<h2 id="shaker-stamps">Shaker Stamps</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-25, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>This summer, the U.S. Postal Service released 12 stamps featuring
photographs by Michael Freeman from six different preserved Shaker
communities, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the first Shakers
arriving in America. Freeman, along with June Sprigg and David Larkin,
published “Shaker: Life, Work, and Art,” in 1991. The stamps were
designed by Postal Service Art…</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from “Shop Tails: The Animals Who Help Us Make
Things Work” by Nancy R. Hiller. Nancy Hiller’s “Shop Tails,” a
companion book of essays to “Making Things Work.” “Shop Tails” is
different from “Making Things Work” in that it is structured around the
animals that came in and out of Nancy’s…</p>

<h2 id="now-shipping-principles-of-design">Now Shipping: ‘Principles of
Design’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>A friend recently took a furniture design course taught by a guy I’ll
call Mr. Famous Furniture Maker. During the class there were lectures,
field trips to find inspiration, drawing lessons, scale model-making and
critiques. “Well,” I asked my friend, “how was the class?” “Great,” he
replied. “Now I know how to design furniture that…</p>

‘Principles of Design’ &amp; Dados</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>By the end of this week (assuming no more disasters), we should have
a clutch of our new Exeter-pattern Furniture-maker’s Hammers for sale,
as well as – finally! – “Principles of Design” (we thought we’d have it
in June, but we’ve been bedeviled by cover problems at the bindery).
“Principles of Design” is our title…</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>This comb-back stick chair is designed for dining and working at a

Oak Trees Will Have More Woody Biomass</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>In an article in “The Conversation,” researchers Rob MacKenzie and
Richard Norby, with the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR),
shared findings from a recent study published in Nature Climate Change.

laboratory is a forest in Staffordshire, England. Their equipment, tall
pipes…</p>
