      <p><span style="background-color: black; color: white;">This is the first in a new series of “Bass Build” videos
that I’m making. I’ve been wanting to build myself a solid body, short-scale
bass guitar for a while and now’s the time! If you’re a regular visitor to my blog,
you would have noticed a few bass side-projects in amongst all the mandolins.
In that case, you’ll remember that I restored a vintage Kay bass about a year
ago and that’s been the inspiration for this one’s design. In this video I look
at designing the bass and solve the problem of a getting a bridge with a narrow
(17mm) string spacing.</span></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahE0j2xM-H0" width="320" youtube-src-id="ahE0j2xM-H0"></iframe></div><br /><span style="background-color: black; color: white;"><br /></span><p></p>
