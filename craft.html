Books</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-18, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>First the good news: Tariffs aren’t yet affecting Lost Art Press
books. We print entirely in the United States. But some of the raw
materials, including some of the papers we use, come from Canada. We
follow the issue closely, and our books might not see any price
increases. The bad news: metal prices are…</p>

<p>This is an excerpt from “With all the Precision Possible: Roubo on
Furniture.” It is a follow-up to the post from a couple weeks ago that

End Panels</h2>

<p>Both Chris and I have made and taught a lot of six-board chests over
the years, and typically we lay out and cut a “boot-jack,” (inverted
V”), simple arc or ogee on the ends. Those are easy to lay out and all
three are relatively easy to cut…and and don’t hurt our brains or
