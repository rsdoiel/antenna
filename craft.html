Rotation</h2>

<p>Good news: We now have 500 pristine-perfect GoDrillas in our
warehouse, and we’re shipping them out as fast as you can order them.
Today ends our six-month saga with manufacturing difficulties with this
tool. If you care about sob stories involving aluminum extrusions and
custom lathe tooling, then this is the bedtime tale for you….</p>

<h2 id="tetanus-is-a-bad-way-to-die">Tetanus is a Bad Way to Die</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>The following is excerpted from Dr. Jeffery Hill’s “Workshop Wound
Care.” The book delves right to the heart of what you need to know when
faced with common workshop injuries, from lacerations, to puncture
wounds to material in the eye. Dr. Hill is an emergency room physician
