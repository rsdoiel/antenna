      <p>The following is excerpted from “James Krenov: Leave Fingerprints,” by Brendan Bernhardt Gaffney.  After years of research and more than 150 interviews, Gaffney produced a definitive biography of Krenov, featuring historical documents, press clippings and hundreds of historical photographs.

      <p>This seven-stick comb-back is Katherine’s first apprenticeship chair, which we built together while teaching a class last week. It’s set up for lounging, with back sticks that rake 20° back and a seat tilt for lounging.   Like all stick chairs, this one bears imperfections that mark how it was made. The leg angles are not...</p>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>Recently we’ve lost two important contributors to our craft: sawmaker Mike Wenzloff and historian Charles Hummel. I knew Mike fairly well, and I met Charlie in person only once. But both people made an indelible mark on me. Mike Wenzloff was a pioneering sawmaker. During the early 2000s, Mike began making incredible handsaws and backsaws...</p>

      <h1>Free Cotton Conversion Chart (Because I’m a Dolt)</h1>

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      I made a mistake when ordering 500 printed cotton conversion charts that translate fractions to decimal to metric. The print job is crisp. The numbers are correct. But I speced the wrong weight of cotton. These are thinner than I intended. They’re perfectly fine – just not what I envisioned. So instead of recycling them,...

      <p>One of the rewards for running a publishing company is getting to say “yes” when other people wouldn’t even know to say “no.” Two summers ago, chairmaker Chris Williams and I visited Drew and Louise Langsner in their home outside Marshall, North Carolina.

      <p>Now is the time to prepare the fretboard (compound radius<br />

the build but of course frets are pretty essential to any fretted instrument!</p>
