      <h1>Woodworking Tourism: A How-to Guide</h1>

      <p>
      Almost every week – especially during the summer – we get messages from readers who want help with an upcoming trip. They are headed to Kalamazoo, Michigan, and would like a list of woodworking stuff in the area that they can visit. For me, answering these questions is time-consuming. I have to go back and...

      <p>
      This comb-back chair is based on the chair on the cover of “The Stick Chair Book,” with some modifications detailed below. The finish is fresh milk paint (a recipe from a forthcoming book) tinted with a French mineral pigment called “saffron.” This particular chair is set up for lounging. This summer, I have been tweaking...

Hayward Years”), in which Hayward wrote, “The influence of mind upon mind is extraordinary.” The idea being there’s often room for improvement.&#160;To that end, we’ve asked you what else you have...

      The following is excerpted from “The Intelligent Hand,” by David Binnington Savage. It’s a peek into a woodworking life that’s at a level that most of us can barely imagine. The customers are wealthy and eccentric. The designs have to leap off the page. And the craftsmanship has to be utterly, utterly flawless. Personally, this...

      <p><span style="background-color: black; color: white;">This is the first in a new series of “Bass Build” videos
that I’m making. I’ve been wanting to build myself a solid body, short-scale
bass guitar for a while and now’s the time! If you’re a regular visitor to my blog,
you would have noticed a few bass side-projects in amongst all the mandolins.
In that case, you’ll remember that I restored a vintage Kay bass about a year
ago and that’s been the inspiration for this one’s design. In this video I look
at designing the bass and solve the problem of a getting a bridge with a narrow
(17mm) string spacing.</span></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahE0j2xM-H0" width="320" youtube-src-id="ahE0j2xM-H0"></iframe></div><br /><span style="background-color: black; color: white;"><br /></span><p></p>

      The following is excerpted from Matthew Bickford’s “Mouldings in Practice.” In this book, Bickford shows you how to turn a set of complicated mouldings into a series of predictable rabbets and chamfers that guide your hollow and round planes to make any moulding that has been made in the past or that you can envision...

      We have a limited run of handmade slipcases hand printed with the image of a honey bee (the symbol of workers everywhere). The slipcase comes with a copy of “The Woodworker’s Pocket Book” plus brass mounting hardware. And we are offering the two together at a special price.
