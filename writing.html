<strong>Brian Hugenbruch </strong>features in the July Escape Pod with

humans surviving in orbit of their home and living very different lives.

Anton Schettini is a TV writer best known for writing sitcoms like
<em>Happy Together</em> and <em>Superior Donuts</em> – and even a drama
called <em>Snap</em>. But before he was an actual writer, he spent years
working his way up the Hollywood ladder as a production assistant,
writers’ assistant and script coordinator. Now Schettini has written a
book about his journey to becoming a professional TV scribe where he
demystifies the process of breaking into the biz and offers other
writers his best advice at all stages of their careers.

<h2>
Chaos. Genius. Drugs. Comedy. Revolution. 
</h2>
<p>
These five words may not seem to go together at first glance, but they
perfectly sum up the rollercoaster ride that is the new film
<em>Saturday Night</em>. Told in real time, the film takes us back to
1975 when a determined Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) wrangles a
motley crew of young comedians to change comedy television for the next
50 seasons – and beyond. I sat down with writers Jason Reitman and Gil
Kenan to find out how they managed to put together such a turbulent,
riotous movie about this beloved NBC institution.

I seem to have found myself reading a number of haunted house novels in

still find ways to ring new changes on a template that goes back to the
earliest Gothic novels. In <strong>Haunt Sweet Home</strong>, Sarah
Pinsker’s witty approach is to focus
