“It’s not ripped from the headlines. We’re not using any of [the Buss
family’s] real-life stories and putting them into our show. Because
Mindy [Kaling], Ike [Barinholtz], and I have so many influences like
<em>Arrested Development</em>, <em>30 Rock, The Office</em> and
<em>Succession</em>, we’re coming up with our own fun stories and fun
situations to put this dysfunctional, very wealthy, successful family
into a blender and then have them going back and forth and arguing and
solving problems together and against each other,” says David Stassen,
showrunner of <em>Running Point</em>, about taking inspiration from Los
Angeles Lakers’ President, Jeannie Buss’s family and turning it into a
hit TV show.  <br><br>In this episode, we chat with David Stassen,
showrunner and co-creator of the Netflix show, <em>Running Point</em>,
that’s just been given the greenlight for Season 2. The show centers on
Isla Gordon (Kate Hudson), the daughter of a powerful basketball
magnate. She’s now taken the helm of the legendary team with the help –
or hindrance – of her four well-meaning but unpredictable brothers.
  <br><br>While firmly set in the brawny world of basketball, Stassen
talks about the true core of <em>Running Point</em>, which revolves
around the siblings trying to earn the love of their deceased father. To
get this particular narrative right, Stassen says the writers room spent
a lot of time focusing on the family dynamics and differentiating each
character’s struggles and traits. Much of the comedy in the show comes
from the clashes between the siblings and their attempts to live up to
their father’s fierce expectations.<br><br>Stassen also talks about how
the character Isla, a woman at the center of a very male-dominated
universe, relies on speeches from gangster films to communicate with her
basketball team. <br><br>“Movies transcend our society. So, I think it’s
a great way to connect and even if you haven’t seen <em>Casino,</em>
most people know that Joe Pesci is viewed as a very scary person on
film. We were lucky enough to get the rights to show a scene. So even if
you didn’t know anything about it, you got to see the moment. It’s just
a fun thing to have this beautiful, airy Kate Hudson taking on these
roles of the tough Italian mobster or the contract killer getting
revenge for his dead dog, like John Wick. And I guess it probably speaks
to something bigger about this show – about a woman in a man’s world.
But at the same time, Isla is powerful in her own way, right? She’s
powerful 95% of the time just being herself and standing up for herself.
And then the fun flourishes are maybe using a movie reference to
illustrate a point,” says Stassen. <br><br>To hear more about
<em>Running Point</em> and Stassen’s advice to TV writers, listen to the
podcast. <br><br>

Every screenwriter hits a wall at some point. Sometimes it’s after your
third script. Sometimes it’s a dozen screenplays in. But there are key
screenwriting challenges that can help beginners avoid hitting those
walls — even before you get to a more advanced point in your
screenwriting career. <br><br>These aren’t warm-ups. They are full-blown
script workouts that will help any screenwriter grow their screenwriting
muscles. They’re not designed to be easy — they are designed to help you
level up by creating tears in your current writing process to allow
space to fill in more talent and experience. <br><br>With that in mind,
here are five screenwriting challenges to help you level up!

Clear-eyed. That’s how I would describe the work of Paul Kincaid. There
are other words I could use: engaging, intelligent, rigorous. All are
accurate. But clear-eyed sits at the top of the list. Since first
encountering Kincaid’s criticism online over two decades ago (whether on

academic bad behaviour, struggle with their relationship, and deal with
consequences of their previous adventures. It’s worth reading the first

It’s coming. You know it’s coming. But <em>Final Destination:
Bloodlines</em> keeps the audiences guessing on who is going to die and
how – it builds suspense even when everyone knows someone is about to
die. If there is one thing that the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise
excels at, it’s the journey more than the (final) destination. The
viewer is consistently thrown into a puzzle trying to piece together the
clues that lead to a character’s death. They’re constantly asking
questions: Will the broken glass play a role in a character’s demise?
What about the penny? Is the vending machine going to tip over?

Sometimes we lose our passion — the fire burning inside that pushes us
through adverse and difficult times during our screenwriting
journeys. <br><br>It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner learning the
ins and outs of writing a screenplay, an experienced screenwriter with
some major contest and fellowship wins, or a seasoned pro earning money
and seeing your name on the screen. Sometimes the passion dims, the
words don’t come, the cursor blinks back at you in quiet judgement on an
empty page, and you begin to question if you’ve lost <em>it</em> for
good — or, if you ever really had <em>it</em> at all.    <br><br>Don’t
worry. Breathe. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You haven’t lost your
fire</span>. It’s still there. <br><br>The key to any successful run at
a career in screenwriting is to learn how to get the fire back — how to
reignite those creative and inspirational flames to a point where the
ideas, visuals, words, and story/character solutions come flowing out of
you through your fingers, onto those keys, and onto the
pages. <br><br>Here are some tested, implemented, and proven ways to
reignite your screenwriting fire!

I love a story that leaves you with more questions than answers. I’ve
