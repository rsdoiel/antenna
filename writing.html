      <h1>A Cheap Cut of Meat Soaked in Butter (Encore)</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>John and Craig invite Aline Brosh McKenna back to celebrate the third anniversary of Scriptnotes. It’s a jam-packed, glass-and-a-half of wine, listener-favorite episode. They look at ways to breathe new life into scenes and characters that aren’t working, box office journalism and how Hollywood is always dying, scene geography, and the role of emotional intelligence […]</p>

      <p>John and Craig wonder, how has TV changed in the last ten years? They compare what’s better and worse, the tradeoffs between quality and quantity, how curation is changing, the pros and cons of shorter seasons, and what this all means for writers and viewers. We also look forward to our time at the Austin […]</p>

      <h1>Beyond the Exception: Licensing, Access, and the Realities of Text and Data Mining in the US, UK, and Singapore</h1>

(date: 2025-09-25)
      <p>
      <p>This is a post by Syn Ong, AI Policy Researcher at Authors Alliance. Authors increasingly rely on text and data mining (TDM) to analyze large corpora across disciplines. Our new working paper, Beyond the Exception: Licensing, Access, and the Realities of Text and Data Mining in the US, UK, and Singapore, finds that formal legal permissions alone do not secure usable access for TDM research. Instead, usable access turns on how statutory rules interact with private licenses, platform architectures, and technological protection measures (TPMs).</p>

      <p>Over the last six months, we’ve discussed microdramas (aka verticals) several times on Scriptnotes. For readers who don’t know, microdramas are a format originating in Asia in which a filmed narrative is broken into very short episodes intended to be watched on your phone. They’re often called verticals because they’re shot to be watched on […]</p>

      <p>This is guest post by Amanda Wakaruk, Jane Secker, and Chris Morrison. Readers of this blog will know that authors are both users and creators of copyright-protected works. How confident are authors about their rights related to copyright? Is the fear of navigating copyright preventing non-infringing ‘user’ activities in higher education? What can we do to mitigate the damage to teaching and research caused by copyright anxiety and chill?</p>
