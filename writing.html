<p>
At the core of <em>Lady in the Lake</em> is a noir mystery about the
death of a young black woman in 1960s Baltimore. But the seven-part
AppleTV+ show is so much more than a straightforward whodunit. Inspired
by the 2019 book of the same name by Laura Lippman, the TV show explores
the stories of two seemingly opposite women whose lives (and one‚Äôs
death) intersect in richly textured ways, first small then large.¬†

<h2 id="why-are-science-fiction-and-fantasy-novels-so-popular">Why Are
Science-Fiction and Fantasy Novels So Popular?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Science fiction goes back centuries, but started becoming popular in the 19th century with the rise of technology following the Industrial Revolution. However, the idea&amp;nbsp;of science fiction as a genre began in the pulp era, with Hugo Gernsback&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Stories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazing Stories&lt;/a&gt;, the first magazine to focus on science fiction. More pulps followed, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Tales&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weird Tales&lt;/a&gt;, the latter also featuring fantasy and horror. Popular on the radio, with serials such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon airing in the 1930s, the crowning moment for science fiction was Orson Welles&amp;rsquo; infamous&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, broadcast in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Fantasy as a genre goes back as far as storytelling, to early mythology.
Some key eras of fantasy include the Arthurian legends of the Middle
Ages and early 19th-century Gothic novels, with writers such as¬†Edgar
Allan Poe producing¬†fiction that highlighted the supernatural later that
century. Fantasy grew in popularity in the early 20th century and became
a serious genre when J.R.R. Tolkien published <em>The Hobbit</em> (1937)
and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (1950), which are the templates for
heroic fantasy, and which brought fantasy¬†into the mainstream. These
works became particularly popular around the world in the 1960s and led
to the rise of the sword and sorcery genre of fantastic fiction.
</p>
<p>
Today, science fiction and fantasy are everywhere. From fiction to film
and television, from comics to video games, the fantasy and science
fiction genre is one of the staples of modern storytelling. And
<a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/features/science-fiction--fantasy-genre-on-course-for-a-record-year" target="_blank">sales
are growing regularly</a>. While the two are separate genres, there can
be a lot of overlap, and are generally grouped together in publishing.
</p>
<p>The escapism of fantasy and science fiction</p>
<p>
No genre offers more escapism than fantasy and science fiction.
Traveling through strange lands or warping through space to visit new
planets; encountering mythical creatures and people with extraordinary
magical powers; these are the thrills of fantasy and science fiction
novels. While this sort of fiction is influenced by other genres -
adventure, mystery, westerns, etc. - the importance of setting is what
sets science fiction and fantasy apart. Whether it‚Äôs the magical realms
of <em>Harry Potter</em> or the otherworldly landscapes of <em>Star
Wars</em>, these stories take us far beyond the world we know and give
our imaginations free rein.
</p>
<p>
Science fiction and fantasy often examine complex and thought-provoking
themes. They can be an engaging way to explore societal issues,
philosophical questions, and futuristic possibilities. Kim Stanley
Robinson‚Äôs Mars Trilogy - <em>Red Mars</em>, <em>Green Mars</em>, and
<em>Blue Mars</em> - combine hard science with an exploration of how
colonists survive and interact in a new form of society. And George
Orwell‚Äôs <em>1984</em> is the classic examination of how a society can
control its citizens, and what happens when citizens try to rebel.
</p>
<p>Science fiction and fantasy are perfect for film and TV</p>
<p>
Science fiction and fantasy have always been popular on film and on TV,
and in the past couple of decades, with the improvement of CGI
(computer-generated imaging), this sort of story works perfectly on the
screen. Whether it be planets with unique biomes, mythical creatures, or
advanced technology, these genres are highly visual.
</p>
<p>
Science fiction and fantasy novels are often written in trilogies, and
there are many long series, such as Robert Jordan‚Äôs 15-volume <em>Wheel
of Time</em>, George R.R. Martin‚Äôs <em>Game of Thrones</em>, the
<em>Expanse</em> novels by James S. A. Corey, and classic science
fiction series such as Frank Herbert‚Äôs <em>Dune</em> and Isaac Asimov‚Äôs
<em>Foundation</em>. It‚Äôs no surprise that all of these have been made
into TV series or movies, along with many others.
</p>
<p>Fantasy and science fiction have a plethora of sub-genres</p>
<p>
Back in the golden age of science fiction, most stories involved space
exploration. This expanded as authors discovered how versatile science
fiction could be, exploring new or imagined technologies, and adding
such sub-genres as post-apocalyptic fiction, military science fiction,
and later steampunk and cyberpunk. Science fiction became a broad
church, with some speculative fiction, such as that of J.G. Ballard,
dealing with the near future instead of the distant future.
</p>
<p>
The same is true of fantasy. From high fantasy, such as <em>The Lord of
the Rings</em>, to sword and sorcery, with authors like Robert E.
Howard‚Äôs <em>Conan</em> series, fantasy branched out into many
sub-genres. There is now urban fantasy, dark fantasy, historical
fantasy, and even magic realism as a sub-genre of literary fiction:
novels such as <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> by Gabriel Garc√≠a
M√°rquez feature fantastic elements.
</p>
<p>
These two genres cover such a wide range of sub-genres that readers have
an embarrassment of riches when looking for new authors and novels.
These are two of the most vibrant genres in popular fiction, and there
is a lively cross-pollination between the two.
</p>
<p>
Literary fiction today sometimes flirts with fantasy and science
fiction. Novels like <em>The Buried Giant</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro,
<em>The Road</em> by Cormac McCarthy, <em>Station Eleven</em> by Emily
St.¬†John Mandel, and <em>Piranesi</em> by Susanna Clarke blend these
genres with literary fiction, providing a fertile ground to allow the
ideas that make up science fiction and fantasy to infiltrate mainstream
fiction.
</p>
<p>
As vehicles for escapism, allowing readers to explore different worlds
and civilizations, science fiction and fantasy have become staples of
literature. With their presence in film and TV, these genres expand
their readership and offer a combination of literature and audio-visual
entertainment that goes beyond the confines of most fiction. The
popularity of these genres is increasing as the imagination of authors
takes new leaps into the unknown.

<strong>Lake of Darkness</strong>, Adam Roberts (Gollancz

With all the much-deserved tributes to the late Terry Bisson and his
work (which included a long-running and very funny column for this

chapbooks he edited for PM Press for the past 15 years. A virtual who‚Äôs
