Happy Halloween! ‘Tis the season for falling leaves and pumpkin-flavored
lattes. It’s also the season for screenwriters to ponder such issues as
‘are machetes passé?’ and the relative merits of fast versus slow zombie
pacing.
</p>
<p>
In short, it’s horror movie writing season!

It’s likely that when <em>Saturday Night Live</em> premiered on October
11, 1975, even the show’s creator didn’t see it lasting 50 years. The
chaotic start of the ‘not ready for prime time’ players was filled with
uncertainty, confusion, hostility and a revolutionary spirit. In the new
film <em>Saturday Night</em> written by Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman, the
audience gets a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the 90 minutes leading up
to the show’s premiere.

Solomon’s <strong>Model Home</strong>, and who’s to argue? Based on the
resurgence of the theme in the past couple of years alone, it’s proved
to be not only a durable framework for supernatural shenanigans, but a
kind of magical mirror for all sorts of issues ranging from

The Horror/Thriller

always thrives in the
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-ways-screenwriters-can-adapt-to-the-marketplace">screenplay
marketplace</a>. This is largely because people enjoy being scared. It’s
not unlike people enjoying a roller-coaster or haunted hayride. There’s
a primal instinct — both exciting and cathartic in nature — that’s
triggered when we’re scared, and that’s one of the reasons why people
love thrillers and horror movies.

Kerstin Hall writes sharp, fierce stories with precise and visceral
prose, and with worldbuilding that possesses a keen sense for the weird,
the haunting, the marvel­lous, and the twistedly strange. <strong>Asunder

For over two decades, Lee Jessup has been coaching the careers of both
emerging and professional screenwriters with the goal of helping them
take their career to the next level. You may also know that Jessup has
been mentoring winners of the Final Draft Big Break Screenwriting
Competition for over a decade, so she knows a thing or two about
emerging writers. Given all her savvy and experience in the industry, we
thought we’d check in with her to pinpoint the latest trends in the
ever-evolving business of screenwriting.
