It’s easy to fall into the many screenwriting traps that most
screenwriters face during those first few screenplays. We learn best by
making mistakes, and then learning from those mistakes. It’s the natural
process of any learning curve — especially when you’re trying to become
a professional screenwriter. But what if you could peek into the future
and learn how to avoid those traps well before you fall into
them? <br><br>With that in mind, here are the most common screenwriting
traps new screenwriters can find themselves in, and how you can avoid
them.

Are you a new screenwriter? If so, there’s probably a good chance you
weren’t even born 29 years ago when Tom Cruise took over the role of
Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible, one of many films inspired and
adapted from their TV counterparts.
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9603208/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2_tt_6_nm_0_in_0_q_mission" style="font-style: italic;">Mission:
Impossible – The Final Reckoning</a> is a love letter to the seven films
that came before it, referencing the others as if everything Ethan Hunt
did or didn’t do to save the world all came to a (wait for it) final
reckoning.
