<p>If Coraline in 3D had been perceived as successful it might have
changed things about the way 3D was used. But there were a limited
number of 3D screens and after a couple of weeks Coraline 3D was
replaced in them by the Jonas Bros Live 3D moviez and that was that.</p>

George Stevens Jr. has been a movie producer and director for decades,
and has written a memoir about his life in Hollywood.
</p>
<p>
Growing up as the son of Hollywood's great directors - his father made
many classic films, such as A Place in the Sun, Shane, Giant, and The
Greatest Story Ever Told - gave Stevens an inside view of Hollywood.
Hobnobbing with the greatest actors of the time, Stevens has been a
background force in the film industry for decades. His memoir My Place
in the Sun tells the story of his experiences in Hollywood and
Washington DC.
</p>
<p>
"I grew up in a house with a person who happened to be a rare
combination of a wonderful father, great director, I could say a war
hero, he spent three years away, and was on the ground and in Europe in
World War Two. I think the most important thing I learned from him was
when he told me you have to respect the audience."
</p>
<p>
And Stevens Sr. did respect the audience. When his movie A Place in the
Sun was released, he threatened to sue, for $1 million, any TV station
that inserted any commercial into the running of his film without his
specific approval of the ad. This was a bold move, but one intended to
ensure that his films retained their integrity.
</p>
<p>
"He was quite confident that he wasn't going to win, but he did get
considerable respect from the judge. His contract provided that
Paramount Pictures could not alter or change in any way, the final cut
of his film, A Place in the Sun, which was so highly regarded that he
won the Oscar." [It garnered nine nominations, and Stevens won for best
director.] "And then he started seeing it on television, as he referred
that they cut into it little playlets, meaning that Montgomery Clift and
Elizabeth Taylor are at an important moment in the film on the beach,
and then going in a motorboat. And then comes a commercial, and it's got
a beach and water, and a whole other story begins. And no judge was
going to up entirely the whole system of commercial television. But he
did get considerable respect in the decision."
</p>
<p>
George Stevens Sr. was in Europe during World War II, and his son
discovered, in the 1980s, some color footage he had shot of the war, the
first of its kind that anyone had seen. "Dad had a storage room in North
Hollywood, California. It had everything, it had file cabinets, it had
his Laurel and Hardy scripts, it had souvenirs from World War Two,
everything. When I discovered that footage, I was living in Washington
and the store room is in Los Angeles. I took one little reel of that
film back to Washington with me. I was running an American Film
Institute and had a screening room and I asked the projectionist on a
warm, sunny Friday afternoon. And on the screen, came footage with
barrage balloons in the sky on a gray morning. And I'm looking at this
footage and I realize it's D-Day. And I further realize that my eyes are
the first ones that weren't there on the day to see color. And around a
bulkhead comes up a man in his late 30s in a helmet, and it's my father.
It's the most remarkable color footage because that was a
black-and-white war."
</p>
<p>
Stevens later set up the
<a href="https://www.afi.com" target="_blank">American Film
Institute</a>, which was set up to recognize film as an art form, mentor
young directors, and restore old films, which he describes as the
organization's cornerstone. "More than half of the films that had been
made since the beginning of film, at the beginning of the 20th century,
were lost or missing or destroyed. AFI's first task was to organize the
rescue and preservation of American film. We did that in collaboration
with the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, George Eastman
House, and other institutions. It was the rock upon which we built the
AFI."
</p>
<p>
Stevens started writing his memoir about 12 years ago, taking notes and
organizing ideas. "Somebody told me about Scrivener, and I got it and I
just kept putting everything into Scrivener in different categories and
subcategories in [the Binder]. It gave me command of the material. It
was like my father shooting all of this film, and then going into the
editing room, and being able to make the film. Writing is rewriting, and
filmmaking is re-cutting until you get it just right. I don't know how I
would have written this book without Scrivener."

<p>15 years ago some nice people from an ad agency arrived at my house
to shoot a bit with a script for me about how scary mothers are. “But
that’s not the film,” I told them. “Then write a new script,” they said.
So I did.</p>

your story before writing a screenplay is a vital tool that will save
