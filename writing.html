K. Wolfe Reviews Convergence Problems by Wole Talabi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>Convergence Problems</strong>, Wole Talabi (DAW 978-0756418830,
$27.00, 320pp, hc) February 2024.
</p>
<p>
After the exuberant fantasy/heist caper that was his debut novel
<strong>Shigidi and the Brass Head of Obalufon</strong>, it might be
easy to overlook Wole Talabi’s background as an engineer and SF writer.
His new collection, <strong>Convergence Problems</strong>, serves as a
rewarding reminder of his connections to more-or-less traditional SF
themes and techniques. A story like ‘‘Blowout’’,

Todd Henry teaches people to be more creative and to solve problems. He
writes books for what he calls “on-demand professionals.” These are
people who “go to work, solve problems, write things, design things,
come up with ideas, provide solutions on demand.” His ideas aren’t
limited to creativity in business; many of them apply to all creatives,
including writers.
</p>
<p>
Todd points out that “creativity doesn’t like to show up whenever we
beckon it. Creativity has to be lured, it has to be cultivated.” This is
an important point for creative writers. On his website, in
<a href="https://www.toddhenry.com/business/thing-every-day/" target="_blank">The
Thing You Do Every Day</a>, he says that “If you’re a writer, your
(everyday) habit of writing things you don’t always care for is what
enables you to write the (once-in-a-while) 60,000-word book manuscript.”
He explains that “for anyone who wants to write well, and write
brilliantly, write uniquely, that starts with having an everyday
practice of writing. Some days, you get to the end of your writing
session and say, ‘It’s awful, or it sounds derivative,’ but it doesn’t
matter because you’re building those muscles, you’re developing the
stamina to be able to sit down and write on demand. And the only way you
ever get to the point where you do something unique is by persistent
repetition and developing your voice over time.”
</p>
<p>
I pointed out that writers need to read a lot to learn about good
writing, and Todd said, “One of the mistakes I think a lot of people
make is that they only read, or study, or delve deeply into a specific
area of interest that is uniquely attached to their own profession or
their area of interest.” Extending this to creative writing means that
while you may write in one genre, and read extensively in that genre, it
can be helpful to read other types of fiction as well. “You have to be
an expert in what you’re writing about if you’re writing nonfiction,
especially. But my encouragement would be to listen, and seek
inspiration outside of the confines of your specific area of focus,
because most of the non-intuitive leaps, the brilliant connections that
you’re going to make, are going to come from taking something from over
here, something from over there, and finding a connection that nobody
else has discovered to this point.”
</p>
<p>
In another article,
<a href="https://www.toddhenry.com/creating/alone-with-your-thoughts/" target="_blank">Alone
with Your Thoughts</a>, Todd discusses a technique he discovered 15
years ago, which involves “plopping down in a chair first thing in the
morning with a notebook and staring at the wall” to generate ideas. Most
people can’t sit and do nothing. “Most of us are not even aware of
what’s on our mind because we don’t pause long enough to discover what
our mind is trying to tell us. We expect ideas to happen in the cracks
and crevices of our incredibly frenetic life. That’s not the way that
creativity works. It’s slow-emergent; it has to be merged over time very
slowly, often.”
</p>
<p>
Todd opened our interview by saying that Scrivener is “one of my
favorite tools in the world,” and he uses it to write all of his books.
“I can’t imagine now writing a book in anything other than Scrivener
because it so perfectly matches the way that I want to work.”
</p>
<p>
He didn’t use it for his first book, but quickly realized that his
process needed improvement, because, “I don’t think in a linear way, nor
do I like to write in a linear way.” He did some research and discovered
Scrivener, and says, “The thing that I love about Scrivener is that I
can write books from the inside out. I tend to write books in sections.
What section do I feel like writing about today? It might be in chapter
five today, and tomorrow it might be in chapter two. Next week, it might
be chapter seven, or maybe I’ll write three or four sections in chapter
two today. Because it’s all text files that can be moved around wherever
I want, it’s easy to track when I’m writing, and it’s easy to organize
when I’m writing in a very streamlined way.”
</p>
<p>
Todd also loves
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/distraction-free-writing-with-scrivener" target="_blank">Composition
Mode</a>, which provides a distraction-free environment for writing.
“One of the things I love about Scrivener, is I always operate in
full-screen mode, I’m always writing with a black screen with white
text. There’s none of this, none of the complexity of the distractions,
the tools; when I’m writing, I want to be writing, that’s what I want to
be doing.”

Capitalists Hate Capitalism</h2>

<p>
In conflict, we find clarity.
</p>
<p>
We all hold contradictory views: We love our families, but they drive us
crazy. We want more housing in our cities, but we don’t want our
property values to decrease with expanded supply. We want better
schools, but we recoil from a 0.1% municipal levy to fund them.
</p>
<p>
It’s normal to hold contradictory views, but when those views come into
conflict, how we act shows

Martini Reviews Paladin’s Faith by T. Kingfisher</h2>

<p>
<strong>Paladin’s Faith</strong>, T. Kingfisher (Argyll Productions
978-1614506096, $6.99, 422pp, eb) December 2023.
</p>
<p>
T. Kingfisher (AKA Ursula Vernon) ventures back into her Saint of Steel
universe with <strong>Paladin’s Faith</strong>. Each book in the planned
seven-book series is nominally about one of the paladins whose spirits
were broken when their animating saint died. But Kingfisher expands what
we know about these paladins, their god, and his demise with each
volume.

I would venture to guess that most SF fans know Alvaro Zinos-Amaro as
one of our best critics and interviewers. Case in point is his recent
volume, <b>Being Michael Swanwick</b>, which I reviewed on this platform
just a short time ago. But like Green Arrow or Hawkeye, the man has more
than one arrow in his quiver. (I
