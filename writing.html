<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: John August blog</p>
<p>John and Craig look at how writers (and other humans) handle the
anxiety of uncertainty, from election nights to green lights. We’ll talk
through strategies for navigating situations where your circle of
concern doesn’t match your circle of control. Then we travel back to the
1980s and 90s, when many studios were run by ambitious […] The post

I move from one instance of weird Florida (Area X is a distorted version
of North Florida) to another: Laura van den Berg’s <strong>State of

back-to-back (alliterative surnames aside) is a remarkable coincidence,

<p>I first met Kamala Harris at a small lunch in 2010. Just four or five

attorney general, so a friend suggested we meet her. I found Harris to
be incredibly bright and charismatic. I donated to her campaign on the

<p>“I think [ <em>Here</em>] has some of the imagination of <em>Forrest
Gump</em>, but it’s not <em>Forrest Gump</em>. It’s a different animal.
I mean, it has the same kind of humanity to it, which is what I’m pretty
good at,” says Eric Roth about his latest film <em>Here</em>, co-written
and directed by Robert Zemeckis and reuniting actors Tom Hanks and Robin
Wright.  <br> <br>On today’s podcast, we speak with Oscar winning
screenwriter Eric Roth about the challenges of writing the screenplay
for <em>Here</em> that mostly takes place in one room, with a fixed
camera that never moves. The movie explores the ordinary lives of
multiple generations of families in a way that many will find relatable,
heartbreaking and, at times, claustrophobic.  <br> <br>“I’m not sure
[the characters in <em>Here</em>] are extraordinary or not, but they
show the length and breadth of what people can and can’t do and when
they’re trapped. I think when it works that way dramatically, it’s quite
lovely and quite beautiful. I don’t want to use the word profound, but I
think the [movie] is profound to a certain extent because it is just
about the regularity of life. And that, from dinosaurs to the future,
it’s going to keep going. Hopefully people will find great joy in how
they’re living and I’m sure great pain too, but I think that’s just sort
of the circle of life,” he says.  <br> <br>We also discuss some of his
other films like <em>Forrest Gump</em>, for which he won an Oscar, and
<em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.  <br> <br>He shared this advice
about using subtext in screenplays. “I think that I’m always trying to
find a way to enhance the scene with not only subtext, but with some
kind of metaphor and make it possibly more interesting as to getting to
the root of people’s feelings without them having to vomit out what
they’re saying you know. It’s not easy, but I think as I’ve gotten more
successful and more accomplished at it,” he says.  <br> <br>To hear more
of Eric Roth’s advice for screenwriters, listen to the podcast. </p>

<p>
Alisa Alering’s debut novel <strong>Smothermoss </strong>is a master
class in conveying both a physically and psychologically oppressive
atmosphere. Set in a small rural Appalachian town in the early 1980s,
the novel follows the tough adventures of sisters Sheila and Angie. At
seventeen years old, Sheila is acutely aware of her ‘‘otherness,’’ a kid
all too often bullied and

The internet is a communications medium, that

That means that every single policy question related to the internet

The Summer ’24 Fiyah theme is disability. The issue seeks to break down
stereotypes and expectations that Black people are monolithic and
separate from experiences with disability, and it does sharp work of
just that, as in <strong>F. Kirk</strong>’s “<strong>Worms Fill My
