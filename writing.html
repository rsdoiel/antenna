Being a screenwriter takes tenacity. It takes a certain amount of
technique, dedication, and imagination as well. But one of the most
important skills you can tuck away inside your writer’s toolbox is the
ability to be an <em>agile</em> screenwriter. <br><br>Sure, this sounds
key to being a good athlete or, say, a first responder, in which
mobility and strength are required. But what does this mean in
screenwriting? <br><br>Being an agile screenwriter means having the
ability to adapt to our ever-changing world. Key to being a successful
screenwriter is being able to evolve, pivot, and anticipate in an
industry that is known for its curve balls. <br><br>So in the spirit of
becoming an agile screenwriter to not only survive, but flourish by
maintaining a writing practice for the long haul (this career is a
marathon, not a sprint, after all), here are your 5 tips to being an
agile screenwriter.

Writer/Director Chuck Russell Says Horror ‘Better Be Scary’ to Work</h2>

In the original horror film <em>Witchboard</em> from 1986, a young woman
(Tawny Kitaen) becomes obsessed with a Ouija board at a party. She is
then terrorized by a malevolent spirit, leaving her boyfriend and her ex
to try to figure out what’s going on. It’s a cult film, although
definitely of its time, and was inspired by the writer’s real experience
with a Ouija board. <br><br>Now, writer/director
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0751080/">Chuck Russell</a> (a
horror icon in his own right) is giving the film an update with 2025’s
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2256055/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cst_sm_2#writer" style="font-style: italic;">Witchboard</a>,
expanding the world and lending the scary premise a fresh, modern spin.
The story is bigger, unfolding across two distinct yet interconnected
timelines: one reveals the board’s origin, while the present-day story
follows the board as it falls into the hands of Emily (Madison Iseman).
The film also stars Jamie Campbell Bower as a mysterious occultist who
will do anything to get the artifact.<br><br>Russell rose to prominence
with some of the major genre films of recent memory, like
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110475/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520mask" style="font-style: italic;">The
Mask</a> starring Jim Carrey and
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093629/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2" style="font-style: italic;">A
Nightmare on Elm Street 3</a>. He also wrote and directed the 1988 film
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094761/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_11" style="font-style: italic;">The
Blob</a> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mummy</span>
franchise entry
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277296/?ref_=nm_flmg_job_1_cdt_t_6" style="font-style: italic;">The
Scorpion King</a>.<br><br>We spoke to Russell ahead of the wide release
of his new film to learn how he approaches structure and character in
the horror genre, and more. <br><br><span

<h2>
What Is Theme in Writing?
</h2>
<p>
A theme is the underlying message or larger idea that a piece of writing
is conveying. Themes in stories are often associated with a moral or the
reader’s takeaway from what has occurred in the narrative. However, a
theme can sometimes simply reflect some truth or observation about life
and society without any judgement.

Seyfu Hinds explores Steampunk and Identity in ‘Washington Black’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: Final Draft blog</p>
<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper">

When Selwyn Seyfu Hinds first picked up the award-winning novel
<em>Washington Black</em> by Esi Edugyan, he was on a break during the
holidays in his homeland of Guyana. “I have a longstanding rule not to
read material over Christmas,” he says. But Ellen Goldsmith-Vein,
producer of <em>The Maze Runner</em> films, convinced him to break that
rule. He was glad he did.<br><br>“The book was just astonishing,” says
Hinds. The journey of a young Caribbean boy navigating trauma, identity,
and freedom deeply resonated with Hinds’ own experience immigrating to
America at 14. <br><br>“The emotional arc felt the same,” he says.
“Learning new ecosystems, new languages and new people – understanding
the opportunities and the dangers in the place that you exist. And all
of it on your road to finding your agency, finding your method, finding
love, you know, finding your existential self. All of that came together
and I said this is something that I have to
write.” <br><br><em>Washington Black</em> is now a lush, genre-bending
TV series on Hulu, executive produced by Hinds, who also serves as
showrunner. It’s a steampunk reimagining of the 19th century from a
perspective rarely seen on screen. Set in the early 1800s, it follows
George Washington “Wash” Black (Eddie Karanja), a boy born into slavery
on a Barbados plantation. After an unfortunate event endangers his life,
he flees with British explorer Titch (Tom Ellis), embarking on a
globe-spanning journey that takes him into adulthood. <br><br>The series
weaves back and forth between 20-something Wash (Ernest Kingsley
Junior), with flashbacks to Young Wash, delving into matters of race,
resilience and a young America. Actor Sterling K. Brown even has a
supporting role and serves as Executive Producer. But it’s the
unexpected playfulness and optimism that the steampunk tropes – like the
depiction of fantastic steam-powered flying machines – that really make
it extraordinary.
