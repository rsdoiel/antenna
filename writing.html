wholehearted embrace of, and a commentary on the high-fantasy high-angst

By now there are so many mystical-magical ‘‘hidden London’’ novels that
it’s getting hard to keep up – though admittedly there’s something
delicious about the notion that in any great city, you’re only being
shown what they want you to see, with the real city available only at
certain access points for certain chosen adventurers. In his

Characters are essential to storytelling. They drive conflict, provide a
point of view for the story, and become the audience’s reason to stay
rooted in the experience. But what kind of character are you writing to

<p>“Comedy and scares are so similar. I’ve found that in a lot of my
scripts, it’s almost like you’re taking the peaks and valleys of humor,
and the peaks and valleys of scares, and flipping them on each other.
So, you have the scare that you come down from for a moment of brevity
and humor, or just character work, and then you do another scare. You’ve
relaxed them and then scare them again. The effect is that you’re making
the audience have a good time,” says Seth Sherwood, author of <em>The
Scary Movie Writer’s Guide</em>. <br> <br>In this episode, we speak with
Seth Sherwood, writer of horror movies like <em>Leatherface</em> and
<em>Hell Fest</em>. He was also nominated for an Emmy for writing the TV
show <em>Light as a Feather</em>. I chat with him about the long process
of making <em>Hell Fest</em> with producer Gale Ann Hurd, the difference
between internal and external horror and his definition of grounded
horror that’s so popular these days. He also gives his advice on what he
thinks is the single best thing an emerging horror writer can do to help
their career.  <br> <br>“Right now, the industry is in a retraction,
there’s an implosion and streaming is dying. When people ask me now how
to break in, I say I don’t know, but I think you’ll never go wrong in
actually trying to make stuff like short films. I know it’s a whole
other path and it’s a difficult thing to do but people will always watch
stuff before they read stuff if they’re not writers. And those people
are the gatekeepers. I always wanted to make my own films, but my
writing career took off and I’m actually in a spot where I’m going
backwards, where I have done so many writing assignments in the last few
years but things aren’t getting made – so, I’m going to go make a
microbudget horror film on my own with my friends. The thing that I
wanted to do when I was 20 years old. Because at least it’s a thing that
can be seen. And that has more weight than a script right now,” he
says.  <br> <br>To hear more about horror writing from Sherwood’s
perspective, listen to the podcast.</p>

We have such a cornucopia of dystopias right now, fictional and
otherwise, that they’ve really got to do something different to catch my
attention. <strong>The Repeat Room</strong>, the latest novel from the
prolific Jesse Ball, captured it thoroughly: haunting, spare, and
inventive, it’s a bleak tale that’s nonetheless rich with sparkling

<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: IF Database News</p>
<p>
There’s a new star rating control, designed for accessibility. We’d love
to get your feedback on it
<a href="https://intfiction.org/t/ifdb-has-a-new-star-rating-control/71812">on
the intfiction.org forum</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The new star controls are designed to be bigger, easier to tap on on
touchscreens.
</li>
<li>
Theyre also designed to be keyboard accessible. You can use tab to focus
on the star control, and then use arrow keys to select a rating. (When
you do this, you have to tab over to the new “Submit Rating” button to
submit your selection.)
</li>
<li>
Under the hood, theyre secretly radio buttons, so users of screen
readers will interact with them like radio buttons.
</li>
<li>
Weve replaced the little star icons with new SVG icons. I think theyre
nicer to look at, especially on high-resolution screens (like phones).
