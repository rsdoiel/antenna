Maybe you‚Äôre a fan of movies, TV series or various streaming content and
have thought: ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to write stuff like this. I‚Äôd like to be a
screenwriter.‚Äô Well, it‚Äôs only natural to want to take part in something
you enjoy, and the prospect of getting paid to do so would no doubt be a
dream job.¬†<br><br>But is it a dream job or just a dream?<br><br>Being a
screenwriter or scriptwriter is a real profession, and although there is
a lot of competition for screenwriting jobs, thousands of people still
manage to do it. In fact, thanks to an ever-growing global marketplace,
there are increasing opportunities for people who know how to write for
the screen.<br><br>Just like any vocation, screenwriting is a learned
skill and there are definite steps you can take to become a professional
screenwriter. I myself am a professional screenwriter, and I‚Äôve been
working in the film and television industry for two decades
now.¬†<br><br>Using my own experience ‚Äî as well as things I‚Äôve heard over
the years from screenwriting friends and colleagues ‚Äî I‚Äôve created some

<p>‚ÄúOne of the things that I really wanted to focus on, and I felt it
immediately after meeting Lina the housewife in Indiana [played by Betty
Gilpin in the show], whose husband no longer wanted to kiss her on the
mouth, I felt like this woman was as important as the Queen of England,
as important as Napoleon. I felt her dreams and fears are just as
universal as someone who has defeated an army and the only reason we‚Äôre
not hearing about her is because we have these sorts of rules in place
for what possesses historical significance. And I don‚Äôt really think
that that‚Äôs necessarily true,‚Äù says Lisa Taddeo, author of the book
<em>Three Women</em>, on which her new TV show is based.¬† <br> <br>In
today‚Äôs episode, we speak to Lisa Taddeo, creator of the show <em>Three
Women</em> that stars Shailene Woodley, Betty Gilpin, DeWanda Wise and
Gabrielle Creevy as ‚Äúordinary‚Äù women searching for their sexual identity
and fulfillment in disparate and surprising ways. The show is an
intimate, often stark portrayal of forbidden female desire and the
consequences of that desire ‚Äì both good and bad.¬† <br> <br>We also talk
about writing the ‚Äúfemale gaze‚Äù into the scripts, filming with
prosthetic penises, the power the book <em>Twilight</em> has on teenage
girls, and the uncanny way our mothers influence our own sexuality.¬†
<br> <br>‚ÄúMy mother made up her face every morning, even when she wasn‚Äôt
going to leave the house. Who is she? My father sees her before she puts
on her face as they say, so it‚Äôs not for him. Nobody is coming to the
door today, so it‚Äôs not for them. It‚Äôs certainly not for me, because I
see her without makeup when she washes it off at night. So, who is it
for, you know? And that was a question I had but didn‚Äôt really know how
to frame,‚Äù Taddeo says.¬† <br> <br>To hear more about the groundbreaking
show <em>Three Women</em> that‚Äôs airing on Starz, listen to the
podcast.¬† <br> <br> <em>Trigger warning: contains mentions of sexual
explicit material, sexual assault and trauma.</em></p>
