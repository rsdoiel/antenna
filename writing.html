Hi. Today’s episode features an enormous amount of profane language, and
not for any reason. I just felt like cursing. If you have kids in the
car or anybody that doesn’t enjoy that sort of thing, earmuffs on. John

Class Action Against McGraw Hill: the Importance of Publishing
Contracts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>At the heart of the Flynn v. McGraw Hill case is a breach of contract
claim. The plaintiffs argue that McGraw Hill’s royalty deductions for
maintaining its online system violated the terms of the agreement.
Central to the argument is the publisher’s promise to ‘publish at its
own expense.’ This case serves as a prime example of how important it is
to scrutinize the details of a publishing agreement, where the devil
often lies.</p>

<p>“What I wanted to do with this movie was take this interesting
relationship that I have been exploring over the course of my writing,
over 20 years, and this dynamic, and set it against the backdrop of
something so objectively worse than anything the characters are going
through. I wanted to put this funny, fraught relationship that seems
like the stakes are quite high – are these two people going to continue
on together? Against the backdrop of stakes that are so much higher, we
can put their relationship into perspective,” says Jesse Eisenberg,
writer/director and star of the new buddy movie <em>A Real Pain</em>
that takes place on a holocaust tour of Poland.   <br> <br>In this
episode of the Write On podcast, Eisenberg talks about spending years
trying to get this particular story just right, how it was personal to
him, what it was like to shoot at a concentration camp and the great
advice his producer Emma Stone gave him. He also shares his criteria for
writing a road trip/buddy movie. <br> <br>“It has to have an original
quality to justify it as a movie. I read so many scripts as an actor and
I’ve written so many things, that [a script] has to have two things: it
has to be specific enough to feel real and personal. There are just so
many movies in this road trip/buddy movie genre, if it doesn’t feel
specific I think an audience can sniff it out immediately. The other
thing is to make it feel new, to have a new reason to tell this story so
it doesn’t feel like something I’ve seen 10,000 other times,” says
Eisenberg.     <br> <br>Listen to the podcast to learn more. </p>

stories have religion as part of the narrative? In everything from

demons and devils are always seeming to pop into the horror genre, with
priests and true believers usually the ones to save the day.

Maybe you’re a fan of movies, TV series or various streaming content and
have thought: ‘I’d like to write stuff like this. I’d like to be a
screenwriter.’ Well, it’s only natural to want to take part in something
you enjoy, and the prospect of getting paid to do so would no doubt be a
dream job. <br><br>But is it a dream job or just a dream?<br><br>Being a
screenwriter or scriptwriter is a real profession, and although there is
a lot of competition for screenwriting jobs, thousands of people still
manage to do it. In fact, thanks to an ever-growing global marketplace,
there are increasing opportunities for people who know how to write for
the screen.<br><br>Just like any vocation, screenwriting is a learned
skill and there are definite steps you can take to become a professional
screenwriter. I myself am a professional screenwriter, and I’ve been
working in the film and television industry for two decades
now. <br><br>Using my own experience — as well as things I’ve heard over
the years from screenwriting friends and colleagues — I’ve created some
basic steps an aspiring screenwriter can do to become a
professional.<br><br>Below are <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 Basic
Steps</span> that can put you on the right path:

<p>“One of the things that I really wanted to focus on, and I felt it
immediately after meeting Lina the housewife in Indiana [played by Betty
Gilpin in the show], whose husband no longer wanted to kiss her on the
mouth, I felt like this woman was as important as the Queen of England,
as important as Napoleon. I felt her dreams and fears are just as
universal as someone who has defeated an army and the only reason we’re
not hearing about her is because we have these sorts of rules in place
for what possesses historical significance. And I don’t really think
that that’s necessarily true,” says Lisa Taddeo, author of the book
<em>Three Women</em>, on which her new TV show is based.  <br> <br>In
today’s episode, we speak to Lisa Taddeo, creator of the show <em>Three
Women</em> that stars Shailene Woodley, Betty Gilpin, DeWanda Wise and
Gabrielle Creevy as “ordinary” women searching for their sexual identity
and fulfillment in disparate and surprising ways. The show is an
intimate, often stark portrayal of forbidden female desire and the
consequences of that desire – both good and bad.  <br> <br>We also talk
about writing the “female gaze” into the scripts, filming with
prosthetic penises, the power the book <em>Twilight</em> has on teenage
girls, and the uncanny way our mothers influence our own sexuality. 
<br> <br>“My mother made up her face every morning, even when she wasn’t
going to leave the house. Who is she? My father sees her before she puts
on her face as they say, so it’s not for him. Nobody is coming to the
door today, so it’s not for them. It’s certainly not for me, because I
see her without makeup when she washes it off at night. So, who is it
for, you know? And that was a question I had but didn’t really know how
to frame,” Taddeo says.  <br> <br>To hear more about the groundbreaking
show <em>Three Women</em> that’s airing on Starz, listen to the
podcast.  <br> <br> <em>Trigger warning: contains mentions of sexual
explicit material, sexual assault and trauma.</em></p>

<p>
RHONDA S.A. GARCIA was born in Trinidad and Tobago, where she has lived
her entire life. Though she earned her A levels and qualified to enter
university, her mother’s illness and other difficulties made it
impossible for her to attend. She worked various jobs, most recently as
an administrator in the engineering industry, until becoming a full-time
writer following a breast cancer diagnosis in 2021.

Garcia began publishing SF with

<p>
Ian McDonald may be one of the most accom­plished SF writers of his
generation, but he isn’t particularly known for horror – though that may
change with the very creepy ecologi­cal fable <strong>The
Wilding</strong>. I’m using “creepy” in a quite literal sense here:
There’s a lot of creeping going on. A project to restore and “rewild” a

<p>
Romantasy is a subgenre getting considerable attention and India Holton
enters the field with a new series, that is a lot of fun. The first
book, <strong>The Ornithologist’s Field Guide to Love</strong>,
introduces two academics, Beth Pickering and Devon Lock­ley, who
specialize in the study and, if necessary, capture of thaumaturgic
birds. These

<h2 id="estimated-play-time-now-searchable">Estimated Play Time (now
searchable!)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: IF Database News</p>
<p>You can now use the “Estimated Play Time” form on any game to submit
a “vote” for how long it takes to finish the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Vote only if you’ve played the game.
</li>
<li>
Vote on how long it would take to get to one final ending without hints
or a walkthrough.
</li>
<li>
Time spent away from the game doesn’t count.
</li>
<li>
Times don’t need to be exact. Good-faith estimates are fine.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We’ll display the median time vote near the top of that game’s page.
</p>
<p>
(EDIT: Nov 15) You can also search for games by play time using the new
<b>playtime:</b> search filter. For example, here’s
<a href="https://ifdb.org/search?searchbar=playtime%3A6h-">a list of
games that have an estimated play time of six hours or more</a>.
</p>
<p>
<p><b>playtime:<i>minimum-maximum</i></b> lists games with an estimated
play time in the given range. After each number, use <b>h</b> for hours
or <b>m</b> for minutes. For example, <b>playtime:2h15m-3h</b> shows
games with an estimated play time of anywhere from 2 hours and 15
minutes to 3 hours. Hours may include decimals (for example,
<b>3.5h</b>). <b>playtime:1.5h-</b> lists games with an estimated play
time of at least 1 and a half hours. <b>playtime:-45m</b> lists games
with an estimated play time of 45 minutes or less. <b>playtime:1h</b>
searches for games with an estimated play time of 1 hour.
<b>playtime:</b> with no text after it searches for games with no
estimated play time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: IF Database News</p>
<p>Most of our <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/">IFDB API</a> endpoints
now support JSON.</p>
<ul>
<li>
You can <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/search">search for games</a> and
get JSON results
</li>
<li>
You can <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">view an individual
game</a> and get JSON results (now including tags and complete,
unstripped HTML!)
</li>
<li>
You can <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/taggame">tag games</a> by posting
a JSON array of tags

</ul>
<p>
All of the old APIs still work in XML mode, but <b>JSON is the preferred
format for all new code.</b> (The API to add/edit games is still
XML-only, for now.)

In addition, we deprecated the
<a href="https://ifdb.org/api/gametags">gametags API</a>. You can view
tags on an individual game with the

In my previous article on Japanese science fiction, published
in Locus in 2016, I likened my experience of living in Japan to Urashima
Taro’s rise from his present world (eighth century) to the world of the
future, with its fast-forward jumble of pop-culture iconography. This
sense of Japan and its current state in science fiction is even more
relevant in the wake of COVID, as these changes have only accelerated.

Manuela Draeger’s <strong>Kree </strong>is so immedi­ately violent that I
wasn’t sure it was going to be for me. Somehow, though, within just a
few chapters, the novel’s mix of haunting imagery and almost humorous
un­predictability grew so compelling that I found myself wanting to track
down everything else the author has written. A midapocalyptic story set
