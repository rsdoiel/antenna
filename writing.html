<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: John August blog</p>
<p>Back in 2017, friends and I came up with a fun little game called
AlphaBirds.1 We’ve been playing it in the office nearly every Friday
since then. It’s a word game like Scrabble or Wordle, but faster and
more fun. And it’s ridiculously simple to learn. On your turn, draw two
cards. Play one card […] The post

rebuild scenes and restore muddy characters that have become burdened by
too many notes, all while making sure your script retains its voice. We

Reviews Baby X by Kira Peikoff</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>Baby X</strong>, Kira Peikoff (Crooked Lane 978-1-63910-633-2,
$30.99, 336pp, hc) March 2024. Cover by Nicole Lecht.
</p>
<p>
Kira Peikoff’s <strong>Baby X </strong>is a solid technothriller that
feels very timely while also delivering great entertainment. At once a
novel of big ideas that will satisfy fans of science fiction and a
fast-paced narrative about crimes that might become a reality sooner
rather than later, <strong>Baby X </strong>pulls readers into a future

Clare Winger Harris is the winner of the 2024 Cordwainer Smith
Rediscovery Award, intended to bring attention to lesser-known SF and

Science Fiction pulps such as Amazing Stories and Science Wonder Stories
under her own name. She published a dozen stories between 1926

Are Ken MacLeod novels realistic? Twenty-five years ago I would have
said no. Reading the Fall Revolution series (1995-1999) as a teenager,
part of the thrill (I see now) was the vivid granular depiction of a
