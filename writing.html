<h2 id="why-is-crime-and-thriller-fiction-so-popular">Why Is Crime and
Thriller Fiction So Popular?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing in July 2024, eight of the 15 books on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/combined-print-and-e-book-fiction/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times combined print &amp;amp; e-book fiction best-seller list&lt;/a&gt; are crime or thriller fiction. It&amp;rsquo;s summer, and this sort of book is popular for beach or vacation reading, but if you look at best-seller lists at any time, you&amp;rsquo;ll find mysteries and thrillers prominently featured.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Crime sells</p>
<p>
It is estimated that one in eight novels sold are in the crime genre,
and this genre is responsible for about 20% of audiobook sales, and more
than a third of ebook sales,
<a href="https://nielsenbook.co.uk/crime-and-thrills-pay-in-the-uk-book-market/" target="_blank">according
to a Nielsen study in the UK</a>. Crime and thriller fiction has been
growing in recent years, as the popularity of some sub-genres has
increased. Psychological thrillers have become very popular, especially
among women, and cozy mysteries - books like those of Agatha Christie,
who is estimated to have sold between two and four billion books - have
had a recent revival.
</p>
<p>
According to Nielsen, “Overall, the crime &amp; thriller buyer skews
older,” though crime and thriller novels appeal to all ages. The study
points out that psychological thrillers are most popular among younger
readers (25 - 44), and “dark countryside,” or rural noir, is most
popular among older readers.
</p>
<p>Crime fiction has many sub-genres</p>
<p>
The crime and thriller genre is broad, and covers many sub-genres:
classic mysteries, thrillers, psychological thrillers, spy novels, legal
thrillers, historical mysteries, cozy mysteries, and police procedurals;
from the whodunit to the detective story, there is something for
everyone.
</p>
<p>
Readers who may not want to read a gritty urban thriller might be
attracted by a mystery set in the 16th century or a cozy mystery with
little or no violence. And readers who want action have plenty to choose
from, with larger-than-life characters, such as Lee Child’s Jack Reacher
or Vince Flynn’s Mitch Rapp.
</p>
<p>
With this vast range of sub-genres, crime and thriller fiction can
appeal to many types of readers. With traditional murder mysteries,
readers try to figure out whodunit and accompany a detective as they
amass clues. A good mystery is an intellectual game the writer plays
with the reader, and readers are satisfied when the guilty party is
found, but when they aren’t too obvious. Readers want to be fooled, but
not cheated, and it’s important that, as Raymond Chandler said, a
mystery “must baffle a reasonably intelligent reader,” but also “must be
honest with the reader.”
</p>
<p>
With psychological thrillers, readers can identify with the characters,
which are often everyday people thrust into unexpected situations. Legal
thrillers give a view of the justice system, which most readers never
encounter personally. And many readers of crime fiction like to read
novels set in unfamiliar locations, or even in historical settings.
</p>
<p>
A unique element of crime fiction is that it can be written in series,
with a recurring police officer or private detective. Series readers
appreciate returning to new cases with familiar characters, and many
popular series have more than two dozen novels. This type of novel is
usually a police or detective procedural, featuring characters like Ian
Rankin’s Rebus, Peter Robinson’s DCI Banks, and Laura Lippman’s Tess
Monaghan, who readers get to watch as they grow and change over time.
</p>
<p>
Through their presence in novels and films, some crime fiction
characters have become iconic: think of Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, and
Miss Marple, not to mention the best-known of all, Sherlock Holmes, and
serve as templates for modern detectives.
</p>
<p>Why do readers like crime and thriller fiction?</p>
<p>
Crime and thriller fiction gives readers the opportunity to experience
unfamiliar parts of the world. They may be transported into dangerous
areas where criminals thrive, and they may experience the thrill of the
heist or the adrenaline rush of an exciting spy story. Or they may look
over the shoulder of a detective as he or she tries to determine who is
guilty.
</p>
<p>
Crime fiction delves into the complexities of human behavior, exploring
both the best and worst of humanity. It can look at parts of society
that readers don’t know with a high level of realism, and can be a tool
for examining social norms and injustices. In some sub-genres, such as
the noir or hardboiled detective genre, crime fiction explores the lower
depths of society, and readers can learn about vice and corruption from
a safe distance.
</p>
<p>
Crime fiction almost always presents legal and moral quandaries,
allowing readers to gauge their own feelings about the gray areas of
right and wrong. In most crime fiction, the resolution is satisfying,
and readers can feel vindicated when they’ve seen how crime is punished.
However, some crime fiction - especially in the noir sub-genre - does
not offer neat resolutions, and this, too, can be satisfying.
</p>
<p>
Psychological thrillers are a sub-genre where readers can experience
danger and suspense from a safe distance. Many of these novels feature
everyday people thrust into dangerous situations, and this can allow
readers to immerse themselves in thrilling scenarios that they would
never experience. Readers can imagine themselves in these situations,
and figure out what they would do without any of the risks involved.
</p>
<p>
The crime and thriller genre is firmly established as one of the main
forms of storytelling, not just in novels, but also in movies and TV
series. Many crime fiction authors are considered among the greatest
writers, and this genre offers a rich history for readers to discover.
The genre’s ability to adapt and incorporate contemporary issues keeps
it relevant and engaging, while the vast trove of crime and thriller
fiction written over the past decades and centuries offers a valuable
canon for anyone who wants to discover this genre.

Much like time travel, the multiverse, as a scientifi­cally originated

degrees of rigour. For every <strong>Timescape </strong>a <strong>Doctor

<strong>Twice Lived</strong>, Joma West (Tordotcom 978-1-250-81032-8,

</p>
<p>
Author Joma West explores the idea of parallel worlds in an unexpected
way in her science fic­tion novel, <strong>Twice Lived</strong>. Canna
and Lily are one person, a ‘‘shifter’’ who uncontrollably moves back and
forth between the two worlds. Her mothers detected her nature when they
were pregnant, as the fetus would disappear and reappear
