Writer’s block isn’t real. It’s not something that should be feared by
writers, whether you’re writing novels or screenplays. It is nothing
more than an over-generalized term for the multiple hurdles <span
style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> writers must face, overcome, and
adapt to in their writing process. <br><br>It’s true. Any writer that
has felt that lingering weight on their shoulders perceived as the
mystical condition <em>writer’s block</em> should take solace knowing
that they don’t have to be a victim to it any longer. <br><br>To truly
conquer a problem, it’s best to explore and understand every dynamic and
angle of it. For writers battling with supposed writer’s block, and for
those who want to avoid it, you must first be able to identify what it
really is, what triggers it, and how you can put a stop to it before it
takes hold. <br><br>With that in mind, here we present seven ways to
identify and prevent what most people initially attribute to being the
dreaded <span style="font-weight: bold;">writer’s block</span>.
