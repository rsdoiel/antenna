how elections and politics can be used across genres to test a

It’s hard to know where to start writing about a book that knows exactly

Wild Robot’ Screenwriter Chris Sanders Tells How to Write for
Animation</h2>

<p>
If you want to learn how to write for animated films, there is probably
no better person to learn from than
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761498/">Chris
Sanders</a>. <br><br>He’s a veritable titan in the industry, with story
credits on Disney classics like <span style="font-style: italic;">Beauty
and the Beast, Aladdin,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Lion King</span>—yes, those classics—along with screenwriting credits on
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mulan</span> and <span
style="font-style: italic;">Lilo &amp; Stitch,</span> not to mention
modern hits like <span style="font-style: italic;">How to Train Your
Dragon</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The</span> <span
style="font-style: italic;">Croods</span>. <br><br>His stories swell
with emotion and feature conflict that’s at times surprising in its
thorniness and complicated, grown-up themes; perhaps why his movies
resonate across ages. The lonely protagonist who needs to find their
place and gain their strength is a favorite in his repertoire, and his
latest film, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wild Robot</span>, is
a new take on this character.  <br><br>Adapted from the book by Peter
Brown, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wild Robot</span> is “Roz”
(Lupita Nyong’o), who crash-lands on an island inhabited only by
woodland creatures. When she stumbles upon an orphaned gosling, she and
the fox Fink (Pedro Pascal) have to get him ready to fly south for his
winter migration. <br><br>When we got the chance to speak with Sanders
about his experience as a writer on this and other films, we of course
jumped at the chance. We asked him what was different about writing for
animation, handling thematic material for kids, and more. <br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">The Wild Robot</span> is now available to
watch at home digitally from Universal Pictures Home
Entertainment. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note:

Lessons in Horror Writing from ‘Smile 2’ Filmmaker Parker Finn</h2>

<p>
Writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6475689/">Parker
Finn</a> has mastered a specific brand of horror with 2022’s <span
style="font-style: italic;">Smile</span> and this year’s Halloween hit,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Smile 2</span>. It’s dour, it’s
high-concept, it’s ghastly and gory and great. The story might lead
viewers to ask certain questions. How does he come up with such unique
scares, and write them visually on the page? How does a focus on
character influence the tension? Also, is he okay? (Just
kidding.) <br><br>Finn has tapped into something that is resonating with
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/why-horror-never-dies">horror</a>
fans and everyday moviegoers alike, and is doing so with original
storytelling and deft direction that has landed him in the nation’s
number-one box office spot. <br><br>In this film, his smiley contagion
lands on Skye Riley (Naomi Scott), one of the world’s biggest pop stars
on the cusp of a comeback. The year before, she suffered a deadly
accident and heavy substance abuse. <br><br>As she preps for her tour,
she visits old friend Lewis (Lukas Gage), who has just had the curse
transferred to him. After he dies in front of her, Skye finds herself
rehearsing and handling appearances as everything crumbles around her.
She grows increasingly manic, not sure what’s real and who she can
trust.

early 20th-century American settings and the classic themes of the need

A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sympathetic Monster</span> is

ourselves caring about them despite the carnage they cause. <br><br>Over
the decades, there have been many Sympathetic Monsters that have
resonated with filmgoers, and some of them are still at the center of
several film franchises, remakes or modern reinterpretations. Because of
this, if you’re writing a script that features a monster of some sort,
it might be a more

I don’t think it’s entirely unrecognised that one of the most notable
qualities of Ken MacLeod’s fic­tion is its dry humour, but I’m not sure
it’s much discussed. So here’s a moment from “The Shadow Ministers”, one
of a baker’s dozen of enjoyable stories collected in <strong>A Jura for
Julia</strong>, that

<strong>The Tongue Trade</strong>, Michael J. Martineck (Edge
978-1770532410, hardcover, 224pp, $34.95) October 2024
</p>
<p>
Michael Martineck has had the kind of respectable bubbling-under career
that many writers enjoy—but which they also might ambitiously seek to
surpass. (Has any writer ever been truly satisfied with his or her
current status?) He sold his first story in 1999, then several novels,
with the most recent being <b>The Link Boy</b> in 2017. Good

I’d never heard of the rapper Logic (AKA Sir Robert Bryson Hall II) or
his work (both musi­cal and literary) until I was sent a copy of
<strong>Ultra 85</strong>. That’s not an indictment of Logic but instead
speaks to my narrow, stunted musical tastes. <strong>Ultra 85
