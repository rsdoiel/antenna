Historical epics are rare. Long gone are the days when large-scale
biblical stories were adapted to the big screen or tales of sweeping
battles from centuries, if not millennia, ago brought audiences swarming
to the cinemas. While they often don’t see a release in the summer
tentpole season or the coveted holidays/Oscar-buzzing season they once
did, they do still exist. And the master of bringing historical epics to
life is Ridley Scott.

When many of us think of Thanksgiving, several things come to mind.
Visiting family and loved ones, watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day
Parade, football or
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/take-5-planes-trains-and-automobiles" style="font-style: italic;">Planes,
Trains and Automobiles</a>, a turkey dinner with stuffing, sweet potato,
cranberry sauce, etc. Not to take away from any of these things, but the
holiday is also a time to be reflective and express gratitude for all
the things that are good in our lives. Of course some people are going
to have more things to be grateful for than others, especially
screenwriters who have numerous ups and downs in their career pursuit.
Whether you’re a beginner screenwriter or a professional with a loaded
IMDB page, some years are bound to be better than others. That being
said, even during an “off year,” there might be more things to be
thankful for than you realize. <br><br>In this spirit, below are <span

<p>“About 12 years ago, I had my very first meeting to staff. It was a
show being run by a playwright named Beau Willimon and he’d done one
season of a show that hadn’t dropped yet and they were going to do this
crazy new model where the whole season was going to drop at once and
they didn’t know how it was going to go. And that was a show called
<em>House of Cards</em>. And I was staffed for season two of that show
before season one dropped. So, that was my entrance into television. It
was my first meeting to staff on any show!” says Laura Eason, playwright
and current showrunner for Starz’s TV show <em>Three Women</em>.  <br>
<br>In this episode of the Write On podcast, we chat with Laura Eason
about her illustrious career as a playwright and how she made the
intimidating transition to TV writing.  <br> <br>“I got a call a week
before the [ <em>House of Cards</em>] room started and I went to Barnes
and Noble and bought the book How to Write the One Hour Drama. I’m not
kidding. I was like, oh my God. And I called everyone I knew that had
been in TV and said, ‘Tell me everything you can about being in a room
and how it’s supposed to go.’ And then I was very lucky my first year in
TV,” says Eason who was nominated for an Emmy for <em>House of
Cards</em> in 2017.  <br> <br>Eason also talks about her latest show
<em>Three Women</em>, its unique structure and also shares her advice
for writing a TV pilot as the tides in Hollywood are changing. </p>

<p>“Well, we’re coming into a different moment with this contraction
that we’re having in the [TV] industry. We had a very beautiful time
where I think there was a lot of room for idiosyncrasy and a lot of room
for things to not quite check the list of everything a pilot should
probably be, but because the voice was really unique or the world was
interesting, those shows still got made. And I think we’re in a moment
now where all of the fundamentals need to be really, really strong. Like
the engine of your pilot really needs to work. Someone needs to read
that pilot and understand how you’re going to be able to make 10
episodes or 20 or 50 episodes of that show, especially because there’s
less interest in limited series. So, making sure that you’re paying as
much attention to engine, to character, to your act structure, that the
action is really moving and the acts the way it should as much as your
voice, the unique things you bring, because of course that’s the special
sauce. But you really need to have both now, in a really strong way.”

Dinner tables can be more than a place to eat. From the mundane
conversations that reveal character dynamics to the rising tension that
happens when everyone is forced to sit down and share a meal, dinner
scenes create the perfect setting for pivotal moments in your story
while also engaging characters in one of the most relatable
activities—eating.
