The longer I review science fiction, the more I notice how it much it
depends on recycling tropes ‚Äì not just repeating but extending and
varying and inverting them ‚Äì and, I suspect, refitting them to reflect
current anxieties or hopes, conscious or not. This time the recognition
lights have been set flashing by

<span style="background-color: transparent; color: #0a0a0a;">‚ÄúWe wanted
the whole series, but specifically the pilot episode, to lure you in
with the kind of comfort and coziness of the 80s nostalgia and the
trappings of John Hughes movies, and all of that, while also giving it
the 80s heavy metal flavor, and then start to build paranoia and change
the vibe a little bit throughout. But we always knew that the series was
going to hinge on this scene with Judith [Jessica Treska] where you
realize that the beautiful girl next door is actually so much trouble!‚Äù
says Matthew Scott Kane, creator and showrunner of Peacock‚Äôs
</span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: #0a0a0a;">Hysteria!</em><span
style="background-color: transparent; color: #0a0a0a;"> Starring Julie
Bowen, Anna Camp and Bruce Campbell.¬†</span>
</p>
<p>The show explores the so-called Satanic Panic that actually happened
in the 1980s at a fictionalized high school in the midwest. When a
varsity football player disappears under mysterious circumstances, a
struggling teen heavy metal band realize they can capitalize on the
town‚Äôs sudden interest in the occult by creating a fake Satanic cult ‚Äì
to their surprise, everyone is into it. Things quickly get out of
control when the town takes the cult more seriously than the high school
band members.¬† <br> <br>In this episode of the Write On podcast, Kane
talks about delving into the generational fear of teenagers, balancing
horror with humor, and writing characters who need ‚Äúto be seen‚Äù by their
peers. He also shares details about his journey to becoming a
professional TV writer, ¬†specifically the many benefits of being an
assistant in Hollywood.¬† <br> <br>‚ÄúThe biggest gift of being an
assistant ‚Äì which is not an easy job, it‚Äôs very difficult, it‚Äôs very
time consuming, you have to be available 24/ 7 and it takes a lot out of
you ‚Äì but the best possible thing that you can get, and not all
showrunners will do this, is to make yourself available to watch every
step of the creative process. Make sure you are in the room while they
are breaking story. Make sure you are reading outlines that are coming
in. Make sure you‚Äôre in concept meetings, tone meetings, production
meetings, all of these things that might feel like they don‚Äôt have
anything to do with writing, but they have everything to do with
writing,‚Äù says Kane.¬† <br> <br>To hear more, listen to the podcast.¬†</p>

It‚Äôs likely that when <em>Saturday Night Live</em> premiered on October
11, 1975, even the show‚Äôs creator didn‚Äôt see it lasting 50 years. The
chaotic start of the ‚Äònot ready for prime time‚Äô players was filled with
uncertainty, confusion, hostility and a revolutionary spirit. In the new
film <em>Saturday Night</em> written by Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman, the
audience gets a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the 90 minutes leading up
to the show‚Äôs premiere.

For over two decades, Lee Jessup has been coaching the careers of both
emerging and professional screenwriters with the goal of helping them
take their career to the next level. You may also know that Jessup has
been mentoring winners of the Final Draft Big Break Screenwriting

emerging writers. Given all her savvy and experience in the industry, we
