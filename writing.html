Every great romantic comedy has a moment where two characters collide,
clash, or connect for the first time. That moment is a meet-cute – the
heartbeat of any romantic comedy. <br><br>Meet-cutes set the tone,
stakes, and emotional undercurrent for everything that follows the
story. It’s where we, the audience, decide if we want to watch these
characters fall in love. When done right, it can hook your viewer,
define your characters, and spark a journey that feels both familiar and
fresh.<br><br>Let’s break down what makes a meet-cute memorable, and how
you can write one that stands out with some of our favorite examples.
