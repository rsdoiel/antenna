id="estimated-play-time-votes-are-now-publicly-attributed-to-you">Estimated
play time votes are now publicly attributed to you</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-19, from: IF Database News</p>
<p>
<p>When we first launched the new
<a href="https://ifdb.org/news?item=150">estimated play time</a>
feature, each player’s votes for a time were private and anonymous. But
we have improvements planned that won’t work well with anonymity, so
we’ve decided to change our approach and to publicly attribute time
votes to the player who posts them, just like reviews and ratings.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Here’s how the transition will work.
</summary>
<ul>
<li>
All 373 existing time votes are temporarily marked “Anonymous.”
</li>
<li>
All <i>new</i> time votes will link to the user who posted them, like
this: “8h30m —
<a href="https://ifdb.org/showuser?id=oyrrw74upu8n2dds">Dan Fabulich</a>
</li>
<li>
We’ll email all 34 users who have submitted time votes, asking their
permission to link their votes to their user name. (The email will
include a list of your existing time votes.)
</li>
<li>
If you decide that you’re not comfortable linking your time votes to
your user name, we’ll delete your time votes from IFDB. (You’ll still
have your private copy in email, so you can always repost them at any
time, but, if you do, the time votes will be publicly attributable to
you.)
</li>
<li>
After 30 days, on or around December 19, we’ll delete any time votes
from users who haven’t granted us permission to link them publicly.
</li>
<li>
After December 19, all existing time votes will be publicly attributed
to the user who posted them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have questions, please reach out to us at
<a href="mailto:ifdbadmin@ifdb.org">ifdbadmin@ifdb.org</a>.

<p>John and Craig analyze the iconic 1995 comedy Clueless, and why

adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma set in Beverly Hills, Clueless follows
protagonist Cher as she tries to do ‘good’ through make-over montages
and match-making attempts. We discuss how the movie sets up the […] The
