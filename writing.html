      <h1>The 2025 Colossal Fundraiser has begun!</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/792165104576774144">IF Competition Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Hello, friends. </p><p>We are just a couple of weeks away from this year’s IFComp games being released. Are you looking forward to them as much as we are?? IT&rsquo;S SO EXCITING!! <br/><small>(Unless you’re an author who is furiously testing and revising and recompiling and testing and revising and recompiling and… Good luck, authors! You can do it!)</small></p><p><b>While we eagerly await the new games to come, we’d like to ask for your help with the Colossal Fund.</b> If you already know about the fund and are able to contribute, please go to <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">ifcomp.org</a> and <b>hit that blue “Donate with PayPal”</b> button!</p><p><i>If you’d like more information first, keep on reading…</i></p><p>The Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to the top two-thirds of IFComp entries. We use 80% of the funds for that, and the remaining funds are used to provide support for the programs and projects of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>, the <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other projects.</p><h2>This year, we are shooting for $8K.</h2><p><b>We’re now accepting donations for 2025!</b> <br/>The donation button is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name listed on our donor page (or listed as “anonymous” if you prefer)! <br/>Our fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition voting. 80% of the proceeds (~$6.4K if we hit our goal) will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. </p><p><b>What does this mean for authors?</b> <br/>Because we’re dividing the money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the money among the top 50. If we hit our goal, that would mean that the winner of the competition will be offered a prize of $357, second place will be offered $343, third prize $329… and so on and so forth until 50th place, which will be offered $10.  Our goal is to distribute prizes across a broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately well is offered a decent prize. (If you wanna get nerdy, there&rsquo;s information about the formula with a link to a Python script <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/162478013529/announcing-the-ifcomp-colossal-fund">here</a>.)</p><p><b>How do I donate?</b> <br/>Please go to https://ifcomp.org and push the big blue <i>Donate</i> button.</p><p><b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b> <br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by law. (Consult a tax professional.)</p><p><b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize list?</b> <br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well! Please visit our prize page to see what objects and services others have donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how you can contribute.</p><p><b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b> <br/>Via PayPal or Venmo. (The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you can’t accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If that doesn’t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we will roll the money into next year’s prize fund, which means it will continue to support authors and IFTF programs.</p>

<p>Cold querying can be an effective tool to get representation, and to get your scripts read and considered by industry insiders and decision-makers in Hollywood. Don’t let anyone tell you differently.&nbsp;<br><br>When you’re not winning major screenwriting contests and fellowships, and when you don’t know anyone in the industry yet, the cold query is perhaps your best option to break through those Hollywood walls and get noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here we discuss and share simple and effective best practices, directives, habits, and examples you can follow to create a cold querying process that works for you.</p>

<p>When Natalie Messier entered the <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">Final Draft Big Break TV writing competition</a> in 2022, she didn’t expect to win. Her dramedy pilot ‘Killer Queen’, about a woman who discovers her husband is a serial killer, was a sharp, funny, and oddly tender take on the delayed coming-of-age trope, but at that point, she says, “I hadn’t really received much acclaim for anything I’d written.”<br><br>Winning changed everything for Natalie.<br><br>Though she was already working in the writers’ room of NBC’s Chicago Fire as an assistant when she found out she won Big Break’s Grand Prize in the TV Drama category, the recognition gave her new-found confidence. “I told my coworkers about the win, and they were like, ‘Congratulations! Can I read it?’ They read it, and that’s what got me my first episode of television. I probably wouldn’t have shared it with them if I hadn’t won.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Freakier Friday</em> is the tale of four women who end up switching bodies, and must learn what it’s like to walk in someone else’s shoes. This isn’t an original story. In fact, it’s the sequel to <em>Freaky Friday</em> (2003), which is a remake of the original <em>Freaky Friday</em> from 1976, not including the TV movie made in 1995, or the other TV movie/musical from 2018.</p>

</div> 
<p>“Our goal in writing [<em>Sirens</em>] was to write something that makes you think, and offers the opportunity to re-examine your own assumptions that you made about these characters. And it’s taxing. We ask some difficult questions. It’s not <em>The Perfect Couple</em>. It’s not a murder show. We’re going after something thematically that’s really large and really ambitious, and that’s why the Greek mythology came to mind. These are epic stories. These are about blood, and moms, and torture, and trauma, and pain. These themes are not tiny. These are complicated, juicy stews,” says showrunner and creator, Molly Smith Metzler about why she wanted to invoke big themes from Greek drama in her TV show <em>Sirens</em>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On today’s episode, we chat with Molly Smith Metzler, showrunner and creator of the hit Netflix limited series <em>Sirens</em> starring Julianne Moore, Meghann Fahy and Kevin Bacon. The show is based on her stage play <em>Elemeno Pea</em> from 2011. Smith Metzler talks about making the transition from playwriting to television and what she learned about being in the writer’s room for <em>Orange is the New Black</em>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Everything you do in a [writer’s] room is an offering. I’m here to serve, I’m here to serve you. Come in with ideas, offer them. If they don’t hit, back off of them. You are a sous chef and a waiter,” she says.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She also talks about writing edgy female characters unapologetically, like the ones in <em>Sirens</em>, and the numerous times she was asked to remove a certain risqué scene from the pilot script – which she refused to do. “We have to write these women in their truest form – they’re complicated, and they don’t have to explain themselves, either. My job is not to soften her so an audience won’t turn off the TV show,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Mild Spoilers Ahead! </em>Zach Cregger’s movies are wildly unique. With his breakout film <em>Barbarian</em>, he played with the fears of anyone staying at an Airbnb realizing that the house is not what it seems. He has followed up this surprise box office hit with <em>Weapons</em>, a twisty, creepy psychological horror movie that plays into every parent’s worst nightmare: their child runs away in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>If you’re an emerging screenwriter, you’ve likely heard it’s a good idea to build a brand or grow your online presence. But putting yourself “out there” can be intimidating, especially if you don’t want to look like a cringey self-promoter or some kind of screenwriting hack.&nbsp;<br><br>The good news is that screenwriter Nic Curcio has figured out a path that feels authentic and engaging and has shared his advice with us. Nic, who wrote on the upcoming animated feature <em>Goat</em> (in theaters February 2026), has steadily grown a loyal following on TikTok by posting screenwriting-related videos that are both educational and entertaining. What started as a side hobby during the pandemic has helped him land meetings, earn extra cheddar, and connect with a larger writing community.<br><br>Before working on <em>Goat</em> and finding a social media following, Nic studied English at UCLA and later earned his MFA in Film/TV Production from USC. His studies at USC gave him hands-on experience in various aspects of filmmaking, but writing is where he found his strongest voice.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2019, his feature script <em>Barron: A Tale of Love, Loss and Legacy</em>, was featured on the annual Black List, a ranking of Hollywood’s best unproduced scripts (yes, it’s a fictional story about a young Barron Trump!). From there, he landed a job as an in-house writer at Sony Animation, where he spent over a year rewriting and shaping <em>Goat</em> while working closely with the animation team. He has since written projects for Paramount and Universal, including a feature adaptation of the comic <em>Planet of the Nerds</em> and a new take on <em>The Magic School Bus</em>. In addition to all of this, he also finds time to co-host the podcast <em>Hollywood Hang</em> with fellow screenwriter Kristen Tepper.&nbsp;</p>
