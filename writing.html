Contained screenwriting can be challenging. Not everyone is wired to
tell a story that involves only a small amount of characters and that
mostly happens in just one or two locations. But like most creative
endeavors, the right kind of limitations can produce surprising
benefits. Placing boundaries on your screenplay can create dynamic
storytelling opportunities, not to mention that contained screenplays
typically have a lower budget. And that could make the difference
between being an aspiring screenwriter versus

There‚Äôs a clich√© in Hollywood that a film is made three times: once on
the page in the form of a screenplay, the second time is on set when
it‚Äôs shot with the director and actors, and the third time is in the
editing bay. While any filmmaker can argue that each stage of ‚Äúmaking‚Äù
the movie is equally important, it‚Äôs in the edit where the story is
finalized and often defined more by what is cut out than by what is left
in.¬†<br><br>Many of the industry‚Äôs greatest screenwriters started their
careers as editors, including Steven Zaillian (<em>Schindler‚Äôs
List</em>, 1993), Steven Soderbergh (<em>Traffic</em>, 2000), and Joel
Coen (<em>No Country for Old Men</em>, 2007). All three filmmakers have
distinct visual styles, a knack for clear and concise storytelling and
the ability to create effective pacing. These skills were no doubt
formed and strengthened while spending hundreds of hours going over raw
footage and slowly piecing it all
together.¬†<br><br><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/tag/podcast">Final

If there‚Äôs one writer/director whose work I‚Äôve been consistently excited
by and whose name at festivals promises a project both heartbreakingly
raw and funny, it‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323708/">Cooper
Raiff</a>.¬†<br><br>He was a SXSW breakout in 2020 with college comedy
<span style="font-style: italic;">Shithouse</span>, which snagged him
the fest‚Äôs Grand Jury Award. And in 2022 took a step into more adult
territory with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of <span
style="font-style: italic;">Cha Cha Real Smooth</span>, which won the
<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/cha-cha-real-smooth-sundance-win-cooper-raiff-dakota-johnson.html">Audience
Award</a> in the U.S. Dramatic category.<br><br>This year, he is back at
Sundance with an episodic work,
<a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753360063b9434588c22178" style="font-style: italic;">Hal
&amp; Harper</a>. The series follows two codependent siblings (Raiff and
Lili Reinhart) who, years after a traumatic event in their family, still
haven‚Äôt quite recovered. That pain seeps into their messy present-day
relationships, including the ones they have with their dad (Mark
Ruffalo) and his new partner (Betty Gilpin). When we get flashbacks into
their childhood, Raiff and Reinhart play their grade-school versions of
the characters, forced to mature too soon.<br><br>Raiff is always highly
involved in his projects, writing and directing as well as starring, and
he brings a singular sensibility to the work that‚Äôs a bit hard to pin
down‚Äîsomething about an awkward honesty, naturalistic dialogue, moments
of emotional punch that feel familiar and real. ¬†<br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</span> is no different, but
as an episodic, the story is a bit more freewheeling, interwoven with
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/frame-story-flashback">past and
present threads</a> that slowly unravel the family‚Äôs
anguish.<br><br>Final Draft spoke with Raiff ahead of Sundance to learn
what was different about his approach to episodic work, his methods for
building characters that he might not fully understand in the beginning,
and how the writing comes together on set.¬†

It‚Äôs a bit bracing to be reminded that I‚Äôve been writing these yearly
re¬≠view columns for more than three decades, but it does put things in

The Sunday Morning Transport publishes out¬≠standing fiction weekly. All
the stories are commendable, but here are my favorites of their fall
offerings. If, as I did, you felt sympathy for Hermione‚Äôs muggle
parents, ‚Äú<strong>F*** These Wizards</strong>‚Äù by <strong>Alex London
