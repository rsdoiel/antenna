      <h1>Anticircumvention Law is Not the Right Solution to Webscraping</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>In the webscraping cases now pending, courts should focus their analysis on whether there has been actual harm to the plaintiffs’ web infrastructures, instead of allowing digital platforms absolute control via ToS or TPMs.</p>

(date: 2026-01-06)

      <p>John and Craig consider all the words they have to write and ask, how do you know when something deserves your best effort? They offer a useful rubric for deciding when something is worth perfecting, and when over-optimization is a waste of time. We also follow up on compulsive writing habits, industry euphemisms, back issues, […]</p>

      <h1>The Value of Public Domain Day</h1>

(date: 2026-01-01)
      <p>
      <p>Out of roughly 16,000 eligible books, movies, or music, no more than five percent could expect to earn more than a total of $100 in the space of 20 years. The rest of the works—more than 15,000 of them—were expected to be worth less than five dollars per year (economically speaking) to their rights holders.</p>

      <p>John and Craig circle back on all the euphemisms and stock phrases that float around Hollywood. Using some favorite examples, they attempt to define and demystify the current industry-speak so everyone is looped in when we come up for air after the holidays. We also wrap-up 2025 with a look at Scriptnotes by the numbers, […]</p>

      <p>This was a tough year. American democracy strained under authoritarian assault. Here in Los Angeles, friends lost homes in the fires while many in the industry struggled to find work. But good things happened as well. Babies were born. Terrific movies and TV shows debuted. My family was happy and healthy. My husband has a […]</p>

      <p>In a Christmas crossover event, John and Craig join Meg LeFauve (Inside Out) and Lorien McKenna (Tab Time) on their podcast, The Screenwriting Life. We talk about why rigid structure can miss the point, how theme emerges from character, what fear and denial really look like on the page, and how writers can survive rejection […]</p>
