In a perfect world, we’d all have unlimited time to work on our scripts.
Studying for school, working to pay the bills, and family obligations
would be taken care of, and there would be plenty of free time
consisting of nothing more than you, your laptop, and the worlds and
characters you create. <br><br>But it’s not a perfect world, and we have
responsibilities to attend to. Even if you become a professional
screenwriter, you’ll still need to balance your writing with social
engagements, health objectives and family duties. Part of any job is
learning to balance that job with this thing we call <em>life</em>. So
whether you’re a beginner or professional, it’s essential to learn how
to balance your life with your writing. <br><br>Below we’ll discuss
various methods and ways of thinking that can help you f<span
style="font-weight: bold;">ind the time to write your
screenplay</span>.

There’s something about a masked character that allows for particular
stories. Self-evidently, it encourages questions and mysteries about the
character’s identity and the purpose of the mask. The Mandalorian’s vow
not to remove his helmet makes more poignant those moments when he
chooses to do so; masks conceal many a
