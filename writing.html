<p>Over the last year, we’ve seen a number of major deals inked between

<p>John and Craig welcome back Megana Rao to look at rituals and what

There are probably hundreds of examples of how the Chosen One motif has

What can be said about Harlan Ellison at this point? The man is a
legend. Unfortunately, some­times legends get lost in the folds of time
and that makes it harder for newer generations of readers to discover
their work. <strong>Greatest Hits</strong>, a superb collection of some
of Ellison’s best short
