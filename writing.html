id="how-much-should-you-write-each-day-and-when-should-you-stop-writing">How
Much Should You Write Each Day; and When Should You Stop Writing?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re writing a novel or another long work, it&amp;rsquo;s like running a marathon, not a sprint. You won&amp;rsquo;t finish it in a few days or a week, and you have to work at a rhythm that allows you to remain creative and achieve the appropriate word count over time. Slow and steady writing will eventually get you to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>How much should you write each day?</p>
<p>
If possible, it‚Äôs a good idea to write every day, even if you can‚Äôt
write very much each day. You can set a target, which isn‚Äôt a hard goal,
but which is something to aim for. Some writers are happy with 500 words
a day, others with 1,000 words, and some, who write full time, may even
strive to write 2,000 words a day. If you do the math, even if you only
write five 500 words a day, that comes to 130,000 words in a year. That
means you can write the first draft of a novel - with room to spare - in
twelve months, if you remain consistent.
</p>
<p>
Many writers can‚Äôt write every day, so they set aside a couple of days a
week to write. If you plan to write 1,000 words a day for two full days
a week, that‚Äôs more than 100,000 words a year. The key is consistency
and maintaining your momentum.
</p>
<p>
How do you decide how many words to write a day? A lot depends on how
experienced you are, and what your writing rhythm is. In <em>On
Writing</em>, Stephen King says, ‚ÄúAs with physical exercise, it would be
best to set this goal low at first, to avoid discouragement. I suggest a
thousand words a day, and because I‚Äôm feeling magnanimous, I‚Äôll also
suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to begin with. No
more; you‚Äôll lose the urgency and immediacy of your story if you do.‚Äú
</p>
<p>
Anthony Trollope had a day job at the General Post Office, but
<a href="http://www.online-literature.com/anthony-trollope/trollope-autobiography/15/" target="_blank">he
would write before going to work</a>. ‚ÄúIt was my practice to be at my
table every morning at 5.30; and it was also my practice to allow myself
no mercy. [‚Ä¶] It had at this time become my custom, and it still is my
custom, though of late I have become a little lenient to myself, to
write with my watch before me, and to require from myself 250 words
every quarter of an hour.‚Äú This meant that he could write up to 3,000
words each morning, and this is how he wrote dozens of novels and other
works.
</p>
<p>
Scrivener
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/track-statistics-and-targets-in-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">has
useful tools to help you set and meet targets</a>. You can view the word
count of your current document in the app‚Äôs footer, and you can view the
total word count of your project by hovering your cursor over the Quick
Search box in the toolbar.
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/statistics-and-targets/stats-top.png" width="412" />
</figure>
<p>
You can also get detailed statistics of your project by choosing Project
&gt; Statistics:
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/statistics-and-targets/stats-full.png" width="490" />
</figure>
<p>
And you can set and view targets for each writing session, and for your
overall project.
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/statistics-and-targets/targets.png" width="555" />
</figure>
<p>When should you end your writing sessions?</p>
<p>
So when should you stop writing? Should you set an alarm, time yourself,
or write precisely for one or two hours? If your target is a word count,
should you stop once you hit that number, or keep going if you feel the
juices flowing?
</p>
<p>
Some writers push on to reach their daily sessions, but this can be
counterproductive. When you‚Äôve lost your mojo, there‚Äôs no point trying
to force it. Sometimes, you just can‚Äôt meet your target.
</p>
<p>
Other writers may choose to end their writing session when they finish
the chapter or a scene. The fact of completing something, even if you
haven‚Äôt hit your session target, can be very satisfying.
</p>
<p>
However, some other writers like to end their writing session in the
middle of a scene, paragraph, or even a sentence.
<a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1935/10/1/monologue-to-the-maestro" target="_blank">Ernest
Hemingway said</a>, ‚ÄúThe best way is always to stop when you are going
good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day ‚Ä¶
you will never be stuck.‚Äú
</p>
<p>
And consider Anthony Trollope, who, if he finished a novel by 8:30 would
immediately start writing the next one. This is probably not practical
for most writers who need to work on multiple drafts to finish a novel.
Trollope was immensely prolific, and, in his time, novels were not
revised extensively, so he could easily move on to the next one at will.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs up to each writer to determine how much they should write and when
they should end. Many factors influence this decision: how much time you
have to write, how many days you can write, and what your writing goals
are. It's a good idea to develop a rhythm, and you can take advantage of
Scrivener‚Äôs features to set session and project targets to help you meet
your goals.

<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-steps-for-developing-great-characters">memorable
characters</a> is the first step in writing engaging short stories. As
the reader, we are choosing to spend a brief period of time inside the
head of the main character, going on an emotional ride with them that
may bring us a new perspective on life, like the resilience of human
nature. Although the wants and needs of your protagonist drive the plot
forward, all the characters, including your antagonist and any
supporting characters, should each leave a lasting impression.</span>
