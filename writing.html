The South by Southwest Conference &amp; Festival, held annually in
Austin, TX, crackles with a creative energy no other film festival can
match, offering screenwriters lessons from its wildly diverse
slate.<br><br>While studios were certainly present at the fest, with
big-name sequels like <em>The Accountant 2</em> and <em>Another Simple
Favor</em> nabbing splashy premieres, it also feels like a remarkably
scrappy place. You’ll find swing-for-the-fences high-concept projects
sharing space with adult animation series, self-funded comedy pilots
paired with deeply personal autobiographical stories, and concepts so
audaciously weird they shouldn’t work but somehow do.<br><br>I saw as
many features, shorts, and pilots as possible and spoke with writers
from projects of all sizes and genres, putting together some of this
year’s common themes and hearing what they’ve learned.

<p>John welcomes back Christina Hodson (The Flash, Bumblebee) to ask,
how do you to construct a great action sequence? Using examples from
three different movies, they discuss what good action looks like on the
page, how to keep your reader from getting bored or confused, and why
production can sometimes blow your plans to smithereens. […] The post

This may sound like an odd question, but are algorithms starting to take
over the narrative func­tion that psi powers once served in SF? The idea
of preventing crimes by pre-emptively arresting supposed perpetrators
has been around at least since Orwell’s notion of ‘‘thoughtcrimes,’’ and
in the 1950s this became the province of psioni­cally gifted folks like

<p>
The premier episode of the fourth and final season of <em>The Righteous
Gemstones</em> has a lot of people talking. <br><br>The episode, titled
simply “Prelude,” doesn’t feature any of the series’ regular cast. It
also takes place during the Civil War, and not during the show’s
present-day setting, as it follows an ancestor of the Gemstone family:
Elijah Gemstone (played wonderfully by Bradley Cooper).<br><br>One of
the main reasons the episode has created such a buzz is how much of a
departure it is from the rest of the show. Cowritten and directed by
<em>Gemstones</em> creator and star Danny McBride, “Prelude” is highly
cinematic and carries far more gravitas than a typical episode of the
comedic series. <br><br>There <em>have </em>been tonal shifts previously
in <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, largely due to the acting chops of
John Goodman (playing family patriarch Eli Gemstone), as well as the
occasional dramatic-leaning turn. The same can be said for McBride’s
other HBO series <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> and <em>Vice
Principals</em>. Whether it’s a shocking burst of violence or a
cathartic moment set to an evocative piece of music, McBride’s comedy —
alongside frequent collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green — has
always been offset by not only a cinematic flair, but also a willingness
to embrace different tones.
