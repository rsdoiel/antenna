Most of us are creatures of habits, and one of the biggest reasons for
this is comfort. <br><br>It’s comforting to know you’ve got a certain
activity or way of doing something that’s a fixture of your life. In a
similar fashion, many screenwriters get comfortable writing in a certain
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">film
genre</a> or in a specific style, and stick with it. However, this
mindset is not always
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-tips-for-a-winning-screenwriting-strategy">the
best strategy</a> for screenwriting success. In fact, learning to <span
style="font-weight: bold;">write outside your comfort zone</span> might
be a smart thing to do for several reasons I’ll explain below, along
with tips on how to learn to do it.

sometimes losing sight of her,
