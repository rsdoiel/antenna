<p>
In two novels nearly 20 years apart, Jack McDe¬≠vitt offered a platter
full of puzzles and oddities. <strong>Ancient Shores </strong>(1996) and

artifacts and buildings on what, 12,000 years earlier, had been the
shore of the inland sea of Lake Agassiz in North Dakota:

<h2 id="how-to-customize-the-scrivener-toolbar">How to Customize the
Scrivener Toolbar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-17, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Scrivener has lots of features, and many of them are available by clicking a menu and choosing a menu item, or by using a keyboard shortcut if you know what it is. But you can also trigger many of Scrivener&amp;#39;s features by clicking buttons in the toolbar, the bar with buttons at the top of the window. By default, Scrivener displays a set of toolbar buttons, but you can customize the toolbar to remove features you don&amp;#39;t use and add buttons for features you use often. Here&amp;#39;s how.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Why use the toolbar?</p>
<p>
All apps today, on Mac and Windows, offer multiple ways to access and
trigger features. You can click menus, press keyboard shortcuts, and
click toolbar buttons. The quickest way to access many features is to
use keyboard shortcuts. You may be familiar with some of the most common
ones, such as Command-C (Mac) or Ctrl+C (Windows) to copy something,
Command-X / Ctrl+X to cut something, and Command-V / Ctrl+V to paste.
</p>
<p>
You can save a lot of time
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/5-scrivener-productivity-tips-keyboard-shortcuts" target="_blank">by
learning additional keyboard shortcuts for the features you use
often</a>, but you can't remember them all.
</p>
<p>
Clicking menus and menu items is great because you can access all of an
app's features, but there are so many that you might forget where the
ones you need are located.
</p>
<p>
If the features you use often have buttons in the toolbar, this can be
an easy way to access them, because there are visual reminders of what
these buttons do. And you can customize the toolbar on both Mac and
Windows versions of Scrivener, to display the buttons for the features
you use often.
</p>
<p>
You may want to add buttons for Targets, Annotations, or Comments, or a
Focus menu (the v to the right of the button indicates that it opens a
menu), to enable Focus mode by line, sentence, or paragraph.
</p>
<p>
Note that not all features offer toolbar buttons.
</p>
<p>How to customize the toolbar on Mac</p>
<p>
To customize the toolbar in Scrivener on macOS, right-click anywhere on
the toolbar and choose Customize Toolbar, or choose View &gt; Customize
Toolbar.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/toolbar1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;When you do this, a dialog displays showing all the available toolbar buttons for Scrivener.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/toolbar2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are dozens of toolbar buttons; to add any to your toolbar, just drag a button to the location where you want it to stay. To remove any toolbar buttons, drag them off of the toolbar onto the desktop. You can also rearrange toolbar buttons by dragging them around on the toolbar. When you have finished, click Done to save your changes.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
You can use Spaces and Flexible Spaces to separate groups of buttons;
just drag them to the toolbar. You can see spaces and how they work in
the default button set at the bottom of the dialog.
</p>
<p>
Note that, at any time, you can drag the default set of toolbar buttons,
which displays at the bottom of the Customize Toolbar dialogue, to the
toolbar to reset these buttons to the default. You can also remove any
button, at any time, by pressing the Command key and dragging the button
to the desktop.
</p>
<p>
One other option, which you can see both in the first screenshot when
right-clicking the toolbar, and in the Customize Toolbar dialogue, is to
display icons with text, icons only, or text only. If you display icons
only, you'll be able to fit more buttons on the toolbar. And if you have
too many buttons to display on the toolbar, click the &gt;&gt; button at
the right of the toolbar to display a menu with additional buttons.
</p>
<p>
You can also tweak what's visible in the Formatting Bar; see
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-use-the-format-bar-header-bar-and-ruler-in-scriveners-editor" target="_blank">this
article to learn how to change its options</a>.
</p>
<p>How to customize the toolbar on Windows</p>
<p>
To customize the toolbar on Windows, choose View &gt; Customize
Toolbars. On Windows, you have access to two toolbars: the Main Toolbar,
the one with buttons, and the Format Toolbar, the one where you can
choose styles, fonts, and other formatting options. See
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-use-the-format-bar-header-bar-and-ruler-in-scriveners-editor" target="_blank">this
article to learn how to work with the Format Bar</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/toolbar3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;To customize the Main Toolbar on Windows, find a button you want to add in the list on the left. Click it to select it, then click the &amp;rarr; button. To move it around among the current buttons, use the &amp;darr; and &amp;uarr; buttons. To remove a button, select it and click the &amp;nbsp; &amp;larr; button. When you&amp;#39;ve finished making changes, click Apply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
On Windows, you can also add Separators and Gaps. Separators are
vertical lines that help you see the difference between groups of
buttons, and Gaps are spaces that allow you to separate buttons or
groups of buttons. You can see that there are already a number of
Separators and Gaps in the default button set, so you can see how they
display in the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
If you have too many buttons to display on the toolbar, click the
&gt;&gt; button at the right of the toolbar to display a menu with
additional buttons.
</p>
<p>
If you want to reset the toolbar buttons to the default set, click
Restore Defaults at the bottom of the dialog.
</p>
<p>
Have a look at the toolbar and see if there are any buttons that you
don't use and any features that would be practical to have in the
toolbar for one-click access. It only takes a few seconds to customize
the toolbar, and it can save you a lot of time.

<span>Any comedic writer will tell you there‚Äôs nothing more satisfying
than a well-placed joke. That‚Äôs probably because writing comedy isn‚Äôt
easy. Just like any other screenplay, a comedic screenplay has to have a
well-developed story and three-dimensional characters while making
audiences laugh. You have to be funny while trying not to be funny while
remaining true to the situation at hand and the character‚Äôs personality.
This is no easy feat.¬†</span>
