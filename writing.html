I went into Jared Pechaček’s debut novel, <strong>The West

a cool cover. Pechaček’s been a delightful person to follow on various

<h2 id="planning-and-pantsing-with-scrivener">Planning and Pantsing with
Scrivener</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            Planning and Pantsing with Scrivener</code></pre>
<p>
Scrivener is designed so all writers - whether they plan in advance or
write by the seat of their pants - can write a novel in a flexible
environment.
</p>
<p>
Writing a novel takes a long time. Some authors like to prepare in
advance, before they start writing, by outlining, determining the
structure of their novel, making notes about characters and settings,
and getting all the elements of their story ready before writing. Others
create a new Scrivener project and just start writing. They develop
characters as they write, they come up with plot points and twists as
they progress, and they let their instincts guide them.
</p>
<p>
Neither process is wrong; it depends on the writer. But with Scrivener,
you can do both. You can plan your novel in advance, or you can be a
<em>pantser</em>, someone who writes “by the seat of their pants,” just
winging it. Here’s how.
</p>
<p>Planning with Scrivener</p>
<p>
Planning a novel can be complicated. You have to come up with a plot,
characters, and setting, and you need to think about how the novel will
be structured. You may want to work with a story structure model, such
as the hero’s journey or Save the Cat! (See
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/five-books-to-help-understand-story-structure" target="_blank">Five
Books to Help Understand Story Structure</a> to discover some story
structure ideas.) Or you may have your own system for structuring your
work.
</p>
<p>
To think of this process, you might look at how some people cook. You
start with a recipe, and you prepare all your ingredients in advance.
You chop and dice, puree and squeeze, and put everything in bowls or on
plates. You get all your herbs and spices ready, along with other
ingredients, such as butter, oil, and wine. Then you start cooking. All
you have to do is add the ingredients at the right time and follow the
recipe.
</p>
<p>
Of course, cooking is very different from writing, and recipes are
important to ensure that your food is cooked correctly. Preparing
everything in advance means that at each step of the recipe, you can add
or cook the ingredients without taking any extra time. But it doesn’t
mean that you don’t make changes or improvise as you progress with your
dish.
</p>
<p>
With Scrivener, you can do all this preparatory work before you start
writing. You can create an outline and view it in the
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank">Outliner</a>,
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard" target="_blank">Corkboard</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/outlining-with-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">Binder</a>.
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner" target="_blank">The
way these three tools integrate</a> means that you can find the ideal
way to see how your project is built.
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/outliner-synopses.png" />
</figure>
<p>
You can prepare your characters using
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-characters-in-scrivener" target="_blank">Scrivener’s
Character sketches</a>. You can make extensive notes about each
character that you can refer back to when needed. And
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-manage-places-and-setting-sketches-in-scrivener" target="_blank">you
can use Setting Sketches</a> to do the same for your settings. You can
even add photos to both of these types of files, if you have ideas of
what your characters look like, or if you’re using real settings and
want images to remind you what they look like.
</p>
<p>
Once you’ve done all this, you can start writing, using the Binder,
which reflects your outline, to move ahead with your story.
</p>
<p>Pantsing with Scrivener</p>
<p>
Not everybody outlines, and
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/should-you-outline-your-novel-or-not" target="_blank">some
people even think you should never outline</a>. Lee Child highlights the
importance of character and voice, and says, “Ditch the plan. Ditch the
plot. Just start writing.”
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, an outline can box you in. Peter Robinson, author of the
Inspector Banks mystery series, told me, in
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/write-now-with-scrivener-podcast-episode-1-peter-robinson-author-of-the-alan-banks-crime-fiction-series" target="_blank">the
first episode of the Write Now with Scrivener Podcast</a>, “I don’t do a
plan; I’m not an outliner. I do make a lot of notes of possible scenes.
I usually begin in my mind with a very visual opening scene. I rarely if
ever know what the ending’s going to be or how I’m going to get there.”
</p>
<p>
If you write that way, Scrivener is the ideal tool. You can
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-folders-and-texts-to-power-up-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">use
the Binder to create files and folders</a> for scenes and chapters, and,
as you progress, you may not even write in a linear manner. As you write
more scenes, you may want to jump ahead or back and rearrange what
happens in your novel;
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/5-ways-to-move-and-rearrange-files-and-folders-in-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">Scrivener’s
Binder is designed for that</a>. Sometimes you may want to split or
merge chapters, if chapters are too long or too short, and
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/merge-and-split-files-in-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">these
are features that Scrivener offers</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-images/move-binder1.png" width="300" />
</figure>
<p>
As you progress, pantsing your way to the denouement of your novel, you
can take advantage of the Outliner and Corkboard, to view a map of where
you’ve been. This allows you to get a bird’s-eye view of your novel as
it progresses, even if you don’t use these tools to plan your structure.
But when you get far enough ahead in your story, you may want to mark
out a few scenes that you now know you need to write, and you can use
these tools to prepare the ground.
</p>
<p>
Scrivener offers both planners and pantsers the tools they need to write
a novel. The flexibility of Scrivener’s three main elements - the
Binder, Outliner, and Corkboard - allow any writer to work the way they
prefer, and character and setting sketches provide repositories for
additional information. In addition,
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-scriveners-research-folder-to-store-information-about-your-project" target="_blank">the
Research folder</a>, which is in the Binder, is a place where both
planners and pantsers can store information about their novels, which
could be photos, PDFs, web pages, and even audio and video files. All
this background information that authors may use in their pre-writing
research is easily accessible and searchable within Scrivener.
</p>
<p>
So plan ahead or pants; it’s up to you. Scrivener has tools for every
writing method.

If you believe the advertising campaigns from Meta and Apple (especially
Apple’s slick ads for its Vision Pro), virtual and physical realities
will harmoniously exist together. It’s a utopian attitude that conflicts
with the often dystopian vision pre­sented by the genre, where VR, with
its immersive pods and body suits, is a means of escaping the harsh
realities
