      <h1>No Worries if Not</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>John and Craig circle back on all the euphemisms and stock phrases that float around Hollywood. Using some favorite examples, they attempt to define and demystify the current industry-speak so everyone is looped in when we come up for air after the holidays. We also wrap-up 2025 with a look at Scriptnotes by the numbers, […]</p>

      <p>This was a tough year. American democracy strained under authoritarian assault. Here in Los Angeles, friends lost homes in the fires while many in the industry struggled to find work.

      <p>In a Christmas crossover event, John and Craig join Meg LeFauve (Inside Out) and Lorien McKenna (Tab Time) on their podcast, The Screenwriting Life. We talk about why rigid structure can miss the point, how theme emerges from character, what fear and denial really look like on the page, and how writers can survive rejection […]</p>

      <p>John and Craig welcome back screenwriter Mike Makowsky (Death by Lightning, Bad Education) to ask, how do you dramatize a historical event that no one’s heard of?

      <p>
      <p>In the news recently were several reports about the Supreme Court deferring a decision on whether President Trump can fire Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights. We have previously blogged about the origins of this lawsuit and why the lawsuit matters for authors, but the rapid developments over the past few months warrant an update. We explain below where the case now stands—and how it connects to two major Supreme Court cases that may shape the future of the US Copyright Office.</p>
