of a Unicorn Review: A Wickedly Clever Monster Movie? by Erin
Underwood</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-28, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>Death of a Unicorn</strong> blends fantasy and horror with a
weird monster movie twist, but is it enough to refresh a somewhat stale
fantasy trope? Written and directed by Alex Scharfman, this A24’s
genre-crossing film stars Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega as the
father-daughter duo of the story along with a talented cast of
supporting actors including Richard E. Grant, Téa Leoni, and Steve Park
among others. A24 is known

International intrigue. Secret agencies. Clandestine operations. Who
doesn’t love a spy movie? From big action blockbusters like the
<em>Mission: Impossible</em> and the <em>Bourne Identity</em> series, to
smaller scale arthouse films like The <em>Imitation Game</em> and even
family movies like <em>Spy Kids</em>, there always seems to be a market
for the spy movie, and they often attract top talent.

“I didn’t really set out to make Cordelia (Uzo Aduba) quirky. I just
wanted to make her distinctive. I just really thought about who I wanted
her to be and how I thought [birdwatching] would be an interesting way
for her to approach her job. And the very first thing that came to me
was just her use of silence and her ability to just be comfortable in
situations that might make other people uncomfortable. And it’s a
quality that I’ve seen in certain people that I’ve always admired and
been fascinated with because there’s nobody quite like Cordelia, but
I’ve seen glimmers of it,” says <em>The Residence</em> creator and
showrunner Paul William Davies about creating his lead character
Cordelia, a detective who uses her birdwatching skills as framework for
solving cases. <br><br>On today’s episode, we talk with Paul William
Davies about <em>The Residence</em>, the new Shondaland show streaming
on Netflix. Set behind closed doors at the White House, <em>The
Residence</em> follows an offbeat detective, Cordelia Cupp (Aduba), as
she investigates the murder of a lead member of the White House staff.
Davies says the idea came to him watching a hearing on C-SPAN that went
into details of the White House’s layout. But the show is more than just
a game of Clue set in the upstairs-downstairs world of 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave. The show goes deep into character and offers plenty of laughs along
the way. <br><br>Davies talks about what he’s learned working with
television revolutionary Shonda Rhimes, the intense work that goes into
structuring a murder mystery, and shares his advice for anyone who may
be working on their own TV mystery.  <br><br>“I think it’s really
important that you think about what the environment is that you’re
having this murder mystery in, and making the motive something that
feels like it’s related to the world that you’re working in. In most
murder mysteries, the murderer is doing it for money or for love or
lust. And that’s probably in 98% of the ones that you read. And that’s
fine… But I think really giving a lot of thought to, what is the motive
here? How do I keep it organic to this world and these people, as
opposed to it just being grafted onto it, which I think sometimes does
happen. Make sure that the killer is doing something that feels like
it’s part of that world for a reason that is related to that world,” he
says. <br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast. <br><br>

Dan Erickson is currently one of the hottest TV writers in the business.
He created, co-writes, co-produces and serves as showrunner for the
popular and acclaimed Apple TV+ series Severance (starring Adam Scott
and executive produced and primarily directed by Ben
Stiller).<br><br>The second season of the sci-fi psychological thriller
met with widespread praise and after its cliffhanger season finale, a
third season has been announced. The series’ main plot follows Mark
Scout (Adam Scott), who is part of a “severance” program in which his
workplace memories are separated from his out-of-work memories,
essentially creating two distinct identities: an “innie” whose existence
revolves around his life at his corporate workplace, and an “outie”
whose personal life is untouched — at least initially — by the drama and
intrigue that’s occurring at the nebulous Lumon Industries. As the
series progresses, Mark’s two worlds begin to collide, throwing him into
an existential crisis as he attempts to find out more about the company
he works for, and discover which version of him is his truer
self.<br><br>This
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/your-elevator-pitch-just-got-shorter">high
concept</a> came solely from Dan Erickson and
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/tv-pilot-writing-building-skeleton-show">a
pilot</a> he wrote a decade ago.

<p>
To the average person, screenwriting and playwriting may seem like
interchangeable terms, with the only difference in their eyes being that
a screenwriter is writing for the movies while a playwright is writing
for the stage. The truth is that the two mediums are vastly different in
so many ways, despite sharing the core purpose of telling compelling
stories with a cast of characters.<br><br>While each shares that same
goal, the method, techniques, and format used to do so is very
different.<br><br>Here we’ll delve into those differences — while also
shedding some light on their similarities as well — all with the hope of
giving you an easy-to-decipher set of guidelines to follow as you
explore whether you want to write a screenplay, stage play, or both.

divided. Some flee the Solar System in generation ships, and some remain
and build a “Mask,” a structure that hides the System from aliens by
creating the appearance of rubble. “Classic Stephen Baxter… driven by
big ideas.” [Alexandra Pierce]

In a career that has ranged from Dickian SF to rural horror, one
scenario that seems to fascinate Daryl Gregory is bringing a small but
diverse group of characters together under stress, whether survivors of

industry insider reading your script can and will pass near-instant
judgment on your screenplay, your story, and your
writing. <br><br>Because of this undeniable truth, you want to make sure

suggest the Godwhale may be alive after all, Anna Maria jacks into the
submersible in an attempt to communicate and ask for help getting home.
