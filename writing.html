Summer may have traditionally been your time to take a mental break—and
we’re not discounting the value of giving your creativity some time off
to recharge. But reframing the game during these hot months could
actually boost your productivity in the long run. Why not take advantage
of the long days and shifted routines? Here are 5 ways to inspire your
summer screenwriting habits.

Updated NIH and Publisher Guidance: What Authors Need to Know about
NIH’s Public Access Policy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>In June, we published an FAQ for authors and librarians to give some
guidance on how they might respond to NIH’s accelerated implementation
of its public access plan, which requires immediate availability of
sponsored research articles upon publication. Our FAQ from June is still
good advice, but since then both the NIH and several publishers have
updated their guidance and so we are giving some additional information
about the latest here.</p>

World by Sayaka Murata: Review by Ian Mond</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>Vanishing World</strong>, Sayaka Murata (Grove Press
978-0-80216-466-7, $28.00, 240pp, hc) April 2025.
</p>
<p>
Published in Japan in 2015, Sayaka Murata’s <strong>Vanishing World
</strong>is the earliest of her novels (so far) to be translated into
English (by the always-excellent Ginny Tapley Takemori). I note this
because, conceptually, it feels to me like <strong>Vanish­ing World
</strong>should come after – not before – both <strong>Convenience Store
Woman </strong>and <strong>Earthlings</strong>.

<p>
When filmmaker Eric D. Howell’s screenplay <em>The Revolution of
Cassandra</em> placed in the top three of the
<a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">Final
Draft Big Break Screenwriting Contest</a> in 2018, he was excited to be
recognized by the people behind the software he relied on every day. But
what he didn’t know was that recognition would send him on a journey
that would take his story beyond the screen and into the dazzling
illustrated world of graphic novels. His story about belief, activism,
and the power of sisterhood is now being published as a three-part comic
book series. For Howell, this pivot wasn’t just about finding a new
platform for <em>The Revolution of Cassandra</em>, it was about staying
true to a story he believed the world needed to hear.

1996 was a fascinating year for independent and low-budget filmmaking.
Visionary writer/directors were making big splashes in arthouse cinemas,
film festivals and even major theaters. Filmmakers like Robert
Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Wes Anderson had made
names for themselves with groundbreaking movies, and leveraged their
success into studio-backed films.

Even though they’ve been around for centuries in complex ways, djinns
have in the past few decades become a sometimes problematical comic pop
culture staple, from a bunch of Disney films to (my current favorite)
the hilari­ously disaffected godlets of Saad Z. Hossain. In Auston
Habershaw’s <strong>If Wishes Were Retail</strong>, a newly liberated
djinn even

“Vampires hold incredible destructive power, and so we’re very drawn to
them, sort of like moths to a candle, right? I think that’s sort of
eternal, and that’s the reason every culture, pretty much around the
globe has some version of the vampire because it represents that very
human conflict of what we desire which is so in tune with and aligned to
things that can also destroy us. That just feels very honest and
eternal, so I don’t think [vampires] will ever go away. I think they
will be an eternal part of our mythologies,” says writer/director
Natasha Kermani, about the everlasting appeal of vampires on
film. <br><br>On today’s episode, we chat with Natasha Kermani about her
new movie <em>Abraham’s Boys</em> that extends the world of Dracula into
a psychological family drama with its own chills and thrills. The movie
centers on brothers Max (Brady Hepner) and Rudy (Judah Mackey) Van
Helsing, who have spent their lives under the strict rule of their
father, Abraham Van Helsing (Titus Welliver). Unaware of their father’s
dark past as a vampire hunter, they struggle to understand his paranoia
and increasingly erratic behavior. But when the brothers begin to
uncover the violent truths behind Abraham’s history with Dracula, their
world unravels, forcing them to confront the terrifying family
legacy.<br><br>Kermani talks about adapting the Joe Hill short story of
the same name, shares tips for structuring a short story into a feature
film, and ways a writer can bring a classic monster story like Dracula
into a modern setting.  <br><br>“I think it’s about examining our world
through an eternal lens of these mythologies that don’t change. Power
dynamics. Authority. Submission. These are eternal. So the question is,
if you take that structure, and apply it to our world, how do things
fall into place? And when you can start to look at the world around us
through that lens, I think you start to get really interesting, truthful
stories because you’re not trying to come up with a new structure, or a
new classic. You are obeying the laws of how our brains work and how our
stories work.”<br><br>“I think it’s a question of, ‘What are the things
that you desire, but also fear? What are you drawn to, like a moth to
flame?’ For me, with <em>Abraham’s Boys</em>, it’s that we’re so drawn
to the idea of someone coming to you and saying, ‘I know what the
monsters are, I know what the heroes are. Follow me and you’ll be safe.’
That’s very dangerous,” says Kermani. <br><br>To hear more, listen to

It’s easy to become overwhelmed as an up and coming screenwriter. You
see where you want to be. You’re hopefully doing the research and honing
your craft to get there. But you also see that the odds are stacked
against you — and the competition is plenty. <br><br>Here are some ways
you can embrace where you are right now in your screenwriting journey,
and understand that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where you
are right now is exactly where you are meant to be</span>.

<p>
Updated 7/14/25: According to a post from SFWA, Must Read Books has
removed some of the troubling contractual language. SFWA was considering
de-listing Analog from their Market report, but,
</p>
<p>
 on July 14, <strong>we received news that Must Read will be removing
moral rights clauses from their boilerplate contracts. </strong>
</p>
<p>
We are optimistic that this will be the change we want to see, and we
look forward to reviewing the updated language.

There are original stories, there are unique sto­ries, and then there are

painting left behind, helium balloons, a sitcom – and somehow turn it
into a gem. If you can do that, you’ll end up with something akin to a
Bertino story, and <strong>Exit </strong>
