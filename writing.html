“For me, I don’t know how you could not make [a script] personal. I
think drama allows you to hide how personal it is. I think that’s kind
of what I like about writing in the genre space. On the outside looking
in, it just looks like a big action movie. It doesn’t look like a
personal story. But there are personal elements like my mom was a
working mom as well. And so that’s why you have Kyra in the movie who
has to come back to her son because she’s been working to protect him.
That’s a very personal thing… but you would never assume that it’s a
personal story because it’s wrapped up in the action,” says Leon Chills,
co-writer of the new film <em>Shadow Force</em>, about writing action
from a very personal point of view. <br><br>On today’s episode, we talk
with director/co-writer Joe Carnahan and co-writer Leon Chills about the
new action flick <em>Shadow Force</em> that puts a family at the center
of the action. With a bounty on their heads, Kyra (Kerry Washington) and
Isaac (Omar Sy) must go on the run with their young son (Jahleel Kamara)
to avoid their former employer, a unit of shadow ops that has been sent
to kill them.<br><br>Carnahan and Chills talk about the challenges of
writing action set pieces and the power of giving the story emotional
weight. We also discuss trying to push the boundaries of the action
genre to invent set pieces that are fresh and inventive, and writing
action scenes on the page that are compact and concise. <br><br>“As an
older writer and doing it as long as I have, I’ll tell screenwriters, if
I see four or five lines of scene description, I’m telling you, do it in
two. Do it in one. Let people spend 40 minutes reading your script. No
more. You know what I mean? Get through it with that kind of economy. If
you’ve ever read M. Night Shyamalan’s <em>Sixth Sense</em> script – it’s
an absolute masterclass in how to do that. Just so sparse and beautiful
and pitch perfect the way that things are written,” says
Carnahan. <br><br>To learn more about action writing and hear more
advice, listen to the podcast.

<em>Friendship</em> writer/director
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2440581/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_1">Andrew
DeYoung</a> has built one of the most impressive comedy resumes in
today’s film and TV world. <br><br>The Emmy-nominated creator recently
had his feature debut with <span
style="font-style: italic;">Friendship</span> at the 2024 Toronto
International Film Festival, followed by successful screenings at this
year’s
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/lessons-for-screenwriters-from-sxsw">SXSW</a>.
His previous directing credits include cult favorites like <span
style="font-style: italic;">Pen15, Our Flag Means Death, Shrill</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Other
Two</span>.<br><br>DeYoung’s path began at Cal State Northridge’s
screenwriting program, before he found himself amid the expanding
alternative comedy scene of the mid-2000s. <br><br>Between overnight
editing shifts, he created music videos and short films that gained
attention online, with six becoming eventual Vimeo Staff Picks. His
digital series 555, co-created with Kate Berlant and John Early, earned
a Gotham Award nomination, establishing him as a filmmaker who could
flit between traditional and experimental approaches to story.<br><br>In
<span style="font-style: italic;">Friendship</span>,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4200503/?ref_=tt_cst_t_1">Tim
Robinson</a> plays Craig, a desperately lonely guy whose life is turned
upside down when he meets Austin
(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0748620/?ref_=tt_cst_t_2">Paul
Rudd</a>), an effortlessly cool meteorologist who just moved in next
door. Craig, mimicking Austin as best he can, somehow manages to push
everyone in his life away even further—including his new friend. His
attempts to recover the relationship end up in unpredictable
disaster. <br><br>It is a weird and uncomfortable but at once deeply
relatable story, and Final Draft was excited to jump on Zoom to chat
with DeYoung about how he wrote the screenplay.

There’s nothing like a filmmaker who refuses to fit neatly into
Hollywood’s boxes. <br><br>Writer/director
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185848/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_1_nm_7_in_0_q_eli%2520craig">Eli
Craig</a> has made a career of blending horror and humor in ways that
studios often struggle to categorize, creating memorable films that
dance between bloody scares and surprising comedy.<br><br>Known for his
breakout cult hit
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465522/?ref_=nm_knf_c_1"><span
style="font-style: italic;">Tucker and Dale vs. Evil</span></a>, Craig
told us he approaches each project with clear thematic guardrails while
leaving room for spontaneity. His latest, <span
style="font-style: italic;">Clown in a Cornfield</span>, adapts Adam
Cesare’s novel with Craig’s unique sensibility, keeping the horror
deadly serious while finding humor in the characters. The film was a hit
at SXSW this year and is set to terrify audiences with its new clown
slasher, Friendo.<br><br>During our conversation ahead of the film’s
wide release, Craig shared insights into his creative approach, from
establishing clear themes to handling studio notes, and offered advice
for aspiring filmmakers trying to break through.<br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following conversation
has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: In your director statement for
the film, you mentioned needing a clear theme, a backbone to hang the
writing on. So I’m interested in how that manifests in your
approach. </span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eli
Craig</span>: Well, ultimately, in writing this one, I didn’t start with
a blank page, but when you’re starting with “fade in,” for me, I’m
looking for guardrails. What’s going to focus the story? Where are the
limitations and what are the rules for this story? Because sometimes it
can feel overwhelming. <br><br>I’m very spontaneous and kind of
capricious and creative, so I’ll always be throwing stuff out and trying
something else. But if there’s no clear guideline or rule or guardrail
for me, I can go off the rails. So my process is like, what is the
skeleton? What are the character arcs and what is the theme? And once I
really have honed in on what the theme is, and probably definitely
where’s this character going and where are they going to end up? Then I
could start honing it in. <br><br>Over time there’s maybe a joke that’s
like, okay, this is kind of funny, but it doesn’t relate to the theme.
How can I bring this funny moment back and make it more a part of the
theme and a part of the story? And so it’s a constant revision of just
trying to clarify what I’m trying to say.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: I imagine that’s a challenge for
a lot of writers who are aware of that fact, but don’t know how to do it
without making it feel really ham-fisted.</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Eli Craig</span>: I think that it can be
ham-fisted, and sometimes something lives on the page for too long and
you know you have to get rid of it, especially as you’re shooting, and
you’re like, “God, okay, I have to take some time and rework this
scene.” <br><br>And there were days, because this was a rush—I didn’t
know the film was going to get made. We got independent financing, and
once it was time to go, we had to go because the corn was going to be
gone. It was moving toward harvest season. So we had very little time.
There were times I would wake up. We were often on a night shoot
schedule. So I would wake up at 3:00 p.m. for two hours, rework the
scene, and then send it to everybody on set, and then show up on set at
6:00 p.m. and start filming. <br><br>But yeah, you can leave something
awkward in there, but just know you have to get back to it. Hopefully
not the day of production. I wouldn’t advise that, but know you have to
get back to it and rework it and be constantly reworking.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: So was a lot of that on the day
then, or were you reworking ahead of time with [co-writer] Carter
Blanchard, or what did that process like?</span><br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Eli Craig</span>: Carter and I wrote
separately. So Carter, he did a first draft of the script based on Adam
Cesare’s book, and there was a lot of really fun stuff in it. And I love
Carter’s brevity as a writer, and he’s quite good at writing action,
which is really fun for me to read, a script that just moves. <br><br>So
I was reading the action and some of the horror beats all there, and I
thought, “Well, the thing I could really bring to this is a tonal
balance of humor, adding a little bit of absurd humor to this.” It’s
called <span style="font-style: italic;">Clown in a Cornfield</span>. I
don’t think we’re writing <span style="font-style: italic;">Citizen
Kane</span> here. We’re trying to do something fun and a little bit
cheeky, but I thought I wanted to clarify the theme, bring a little more
humor and bring really kind of cinematic, fun kills because that I
learned from <span style="font-style: italic;">Tucker and Dale
vs. Evil</span>. Let’s make the kills part of the real fun of the
movie. <br><br>Yeah, I would say that as far as rewriting on the day,
that’s sort of a last chance thing, but that’s more in director mode
where you’re like, “How is the scene going to work? What’s the
blocking?” And you’re changing it all the way through blocking the
rehearsal into even shooting. “What if you say this line
instead?” <br><br>That’s why I don’t even know how you direct something
without being a writer/director, because you have to own the material
and hear it in your head and be revising it just all the time.<br>

On today’s episode, we speak to writer Brandon Osterman, whose short
script <em>The Naughty List</em> won last year’s Final Draft Big Break
Short Screenplay Category. As part of his prize package, he received a
consultation with Sav Rodgers, Marketing Manager for Seed&amp;Spark, the
film industry’s most popular crowdfunding platform. Sav joins the
conversation to tell us exactly what crowdfunding is and help all
writers understand that funding for their project is possible to
achieve. <br><br>“Who is your audience? At Seed&amp;Spark, we always say
that great crowdfunding is audience building first and fundraising
second. While there is definitely a fundraising need, finding your
audience is invaluable… Something that I always tell prospective
crowdfunders is you already have the tools you need to do this. You know
how to tell a story. You’re here because you’re a storyteller. You know
how to invite people in. You already know how to talk about yourself
persuasively,” says Sav Rodgers. <br><br>Osterman also shares his
journey creating his award-winning short script and gives advice to
writers who are thinking of creating their own short film
project.<br><br>“I don’t think there’s been a better time to be making
short format content than right now. The demand for it seems to be
expanding every time I turn around. I think if that’s something that
you’re interested in, go after it. You know, I think there are more
opportunities to distribute that form of content than there have ever
been. I think we’ve got a generation now that’s grown up with TikTok and
social media and much shorter, digestible content that, whether it’s
conditioning or just sort of lowering of attention spans, I think more
people are more tuned into short form content than they have ever been
before. It’s a really, really exciting time to be making shorts,” says
Osterman. <br><br>To hear more about the short filmmaking process and
crowdfunding, listen to the podcast.

Screenwriter
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1151425/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_wr_1">Alan
Trezza</a> discovered the concept for his new horror film <span
style="font-style: italic;">Rosario</span> during the pandemic. The
project went from concept to completed script in just four weeks in a
creative sprint fueled by 5 a.m. wake-ups and late-night writing
sessions.<br><br>It all started when he wondered what it would be like
to have to spend a night with a loved one’s body. This idea evolved
further when Trezza, the son of an immigrant, began examining cultural
assimilation in America.<br><br>These themes coalesced for <span
style="font-style: italic;">Rosario</span>, a claustrophobic horror film
starring
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014089/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_cst_1">Emeraude
Toubia</a> as a Wall Street stockbroker who returns to her deceased
grandmother’s apartment during a snowstorm. While waiting for EMTs to
collect the body, she uncovers a hidden chamber filled with occult
artifacts tied to dark rituals. It becomes a race against the sunrise
for her to break an ancestral curse.<br><br>We spoke with Trezza about
how he finished the screenplay so quickly, keeping the second act
interesting, the importance of plant-and-payoff for horror, and more.
Explore his process with us.<br><br><span

“One of the things we talked a lot about in the room is that very rarely
do people set about their day saying, ‘Okay, I’m going to go do some
evil.’ But for most people, we’re all sort of the leads in our own
stories and we’re all crafting the narrative of who we want the world to
see us as. And we do start to believe that. You tell yourself these
stories about yourself that you want to be true and you move through the
world and you make decisions based on that narrative. And I think that
one of the things that as writers, we really try to do is get into the
shoes and the heads of the characters that we’re writing and really try
to break down why they’re doing what they’re doing and make it feel as
real and true as possible. The things that these characters believe – or
convince themselves that they believe – have to feel really real and
grounded to us,” says Katie Robbins, creator and co-showrunner of<em>
Good American Family</em>, on writing flawed characters who prefer to
live in fantasy, not reality. <br><br>On today’s episode of Write On, we
speak to Katie Robbins (creator) and Sarah Sutherland, co-showrunners on
the explosive limited series, <em>Good American Family</em>. The show
tells the story of a midwestern couple who adopts what they believe is
little girl with dwarfism. Soon they are in the midst of a battle fought
in the tabloids, the courtroom and ultimately their marriage. The show
is based on the real-life story of Natalia Grace that made many
headlines.<br><br>Robbins and Sutherland talk about the unusual yet
brilliant structure of telling various episodes from different
characters’ points of view, and how the tone changed when they got to
the episodes told from Natalia’s perspective. They also talked about the
messiness of writing a dysfunctional family while still keeping the
story grounded. <br> <br>“We all know family is this wonderful,
beautiful thing, but it’s so complex. And I think that it’s really hard
to talk about the complexities of family because we’re afraid to
undermine the sacredness of it. It’s my view that if we are actually
more open about what is hard about coexisting as a unit who loves each
other, but also what’s not perfect, it would make us all better. And I
think that that’s true both for family but also even for our enemies.
We’re not writing autobiographies, but I think that we take those very
real emotional experiences that we all have and then put them into a
story that is cinematic, that is more interesting than our lives, but
that is deeply steeped in those real moments of heartache and joy and
confusion,” says Sutherland. <br><br>To learn more, listen to the
podcast but be aware there are SPOILERS ahead. <br><br>

Thirty years ago, comic book movies were hardly popular. Batman seemed
to be the only reliable franchise character igniting the 1995 summer
with <em>Batman Forever</em>. <em>Spider-Man</em> in 2002 launched the
real possibility of superhero and comic book movies before the genre hit
the gas in 2008 with <em>Iron Man</em>. Studios and producers then dug
deep into the comic book world turning the obscure <em>Guardians of the
Galaxy</em> into a major piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and
also creating acclaimed television shows like <em>The Boys</em> and
<em>The Penguin</em>.

Debut author Channelle Desamours has crafted a compelling mystery with
her twisty, turning, keeps-you-guessing-until-the-end novel,
<strong>Needy Little Things</strong>. (And that ending! Wow!) Sariyah
Bryant has a talent, an ability to “hear” the things a person needs. She

gum, pens, notebooks, shoelaces, tissues, tampons,

Cory Doctorow: Strange Bedfellows and Long Knives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Locus Magazine</p>

If a group of people have been trying to get something done for some
time without success, there are two possibilities: Either they’re

discovered a new tactic, or they’ve found some new coalition partners.

Gyre</strong>” by <strong>Doug Franklin, </strong>a post-environmental
collapse story, which centers on Mel – a man who lost his wife in a
storm and now fishes and sinks carbon under the guidance of a patron AI
