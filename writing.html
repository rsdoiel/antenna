<strong>Sargassa</strong>, Sophie Burnham (DAW 978-0-7564-1936-3,
$28.00, 416pp, hc) October 2024.
</p>
<p>
Sophie Burnham’s <strong>Sargassa </strong>is another first novel, and
another novel that flits with playful seriousness between the trappings
of fantasy, science fiction, and alternate history, using all three to
question and upend the reader’s assumptions about the world of the novel
(and perhaps the world at large) and how it works. <strong>Sargassa
</strong>takes the aura of Rome – perennial

<p>
<em>Disclaimer</em> warns audiences at the beginning to be wary of
narratives and forms that distract from hidden truths. Written and
directed by auteur Alfonso Cuarón, this AppleTV+ miniseries weaves
together storylines to uncover the truth about what happened years ago
between a young Catherine Ravenscroft (Leila George) and Jonathan
Brigstocke (Louis Partridge), the deceased son of a grieving
widow.<br><br>After the adult Catherine (Cate Blanchett) receives a copy
of an independently published novel with the disclaimer: “Any
resemblance to persons living or dead is not a coincidence,” the mystery
begins to unravel before the audience.<br><br>With a heavy focus on form
and structure, <em>Disclaimer</em> offers valuable lessons for
screenwriters looking to hook audiences with a shocking mystery.

family she hasn’t seen since fleeing as a teen to attend her
grandmother’s funeral… but a disappearance forces her to face the past.

based solely on the title and cover of Kay Chro­nister’s new novel,

The trope of gender-based magic is an old one in fantasy fiction. It
never fails to annoy me, and not just because I’m gen­derqueer. Besides
the whole gender essentialism thing, I just find it to be lazy and
uninspired. At this point, the only time I’ll read a ’’girls do this

ALLIANCE SUBMITS AMICUS BRIEF IN SEDLIK v. DRACHENBERG</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>The case Sedlik v. Drachenberg, currently pending before the 9th
Circuit, presents the 9th Circuit a first opportunity to interpret the
fair use right in the wake of the Warhol decision. Anticipating the
far-reaching consequences for artists and authors, Authors Alliance
filed an amicus brief in support of KVD. In our brief, we explained that
(1) a distinct purpose is required for the first factor to tilt in favor
of fair use, (2) a successful social media presence does not
automatically render all postings “commercial,” and (3) concrete
evidence is needed to prove the existence of a licensing market or the
likelihood of it developing.</p>

There are different ways of writing medical SF. One, as in the case of
Rajaniemi above, or Greg Egan occasionally, is to crank up the
verisimilitude and extrapolate specific diseases or treatments in the
best net-up hard-SF fashion; another is to lean into medicine as a
system rather than a sci­ence and build
