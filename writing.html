Character Energy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
RHONDA S.A. GARCIA was born in Trinidad and Tobago, where she has lived
her entire life. Though she earned her A levels and qualified to enter
university, her mother’s illness and other difficulties made it
impossible for her to attend. She worked various jobs, most recently as
an administrator in the engineering industry, until becoming a full-time
writer following a breast cancer diagnosis in 2021.

Garcia began publishing SF with

by Ian McDonald: Review by Gary K. Wolfe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>The Wilding</strong>, Ian McDonald (Gollancz 978-1-39961-147-3,
£25.00, 314pp, hc) September 2024.
</p>
<p>
Ian McDonald may be one of the most accom­plished SF writers of his
generation, but he isn’t particularly known for horror – though that may
change with the very creepy ecologi­cal fable <strong>The
Wilding</strong>. I’m using “creepy” in a quite literal sense here:
There’s a lot of creeping going on. A project to restore and “rewild” a

(Berkley 978-0-593-54728-1, $19.00, tp, 384pp) July 2024.
</p>
<p>
Romantasy is a subgenre getting considerable attention and India Holton
enters the field with a new series, that is a lot of fun. The first
book, <strong>The Ornithologist’s Field Guide to Love</strong>,
introduces two academics, Beth Pickering and Devon Lock­ley, who
specialize in the study and, if necessary, capture of thaumaturgic
birds. These
