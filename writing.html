Cherie Priest’s novella <strong>Cinderwich </strong>gifts readers with a
bit of a haunted tree folktale, some true crime detecting, a frustrated
ghost, and a couple of academic ladies with a sometimes prickly
friendship who are more than willing to sit through countless diner
dinners to get to a much-needed truth. In other words, it’s catnip for

Scary is in. Fear is fashionable. Horror is hot. That’s what we’re told.
Judging strictly by box office returns and critical acclaim—not to
mention the occasional Academy Award® for best screenplay—horror does
seem to be having a moment in the zeitgeist.

YOUR BREATH Writer Explores Dark Side of Motherhood in Horror Tale</h2>

<p>
<em>Hold Your Breath</em> is an achingly beautiful film that resonates
in many powerful ways. While hitting many of the necessary tropes of
psychological horror, it’s the incredible acting performances that hook
you and won’t let you escape – even when it’s hard to
breathe. <br><br>Set in Oklahoma in the 1930s Dust Bowl, famine, disease
and death abound. But for Margaret (Sarah Paulson), and her two
daughters, 12-year-old Rose (Amiah Miller) and 7-year-old Ollie (Alona
Jane Robbins) who’s deaf, it’s not just the pervasive dust that’s
threatening their lives, but something much more sinister. Even when the
mysterious stranger Wallace (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) shows up menacingly in
the night, the film asks: could the mother-daughter bond be the most
dangerous threat of all? <br><br>Written by Karrie Crouse, best known
for TV’s <em>Westworld</em>, and directed by Crouse and Will Joines, the
movie seems like a dark fable inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, when
just breathing the air might put your life at risk. But surprisingly
(and eerily), the screenplay was written before the pandemic even
started. Crouse says the inspiration for the film actually came from
watching the Ken Burns documentary <em>The Dust Bowl</em>.

The novels I review for this column are not chosen with a theme in mind.
If one does pop up, it’s purely coincidental. That goes for this month.
I had no idea <strong>Hum</strong>, <strong>Napalm in the

novels. The good news is that they’re very different in tone,

<p>Ideas and concepts, including “derivative works,” are only important
to the extent they elucidate our understanding of the world. When the
use of “derivative works” leads to more confusion than clarity, we
should be cautious in adopting the new meaning being superimposed on
“derivative works.”</p>

Even when deploying familiar tropes of the genre in totally au courant
ways, science fiction by non-Anglo authors always reveals an
idiosyncratic slant or attitude or worldview. This has been evident at
least since Stanislaw Lem burst onto the English-language publishing
scene, and is witnessed more recently in works from such accomplished
authors as Cixin Liu, Hannu
