<p>“One of the things that I really wanted to focus on, and I felt it
immediately after meeting Lina the housewife in Indiana [played by Betty
Gilpin in the show], whose husband no longer wanted to kiss her on the
mouth, I felt like this woman was as important as the Queen of England,
as important as Napoleon. I felt her dreams and fears are just as
universal as someone who has defeated an army and the only reason we’re
not hearing about her is because we have these sorts of rules in place
for what possesses historical significance. And I don’t really think
that that’s necessarily true,” says Lisa Taddeo, author of the book
<em>Three Women</em>, on which her new TV show is based.  <br> <br>In
today’s episode, we speak to Lisa Taddeo, creator of the show <em>Three
Women</em> that stars Shailene Woodley, Betty Gilpin, DeWanda Wise and
Gabrielle Creevy as “ordinary” women searching for their sexual identity
and fulfillment in disparate and surprising ways. The show is an
intimate, often stark portrayal of forbidden female desire and the
consequences of that desire – both good and bad.  <br> <br>We also talk
about writing the “female gaze” into the scripts, filming with
prosthetic penises, the power the book <em>Twilight</em> has on teenage
girls, and the uncanny way our mothers influence our own sexuality. 
<br> <br>“My mother made up her face every morning, even when she wasn’t
going to leave the house. Who is she? My father sees her before she puts
on her face as they say, so it’s not for him. Nobody is coming to the
door today, so it’s not for them. It’s certainly not for me, because I
see her without makeup when she washes it off at night. So, who is it
for, you know? And that was a question I had but didn’t really know how
to frame,” Taddeo says.  <br> <br>To hear more about the groundbreaking
show <em>Three Women</em> that’s airing on Starz, listen to the
podcast.  <br> <br> <em>Trigger warning: contains mentions of sexual
explicit material, sexual assault and trauma.</em></p>
