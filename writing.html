Films of Charlie Kaufman</h2>

If you were to survey the new voices of American cinema across smaller,
auteur-driven outfits like A24 and Neon, there’s one pervading influence
that seems to crop up more than any other, that of writer/director
Charlie Kaufman. The New York-born filmmaker made his name writing
scripts that used absurdist, comic premises to grapple with the personal
anxieties and neuroses he experienced in mundane everyday life,
oftentimes exploring the blurry line between performance and reality.
The earliest of these films were lent a whimsical visual style by such
inventive music video directors as Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry, before
Kaufman eventually took the directorial reins himself, resulting in a
darker, rawer expression. <br><br>A quarter century on from Kaufman’s
debut feature film,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_0_in_0_q_being%2520john%2520malkovich"><em>Being
John Malkovich</em></a>, his style still echoes prevalently in
contemporary works as diverse as The Daniels’ Oscar-winning <span
style="font-style: italic;">Everything Everywhere All At Once</span>,
Boots Riley’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sorry To Bother
You</span>, Ari Aster’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Beau Is
Afraid</span>, Kristofer Borgli’s <span
style="font-style: italic;">Dream Scenario</span>, Aaron Schimberg’s
Oscar-nominated <span style="font-style: italic;">A Different
Man</span>, and the dark comic works of Yorgos Lanthimos. Even Apple
TV’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Severance</span> and sci-fi
romances like <span style="font-style: italic;">Palm Springs</span> and
Jonze’s own screenplay for <span style="font-style: italic;">Her</span>,
owe a debt to Kaufman’s unique voice. <br><br>In studying his career,
one can trace how Kaufman developed and fought hard to stay true to his
weird, distinct sensibility in a system increasingly averse to
originality, from struggling sitcom writer, to inventive
screenwriter-for-hire, and finally, to a singular filmmaker who would
influence a generation.

Everyone wants to take a whack at Blue­beard, it seems. While many of
those old Charles Perrault fairy tales have given rise to endless
variations over the centuries, this one seems particularly fascinating
to modern writers, including Kurt Vonnegut, Donald Barthelme, and Angela
Carter. More recently, we’ve seen variations from Margaret Atwood,
Gregory Frost, T. Kingfisher, Catherynne
