Debut author Channelle Desamours has crafted a compelling mystery with
her twisty, turning, keeps-you-guessing-until-the-end novel,
<strong>Needy Little Things</strong>. (And that ending! Wow!) Sariyah
Bryant has a talent, an ability to “hear” the things a person needs. She
carries a small duffle bag around filled with all the obvious items:
gum, pens, notebooks, shoelaces, tissues, tampons,

Cory Doctorow: Strange Bedfellows and Long Knives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
If a group of people have been trying to get something done for some
time without success, there are two possibilities: Either they’re
failing because of bad tactics, or they’re failing because they simply
lack the power to achieve their goals. When things start changing in
big, dramatic ways, that means that some group in society has either
discovered a new tactic, or they’ve found some new coalition partners.

The January/February issue of Analog opens with “<strong>Our Lady of the
Gyre</strong>” by <strong>Doug Franklin, </strong>a post-environmental
collapse story, which centers on Mel – a man who lost his wife in a
storm and now fishes and sinks carbon under the guidance of a patron AI
known as the Lady of the Gyre. The worldbuilding and the characters are
engaging, and there’s a satisfying arc for
