It’s both exciting and terrifying to start a new screenplay — whether
it’s your first, second, third, or beyond. <br><br>The excitement takes
hold because you’ve had this idea playing in your head for a while and
you’re finally committed to getting that idea — and its story and
character elements — onto the page. It’s always exciting to see your
concepts come to life. <br><br>The terror can reside in the fact that
you now have to bring those visuals and thoughts into the realm of
screenwriting structure by way of laying it out in script format, story
structure, scene description, dialogue, and
characterization. <br><br>That’s the thrill though. That’s why
screenwriters do this. You want to see your ideas and concepts grow into
compelling and engaging cinematic tales that entice Hollywood to buy
them and bring them to life on the screen for audiences to
experience. <br><br>But for all of that to happen, your scripts have to
not just be good — they need to be amazing. You always want to showcase
your best work to the powers that be. <br><br>With that in mind, here
we’ll share five screenwriting prep exercises you should do <span
style="font-weight: bold;">before you write a single word</span>.
Front-end screenwriting tasks are key to the success of any screenplay.
If you do the front-end work before you jump into the writing process,
your script will be far, far more successful than just jumping into the
writing and “vomiting” out a quick first draft.

If there’s one thing I can’t abide, it’s nontechnical technothrillers.
You know the trope: “We’ve got eight minutes to crack this mainframe,
but it’s protected with encryption that is rated for ten minutes. We’re
gonna have to hack really hard. Come on, hacker, HACK AWAY!”
</p>
<p>
Technothrillers are consumed by an increasingly computer-savvy audience,
which means that the kind of technical elision and corner-cutting that
dominates the field grows thinner by
