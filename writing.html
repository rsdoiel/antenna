British writers Chris and Michael Mul, known as the Mul Brothers in the
screenwriting world, have some fantastic news: their Big Break-winning
screenplay,
<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ansel-elgort-in-bear-grylls-produced-survival-thriller-faster-than-horses-afm2024-1236047326/" style="font-style: italic;">Faster
Than Horses</a>, is in pre-production with director James Erskine (<span
style="font-style: italic;">Shooting for Socrates</span>), producer Bear
Grylls (<span style="font-style: italic;">Running Wild with Bear
Grylls</span>) and starring Ansel Elgort (<span
style="font-style: italic;">Baby Driver</span>). <br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</span> is a
survival-thriller about a former Olympic runner, Mauro Prosperi
(Elgort), who attempts a comeback in the grueling Marathon des Sables
across the treacherous Sahara Desert. Based on a true story, the athlete
disappeared for nine days in a sandstorm that left him fighting for his
life. <br><br>We sat down with the Mul Brothers to find out about their
writing journey and hear how winning the Big Break competition helped
progress their career to the next level.<br><br>The Mul Brothers have
always been fans of survival stories and are obsessed with movies like
<span style="font-style: italic;">127 Hours</span>. But when they read
an article about
<a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/crazy-in-the-desert-w474055">Prosperi’s
harrowing journey</a> in 2017, they knew the shocking endurance story
had particular cinematic appeal.  <br><br>“The amount of things that
went wrong for Mauro while he was in the desert – you couldn’t believe
it!” says Michael, adding, “A missed plane that went past and then he
just so happened to not be in the right place when they sent out a
rescue team, it was one thing after another. And then right at the end
of the story, he tried to take his own life but somehow survived because
the blood just congealed. He saw that as a sign of divine intervention
to keep going.” <br><br>After that, Prosperi faced down the guns of
Algerian soldiers when he accidentally wandered from Morocco into
Algeria. No wonder survival expert Bear Grylls signed on to produce the
movie!<br><br>But a great true-life story doesn’t always translate
easily into a great movie script. Beyond just the true events, the story
must also include a highly emotional and cathartic journey for its
protagonist. The Mul Brothers were able to craft that journey by
focusing on Prosperi’s deep need to reclaim his former athletic glory –
something the judges of the Final Draft Big Break competition
recognized. <span style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</span>
was awarded the prize for Best Feature Drama in 2021. <br><br>“Every
screenplay competition has a different caliber and it took us a little
while to figure out who the big players were. So with the Final Draft
submission, we were just like fingers crossed!” says Chris, who admits
he was thrilled to find out they’d won considering they had entered the
year before. <br><br>The prize package that came with the Big Break win
made all the difference. <br><br>“Mike and I say, 100 percent, one of
the best prize packages we ever received was the fellowship that we got
as a result of Final Draft. It wasn’t so much about the money. It was
more about the opportunity that led to us writing more material. I think
it was 10 weeks and over that time, we wrote an entirely new TV pilot in
one of the classes [as part of the New York Film Academy, included in
their prize package] which was a really cool experience. The guy who was
running it, George McGrath, who we’ve stayed in contact with and was
super lovely, shared it with a friend of his at HBO just off the bat and
he’d never shared anything with anybody before, but he just felt like
the color of the writing was great. So just off that, it was like,
‘Okay, this is why Final Draft is that much higher in caliber.’ For us,
it was one of the best experiences we’ve had when it came to placing or
winning in contests,” says Chris.<br><br>The Mul Brothers want to share
this advice for emerging writers: “Keep writing. I think that that is
the best way to find your voice as a writer. The more Chris and I wrote,
we started to find that we would continually revisit the same themes in
our work. And ultimately that’s what really grounds you as a writer in
terms of the things that you like to explore,” says
Michael. <br><br>Chris’s advice is to read produced screenplays for this
reason: “A lot of writers starting out don’t realize how important the
first 10 pages of the screenplay are because sometimes that’s all a
producer is going to read. You see in those opening 10 pages of a lot of
produced screenplays, they’re almost perfect in how they’re delivering
character and introductions to the world and themes, and the economy of
those pages.” <br><br>For more information on Big Break visit

Like Death by Kalynn Bayron: Review by Colleen Mondor</h2>

<strong>Sleep Like Death</strong>, Kalynn Bayron (Bloomsbury
978-1-547-60976-5, $19.99, 368pp, hc) June 2024.
</p>
<p>
As she previously did with Cinderella, author Kalynn Bayron turned
another classic on its head this year with <strong>Sleep Like
Death</strong>, her smart and scary reimagining of Snow White. There’s a
temptation when an author revisits a famous tale to assume they will
simply modernize or dress it up a little, all of which can be
