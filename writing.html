in the Simulation: A Conversation with Daryl Gregory</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
Please join award-winning author Daryl Gregory and our editor-in-chief
Liza Trombi for an online conversation about ‘Life in the Simulation:
Writing From Another Reality.’
</p>
<p>

transcend our programming? Gregory delves into these concepts and more
in his latest science fiction road trip book
