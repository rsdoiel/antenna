      <h1>Write On: 'The Toxic Avenger' Writer/Director Macon Blair</h1>

<p>“The thing that started it all off was me saying [the character Toxie] should be a guy in a suit. In other words, let’s not do a computer-generated creature, let’s have a person in a suit and have that handmade, hand-stitched kind of quality to it where you can sort of see the seams a little bit and have that be part of the fun. I also said let’s have it be rated R. Hopefully y’all are not interested in a family-friendly PG-13 version of this movie, because that’s not what the fans of the original are going to want, so let’s keep it in the R-zone. And let’s make sure it stays very silly. That silliness is what was so appealing to me about the original, and I just wanted to make sure that we weren’t going to try and do something that was too self-serious,” says <em>The Toxic Avenger</em> writer/director Macon Blair about pitching Legendary Studios his version of how he would reimagine the classic black comedy splatter film for a modern audience while staying loyal to the fans of the 1984 version.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On today’s episode, we chat with writer/director/actor Macon Blair about his previous films like <em>Blue Ruin</em> and <em>I Don’t Feel at Home</em> <em>in This World Anymore</em>, which won the Sundance Grand Jury award in 2017. His latest film is a reboot of <em>The Toxic Avenger</em> starring Peter Dinklage and Kevin Bacon, and is a whole lot of gory, gross-out fun. Blair talks about the need to dig into the over-the-top absurdity of the franchise while still making the modern version of the story feel authentic.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“I’m always looking for something that I can connect to on a personal level. I don’t mean autobiographical. I mean to be able to have that electrical current with what I’m typing out,” he says.</p> 
<p>Blair tells us about his on-going journey to finding his voice as a writer and what it was like waiting two years to get distribution for <em>The Toxic Avenger</em>. He also explains why he skewers a famous screenwriting trope in the film that involves a cat named Mr. Treats who was apparently quite the menace.</p>

<h2>What Is a Beat Board?</h2> 
<p>Perhaps you’ve seen images of a TV writer’s room and noticed a whiteboard with a bunch of sticky notes attached to it or handwritten Sharpie notes. Or maybe you’ve watched a behind-the-scenes featurette on a Blu-ray and noticed a cork board at a production company’s office and it was similarly covered with sticky notes or index cards.&nbsp;<br><br>These boards are referred to as a “beat board” in the film and television industry. It’s extremely helpful to have a visual representation of a story when in the development process, and that’s why beat boards are frequently used by writers and producers.<br><br>Whether they’re on a sticky note or index card, what’s usually written is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">beat</span>. A beat is a smaller story event that happens within a larger sequence or narrative. Think of beats as the molecules of a screenplay or television script: they’re the little things that are holding everything together and helping to create a whole.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>How Travis Braun Topped The Black List Two Years in a Row</h1>

 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-travis-braun-topped-the-black-list-two-years-in-a-row" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Headshot%20of%20writer%20Travis%20Braun.png" alt="How Travis Braun Topped The Black List Two Years in a Row" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>It’s a feat to top the Black List, Hollywood’s list of favorite unproduced screenplays, any year. But what if you did it two years in a row?<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4136506/">Travis Braun </a>has been the only writer to accomplish this so far. In 2023, it was his horror script <span style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</span> that won the top spot; in 2024, rom-com <span style="font-style: italic;">One Night Only</span> was named the number-one work. Both are currently in development. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/lili-reinhart-ke-huy-quan-horror-film-bad-boy-dog-efm-1236279194/" style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</a> has Ke Huy Quan and Lili Reinhart attached, while Monica Barbaro and Callum Turner are set to star in <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/monica-barbaro-callum-turner-one-night-only-will-gluck-1236481748/" style="font-style: italic;">One Night Only</a> for Universal.<br><br>Beyond this, Braun has already found a ton of success in the children’s TV space, with an Emmy nomination and an overall deal at Disney, where he created the shows <span style="font-style: italic;">Pupstruction, T.O.T.S.</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Fast Layne</span>.<br><br>His new features fall outside the world of kids’ entertainment, though. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</span> is about a dog who uncovers a serial killer, and <span style="font-style: italic;">One Night Only</span> follows the single night every year when extramarital sex is allowed. Both high-concept stories clearly resonated with readers eager for original plotlines.&nbsp;<br><br>The diversity of Braun’s slate is impressive, but there’s volume, as well. Which is probably how his work has found a home at some of Hollywood’s biggest networks and on coveted lists.<br><br>Final Draft chatted with Braun about his writing process, and he told us that there was no secret formula to it but rather a dedication to pursuing exciting ideas and cutting out noise. Dive into his advice below.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You topped the Black List two years in a row, and you were the first person to do so. What’s your secret?&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Travis Braun</span>: Man, I don’t know. I wish there was a secret, then it would be a lot easier to write these scripts.&nbsp;<br><br>They’re always hard. Each one is its own challenge. I feel like every time you think you know how to write a script, or at least I think I know how to write a script, I start the next one and it’s a quick rude awakening that all the lessons from the last one just don’t apply to the next one. So it feels like you’re always making the tools as you’re trying to build the car. You need new tools for each type of car you’re building. I wish I knew the secret, but I’m still trying to figure that out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think the biggest shift that I’ve made in the last four or five years was just really trying to tap into what excites me and cut out a lot of the noise, which is hard to do. And there’s a lot of voices out there from your reps to buyers, to producers, and everyone has a feeling of what’s going to work. And ultimately, it’s been me just trying to figure out, what do I love? What do I think is exciting, what entertains me, and trying to follow that North Star.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: I’d love to explore that a little more because both of the scripts I mentioned, Bad Boy and One Night Only, they’re both high-concept. What attracts you to that space?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Travis Braun</span>: I’m always trying to find something that feels original. That’s why I live in Burbank. I go to the Burbank AMC three times a week, probably. I love that feeling of discovering something new.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s what I am trying to find in my writing too, is just chasing that feeling of what’s fresh, what’s a completely new take on a horror movie or a thriller or a romcom and just trying to find something that feels fresh and different and unexpected. Because as an audience member, as a lover of movies, that’s what I’m always looking for.<br></p>

      <h1>The Coen Brothers’ Literary Influences: 4 Writers Who Shaped Their Films</h1>

</div> 
<p>The Coen Brothers have been major forces in American cinema for an astounding 40 years now, spanning genres from crime thriller to musical to stoner comedy, and always with a dark sense of humor. Though the Minnesota writing/directing/editing team of Joel and Ethan Coen haven’t made a film together since 2018’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6412452/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</a>, Joel is currently directing a film called <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/josh-o-connor-joel-coen-movie-jack-of-spades-baz-bamigboye-1236409439/" style="font-style: italic;">Jack Of Spades</a> starring Josh O’Connor in Scotland, and Ethan’s newest directorial effort, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30645201/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Honey Don’t!</a>, co-written with his partner and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19356262/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Drive Away Dolls</a> (2024) collaborator <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177504/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk">Tricia Cooke</a>, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May and releases this month, frontlined by Margaret Qualley and Aubrey Plaza.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Honey</span> takes its name from Qualley’s private investigator character, Honey O’Donahue, representing the latest in a long line of mystery and crime thriller characters from the Coens that take their roots in American crime fiction, going back to their debut feature, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086979/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Blood Simple</a> (1984). The brothers, together and apart, have created a specific tone, rich with literary layers, that’s all their own, in part by drawing on a deep well of influence. And while their movies are littered with cinematic allusions, they owe as great a debt to literature.&nbsp;<br><br>The brothers clearly love to read, and have done their fair share of literary adaptations, like Oscar-winning <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" style="font-style: italic;">No Country for Old Men</a> (2007) based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, their western hit based on Charles Portis’ <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403865/" style="font-style: italic;">True Grit</a> (2010), and Joel Coen’s solo directorial effort adapting William Shakespeare in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10095582/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy of Macbeth</a> (2021), whose murder plot <a href="https://www.dga.org/Events/2022/February2022/Macbeth_QnA_1221">Coen compared</a> to the hard-boiled American crime fiction that influenced their films.&nbsp;<br><br>One that got away was an adaptation of James Dickey’s <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/specials/dickey-sea.html?scp=24&amp;sq=moral%20camouflage&amp;st=cse" style="font-style: italic;">To The White Sea</a>, about an American gunner who’s shot down over Tokyo during the WWII fire bombings, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=116293&amp;page=1">which had Brad Pitt attached in the early 2000s</a>, but ultimately was too expensive to get off the ground. Additionally, one of their most acclaimed film’s features characters loosely based on real writers. The Palme d’or winning <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101410/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Barton Fink</a> (1991) starred John Turturro as a playwright turned fledgling screenwriter with roots in Clifford Odets and George S. Kaufman, alongside another character depicted in the mold of William Faulkner, himself a great influence on the Coens.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other side of the spectrum are films where the cinematic influences are more apparent than the literary ones, like screwball comedies <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093822/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Raising Arizona</a> (1987), which seems to meld the crime film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078326/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Straight Time</a> (1978) with the high speed action antics of Chuck Jones’ <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041349/">Wile E. Coyote</a> cartoons and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Road Warrior</a> (1981), and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110074/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Hudsucker Proxy</a> (1994), a post-modern love letter to 40s comedy films by the likes of Frank Capra, Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges.&nbsp;<br><br>Their 2004 Tom Hanks vehicle <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335245/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Ladykillers</a> (2004) was a remake of the Ealing Studios British comedy film of the same name from 1955, itself littered with shades of Faulkner and Flannery O’Connor, whose influence can be seen across the filmography, while <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138524/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Intolerable Cruelty</a> (2002) was developed from an existing romantic comedy screenplay.&nbsp;<br><br>But some of the Coens’ most significant movies aren’t necessarily literary adaptations or film genre homages, but original films where they’ve worked under the spectre of specifically cited literary figures. From hard-boiled detective fiction to Greek mythology, here are some of the foremost literary influences on the work of the Coen Brothers.</p>

<p>Conflict is everything in a screenplay. Without conflict, there’s nothing to drive the story forward. Stories need characters to be struggling through conflict that they are either forced to deal with, or conflict that they’ve <em>chosen</em> to face.&nbsp;<br><br>There are two different forms of conflict in literary, stage, or cinematic narratives:</p>

<p>Less is more. Screenwriters have been reading and hearing that phrase for years. But what does it really mean? It’s about being concise, especially when dealing with screenwriting action lines.&nbsp;<br><br>Less is more is the philosophy that restraint often has greater impact than excess. If you cut away the noise and clutter, what remains feels so much sharper, stronger, and more resonant. It helps maximize the impact of the information.&nbsp;<br><br>In screenwriting and, more specifically, while writing scene descriptions in your script’s action lines, “less is more” has a much deeper meaning. When you maximize your impact with more concise action lines and scene description, <span style="font-weight: bold;">you’re trusting the script reader</span>. It’s about trimming overly-descriptive action lines so the fewer words you use to communicate a cinematic moment actually makes that moment even more cinematic.&nbsp;<br><br>A screenplay isn’t about spelling everything out - it’s about sparking images in the reader’s mind and leaving space for the script readers, actors, directors, and crew to engage their own imagination to visualize the intent of each line of action you write. Using the tools outlined here, we’ll teach you how to write better action lines in your script.<br><br>Here we’ll delve into how to write great action lines in a screenplay using <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/">Final Draft Screenwriting software</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There seems to be something unique about the 1970s. The decade was filled with political turmoil, the ending of the Vietnam War, global instability, government scandals and a hostage crisis in Iran. There were plenty of monsters in the newspapers, but audiences preferred our monsters on the movie theater screen. Science fiction had been mostly B-movie Roger Corman stories where rubber-suited creatures terrorized unsuspecting humans. <em>Star Wars</em> proved that people wanted more from their space adventures, while <em>Jaws</em> showed that audiences love to be scared.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>We Strangers</em> is a surprising and deeply personal study of race and class in small-town America. The story centers on Ray (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a charming young woman living in Gary, Indiana who’s trying to make ends meet in the gig economy. While she’s determined to pay her bills, she discovers her integrity, self-worth and identity will be tested in unexpected ways.&nbsp;<br><br>Writer-director Anu Valia, a first-generation Indian American, grew up in the Midwest and says she understands the challenges of fitting in when you feel different from those around you. From an early age, she had to learn how to adapt to unfamiliar situations, but that skill also gave her resilience. “I feel like I became very good at tailoring who I was to the surroundings around me. It can be a great gift, a superpower even, but I started asking myself, ‘Where does that leave you? Who are you when you’re always being somebody else?’”</p>

</div> 
<p>Gigi Levangie’s career demonstrates the importance of diligence as a writer.&nbsp;<br><br>She’s a prolific novelist, with several adaptations of her works moving to the screen, including <em>Maneater</em> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810726/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2" style="font-style: italic;">The Starter Wife</a>. She also wrote the 1998 drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120686/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1" style="font-style: italic;">Stepmom</a>. A disciplined creator, she writes at least five days a week, understanding that the first draft doesn’t need to be perfect.<br><br>Her new film is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31314745/" style="font-style: italic;">Trust</a> stars Sophie Turner as a beloved sitcom actor with a dark secret. After a phone hack that violates her privacy, she escapes LA for a solo vacation, but doesn’t find any solitude when a home invasion traps her in a hot-water closet.<br><br>The script was inspired by a real-life story of a woman who ended up stuck in a closet with a hot-water heater instead of finding the bathroom she was looking for. Levangie said she writes very quickly, not wanting to lose momentum when an idea sparks. She also knows that if she’s particularly excited about a premise, it’s likely that someone else somewhere shares her enthusiasm. That’s how the zeitgeist works!<br><br>We asked her about her experience and got tons of great advice for writers wanting to break into the business right now.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: What attracted you to this project?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: I love to write what really captures me. I write spec scripts all the time. So this was part and parcel to my greatest fear, which is to be locked in a closet in a closed space, dark closed space.<br><br>I had read an article a long time ago about a woman who went by herself to a secluded place for a weekend, and in the middle of the night they surmised that she went into a hot water closet instead of the bathroom, and she never made it out. And of course, I saw something like that, I thought, “I have to write this down.”&nbsp;<br><br>I write things quickly. I try to get them down as fast as possible because if I’m feeling this, then I know that it’s out there in the world and somebody else is feeling the same way. So I wrote this, it was an original screenplay, and then I was lucky enough to eventually get it made.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You mentioned that you write fast. What does that look like?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: When I’m writing a screenplay, it’s usually, say, two to three weeks. If I’m writing a novel, it’s a thousand words a day. I think momentum is everything to get a first [draft]. I’m not saying it’s a perfect first draft by any means, but we’re not going for a perfect first draft. We’re going to get from start to finish of a screenplay or a book.&nbsp;<br><br>I read and reread a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/10-Day-Screenplay-How-Write-Days/dp/0692582622" style="font-style: italic;">The 10-Day Screenplay</a> by the Donnelley brothers. I used it to write this screenplay. It’s basically like, day one, you write out the characters, 20 questions for each major character. What’s their internal/external conflict? And from there you write to page 15, to the first big plot point, and then you go on from there. And it just works.&nbsp;<br><br>Now again, it’s not going to be perfect, but I think too many people go for perfect, and they overanalyze, and writing is so visceral to me and so personal that it’s almost like my lifeblood, and I have to get it down, keep it moving, not let it stagnate for at least five, six, seven days a week, whether I’m being paid or not. And most of the time I’m not being paid. That’s an art form. But eventually you might get lucky and something cracks in the universe and you get your movie made.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Two to three weeks is kind of bonkers for speed, so that’s very impressive.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: I’m used to writing novels as well, so to me, a screenplay is fun. It’s dialogue. I can be really jokey within that paradigm. And I think that studio writers, contract writers, they used to have to crank out scripts all the time, very quickly. And I know novelists who crank out a book every six months or at least one a year. It’s possible, but you have to be very, very disciplined.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: So you’re approaching character development with those questions?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: There are like 20 character questions. What was your home life? Were you raised with religion or not? Do you have a spiritual life? What were your grades like? Were you popular in school? Not popular in school?&nbsp;<br><br>There are so many things that shape us, and it just helps me to really focus on the character. Otherwise, I would jump into the writing too quickly. If I’m really excited by an idea—and I know that when I’m excited by an idea, I know it’s in the zeitgeist, I know that there are other people writing the same thing, so I really want to jump in. But I have to take a day or two, and write out those character sketches and then add to them, take away, add, change as you need.&nbsp;<br><br>Your screenplay, it’s a living thing. It’s a living document. So when you write the screenplay, the first draft is yours. Once you sell it, it takes on a life of its own. And then other people put their thumbprints [on it] for better or worse. So we don’t want to be too precious.<br><br>I like a visceral feel. I like to feel like mistakes are made, but it’s interesting. It doesn’t feel overdeveloped.<br></p>

      <h1>'Casablanca': The Many Writers Who Shaped a Classic</h1>

<p>In 1942, Warner Brothers began production on a romantic wartime melodrama with all the workmanlike routine of any of the other dozens of programmers they churned out each year. No one involved had any clue that this particular assignment would become one of the most famous movies of all time, an Academy Award-winning classic that would transcend generations, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/" style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>There are myriad reasons for its longevity, from the universal emotions of the central love triangle, to the sadly all-too-resonant anti-fascist sentiment, and unforgettable movie star performances, but in trying to determine what authorial voice crafted this near-perfect screenplay, the answer is far messier than the simplicity of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory">auteur theory</a>. In fact, <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span> is one of the greatest examples of cinematic storytelling as total collaboration.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/movies/andrew-sarris-film-critic-dies-at-83.html">Andrew Sarris </a>once called <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span> “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-michael-curtiz-ucla-20180104-story.html">the most decisive exception to the auteur theory</a>,” and in reading the exhaustively researched and endlessly fascinating <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/aljean-harmetz/the-making-of-casablanca/9780786888146/?lens=grand-central-publishing" style="font-style: italic;">The Making of Casablanca</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aljean-harmetz">Aljean Hermetz</a>, it’s hard to disagree. Hermetz used the meticulous memos that Warners ran off of in its day, comparisons of the many drafts of the screenplay, and interviews with the creatives to paint a picture of the inner workings of the studio system during its Golden Age. Actors, directors and writers alike were seen less as singular artists than as contracted professionals, paid weekly for their specific technical contributions to the construction of a mass-produced product.&nbsp;<br><br>“Warner Brothers was like the assembly line at an automobile plant,” says screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258493/">Julius Epstein</a> in Harmetz’ book, “You were assigned a script, and when you were through with it, the studio would give it to another writer, and someone else would polish it and if you were good at a particular thing, you would do that type of scene on one picture, and another and another.”&nbsp;<br><br>Epstein and his brother <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm16909158/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_philip%2520epstein">Philip</a> were two of the writers assigned to adapt the unproduced play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Everybody Comes To Rick’s</span>, by unknown writers <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122417/">Murray Burnett</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019706/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_1_nm_7_in_0_q_joan%2520alison">Joan Alison</a>, along with fellow contracted screenwriter, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0462321/">Howard Koch</a>. The Epsteins, Burnett and Koch were all very different writers with different strengths, but all had in common that they were staunchly anti-fascist Jewish New Yorkers. In the months after America joined WWII, they injected their firmly held beliefs and contrasting styles into this run-of-the-mill melodrama whose fateful wartime release would make it not only a beloved entertainment, but a political act.&nbsp;<br><br>Top WB screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732452/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_casey%2520robinson">Casey Robinson</a> noted and polished the script under the creative oversight of prolific producer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0909259/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_1_in_0_q_hal%2520b%2520wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> and director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002031/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_3_nm_5_in_0_q_michael%2520curtiz">Michael Curtiz</a>, but writing from all parties continued well into production. Some of the most iconic lines in the film even came from the actors themselves, and the ending wasn’t decided upon until the day they needed to shoot it. So it becomes clear in studying the film’s production, that there is no one, or even two authors of <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span>. It’s the type of classic whose quality is made up of the contrasts and tensions of a great many creative personalities playing tug of war with one of many inconspicuous films they’d be beating into shape that year. The writing of Casablanca is a testament to the merits of collaboration and the studio system working at its best. These are the authors who created <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span>.</p>

</div> 
<p>I, like many people, have been a fan of <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-poor-things-writer-tony-mcnamara">Tony McNamara</a>’s witty, biting work for several years.&nbsp;<br><br>The screenwriter and playwright has gained fame for his diverse, fanciful stories, featuring colorful characters in even more colorful conflicts. The words that tumble out of their mouths are often shocking or obscene. It makes for punchy, unique comedy.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1110111/">McNamara&nbsp;</a>is twice Oscar-nominated for the delightful <span style="font-style: italic;">Poor Things</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Favourite</span>, both part of his collaboration with director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0487166/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>. He also wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great</span>, a historical comedy about Catherine the Great, which was taken from us too soon.&nbsp;<br><br>He’s gathered additional accolades for projects like <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rage in Placid Lake</span> (which he also directed) and the Disney origin story <span style="font-style: italic;">Cruella</span>.<br><br>His newest project is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Roses</span>, a comedy directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005366/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1">Jay Roach</a>, a retelling of the 1989 black comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">The War of the Roses</span>. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy, the story follows a marriage on the verge of collapse.&nbsp;<br><br>McNamara takes the audience through the building tension of this relationship to an explosive (and hilarious) conclusion, while also finding touching kernels of truth in their conflict - exactly the kind of writing he’s best at.<br><br>We spoke with McNamara about the film and got some of his best advice for screenwriters. If you want to write fun, character-driven comedy, this is the post for you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: In this film, you have two characters who are deeply in love, but they do terrible things to each other. How do you convey that duality in your writing?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span>: I think I always try to look at real basics of where they’re coming from. I feel like if you’re always writing from some <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-create-an-emotional-through-line-in-your-screenplay">emotional truth</a> of why people want stuff, and how they’re going to go about it, it might not be the best version of going about it as a human being. It can be quite flawed. But as long as you understand that these two, they’re not very good at marriage, but they want it to work. They’re desperately trying a lot of the time, but they’re quite bad at trying.&nbsp;<br><br>You’re just watching people who are flawed trying to get something. Which we all are. I feel like you give them a bit of a pass on some of their behavior because of it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Your dialogue is amazingly sharp, but it manages to get these emotional gut-punches in there as well. How do you find those moments for those barbs?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span>: I think I try and know what everyone’s about. I’m very <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/dialogue-the-art-of-subtext">tonally driven</a> and rhythm-driven. I know that within the rhythm of a scene, there will be moments that take off out of the rhythm that provide more of a punch. A lot of it’s character driven, of where they’re at.&nbsp;<br><br>It is then organizing the scene so that you’re surprising the audience with where they get to. But you’re also like, “Oh, well, of course they said that.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You also have a really pivotal table scene in this movie, which you wrote in an afternoon, I believe.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span>: Yeah. It was one of those things that I think as a writer, sometimes you get it free. I think it was built on all the work of the previous 70 pages and drafts. I’d already done a bunch of drafts of the script.&nbsp;<br><br>I think it’s one of those things when you’re writing a script that’s set over 20 years, they’re quite difficult. And all the sequences before were bunches of scenes set across a couple of weeks or a month … I think the playwright in me went, “I just want to write a big long scene.”&nbsp;<br><br>I wanted a scene where they were in one place for a bunch of time and you really understood where they were, and that they’d been holding it together, and they finally couldn’t.<br><br>And I went, “I’ll just do it as a quick <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/learn/building-screenplay-structure/">three acts</a> over 14 pages or something and see if it works.” I wrote it out really quickly and showed it to my best friend who was a writer on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great</span>, and she was in my office and I said, “Read this. I feel like it’s good.”&nbsp;<br><br>And she was like, “That’s great.” I think it was all built out of a bunch of drafts where that didn’t happen and I hadn’t quite solved how to shift gears and make the rhythm jump up a notch. But yeah, it was like, I got one free for the writing gods for an afternoon.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Well, it’s an amazing scene, and </span><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-write-a-great-dinner-scene-in-your-screenplay" style="font-weight: bold;">table scenes</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> can be notoriously difficult to write. So it sounds like you approached it with that three-act structure in mind. Are there any other ways that you would recommend attacking a big table scene?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> No, I think that’s partly it. I’ve written a bunch of them in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great</span> and other things, and theater, because I started as a playwright, that were very table scene-y.&nbsp;<br><br>I think it was like, “Oh, it’s trying to find a structure,” because they can easily run into just dialogue for no real purpose or get off-line easily.&nbsp;<br><br>I think I was just very conscious of it [being] three acts, and I knew how it started. I think what I felt good about was, I went, “Well, it starts pretty cool and everyone’s pretty chill, and then the table scene is insane.”&nbsp;<br><br>And then there’s the aftermath, which was the scene I really cared about emotionally, but we couldn’t get there without the middle scene. That was the fun bit.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>The 2025 Colossal Fundraiser has begun!</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/792165104576774144">IF Competition Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Hello, friends. </p><p>We are just a couple of weeks away from this year’s IFComp games being released. Are you looking forward to them as much as we are?? IT&rsquo;S SO EXCITING!! <br/><small>(Unless you’re an author who is furiously testing and revising and recompiling and testing and revising and recompiling and… Good luck, authors! You can do it!)</small></p><p><b>While we eagerly await the new games to come, we’d like to ask for your help with the Colossal Fund.</b> If you already know about the fund and are able to contribute, please go to <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">ifcomp.org</a> and <b>hit that blue “Donate with PayPal”</b> button!</p><p><i>If you’d like more information first, keep on reading…</i></p><p>The Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to the top two-thirds of IFComp entries. We use 80% of the funds for that, and the remaining funds are used to provide support for the programs and projects of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>, the <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other projects.</p><h2>This year, we are shooting for $8K.</h2><p><b>We’re now accepting donations for 2025!</b> <br/>The donation button is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name listed on our donor page (or listed as “anonymous” if you prefer)! <br/>Our fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition voting. 80% of the proceeds (~$6.4K if we hit our goal) will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. </p><p><b>What does this mean for authors?</b> <br/>Because we’re dividing the money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the money among the top 50. If we hit our goal, that would mean that the winner of the competition will be offered a prize of $357, second place will be offered $343, third prize $329… and so on and so forth until 50th place, which will be offered $10.  Our goal is to distribute prizes across a broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately well is offered a decent prize. (If you wanna get nerdy, there&rsquo;s information about the formula with a link to a Python script <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/162478013529/announcing-the-ifcomp-colossal-fund">here</a>.)</p><p><b>How do I donate?</b> <br/>Please go to https://ifcomp.org and push the big blue <i>Donate</i> button.</p><p><b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b> <br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by law. (Consult a tax professional.)</p><p><b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize list?</b> <br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well! Please visit our prize page to see what objects and services others have donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how you can contribute.</p><p><b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b> <br/>Via PayPal or Venmo. (The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you can’t accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If that doesn’t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we will roll the money into next year’s prize fund, which means it will continue to support authors and IFTF programs.</p>
