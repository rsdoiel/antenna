<p>Less is more. Screenwriters have been reading and hearing that phrase for years. But what does it really mean? It’s about being concise, especially when dealing with screenwriting action lines.&nbsp;<br><br>Less is more is the philosophy that restraint often has greater impact than excess. If you cut away the noise and clutter, what remains feels so much sharper, stronger, and more resonant. It helps maximize the impact of the information.&nbsp;<br><br>In screenwriting and, more specifically, while writing scene descriptions in your script’s action lines, “less is more” has a much deeper meaning. When you maximize your impact with more concise action lines and scene description, <span style="font-weight: bold;">you’re trusting the script reader</span>. It’s about trimming overly-descriptive action lines so the fewer words you use to communicate a cinematic moment actually makes that moment even more cinematic.&nbsp;<br><br>A screenplay isn’t about spelling everything out - it’s about sparking images in the reader’s mind and leaving space for the script readers, actors, directors, and crew to engage their own imagination to visualize the intent of each line of action you write. Using the tools outlined here, we’ll teach you hot to write better action lines in your script.<br><br>Here we’ll delve into how to write great action lines in a screenplay using <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/">Final Draft Screenwriting software</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There seems to be something unique about the 1970s. The decade was filled with political turmoil, the ending of the Vietnam War, global instability, government scandals and a hostage crisis in Iran. There were plenty of monsters in the newspapers, but audiences preferred our monsters on the movie theater screen. Science fiction had been mostly B-movie Roger Corman stories where rubber-suited creatures terrorized unsuspecting humans. <em>Star Wars</em> proved that people wanted more from their space adventures, while <em>Jaws</em> showed that audiences love to be scared.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>We Strangers</em> is a surprising and deeply personal study of race and class in small-town America. The story centers on Ray (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a charming young woman living in Gary, Indiana who’s trying to make ends meet in the gig economy. While she’s determined to pay her bills, she discovers her integrity, self-worth and identity will be tested in unexpected ways.&nbsp;<br><br>Writer-director Anu Valia, a first-generation Indian American, grew up in the Midwest and says she understands the challenges of fitting in when you feel different from those around you. From an early age, she had to learn how to adapt to unfamiliar situations, but that skill also gave her resilience. “I feel like I became very good at tailoring who I was to the surroundings around me. It can be a great gift, a superpower even, but I started asking myself, ‘Where does that leave you? Who are you when you’re always being somebody else?’”</p>

</div> 
<p>Gigi Levangie’s career demonstrates the importance of diligence as a writer.&nbsp;<br><br>She’s a prolific novelist, with several adaptations of her works moving to the screen, including <em>Maneater</em> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810726/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2" style="font-style: italic;">The Starter Wife</a>. She also wrote the 1998 drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120686/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1" style="font-style: italic;">Stepmom</a>. A disciplined creator, she writes at least five days a week, understanding that the first draft doesn’t need to be perfect.<br><br>Her new film is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31314745/" style="font-style: italic;">Trust</a> stars Sophie Turner as a beloved sitcom actor with a dark secret. After a phone hack that violates her privacy, she escapes LA for a solo vacation, but doesn’t find any solitude when a home invasion traps her in a hot-water closet.<br><br>The script was inspired by a real-life story of a woman who ended up stuck in a closet with a hot-water heater instead of finding the bathroom she was looking for. Levangie said she writes very quickly, not wanting to lose momentum when an idea sparks. She also knows that if she’s particularly excited about a premise, it’s likely that someone else somewhere shares her enthusiasm. That’s how the zeitgeist works!<br><br>We asked her about her experience and got tons of great advice for writers wanting to break into the business right now.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: What attracted you to this project?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: I love to write what really captures me. I write spec scripts all the time. So this was part and parcel to my greatest fear, which is to be locked in a closet in a closed space, dark closed space.<br><br>I had read an article a long time ago about a woman who went by herself to a secluded place for a weekend, and in the middle of the night they surmised that she went into a hot water closet instead of the bathroom, and she never made it out. And of course, I saw something like that, I thought, “I have to write this down.”&nbsp;<br><br>I write things quickly. I try to get them down as fast as possible because if I’m feeling this, then I know that it’s out there in the world and somebody else is feeling the same way. So I wrote this, it was an original screenplay, and then I was lucky enough to eventually get it made.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You mentioned that you write fast. What does that look like?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: When I’m writing a screenplay, it’s usually, say, two to three weeks. If I’m writing a novel, it’s a thousand words a day. I think momentum is everything to get a first [draft]. I’m not saying it’s a perfect first draft by any means, but we’re not going for a perfect first draft. We’re going to get from start to finish of a screenplay or a book.&nbsp;<br><br>I read and reread a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/10-Day-Screenplay-How-Write-Days/dp/0692582622" style="font-style: italic;">The 10-Day Screenplay</a> by the Donnelley brothers. I used it to write this screenplay. It’s basically like, day one, you write out the characters, 20 questions for each major character. What’s their internal/external conflict? And from there you write to page 15, to the first big plot point, and then you go on from there. And it just works.&nbsp;<br><br>Now again, it’s not going to be perfect, but I think too many people go for perfect, and they overanalyze, and writing is so visceral to me and so personal that it’s almost like my lifeblood, and I have to get it down, keep it moving, not let it stagnate for at least five, six, seven days a week, whether I’m being paid or not. And most of the time I’m not being paid. That’s an art form. But eventually you might get lucky and something cracks in the universe and you get your movie made.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Two to three weeks is kind of bonkers for speed, so that’s very impressive.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: I’m used to writing novels as well, so to me, a screenplay is fun. It’s dialogue. I can be really jokey within that paradigm. And I think that studio writers, contract writers, they used to have to crank out scripts all the time, very quickly. And I know novelists who crank out a book every six months or at least one a year. It’s possible, but you have to be very, very disciplined.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: So you’re approaching character development with those questions?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gigi Levangie</span>: There are like 20 character questions. What was your home life? Were you raised with religion or not? Do you have a spiritual life? What were your grades like? Were you popular in school? Not popular in school?&nbsp;<br><br>There are so many things that shape us, and it just helps me to really focus on the character. Otherwise, I would jump into the writing too quickly. If I’m really excited by an idea—and I know that when I’m excited by an idea, I know it’s in the zeitgeist, I know that there are other people writing the same thing, so I really want to jump in. But I have to take a day or two, and write out those character sketches and then add to them, take away, add, change as you need.&nbsp;<br><br>Your screenplay, it’s a living thing. It’s a living document. So when you write the screenplay, the first draft is yours. Once you sell it, it takes on a life of its own. And then other people put their thumbprints [on it] for better or worse. So we don’t want to be too precious.<br><br>I like a visceral feel. I like to feel like mistakes are made, but it’s interesting. It doesn’t feel overdeveloped.<br></p>

      <h1>'Casablanca': The Many Writers Who Shaped a Classic</h1>

<p>In 1942, Warner Brothers began production on a romantic wartime melodrama with all the workmanlike routine of any of the other dozens of programmers they churned out each year. No one involved had any clue that this particular assignment would become one of the most famous movies of all time, an Academy Award-winning classic that would transcend generations, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/" style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>There are myriad reasons for its longevity, from the universal emotions of the central love triangle, to the sadly all-too-resonant anti-fascist sentiment, and unforgettable movie star performances, but in trying to determine what authorial voice crafted this near-perfect screenplay, the answer is far messier than the simplicity of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory">auteur theory</a>. In fact, <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span> is one of the greatest examples of cinematic storytelling as total collaboration.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/movies/andrew-sarris-film-critic-dies-at-83.html">Andrew Sarris </a>once called <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span> “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-michael-curtiz-ucla-20180104-story.html">the most decisive exception to the auteur theory</a>,” and in reading the exhaustively researched and endlessly fascinating <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/aljean-harmetz/the-making-of-casablanca/9780786888146/?lens=grand-central-publishing" style="font-style: italic;">The Making of Casablanca</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/aljean-harmetz">Aljean Hermetz</a>, it’s hard to disagree. Hermetz used the meticulous memos that Warners ran off of in its day, comparisons of the many drafts of the screenplay, and interviews with the creatives to paint a picture of the inner workings of the studio system during its Golden Age. Actors, directors and writers alike were seen less as singular artists than as contracted professionals, paid weekly for their specific technical contributions to the construction of a mass-produced product.&nbsp;<br><br>“Warner Brothers was like the assembly line at an automobile plant,” says screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258493/">Julius Epstein</a> in Harmetz’ book, “You were assigned a script, and when you were through with it, the studio would give it to another writer, and someone else would polish it and if you were good at a particular thing, you would do that type of scene on one picture, and another and another.”&nbsp;<br><br>Epstein and his brother <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm16909158/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_philip%2520epstein">Philip</a> were two of the writers assigned to adapt the unproduced play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Everybody Comes To Rick’s</span>, by unknown writers <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122417/">Murray Burnett</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019706/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_1_nm_7_in_0_q_joan%2520alison">Joan Alison</a>, along with fellow contracted screenwriter, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0462321/">Howard Koch</a>. The Epsteins, Burnett and Koch were all very different writers with different strengths, but all had in common that they were staunchly anti-fascist Jewish New Yorkers. In the months after America joined WWII, they injected their firmly held beliefs and contrasting styles into this run-of-the-mill melodrama whose fateful wartime release would make it not only a beloved entertainment, but a political act.&nbsp;<br><br>Top WB screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732452/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_casey%2520robinson">Casey Robinson</a> noted and polished the script under the creative oversight of prolific producer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0909259/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_1_in_0_q_hal%2520b%2520wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> and director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002031/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_3_nm_5_in_0_q_michael%2520curtiz">Michael Curtiz</a>, but writing from all parties continued well into production. Some of the most iconic lines in the film even came from the actors themselves, and the ending wasn’t decided upon until the day they needed to shoot it. So it becomes clear in studying the film’s production, that there is no one, or even two authors of <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span>. It’s the type of classic whose quality is made up of the contrasts and tensions of a great many creative personalities playing tug of war with one of many inconspicuous films they’d be beating into shape that year. The writing of Casablanca is a testament to the merits of collaboration and the studio system working at its best. These are the authors who created <span style="font-style: italic;">Casablanca</span>.</p>

</div> 
<p>I, like many people, have been a fan of <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-poor-things-writer-tony-mcnamara">Tony McNamara</a>’s witty, biting work for several years.&nbsp;<br><br>The screenwriter and playwright has gained fame for his diverse, fanciful stories, featuring colorful characters in even more colorful conflicts. The words that tumble out of their mouths are often shocking or obscene. It makes for punchy, unique comedy.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1110111/">McNamara&nbsp;</a>is twice Oscar-nominated for the delightful <span style="font-style: italic;">Poor Things</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Favourite</span>, both part of his collaboration with director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0487166/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>. He also wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great</span>, a historical comedy about Catherine the Great, which was taken from us too soon.&nbsp;<br><br>He’s gathered additional accolades for projects like <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rage in Placid Lake</span> (which he also directed) and the Disney origin story <span style="font-style: italic;">Cruella</span>.<br><br>His newest project is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Roses</span>, a comedy directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005366/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1">Jay Roach</a>, a retelling of the 1989 black comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">The War of the Roses</span>. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy, the story follows a marriage on the verge of collapse.&nbsp;<br><br>McNamara takes the audience through the building tension of this relationship to an explosive (and hilarious) conclusion, while also finding touching kernels of truth in their conflict - exactly the kind of writing he’s best at.<br><br>We spoke with McNamara about the film and got some of his best advice for screenwriters. If you want to write fun, character-driven comedy, this is the post for you.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: In this film, you have two characters who are deeply in love, but they do terrible things to each other. How do you convey that duality in your writing?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span>: I think I always try to look at real basics of where they’re coming from. I feel like if you’re always writing from some <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-create-an-emotional-through-line-in-your-screenplay">emotional truth</a> of why people want stuff, and how they’re going to go about it, it might not be the best version of going about it as a human being. It can be quite flawed. But as long as you understand that these two, they’re not very good at marriage, but they want it to work. They’re desperately trying a lot of the time, but they’re quite bad at trying.&nbsp;<br><br>You’re just watching people who are flawed trying to get something. Which we all are. I feel like you give them a bit of a pass on some of their behavior because of it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Your dialogue is amazingly sharp, but it manages to get these emotional gut-punches in there as well. How do you find those moments for those barbs?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span>: I think I try and know what everyone’s about. I’m very <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/dialogue-the-art-of-subtext">tonally driven</a> and rhythm-driven. I know that within the rhythm of a scene, there will be moments that take off out of the rhythm that provide more of a punch. A lot of it’s character driven, of where they’re at.&nbsp;<br><br>It is then organizing the scene so that you’re surprising the audience with where they get to. But you’re also like, “Oh, well, of course they said that.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You also have a really pivotal table scene in this movie, which you wrote in an afternoon, I believe.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span>: Yeah. It was one of those things that I think as a writer, sometimes you get it free. I think it was built on all the work of the previous 70 pages and drafts. I’d already done a bunch of drafts of the script.&nbsp;<br><br>I think it’s one of those things when you’re writing a script that’s set over 20 years, they’re quite difficult. And all the sequences before were bunches of scenes set across a couple of weeks or a month … I think the playwright in me went, “I just want to write a big long scene.”&nbsp;<br><br>I wanted a scene where they were in one place for a bunch of time and you really understood where they were, and that they’d been holding it together, and they finally couldn’t.<br><br>And I went, “I’ll just do it as a quick <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/learn/building-screenplay-structure/">three acts</a> over 14 pages or something and see if it works.” I wrote it out really quickly and showed it to my best friend who was a writer on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great</span>, and she was in my office and I said, “Read this. I feel like it’s good.”&nbsp;<br><br>And she was like, “That’s great.” I think it was all built out of a bunch of drafts where that didn’t happen and I hadn’t quite solved how to shift gears and make the rhythm jump up a notch. But yeah, it was like, I got one free for the writing gods for an afternoon.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: Well, it’s an amazing scene, and </span><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-write-a-great-dinner-scene-in-your-screenplay" style="font-weight: bold;">table scenes</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> can be notoriously difficult to write. So it sounds like you approached it with that three-act structure in mind. Are there any other ways that you would recommend attacking a big table scene?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tony McNamara</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> No, I think that’s partly it. I’ve written a bunch of them in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great</span> and other things, and theater, because I started as a playwright, that were very table scene-y.&nbsp;<br><br>I think it was like, “Oh, it’s trying to find a structure,” because they can easily run into just dialogue for no real purpose or get off-line easily.&nbsp;<br><br>I think I was just very conscious of it [being] three acts, and I knew how it started. I think what I felt good about was, I went, “Well, it starts pretty cool and everyone’s pretty chill, and then the table scene is insane.”&nbsp;<br><br>And then there’s the aftermath, which was the scene I really cared about emotionally, but we couldn’t get there without the middle scene. That was the fun bit.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>The 2025 Colossal Fundraiser has begun!</h1>

(date: 2025-08-17, from: <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/792165104576774144">IF Competition Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Hello, friends. </p><p>We are just a couple of weeks away from this year’s IFComp games being released. Are you looking forward to them as much as we are?? IT&rsquo;S SO EXCITING!! <br/><small>(Unless you’re an author who is furiously testing and revising and recompiling and testing and revising and recompiling and… Good luck, authors! You can do it!)</small></p><p><b>While we eagerly await the new games to come, we’d like to ask for your help with the Colossal Fund.</b> If you already know about the fund and are able to contribute, please go to <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">ifcomp.org</a> and <b>hit that blue “Donate with PayPal”</b> button!</p><p><i>If you’d like more information first, keep on reading…</i></p><p>The Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to the top two-thirds of IFComp entries. We use 80% of the funds for that, and the remaining funds are used to provide support for the programs and projects of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>, the <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other projects.</p><h2>This year, we are shooting for $8K.</h2><p><b>We’re now accepting donations for 2025!</b> <br/>The donation button is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name listed on our donor page (or listed as “anonymous” if you prefer)! <br/>Our fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition voting. 80% of the proceeds (~$6.4K if we hit our goal) will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. </p><p><b>What does this mean for authors?</b> <br/>Because we’re dividing the money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the money among the top 50. If we hit our goal, that would mean that the winner of the competition will be offered a prize of $357, second place will be offered $343, third prize $329… and so on and so forth until 50th place, which will be offered $10.  Our goal is to distribute prizes across a broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately well is offered a decent prize. (If you wanna get nerdy, there&rsquo;s information about the formula with a link to a Python script <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/162478013529/announcing-the-ifcomp-colossal-fund">here</a>.)</p><p><b>How do I donate?</b> <br/>Please go to https://ifcomp.org and push the big blue <i>Donate</i> button.</p><p><b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b> <br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by law. (Consult a tax professional.)</p><p><b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize list?</b> <br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well! Please visit our prize page to see what objects and services others have donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how you can contribute.</p><p><b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b> <br/>Via PayPal or Venmo. (The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you can’t accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If that doesn’t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we will roll the money into next year’s prize fund, which means it will continue to support authors and IFTF programs.</p>

<p>Cold querying can be an effective tool to get representation, and to get your scripts read and considered by industry insiders and decision-makers in Hollywood. Don’t let anyone tell you differently.&nbsp;<br><br>When you’re not winning major screenwriting contests and fellowships, and when you don’t know anyone in the industry yet, the cold query is perhaps your best option to break through those Hollywood walls and get noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here we discuss and share simple and effective best practices, directives, habits, and examples you can follow to create a cold querying process that works for you.</p>

<p>When Natalie Messier entered the <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">Final Draft Big Break TV writing competition</a> in 2022, she didn’t expect to win. Her dramedy pilot ‘Killer Queen’, about a woman who discovers her husband is a serial killer, was a sharp, funny, and oddly tender take on the delayed coming-of-age trope, but at that point, she says, “I hadn’t really received much acclaim for anything I’d written.”<br><br>Winning changed everything for Natalie.<br><br>Though she was already working in the writers’ room of NBC’s Chicago Fire as an assistant when she found out she won Big Break’s Grand Prize in the TV Drama category, the recognition gave her new-found confidence. “I told my coworkers about the win, and they were like, ‘Congratulations! Can I read it?’ They read it, and that’s what got me my first episode of television. I probably wouldn’t have shared it with them if I hadn’t won.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Freakier Friday</em> is the tale of four women who end up switching bodies, and must learn what it’s like to walk in someone else’s shoes. This isn’t an original story. In fact, it’s the sequel to <em>Freaky Friday</em> (2003), which is a remake of the original <em>Freaky Friday</em> from 1976, not including the TV movie made in 1995, or the other TV movie/musical from 2018.</p>

      <h1>Write On: 'Sirens' Creator/Showrunner Molly Smith Metzler</h1>

<p>“Our goal in writing [<em>Sirens</em>] was to write something that makes you think, and offers the opportunity to re-examine your own assumptions that you made about these characters. And it’s taxing. We ask some difficult questions. It’s not <em>The Perfect Couple</em>. It’s not a murder show. We’re going after something thematically that’s really large and really ambitious, and that’s why the Greek mythology came to mind. These are epic stories. These are about blood, and moms, and torture, and trauma, and pain. These themes are not tiny. These are complicated, juicy stews,” says showrunner and creator, Molly Smith Metzler about why she wanted to invoke big themes from Greek drama in her TV show <em>Sirens</em>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On today’s episode, we chat with Molly Smith Metzler, showrunner and creator of the hit Netflix limited series <em>Sirens</em> starring Julianne Moore, Meghann Fahy and Kevin Bacon. The show is based on her stage play <em>Elemeno Pea</em> from 2011. Smith Metzler talks about making the transition from playwriting to television and what she learned about being in the writer’s room for <em>Orange is the New Black</em>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Everything you do in a [writer’s] room is an offering. I’m here to serve, I’m here to serve you. Come in with ideas, offer them. If they don’t hit, back off of them. You are a sous chef and a waiter,” she says.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She also talks about writing edgy female characters unapologetically, like the ones in <em>Sirens</em>, and the numerous times she was asked to remove a certain risqué scene from the pilot script – which she refused to do. “We have to write these women in their truest form – they’re complicated, and they don’t have to explain themselves, either. My job is not to soften her so an audience won’t turn off the TV show,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Mild Spoilers Ahead! </em>Zach Cregger’s movies are wildly unique. With his breakout film <em>Barbarian</em>, he played with the fears of anyone staying at an Airbnb realizing that the house is not what it seems. He has followed up this surprise box office hit with <em>Weapons</em>, a twisty, creepy psychological horror movie that plays into every parent’s worst nightmare: their child runs away in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>If you’re an emerging screenwriter, you’ve likely heard it’s a good idea to build a brand or grow your online presence. But putting yourself “out there” can be intimidating, especially if you don’t want to look like a cringey self-promoter or some kind of screenwriting hack.&nbsp;<br><br>The good news is that screenwriter Nic Curcio has figured out a path that feels authentic and engaging and has shared his advice with us. Nic, who wrote on the upcoming animated feature <em>Goat</em> (in theaters February 2026), has steadily grown a loyal following on TikTok by posting screenwriting-related videos that are both educational and entertaining. What started as a side hobby during the pandemic has helped him land meetings, earn extra cheddar, and connect with a larger writing community.<br><br>Before working on <em>Goat</em> and finding a social media following, Nic studied English at UCLA and later earned his MFA in Film/TV Production from USC. His studies at USC gave him hands-on experience in various aspects of filmmaking, but writing is where he found his strongest voice.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2019, his feature script <em>Barron: A Tale of Love, Loss and Legacy</em>, was featured on the annual Black List, a ranking of Hollywood’s best unproduced scripts (yes, it’s a fictional story about a young Barron Trump!). From there, he landed a job as an in-house writer at Sony Animation, where he spent over a year rewriting and shaping <em>Goat</em> while working closely with the animation team. He has since written projects for Paramount and Universal, including a feature adaptation of the comic <em>Planet of the Nerds</em> and a new take on <em>The Magic School Bus</em>. In addition to all of this, he also finds time to co-host the podcast <em>Hollywood Hang</em> with fellow screenwriter Kristen Tepper.&nbsp;</p>
