Artist for the 2024 Logo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: IF Competition Blog</p>
<h2>
We are looking for art for this year’s IFComp logo! We will pay a $250
commission.
</h2>
<p>
Artists should express interest by sending us a link to their past
work/portfolio via email:
<b><a href="http://ifcomp.org">ifcomp@ifcomp.org</a></b> by July 15; the
artist will be selected by the end of July.
</p>
<p>
More info:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We will request one rough draft for review / edit before the final logo
is produced.
</li>
<li>
We must have the final art in hand by August 25th.
</li>
<li>
We will need three versions of the logo: one with no text, one that says
‘IFComp’, and one that says ‘IFComp 2024’.
</li>
<li>
The final image file will be created or scanned at 3600 x 3600 px, and
the design should still be clearly legible when reduced for display at
250 x 250 px for the web.
</li>
<li>
If you incorporate a person (optional) we ask that you make the person’s
gender ambiguous.
</li>
<li>
We ask that you integrate the IFTF logo into the art in some way.
</li>
<li>
The IFComp logo should imply / be inspired by the many genres of games
people make.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will also request an invoice from the artist that the includes the
following terms:
</p>
<blockquote class="npf_indented">
<p>
<i>The Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation has the right to use
the image in whole or in part, in world-wide publishing, print, or on
any merchandise for an unlimited time. </i><br/><i>The artists reserves
the right to use or edit the work to be used in their portfolio.
<br/>The artist will be paid $250 US dollars, sent by PayPal or Venmo,
upon receipt of final image file. IFComp will cover currency conversion
fees charged by PayPal</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you are an artist thinking about making something for this year’s
competition (e.g. cover art or a game), the logo may not be or have an
obvious reference to an entry submitted this year. We are still open to
artists participating in any way, whether it be submitting a game or
doing art for an author, in this year’s competition.
</p>
<p>
Here are the last few years’ logos, just to give you an idea of what
we’re looking for…

<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
Romance Writers of America filed for bankruptcy in May 2024 in the
Southern District of Texas. The RWA was unable to pay the hotel
contracts for their annual conferences after membership plummeted
following a series of high-profile controversies. The RWA owes about $3
million to hotels, and almost $75,000 to other creditors.
</p>
<p>
The main cause of the fiscal problems is a long-term contract RWA signed
with Marriott Hotels to host

Hello, everyone, and happy (slightly belated) start of July! With a new

Final entries are due on <b>August 28th</b>, 11:59pm Eastern, but you
must register by <b>August 1st</b>! <br/>That’s right… <b>everything is
one month earlier this year!</b>
</p>
<p>
If you miss it, there’s always 2025… If you register and then can’t

The Wild Cards universe is a fertile play­ground for writers, as its

the universe departs from ours in 1946, when an alien virus arrives on
Earth. Ninety percent of those who contract it die; the DNA of the ten

<p>
Wendy writes speculative poetry, which is “what we consider genre
poetry. Just as there are science fiction and fantasy authors, and you
would know what their genre is and what they write, poetry also has
genre, it’s not always literary.”
</p>
<p>
Speculative poetry covers as broad a range of topics as novels and short
stories. “You could be doing poems about vampires, you could be doing
poems about dragons. Those are fantasy elements. Or you could be doing
hard science fiction concepts to the same tropes that a science fiction
or fantasy author would use for their novels.”
</p>
<p>
One subset of speculative poetry is ScFiKu, which is a form of haiku
based on science fiction themes. “We incorporate technical words, we
have science fiction, astronomy themes, things of that nature in our
haiku poems.”
</p>
<p>
Wendy got into speculative poetry by chance, when, at a local science
fiction convention, she wanted to get out of the sun, and decided to
check out a poetry workshop. It turned out that she was the only
student; the workshop leader said that all the other participants were
“just friends of mine. They’re all editors of National Poetry magazines
that have come to support me.” Wendy worked on a poem, read it out, and
“one of these editors happened to be sitting close to me, leaned over
and whispered into my ear, I loved your poem, I want to publish it, I’ll
pay you. And that is the day I became a poet.”
</p>
<p>
Wendy isn’t just a poet; she has also written a Regency romance, <em>The
Curate’s Brother: A Jane Austen Variation of Persuasion</em>. I asked
her what the Regency was. “King George became mad, he was suffering from
mental illness. And so his son had to take over, but because his son was
not confirmed, he was called a regent for his father.”
</p>
<p>
The Regency period only lasted about ten years. “But it was a period of
great change in English. The old aristocratic societies were falling to
the wayside. And new people were coming up from the commoners to fill
the ranks.” As to why this is such a popular period for romance novels,
Wendy said, “I really credit Austen for that. She was a woman of that
time period, and she was writing stories about the women that she knew
and the plight of women of her time. It was like she was writing a
contemporary romance before we even had a genre called romance. In a
sense, she and a few others of her time developed the genre.”
</p>
<p>
Wendy has been using Scrivener since the beginning of her writing,
having discovered the app during
<a href="https://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>. She likes
to type on an AlphaSmart Neo, a small electronic typewriter, and, “at
the end of the day, I download whatever I’ve written for the day into
Scrivener. Scrivener was a great way to organize my book while I was
drafting it, and then when you’re editing, it’s very easy to move things
around.” She uses a system of color-coding for scenes in the Binder. “I
color-code each scene. So I color-code them either as good, or bad, so
good is green, a rejected scene is red.” This helps her organize her
work as she progresses in her drafts.
</p>
<p>
In addition to being an author, Wendy edits poetry anthologies, and uses
Scrivener to manage those as well. She creates folders for each poet,
files for each poem, and adds more information in notes in the
Inspector, such as poets biographies and emails. “I just find nothing
goes astray each anthology, and I’ve done eight now. It can be pretty
busy managing an anthology as an editor, and I find Scrivener has become
my go-to place to organize them.”
