Dan Gilroy has spent decades mastering the art of character-driven
storytelling, from his gritty noir thriller <em>Nightcrawler</em> to his
work on <em>Andor</em>, the <em>Star Wars</em> series that has redefined
what science fiction television can accomplish. <br><br>Gilroy wrote the
three-episode arc that includes the Ghorman massacre and Mon Mothma’s
(Genevieve O’Reilly) dramatic escape from the Senate. The episodes are
standouts in a magnificent season of rich, complex TV. <br><br>As
someone who has loved <em>Star Wars</em> since infancy, <em>Andor</em>
feels like a miracle to me. It’s adult, dark, and grounded writing that
deals with complicated people in impossible situations, making for some
of the realest, most complicated <em>Star Wars</em> adventures in the
franchise. Little 1999 me could have never imagined she’d get the chance
to dissect some of her favorite intergalactic moments with its writers,
but here we are.<br><br>And I learned a ton from our conversation. As a
writer, Gilroy understands that the biggest conflicts mean nothing
without intimate human stakes, a philosophy that shines through in his
episodes, in which personal betrayals and political awakenings unfurl
against the backdrop of a growing rebellion.<br><br>In our discussion,
he told us about his habit of developing a unique visual style for every
script and his philosophy on trusting audiences with minimal exposition.
He also shares his wisdom about finding your voice as a writer, why
writers don’t need interpersonal skills to succeed, and how to write
action sequences that prioritize character over
spectacle.<br><br><em>Editor’s note: The following interview has been
edited for length and clarity.</em><br>

<p>
It’s uniquely refreshing to encounter a novel that genuinely breathes
new life into a trope or a subgenre that seemed to be played out. I’ve
been experiencing “multiverse fatigue” for quite a while now,
immediately skeptical that an alternate-reality narrative can go
anywhere meaningful; and I was completely charmed by

v. Anthropic: Class Certification at Issue for Book Authors in AI
Copyright Litigation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>Back in October, I asked a simple but unresolved question: “Who
represents you in the AI copyright suits?” Now, eight months later,
we’re getting closer to an answer—at least for some authors. In Bartz v.
Anthropic, one of the fastest-moving lawsuits over the use of
copyrighted works to train generative AI systems, the plaintiffs have
asked the court to certify a class of authors whose books were allegedly
copied without permission.</p>

“In my mind, Belle is going through life, at least our version of Belle
– I’ve never met the real Belle – she’s going through life with this
hole inside, this overwhelming need for approval, that social media
absolutely capitalizes on, and she just keeps trying to feed the beast.
She hasn’t grown up with the healthiest of role models herself. She has
learnt that being sick is a shortcut to being loved and to getting
attention,” says Samantha Strauss, creator and showrunner for the
Netflix limited series <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em>, about understanding
her main character’s disgraceful motivation to lie about having brain
cancer. <br><br>Adapted from the book, <em>The Woman Who Fooled the
World</em>, by Beau Donelly and Nick Toscano, <em>Apple Cider
Vinegar</em> chronicles the incredible and heartbreaking rise and fall
of the real Belle Gibson (Kaitlin Dever), a notorious health and
wellness “scamfluencer.”<br><br>Strauss talks about starting her young
life in Australia as a ballet dancer before a terrible injury led her to
discover TV writing. She also talks about how her previous TV show,
<em>The End</em>, got the attention of Nicole Kidman who championed her
writing career. Strauss gushes about how she was inspired by Kidman’s
“fierce intelligence, just exactly what you’d expect, and rigor. You
know, she would be giving notes at the end of a really long day of
filming. She wasn’t resting on her laurels at all. There’s just such a
generosity of spirit there and to think she’s helped other emerging
Australian creatives is pretty special.”<br><br>Strauss discusses the
challenges of adapting a true story while the subject is still alive,
tips and tricks for making the show feel immediate and seductive while
mimicking the addictive nature of social media, and getting the primal
relationship of mothers and daughters authentic on screen. <br><br>To
hear more about <em>Apple Cider Vinegar</em> and Strauss’s advice for
writers adapting true stories, listen to the podcast. <br><br>

Among the most hotly anticipated movies of the summer are two
live-action remakes of recent animated classics,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11655566/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_3_nm_4_in_0_q_lilo%2520"><em>Lilo
&amp; Stitch</em></a>, releasing May 23, and
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26743210/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_how%2520to%2520train%2520your%2520dr" style="font-style: italic;">How
To Train Your Dragon</a>, coming just a few weeks later on June 13. What
many may not know, is that both of the original animated films share the
same writing/directing team. One half of that team is
<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0761498/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_chris%2520sanders">Chris
Sanders</a>, who wrote and directed last year’s Academy Award-nominated
hit,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29623480/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520wild%2520robot" style="font-style: italic;">The
Wild Robot</a> (2024). The other half, who is returning to direct the
live action remake of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dragon</span>,
is Canadian animator and filmmaker
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0213450/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_in_0_q_dean%2520debloi">Dean
DeBlois.</a> The return may seem almost obligatory for the man who
spearheaded the animated franchise, but in tracing DeBlois’ origins and
filmmaking ambitions back to his boyhood love of comic books and
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_star%2520wars" style="font-style: italic;">Star
Wars</a> in the 1980s, it’s easy to see why writing and directing the
live action remake of his own film makes all the sense in the
world.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read more:

Wild Robot’ Screenwriter Chris Sanders Tells How to Write for
Animation</a><br> <br>DeBlois started out drawing homemade comics,
transitioned into animation, and rose the ranks at Disney until Sanders
took note of his innate, passionate storytelling sense, and brought him
on to co-write/co-direct the original
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4_tt_7_nm_0_in_0_q_lilo%2520%2526%2520stit" style="font-style: italic;">Lilo
&amp; Stitch</a> (2002) and

(2010) with him. All the while, DeBlois dreamed of being able to direct
a live action film until he finally received his shot with this summer’s
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dragon</span>. The common thread
between every step he took is a very pure love and reverence for the
creative process and craft of visual storytelling, and a hard work
ethic. DeBlois’ story is truly a case study for when preparation meets
opportunity. By taking his career one story, one scene, one frame at a
time, Dean DeBlois carved his way into cinema history.

I spent a bit of time, while reading Oliver K. Langmead &amp; Aliya
Whiteley’s <strong>City of All Seasons,</strong> wondering whether the
title was careless or a clue, because the novel appears to describe a
city, or versions of a city, in which only two of the four seasons
matter. What we are

I sincerely doubt whether I will encounter another novel as sheerly
enjoyable as <b>Anima Rising</b> over the rest of my reading days during
2025—and perhaps beyond. It now occupies the spot formerly held by
