“Thoughtful social commentary about race and the justice system is baked

<strong>Urban Fantasy: Exploring Modernity through Magic</strong>,
Stefan Ekman (Lever Press 978-1643150642, $26.99, 351pp, tp) August
2024.

<p>
Stefan Ekman opens his engrossing new study <strong>Urban Fantasy:
Exploring Modernity through Magic </strong>by admitting that ‘‘I began
reading urban fantasy in the 1990s, not quite knowing that I did so.’’
He’s not the only one. Over the past few decades, the term seems to have
evolved into a sort of catchall, defined

<h2 id="rules-for-2024-ifdb-awards">Rules for 2024 IFDB Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: IF Database News</p>
The IFDB Awards is an annual competition designed to award excellence in
creating interactive fiction.It is held from February 1st to the first
weekend after February 15th each year on the Interactive Fiction
Database, and take the form of polls.
</P>
Votes are public but anonymized. Every IFDB member is eligible to vote,
except for one special poll, the Author’s Choice Poll. Eligibility to
vote in the Author’s Choice competition is determined by having a game
linked to your IFDB profile (this can be found by editing a game page
and use the ‘Link to Author’s Profile’ feature. Authors added
incorrectly to a game will not be permitted to vote (for instance, if
someone associates a random game they didn’t make to their account).
</P>
<p>Rules for discussion and voting <br> -Voting must be in good faith
and be based on personal experience with the games involved.<br></p>
<p>-Campaigning or organizing voting is not allowed if it breaks the
above rule.<br></p>
<p>-Discussion of games on merit is allowed and encouraged.<br></p>
<p>-There is no hard limit on how many votes a person can cast in each
poll for different games. A player voting for so many games that it
makes voting difficult for others (such as voting for every game from
the whole year) may have their votes removed, but only after
warning.<br></p>
-Author cannot vote for their own games. Such votes will be removed so
that the running tallies are correct. Authors can post about their own
games (for instance on intfiction) as long as doesn’t encourage people
to break the rules (such as telling people to vote for your game even if
they haven’t played it).
</P>
Code of conduct
</P>
-Voters must abide by the
<A HREF="https://ifdb.org/code-of-conduct">IFDB Code of Conduct</A>.
Harassment of other voters (including on other platforms) and creating
multiple accounts for one person are prohibited.
</P>
Moderation -Votes that are cast incorrectly (for instance, voting for a
Twine game in a Choicescript poll) or fraudulently (for instance, using
sockpuppet accounts) may be removed.
</P>
<p>Eligibility <br> -For most polls, games are eligible if they are
listed on IFDB and have a publication date during 2024.<br></p>
<p>-For system-specific polls, games additionally must have the
appropriate system or genre listed on their IFDB page under the
specified field.<br></p>
<p>-Each poll will have a link to an IFDB search listing suggested
games. Outside of system-based polls, users can vote for any game they
feel fits the criteria.<br></p>
<p>-Any IFDB user can edit game pages to confirm eligibility. However,
malicious editing (such as adding every genre to a game or adding
incorrect systems to a game) will be reverted or removed.<br></p>
<p>-Any game author can opt out of the competition. Adding a note to the
game page during the competition may be helpful to let others know not
to vote for it, but opting out should be officially done by messaging
the organizer (me, for now).<br></p>
</P>
<p>Results <br> -Results will be clearly visible throughout the poll.
However, there will be a grace period of up to 3 days at the end to
allow checking of votes before the official announcements, which will be
made on Intfiction and IFDB.<br></p>
-Polls with very low traffic will not have a winner awarded. This is
left up to organizer discretion, but low traffic may include less than 5
votes for the winning game or less than ten votes total cast.
</P>
Future of Awards
</P>
One of the main purposes of these new awards is to be community-owned
and regular. They need to keep working even if I don’t keep working.
</P>
The awards begin on February 1st of each year. If Feb 1st passes without
the current organizer having created the polls, anyone can create the
polls themselves.
</P>
<p>The community can propose new changes to awards or new organizers via
public discussion. A public yes/no poll on intfiction with more than 50%
voting yes can be used to add new organizers. Current organizers can
also add in other organizers or successors, subject to a public
veto.</p>

‘Rabbit Trap’ Screenplay Took Shape</h2>

<p>
For his feature debut and Sundance premiere <em>Rabbit Trap</em>,
writer/director Bryn Chainey took what might seem like an unconventional
path to develop the period horror story. <br><br>After drafting two
unproduced features with the goal of trying to fit industry
expectations, Chainey decided to follow his creative instincts wherever
they led. The result is a genre-defying work that weaves together folk
horror elements with experimental music and striking visuals, emerging
from a deeply personal creative process.<br><br>In <em>Rabbit Trap</em>,
Daphne (Rosy McEwen) and Darcy (Dev Patel) move to the 1970s Welsh
countryside to work on Daphne’s experimental album. Her music is full of
droning, buzzing, theremin and spoken vocals. Darcy spends his days
recording audio on the moors, until one day he picks up a strange
vibration. Nightmares keep him up at night. Then, one day, they see a
puckish child (Jade Croot) watching their cottage—and he’s soon enmeshed
in their lives in a way that threatens all of them.<br><br>Instead of
traditional outlining, Chainey said he started with his
fascinations—images, sounds, and ideas that captured his imagination.
Through journaling and self-interrogation, he allowed sometimes
seemingly disconnected elements to find their own
connections.<br><br>Landscapes morphed into scenes, musical patterns
suggested character moments, and even the growth patterns of mushrooms
influenced the film’s visual language. It’s a unique process and a way
to connect thematic and visual threads. What results is an atmospheric
story and one of the strongest folk horror tales I’ve seen in
years.<br><br>Final Draft chatted with the filmmaker just before his
Sundance premiere at a very chilly Eccles. <br><br>Chainey opened up
about his distinctive approach to screenwriting, his methods for solving
creative problems, and why staying true to your artistic vision might be
the most important lesson any filmmaker can learn. <br><br>His insights
offer valuable guidance for creators looking to find their own path
through the murky landscape of independent film. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: So you’re blending a few
different things in the script. You’ve got folk horror. You’ve got
experimental music elements. How do you approach putting that all on the
page? </span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bryn
Chainey</span>: For me, I do a lot of journaling. When I write, I get
fixated on certain things at different times. I get a certain kind of
music or a landscape or an image or a color, and I just journal. I’m
like, “Okay, Bryn”—I do it as questions. Why is this interesting to you?
Is it because this is, is it somehow scary to you? Are you intimidated
by this? And I just ask myself questions. <br><br>And so I end up with
just pages and pages of just ranting, rambling, kind of just asking
myself what’s going on. And along the way, rhymes happen in a
way. <br><br>I say, “Oh, what I’m fascinated by in the music is actually
connected to why I’m interested in mushrooms and the way they grow,” and
along the way I find the connection points and they just coalesce.

In her debut novel, Sheri T. Joseph mixes frus­tratingly messy politics
with painfully messy personal affairs to create a riveting novel of the
not-far-enough-away future. It’s a future of familiar challenges –

privacy. Joseph uses three key characters, and their love triangle, to

“Fugler [Robert Carlyle] was a character that I really connected with
from the beginning. I know it sounds a little strange that the Nazi was
my way into this, but it really was that idea of, ‘How can we get inside
his head and make sure that he’s a fully fleshed out person that way?’”
says Josh Salzberg about trying to make his villain, a Nazi named Damien
Fugler, a three-dimensional character.<br><br>Josh Salzberg wrote the
screenplay for <em>The Performance</em> with co-writer/director Shira
Piven. In this episode, Salzberg talks about the challenges of adapting
a short story by playwright Arthur Miller that’s about a Jewish-American
tap dancer [Jeremy Piven], who’s willing to compromise his own core
values to find fame and fortune in Nazi Germany. <br><br>“The idea of
all [the characters] is that they’re all performing on some level. They
all have another life. And that’s true to show business, that we all
have sides of ourselves that we’re not sure we want everybody to see or
that it’s okay for everybody to see. And then in Berlin in the ’30s,
there’s all these different communities that were impacted – not just
the Jews in Germany,” he says. <br><br>Salzberg also talks about his
background as a film editor, how it helped him transition to
screenwriting, and the challenges of writing morally compromised
characters like his protagonist, Harold [Jeremy Piven]. <br><br>“I think
embracing the mistakes that they make, embracing those flaws and leaning
into that is important. Sometimes we can care about our characters to
the point where we want them to be likable, which is a note we always
get, but we’ve got to be okay with the mistakes – and the consequences
for those mistakes. And that was a lesson that Shira and I kept learning
as we were developing the script,” he says. <br><br>To hear more about
Salzberg’s writing process, listen to the podcast. <br><br><em>Please
note: this episode contains discussions regarding racism and
anti-semitism. </em><br><br>

diversity in the upper classes, the garish wardrobe, the playful
disregard for historical accuracy, the overly dramatic rela­tionship

a Movie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: John August blog</p>
<p>Structure is the fundamental skeleton of every story ever told, so
why does it flummox so many writers? John and Craig outline what
structure really is, ways to find it in your story, and how to keep it
from tying your brain in knots. We also look at ways to find nuance in
our appreciation […] The post

Writers of duologies aren’t doing any favors for book reviewers. With a
trilogy, we can blather on about middle-book syndrome and three-act
structures; with an ongoing series, we can spec­ulate about
metanarratives or simply rate each new volume as though it were the
latest album from a familiar band, but a duology somehow seems to

Screenwriting Lessons from Golden-Globe Winner ‘The Brutalist’</h2>

This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best
Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The
Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out
of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László
Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent
lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build
a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The
Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely
unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).

<strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by
big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat
includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering
projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so
much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively
small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but

in our lives, it has also begun inflecting and informing works of
fiction, whose authors imag­ine how the remainder of the 21st century
will play out. Interestingly, it is writers coming from outside the
traditional venues of SFF writing and publishing who have most readily
