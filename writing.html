Repeat Room by Jesse Ball: Review by Jake Casella Brookins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-23, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>The Repeat Room</strong>, Jesse Ball (Catapult
978-1-64622-140-0, 256pp, $27.00, hc) Cover by Sara Wood. September
2024.
</p>
<p>
We have such a cornucopia of dystopias right now, fictional and
otherwise, that they’ve really got to do something different to catch my
attention. <strong>The Repeat Room</strong>, the latest novel from the
prolific Jesse Ball, captured it thoroughly: haunting, spare, and
inventive, it’s a bleak tale that’s nonetheless rich with sparkling
turns

<h2 id="new-star-rating-control">New Star Rating Control</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: IF Database News</p>
<p>
There’s a new star rating control, designed for accessibility. We’d love
to get your feedback on it
<a href="https://intfiction.org/t/ifdb-has-a-new-star-rating-control/71812">on
the intfiction.org forum</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The new star controls are designed to be bigger, easier to tap on on
touchscreens.
</li>
<li>
Theyre also designed to be keyboard accessible. You can use tab to focus
on the star control, and then use arrow keys to select a rating. (When
you do this, you have to tab over to the new “Submit Rating” button to
submit your selection.)
</li>
<li>
Under the hood, theyre secretly radio buttons, so users of screen
readers will interact with them like radio buttons.
</li>
<li>
Weve replaced the little star icons with new SVG icons. I think theyre
nicer to look at, especially on high-resolution screens (like phones).

The longer I review science fiction, the more I notice how it much it
depends on recycling tropes – not just repeating but extending and
varying and inverting them – and, I suspect, refitting them to reflect
current anxieties or hopes, conscious or not. This time the recognition
lights have been set flashing by
