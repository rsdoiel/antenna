her programming.

You know Ehren Kruger. He has written some of the biggest blockbusters
of the last 20 years, two of which were the highest grossing films of
their respective year: <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</em>
(2009) and <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> (2022). Further back, in 2002, he
scared the hell out of us with <em>The Ring</em>.

I sometimes find myself wondering whether the recurrence of a motif or
trope or set­ting in some slice of SF history represents a kind of
collective anxiety dream – certainly the postnuclear-apocalypse stories
that were common when I was first reading SF in the 1950s were not
utterly disconnected from the duck-and-cover drills I recall.

David Koepp is a Hollywood legend. One of the most successful
screenwriters of all time, Koepp is the iconic voice behind works like
<em>Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Death Becomes Her, Mission:
Impossible</em>, and many more. <br><br>Koepp is known for his
versatility. He has achieved both critical and commercial success in a
wide variety of genres, including thriller, science fiction, comedy,
action, drama, crime, superhero, horror,
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/big-break-winners-sell-true-life-adventure-script-faster-than-horses">adventure</a>,
and fantasy. He can write in essentially any world or tone and deliver
consistent blockbusters. <br><br>Recently, he rejoined Steven Spielberg
to take on dinosaurs again for <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em>, the next
entry in the <em>Jurassic</em> franchise. Set five years after the
events of

become mostly inhospitable to dinosaurs, leaving them only the tropical

Edwards, the film stars Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, and
Mahershala Ali.<br><br>We were delighted to be able to speak with Koepp
ahead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Jurassic World Rebirth</span>

Most screenwriters focus heavily on their original spec scripts
(screenplays written under speculation that they will be sold) — and
rightfully so. We get into screenwriting because we have cinematic
stories we want to tell. <br><br>However, a majority of screenwriting
contracts both in and out of the Hollywood system entail screenwriters
writing other people’s ideas. That’s right — a majority of what you will
be doing as a professional screenwriter is a work-for-hire experience
where you will be developing and writing screenplays based on other
people’s concept, intellectual property, and, yes, rewriting other
people’s screenplays. <br><br>Here we offer a look into the world of pro
screenwriting contracts, namely writing assignments where a screenwriter
is being brought in to rewrite a script that a company owns — a script
that was written by another screenwriter.

When it comes to being a screenwriter, the creative process is a very
personal thing; almost as personal as our voice. That voice is what
distinguishes our script from the next, and when it comes to completing
a script – no matter how inspired we are – getting all those words on
the page can sometimes feel like an insurmountable
task. <br><br>Therefore, it’s up to our Creative Process, capital C,
capital P, to get the job done! The story wants to come out: we’ve taken
up the screenwriter mantle for a reason. Our Creative Process is the
thing that will get us to that outcome, so we must invest in cultivating
a solid one.<br><br>So when motivation is flagging, the muse has taken
up residence elsewhere, the world is feeling heavy, and yet, that tiny
little spark of <em>I must write to keep breathing</em> won’t let go of
you—what’s a creative writer to do? <br><br>One way to keep
screenwriting while the world feels like it’s on fire is to set your
intentions—and then follow through with them.

<p>
The March Strange Horizons features a great mix of fiction and poetry,
including <strong>Nico Martinez Nocito</strong>’s poem “<strong>To Be
the Change</strong>”, which centers a prophecy foretelling the fall of a
powerful magic family. The family cannot fathom what it might mean that
their dominance will end when their heir (always a man) becomes a
daughter.

<p>The NIH Public Access Policy is in effect as of July 1, 2025. In
response, Authors Alliance and SPARC have created a form to collect
information about challenges or questions faced by authors, librarians
and their institutions in complying with the roll out of new public

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: John August blog</p>
<p>
On Scriptnotes, we often explore craft topics, looking at the specific
choices writers make on the page. But there’s an obvious challenge when
discussing visual storytelling in an audio medium. That’s why for the
most recent Scripnotes video, I wanted to revisit my conversation with
Christina Hodson on writing action sequences. In this new format, […]

“One thing I’ve found in the crime genre is that homicides are always
interesting. When somebody’s killed, whatever that case may be, it’s
usually compelling drama. So then it’s up to you as the writer to
surprise the audience and do things that they didn’t think were coming.
I’ve described it like this before: If you can hit the sweet spot of, ‘I
didn’t see that coming! I should have seen it coming, but I didn’t see
it coming,’ That, to me, is the best writing. It’s like, when you got to
the end of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, and you were like, ‘Oh my god, I
should have seen that coming!’ That was great writing,” says Derek Haas,
creator and writer for the show <em>Countdown</em> on Prime. <br><br>You
may know Derek Haas from the popular NBC procedural dramas like
<em>Chicago Med, Chicago Fire</em> and <em>Chicago PD</em>. Now, he’s
got a new crime drama on Prime called <em>Countdown</em> that tells one
twisty crime story over 13 episodes – all written by Haas. Set in Los
Angeles, <em>Countdown</em> follows a secret task force who discover a
sinister international plot that threatens millions of lives. The show
stars Eric Dane, Jensen Ackles and Jessica Camacho as undercover agents
all harboring dark secrets of their own. <br><br>On this episode of the
podcast, we chat with Haas about starting his career as a crime
novelist, writing movies like<em> 2 Fast 2 Furious, 3:10 to Yuma</em>
and <em>Wanted</em> before making the switch to TV. Haas talks about
working with director John Singleton, prolific TV producer Dick Wolf and
writing characters that hook audiences. He also shares his advice for
writing action sequences that both stun visually and surprise the
audience. <br><br>“When I think about action sequences, I always go back
to <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. My favorite action sequence of any
movie ever is when Indiana Jones has to fight this gigantic Nazi guy,
and – in any other movie – that would have been the only thing that’s
happening. But they put Marion in a plane where she gets trapped because
the cover of the plane closes. Then the plane’s propellers start
spinning. The plane starts spinning, gas is leaking out of the plane,
there’s other people running by with machine guns. So it’s not just,
‘Oh, here’s a fight,’ it’s ‘Here’s a fight, but there’s eight other
things happening at once.’ I really try to do that in these chase
sequences, because you have seen a million of them. What’s the other
factors I can bring to it? How can I show you something you haven’t seen
before? Sometimes it’s character, and sometimes, it’s the stunt itself,”
says Haas. <br><br>To hear more screenwriting advice from Haas, listen
to the podcast.

Author-Library Alliance: Supporting Fair eBook Legislation Together</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>In May 2025, Connecticut’s legislature passed landmark legislation to
address restrictive ebook licensing practices that limit libraries’
ability to serve the public. It aims to ensure ebook licenses align more
closely with  libraries’ core public interest mission of lending,
access, and preservation. This represents a pivotal step toward
safeguarding the role of libraries in the digital age. As more states
consider similar measures, a key question arises: Should authors support
these efforts? The answer is unequivocally yes— and here’s why.</p>
