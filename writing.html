<strong>Sinophagia: A Celebration of Chinese Horror </strong>is a
carefully curated anthology of contemporary Chinese horror. It’s a
cultural fest that arrives with triggers warnings of corpses, childhood
trauma, self-harm, torture, graphic violence, domestic violence,
strangulation and, strangely, coercion/gaslighting – not commonly
associated with hor­ror, but typical of psychological abuse.
