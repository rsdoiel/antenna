“The most subversive thing this show could do is make you cry… If you
really boil down television, really cook it in the pan, it’s the
character business. I’m in the character business. Movies are in the
plot and spectacle business, for television, there’s a thing about
laying in bed and watching someone in your bedroom or living room that
you really care about, you’re inviting these people into your house. The
more you care about them, the more your show will succeed. There’s no
simple formula, but you could boil down every single TV show to if the
characters work, that show is likely going to work. If the characters
don’t work, no matter what that show is, no matter how much money you
throw at it, that show is not going to work,” says Eric Kripke, creator
and showrunner for <em>The Boys</em> on Prime Video. <br><br>In this
special episode hosted by screenwriting career coach Lee Jessup live
from the Writers Guild Foundation in Los Angeles, Kripke talks about the
functions of a showrunner, the excellent training he got doing 15
seasons of the show <em>Supernatural</em>, and what it’s like when the
real world mirrors the darker aspects of <em>The
Boys</em>. <br><br>Kripke also shares his sage advice for writing
dialogue. <br><br>“I was interviewing people about their life
experiences – it was a romantic comedy so I was asking people about
their love lives. I wanted to transcribe it, so I had about 20 hours of
material that I’m just transcribing and that’s how I learned to write
dialogue, just from doing that because you learn how people really
speak. No one speaks in straight, declarative sentences. It’s this
weaving thing where they’ll start and they’ll back away and throw in a
new idea. When you start to pay attention to what real language looks
like on a page, it’s very different than what you think it looks like.
So, to know what it looked like and how to recreate it, was huge. I
recommend everyone try that,” says Kripke. <br><br>To hear more, listen
to the podcast. <br><br>You can also watch this episode

If you’re a beginner writer and you’ve read about a new “spec sale” in
the trades, you might not know what all the fuss is about. <br><br>A
spec sale is when
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-spec-script">a spec
script</a> has been purchased by a studio or production company (a spec
script being an original screenplay that you’ve written on your own and
not on assignment).  <br><br>Spec sales have always piqued the
imagination of aspiring screenwriters and people working in the film
business, especially in a marketplace that’s increasingly dependent on
established IPs (intellectual properties). Just the idea that someone
came up with <span style="font-style: italic;">an original idea for a
movie</span> and then <span style="font-style: italic;">sold it</span>
almost seems like a fantastical feat, and the bigger the sale, the more
wonder it inspires. <br><br>Big spec sales aren’t a daily event, and
when they do happen, everyone gets very excited about the news. It can
create a long-lasting career for a screenwriter if they have good
representation and make the most of their newfound “heat” (i.e. industry
buzz). <br><br>Sometimes the spec script you sold doesn’t even have to
end up getting produced in order for it to create a career for you. I
broke into the film business with
<a href="https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/carrey-reitman-team-for-pierre-1117981909/">a
big spec sale</a> that got a lot of attention for several years. In
fact, that script <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> gets
brought up to me whenever I meet someone who was working in the industry
back when we sold it. This proves that spec sales not only pique the
imagination, stir excitement and create a buzz: they stick in the minds
of people for years to come.<br><br>Every screenwriter’s journey is
going to be different, but for me there were six degrees to my spec
sale.

Despite what Robert Frost may have thought, a lot of SFF writers really
do love a wall. Walled and isolated cities, redoubts, or keeps (to use
the term favored by <strong>The Science Fiction Encyclopedia</strong>)
have proved useful to SFF for exploring everything from overpopulation
to alien invasions to environmental catastrophe to those pesky tech

Erin Wagner’s debut novel is a highly sophisticated tale, constructed in
clever fashion, which revolves around the classic motif of human versus
nonhuman, specifically man against android. It does not necessarily
expand the frontiers of this theme—Wagner’s sociological and
technological speculations about androids and their uses hew pretty
closely to the standard SF textbook,
