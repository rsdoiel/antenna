“I think it was more like a litmus test of, where is the script? How
would it be received? With this script, I was a quarter finalist in some
competitions, and this was obviously the most exciting, the winning… I
just wanted to really put my best foot forward, and with this script, I
was like, okay, I actually feel like I’m confident and ready,” says Maia
Mulcahy, Grand Prize TV winner of the 2024 Final Draft Big Break
Contest.<br><br>In this episode hosted by screenwriting career coach Lee
Jessup,
<a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">Final
Draft Big Break Contest</a> 2024 Grand Prize winners Laura Kroeger and
Maia Mulcahy talk about working in the industry, writers’ groups and
mentors, and the ups and downs of submitting to and winning a respected
screenwriting competition.<br><br>Laura Kroeger won the Feature Film
category for her dramatic feature script “Bigger in Texas,” which
follows a wealthy woman in Texas who loses everything and, with a
partner, blackmails powerful men by exploiting a real law in Texas that
limits the amount of sex toys a person can own. <br><br>Maia Mulcahy won
the TV category for her half-hour comedy “Fountain of Ruth,” which
follows an older couple in a special retirement community after the wife
gets de-aged but the husband opts out at the last minute, and are now
faced with this big new challenge in their relationship.<br><br>Kroeger
says, of the value of screenwriting contests for someone who lives
outside of LA:<br><br>“For me, I don’t live in LA, and so my way into
the industry had to be different. I knew that contests were going to be
a big part of me being able to demonstrate that I had ability when I
didn’t necessarily have the network, or the ability to run into somebody
at the supermarket or a bar or restaurant, and make those connections.
So, I did use contests. I use them judiciously. I did a lot of research
on what contests were worthwhile. Both their prize packages as well as
their reputation. So if I placed in them, maybe if I didn’t quite win
them, that would still mean something in the industry.”<br><br>To hear

Nobody likes rejection. It doesn’t feel good. It creates an immediate
negative emotional and physical response. A study from the University of
Amsterdam found that unexpected social rejection triggers the
parasympathetic nervous system, which governs our body’s “rest and
digest” functions. Unlike the “fight or flight” response, which
heightens alertness, rejection causes our heart rate to slow, leading to
feelings of disorientation, sadness, and even physical
lethargy.<br><br>Rejection is not fun and never will be, no matter what
the situation. <br><br>However, rejection is also a powerful tool that
you can use to become a better you — <span
style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> a better screenwriter. A
not-so-famous and moderately successful pro screenwriter (yours truly)
once said, <em>“You have to fail before you can prevail.”</em> It’s a
quote that I live by in my career. <br><br>I’ve learned to thrive
through rejection. It still sucks, but you can turn it into the
necessary motivation to help you become not just a better and stronger
screenwriter, but also a better and stronger person. Here we’ll cover
how you can handle screenwriting rejection like a pro. But before we
do…

<p>
On today’s episode of Write On, we chat with Kim Rosenstock, co-creator
and co-showrunner for the new limited series, <em>Dying For Sex</em>,
starring Michelle Williams, Jenny Slate and Sissy Spacek. <br><br>Based
on a true story, <em>Dying for Sex</em> is about a woman diagnosed with
metastatic breast cancer who abandons her husband of 15 years to begin a
journey of sexual discovery.<br><br>Rosenstock talks about her
background as a playwright, nearly missing out on the opportunity to
write for the hit show <em>New Girl</em>, and navigating the complicated
tone of <em>Dying For Sex</em> that balances a woman having
unconventional, often hilarious sexual escapades with facing her own
mortality. <br><br>“We need humor the most as human beings, so don’t be
afraid of injecting humor and joy and levity into these sort of subject
matters… If you have the impulse to make it funny or to make it feel
joyful or hopeful, lean into that and don’t be afraid of it. I also
think that is what makes it feel real, actually. To me, that makes it
feel more honest, not the other way around… I think what’s exciting is
that audiences are embracing these kinds of stories that can kind of go
into darker and lighter places at the same time,” says Rosenstock about
mixing joy and sadness in <em>Dying For Sex</em>. <br><br>To hear more,
listen to the podcast. Please be advised the interview includes
discussion of sexual abuse. <br><br><em>Dying for Sex</em> is currently
streaming on Hulu.

Since 2011, <a href="https://cinemacon.com/">CinemaCon</a> has
transformed Las Vegas into the movie industry’s ultimate insider
gathering each year, drawing studios, stars, and distributors for a
glimpse at Hollywood’s coming attractions. <br><br>The event is the
official convention of the <a href="https://cinemaunited.org/">Cinema
United</a>, formerly The National Association of Theatre Owners.
Obviously, the organization is focused on getting people into theaters
to watch movies on the big screen. Hey, that’s my preference,
too.<br><br>Think of it as a massive trade show where industry players
reveal their cards for the months ahead. While there are plenty of
<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-cinemacon-1236358190/">celebrities
plugging their latest</a> and big trailer premieres, screenwriters
should pay attention to what’s happening amidst the glitz. There’s value
in understanding which genres and stories are actually (hopefully)
selling tickets. Smart writers can take these insights to position their
work in Hollywood. <br><br>So here are some of the key lessons we
noticed this year.

Professional screenwriters can make a great living writing feature
screenplays and working in writers rooms for streaming and television
series —  as much as six to seven figures per year at the highest level.
However, most that make it to that level have to pay their dues well
before that. <br><br>Screenwriting is not for everyone, and not everyone
will make it — but if it’s what you’re destined to do and where your
passion lies, here’s a breakdown of what the average salary of a
screenwriter can be, and what screenwriters should expect along the
way.
