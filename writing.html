Like Chekhov’s famous gun, it seems to be an un­stated principle among
writers as diverse as Rob­ert Ludlum and Octavia E. Butler that a
character suffering from total amnesia in the first act is in for some
world-shaking revelations by the third. The same is true of P. Djèlí
Clark’s <strong>The Dead Cat Tail </strong>

the two classes of work into separate collections. I always recall one
