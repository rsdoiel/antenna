<h2 id="plonking-is-now-called-muting">“Plonking” is now called
“muting”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: IF Database News</p>
IFDB has allowed you to hide a user and their reviews, comments, lists,
and polls since 2008. At that time, the feature was called “plonking,”
which is <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/P/plonk.html">an old term
from Usenet</a>. Now, we use the modern standard term, “muting.” (This
is just a rename; the feature works the same way it did before.)
<details>
<summary>
How muting works
</summary>
<ul>
<li>
If you mute a user, all of her reviews, comments, lists, and polls will
be omitted throughout IFDB.
</li>
<li>
This only affects you - it won’t actually delete the user’s reviews or
hide them when other members view the same game pages.
</li>
<li>
Muted accounts will not know that you’ve muted them.
</li>
<li>
You can change your mind and un-mute someone later via the
<a href="https://ifdb.org/userfilter?list">user filter editor</a>.

Slays Holiday Horror</h2>

There is nothing quite like horror to ring in the holiday cheer. While
the holiday season offers your favorite formulaic rom-com that brings
that feeling of joy to our cold hearts, Christmas-themed horror movies
designed to scare audiences during the most wonderful time of the year
have become more popular than ever. <br><br>While horror films—more
specifically slashers—are often reserved for Halloween, Damien Leone’s
<em>Terrifier 3</em> paid homage to classic Holiday slashers <em>Black
Christmas</em> and <em>Silent Night Deadly Night</em>, all of which make
the season terrifying. But what is it about these movies that works? And
more importantly—how do you write a Christmas horror movie?

<p>“What happens when you disassociate? What happens when you’re
separate from yourself? What happens when you’re no longer yourself? Is
there a camera language that can embody that, that can execute that? In
the film, when Elwood walks into the white house, he looks left he sees
the sawhorse thing that they’re beat on. He looks to the right, he sees
Hamish [Linklater, who plays Spencer]. And then when he looks to the
left again, he’s in front of the camera because he separated from it.
He’s having an out of body experience,” says director and co-writer of
<em>Nickel Boys</em> about his unusual technique for shooting his
protagonist Elwood’s point of view. </p>
</div>

<p> </p>

<div>
<p>On today’s episode of the Write On podcast, we speak with RaMell Ross
about his new film <em>Nickel Boys</em> about two young Black men who
get sent to a reform school in 1960’s Jim Crow South. The film is
heartbreakingly beautiful and already getting plenty of Oscar buzz.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the interview, Ross admits he didn’t know how to write a
screenplay when he decided to adapt Colson Whitehead’s book <em>Nickel
Boys</em>, so he began the process by using written storyboards to
visualize the scenes, which were later converted into a screenplay with
the help of co-writer Joselyn Barnes. We also discuss his decision to
limit the violence depicted on screen. </p>

<p>“It’s a tough space because on one hand, you want people to
understand the things that happened and their horror. But I feel as a
culture, we’ve been overexposed to it and specifically overexposed as it
relates to people of color because we don’t have so many iterations of
visuals of people of color. If that’s most of it, then how does that
work on the culture and psyche?” says Ross. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ross also shares his take on writing a movie with historical
elements.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>“I don’t think that what we understand to be history is history. I
think that it’s a collection of familiar ways of analyzing or engaging
with the past that fits comfortably in the socio-political language of
reflection. I don’t know what it’s like to be a person in the past. And
I know that a lot of the narratives that we have these days are guided
by a person’s either nefarious unconscious or they have another type of
motivation behind them. And so I want people to think about the past as
something that has the freedom of interpretation, that we would like to
be given to all of the things that we’ve done in our lives. I just don’t
believe in historical reproduction,” he says. </p>

filmmaking process. </p>

Her imagination, creativity, and thirst for learning have been

career started after college while working as a production artist and
graphic designer at a few design and marketing firms for about seven
years. She gained insight into client work and procedures to help a

I’m continually interested in how the corona­virus pandemic does – or
commonly doesn’t – make its way into fiction. It’s such a huge event,
but one that “realistic” novels, movies, and television series seem
hesitant to engage with, opting instead for a kind of hazy
