<p>Structure is the fundamental skeleton of every story ever told, so
why does it flummox so many writers? John and Craig outline what
structure really is, ways to find it in your story, and how to keep it
from tying your brain in knots. We also look at ways to find nuance in
our appreciation […] The post

Writers of duologies aren’t doing any favors for book reviewers. With a
trilogy, we can blather on about middle-book syndrome and three-act
structures; with an ongoing series, we can spec­ulate about
metanarratives or simply rate each new volume as though it were the
latest album from a familiar band, but a duology somehow seems to

<p>
This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best
Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The
Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out
of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László
Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent
lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build
a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The
Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely
unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).

<strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by
big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat
includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering
projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so
much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively
small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but
