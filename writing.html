At some point in your screenwriting journey and career, you’re going to
need to write a <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Risk It”
Script</span>. The original term begins with another four-letter word
beginning with F, but we’re taking the family approach for this
discussion.<br><br>Screenwriters are bombarded with <em>musts</em>. You
read the screenwriting books, you listen to the screenwriting podcasts,
you watch interviews with successful name screenwriters, you attend
screenwriting Q/A panels and listen to industry pros tell you what you
<em>must</em> do to become a professional screenwriter. All of those
<em>musts</em> can create extreme anxiety and overwhelmingness — all of
which can crush your dreams and subdue your passion and drive. And,
oddly enough, many of those <em>musts</em>, rules, and guidelines can
contradict one another. <br><br>If you’re tired of all of that, it’s
time to write your <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Risk It”
Script</span>.
