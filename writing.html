Artist for the 2025 Logo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-05, from: IF Competition Blog</p>
<h2>
We are looking for art for this year’s IFComp logo! We will pay a $250
commission.
</h2>
<p>
Artists should express interest by sending us a link to their past
work/portfolio via email:
<a href="http://ifcomp.org/"><b>ifcomp@ifcomp.org</b></a> by June 30
(incl.); the artist will be selected by the end of July.
</p>
<p>
More info:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We will request one rough draft for review / edit before the final logo
is produced.
</li>
<li>
We must have the final art in hand by August 25th.
</li>
<li>
We will need three versions of the logo: one with no text, one that says
‘IFComp’, and one that says ‘IFComp 2025’.
</li>
<li>
The final image file will be created or scanned at 3600 x 3600 px, and
the design should still be clearly legible when reduced for display at
250 x 250 px for the web.
</li>
<li>
If you incorporate a person (optional) we ask that you make the person’s
gender ambiguous.
</li>
<li>
We ask that you integrate the
<a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">IFTF logo</a> into the art in
some way.
</li>
<li>
The IFComp logo should imply / be inspired by the many genres of games
people make.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will also request an invoice from the artist that the includes the
following terms:
</p>
<blockquote class="npf_indented">
<p>
<i>The <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction
Technology Foundation</a> has the right to use the image in whole or in
part, in world-wide publishing, print, or on any merchandise for an
unlimited time. The artists reserves the right to use or edit the work
to be used in their portfolio. The artist will be paid $250 US dollars,
sent by PayPal or Venmo, upon receipt of final image file. IFComp will
cover currency conversion fees charged by PayPal</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you are an artist thinking about making something for this year’s
competition (e.g. cover art or a game), the logo may not be or have an
obvious reference to an entry submitted this year. We are still open to
artists participating in any way, whether it be submitting a game or
doing art for an author, in this year’s competition.
</p>
<p>
Here are the last few years’ logos, just to give you an idea of what
we’re looking for…

According to Christopher Booker’s <em>The Seven Basic Plots</em>, there
are really only seven types of stories that one can tell. While the
<em>Karate Kid</em> story may seem deceptively simple, it has a strong
concept behind it; in this case, the basic plot of Overcoming the
Monster, which places the protagonist into a situation where they must
defeat a threatening antagonist.

<p>
In the simplest terms, <span style="font-weight: bold;">dramatic
irony</span> in storytelling is when the audience knows something the
characters don’t. Oftentimes, the characters would have benefited from
this knowledge and it would have taken them down a less troublesome or,
in some cases, tragic path (also known as “tragic
irony”). <br><br>Dramatic irony in storytelling is often achieved by
showing or revealing something to the audience that one of the main
characters hasn’t witnessed or heard (this is sometimes referred to as
“proleptic irony”). There are many possibilities for what could happen
in a story with dramatic irony, but firstly it’s important to know how
it differs from another form of irony.

<p>
Michel Nieva’s <strong>Dengue Boy</strong>, translated by Rahul Bery, is
an exuberant, gore-spattered romp of a climate fiction novel, shot
through with cosmic terrors and delivered in a pyretic, exclamatory
style. There are incredible horrors here, at the level of the globe and
of the body, but the novel has an undeniable comic

<p>
<strong>Greenteeth </strong>is Australia-based British author Molly
O’Neill’s debut novel, and one that owes an unexpectedly charming debt
to T. Kingfisher and Terry Pratchett. In a small lake near the English
village of Chipping Appleby, in an uncertainly historic (premodern,
post-Reformation) century, lives the monster Jenny Greenteeth. Jenny’s a
sharp-toothed predator. But this nightmarish monster

In a career of barely a decade, Premee Mohamed has emerged as one of the
more adventurous new voices in SFF, both in terms of genre and form – a
trilogy that combines SF with Lovecraftian horror (<strong>Beneath the

Every great romantic comedy has a moment where two characters collide,
clash, or connect for the first time. That moment is a meet-cute – the
heartbeat of any romantic comedy. <br><br>Meet-cutes set the tone,
stakes, and emotional undercurrent for everything that follows the
story. It’s where we, the audience, decide if we want to watch these
characters fall in love. When done right, it can hook your viewer,
define your characters, and spark a journey that feels both familiar and
fresh.<br><br>Let’s break down what makes a meet-cute memorable, and how
you can write one that stands out with some of our favorite examples.
