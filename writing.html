      <h1>Welcome to the 31st Annual IFComp!</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://blog.ifcomp.org/post/793498286286864384">IF Competition Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1><b>Welcome to the 31st Annual IFComp!</b></h1><p>The <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">2025 Interactive Fiction Competition</a> has officially begun!</p><p>For the next six weeks, players and judges around the world will be diving into this year’s crop of brand-new interactive fiction. We’re delighted to share that <i><b>85 entries(!!) </b></i>have been submitted this year. We&rsquo;re excited to see so many authors tossing their hat into the ring.</p><p>As always, you don’t need to play every entry to be a judge. You only need to <b>play and rate </b><i><b>at least five </b></i><b>entries</b> to submit a ballot. Whether you’re a seasoned IFComp veteran or joining us for the very first time, we welcome you and hope you’ll find plenty to discover and enjoy!</p><p><b>What&rsquo;s New for 2025<br/></b>You can now choose whether or not to see content warnings. Authors still provide them, and they&rsquo;ll be shown by default, but if you’d prefer not to see them (to avoid spoilers or for any other reason), you’ll find a setting at the top of the ballot that lets you hide them.</p><p><b>The Colossal Fund<br/></b>We’re excited to share that this year’s Colossal Fund is already halfway to its goal! Thanks to the generosity of donors, we’re well on our way to ensuring a strong pool of prizes. If you’d like to learn more about the Fund and how to contribute cash (or other prizes), visit h<a href="https://ifcomp.org/about/prizes">ttps://ifcomp.org/about/prizes</a></p><p><b>Our Awards Ceremony<br/></b>As in years past, we will celebrate the conclusion of this year’s competition with a virtual awards ceremony, where we announce the results and recognize the authors. The awards ceremony will be held on T<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/interactivefictioncomp">witch </a>at 4:00 PM Eastern Oct 18. To confirm what time the awards stream will be for you in your time zone, c<a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/4849cb8d">heck here.</a></p><p><b>On the Topic of the UK&rsquo;s Online Safety Act<br/></b>This year brings change for many authors and all of our UK judges: the United Kingdom’s O<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">nline Safety Act </a>(OSA), which restricts access to a wide range of content that could be harmful to children. We spent considerable time investigating whether a third-party provider could offer age verification for our UK users without us needing to retain sensitive information, but we were not able to implement a workable solution before launch. We are still pursuing that possibility, but it may not be in place until next year’s competition.</p><p>Until earlier this week, we thought we’d need to geoblock all entries for UK users. That was something we very much wanted to avoid. Fortunately, we were able to put in place a more limited, case-by-case approach. With 85 entries, over two dozen of which arrived after we learned of this option, it was not possible to thoroughly play every entry beforehand. Instead, we based initial geoblock decisions on a mix of author-provided content warnings and notes from our Curation Team.</p><p>Ofcom has <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/consultations/category-1-10-weeks/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online/main-document/guidance-on-content-harmful-to-children.pdf">published guidance</a> to help organizations navigate the OSA, including exceptions to the law. At the recommendation of our attorney, we are utilizing their guidance to inform our decisions as we review entries. All authors whose entries were selected for geoblocking in the UK were notified and invited to discuss their entry with us if they felt their work was acceptable for all ages under the OSA. After reviewing additional text from entries, and weighing that text against exceptions provided by the OSA, we lifted geoblocks for several authors.</p><p>We do not love restricting content and we understand that many in the community are frustrated, but we are obligated to comply with the law for UK users. For transparency: as of the time of this post, 24 of 85 entries are geoblocked in the UK. It is possible that this number may shift slightly in the coming days as more authors reach out to us.</p><p>In response to a question we’ve already received, we do not intend to make a new Author Rule to address the OSA. It is a law external to the IFComp, and it does not affect all users. As case law develops, and as the broader internet learns to navigate the OSA, authors will likely get a clearer sense of what may or may not be restricted. We may also be able to implement age verification for users who wish to take advantage of it. Regardless, our preference remains the same: authors should write whatever they want to write to tell the stories that they wish to tell for the audiences they wish to reach.</p><p><b>Generative AI in IFComp<br/></b>Another evolving area is the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI). The community remains divided on its role in interactive fiction, and the technology itself continues to change rapidly. Our stance for the past two years has been to require transparency but to otherwise allow GAI. On the entry form, authors are asked to declare most uses of GAI in their work. After last year’s competition, we expected to see a flood of feedback about AI in the post-comp survey. In reality, only about 10 percent of respondents mentioned it. Based on that, we kept the same policy for 2025.</p><p>We plan to use this year’s post-competition survey to float some ideas about new approaches on GAI in the competition, including possible rule changes, and invite your input. The survey will also include space for you to share rule ideas of your own. We recognize that it is unlikely that we’ll land in a place that makes everyone happy, but we’ll endeavor to do our best to find common ground. We intend to finalize decisions for 2026 by the end of this calendar year, so that authors have plenty of time to plan.</p><p>Anything we haven’t covered? Still got questions? Email us at ifcomp@ifcomp.org</p><p>Thank you in advance for judging!<br/>– Jacqueline Ashwell,<br/>September 2025</p>

      <h1>Markdown support in reviews</h1>

      <p>
      <p>IFDB reviews now allow you to use Markdown. Now you can type <code>*emphasis*</code> and get <i>italic text</i>, <code>**strong**</code> and get <b>bold text</b>, use backticks <code>`</code> to get monospaced code. Also numbered lists, bulleted lists, blockquotes, headings, and the whole jam. See "<a href="https://ifdb.org/help-formatting?review">Review Formatting Hints</a>" for details.</p>

<details><summary>Additional details</summary>
<ul>
<li>Right now, Markdown is only available in reviews. It will require additional work to add Markdown to each text box in the site, e.g. comments, game descriptions, etc.</li>
<li>In order to avoid messing up existing reviews, we only render Markdown in reviews that have been modified since today's date, August 30. This means that if you edit a review and save it, it might look different than when you started editing it. But we did a bunch of tests and found that 90%+ of reviews aren’t transformed at all by adding Markdown support, and more than half of the remainder are improved by it (e.g. converting “*emphasis*” to “<i>emphasis</i>”). If Markdown is doing something you don't want it to do, try using a backslash <code>\</code> character before asterisks, underscores, etc.</li>

<p>“The thing that started it all off was me saying [the character Toxie] should be a guy in a suit. In other words, let’s not do a computer-generated creature, let’s have a person in a suit and have that handmade, hand-stitched kind of quality to it where you can sort of see the seams a little bit and have that be part of the fun. I also said let’s have it be rated R. Hopefully y’all are not interested in a family-friendly PG-13 version of this movie, because that’s not what the fans of the original are going to want, so let’s keep it in the R-zone. And let’s make sure it stays very silly. That silliness is what was so appealing to me about the original, and I just wanted to make sure that we weren’t going to try and do something that was too self-serious,” says <em>The Toxic Avenger</em> writer/director Macon Blair about pitching Legendary Studios his version of how he would reimagine the classic black comedy splatter film for a modern audience while staying loyal to the fans of the 1984 version.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On today’s episode, we chat with writer/director/actor Macon Blair about his previous films like <em>Blue Ruin</em> and <em>I Don’t Feel at Home</em> <em>in This World Anymore</em>, which won the Sundance Grand Jury award in 2017. His latest film is a reboot of <em>The Toxic Avenger</em> starring Peter Dinklage and Kevin Bacon, and is a whole lot of gory, gross-out fun. Blair talks about the need to dig into the over-the-top absurdity of the franchise while still making the modern version of the story feel authentic.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“I’m always looking for something that I can connect to on a personal level. I don’t mean autobiographical. I mean to be able to have that electrical current with what I’m typing out,” he says.</p> 
<p>Blair tells us about his on-going journey to finding his voice as a writer and what it was like waiting two years to get distribution for <em>The Toxic Avenger</em>. He also explains why he skewers a famous screenwriting trope in the film that involves a cat named Mr. Treats who was apparently quite the menace.</p>

<h2>What Is a Beat Board?</h2> 
<p>Perhaps you’ve seen images of a TV writer’s room and noticed a whiteboard with a bunch of sticky notes attached to it or handwritten Sharpie notes. Or maybe you’ve watched a behind-the-scenes featurette on a Blu-ray and noticed a cork board at a production company’s office and it was similarly covered with sticky notes or index cards.&nbsp;<br><br>These boards are referred to as a “beat board” in the film and television industry. It’s extremely helpful to have a visual representation of a story when in the development process, and that’s why beat boards are frequently used by writers and producers.<br><br>Whether they’re on a sticky note or index card, what’s usually written is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">beat</span>. A beat is a smaller story event that happens within a larger sequence or narrative. Think of beats as the molecules of a screenplay or television script: they’re the little things that are holding everything together and helping to create a whole.&nbsp;</p>

</div> 
<p>It’s a feat to top the Black List, Hollywood’s list of favorite unproduced screenplays, any year. But what if you did it two years in a row?<br><br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4136506/">Travis Braun </a>has been the only writer to accomplish this so far. In 2023, it was his horror script <span style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</span> that won the top spot; in 2024, rom-com <span style="font-style: italic;">One Night Only</span> was named the number-one work. Both are currently in development. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/lili-reinhart-ke-huy-quan-horror-film-bad-boy-dog-efm-1236279194/" style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</a> has Ke Huy Quan and Lili Reinhart attached, while Monica Barbaro and Callum Turner are set to star in <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/monica-barbaro-callum-turner-one-night-only-will-gluck-1236481748/" style="font-style: italic;">One Night Only</a> for Universal.<br><br>Beyond this, Braun has already found a ton of success in the children’s TV space, with an Emmy nomination and an overall deal at Disney, where he created the shows <span style="font-style: italic;">Pupstruction, T.O.T.S.</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Fast Layne</span>.<br><br>His new features fall outside the world of kids’ entertainment, though. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bad Boy</span> is about a dog who uncovers a serial killer, and <span style="font-style: italic;">One Night Only</span> follows the single night every year when extramarital sex is allowed. Both high-concept stories clearly resonated with readers eager for original plotlines.&nbsp;<br><br>The diversity of Braun’s slate is impressive, but there’s volume, as well. Which is probably how his work has found a home at some of Hollywood’s biggest networks and on coveted lists.<br><br>Final Draft chatted with Braun about his writing process, and he told us that there was no secret formula to it but rather a dedication to pursuing exciting ideas and cutting out noise. Dive into his advice below.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Editor’s note: The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: You topped the Black List two years in a row, and you were the first person to do so. What’s your secret?&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Travis Braun</span>: Man, I don’t know. I wish there was a secret, then it would be a lot easier to write these scripts.&nbsp;<br><br>They’re always hard. Each one is its own challenge. I feel like every time you think you know how to write a script, or at least I think I know how to write a script, I start the next one and it’s a quick rude awakening that all the lessons from the last one just don’t apply to the next one. So it feels like you’re always making the tools as you’re trying to build the car. You need new tools for each type of car you’re building. I wish I knew the secret, but I’m still trying to figure that out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I think the biggest shift that I’ve made in the last four or five years was just really trying to tap into what excites me and cut out a lot of the noise, which is hard to do. And there’s a lot of voices out there from your reps to buyers, to producers, and everyone has a feeling of what’s going to work. And ultimately, it’s been me just trying to figure out, what do I love? What do I think is exciting, what entertains me, and trying to follow that North Star.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: I’d love to explore that a little more because both of the scripts I mentioned, Bad Boy and One Night Only, they’re both high-concept. What attracts you to that space?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Travis Braun</span>: I’m always trying to find something that feels original. That’s why I live in Burbank. I go to the Burbank AMC three times a week, probably. I love that feeling of discovering something new.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s what I am trying to find in my writing too, is just chasing that feeling of what’s fresh, what’s a completely new take on a horror movie or a thriller or a romcom and just trying to find something that feels fresh and different and unexpected. Because as an audience member, as a lover of movies, that’s what I’m always looking for.<br></p>

<p>The Coen Brothers have been major forces in American cinema for an astounding 40 years now, spanning genres from crime thriller to musical to stoner comedy, and always with a dark sense of humor. Though the Minnesota writing/directing/editing team of Joel and Ethan Coen haven’t made a film together since 2018’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6412452/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</a>, Joel is currently directing a film called <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/josh-o-connor-joel-coen-movie-jack-of-spades-baz-bamigboye-1236409439/" style="font-style: italic;">Jack Of Spades</a> starring Josh O’Connor in Scotland, and Ethan’s newest directorial effort, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30645201/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Honey Don’t!</a>, co-written with his partner and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19356262/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Drive Away Dolls</a> (2024) collaborator <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177504/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk">Tricia Cooke</a>, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May and releases this month, frontlined by Margaret Qualley and Aubrey Plaza.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Honey</span> takes its name from Qualley’s private investigator character, Honey O’Donahue, representing the latest in a long line of mystery and crime thriller characters from the Coens that take their roots in American crime fiction, going back to their debut feature, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086979/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Blood Simple</a> (1984). The brothers, together and apart, have created a specific tone, rich with literary layers, that’s all their own, in part by drawing on a deep well of influence. And while their movies are littered with cinematic allusions, they owe as great a debt to literature.&nbsp;<br><br>The brothers clearly love to read, and have done their fair share of literary adaptations, like Oscar-winning <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" style="font-style: italic;">No Country for Old Men</a> (2007) based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, their western hit based on Charles Portis’ <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403865/" style="font-style: italic;">True Grit</a> (2010), and Joel Coen’s solo directorial effort adapting William Shakespeare in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10095582/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy of Macbeth</a> (2021), whose murder plot <a href="https://www.dga.org/Events/2022/February2022/Macbeth_QnA_1221">Coen compared</a> to the hard-boiled American crime fiction that influenced their films.&nbsp;<br><br>One that got away was an adaptation of James Dickey’s <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/30/specials/dickey-sea.html?scp=24&amp;sq=moral%20camouflage&amp;st=cse" style="font-style: italic;">To The White Sea</a>, about an American gunner who’s shot down over Tokyo during the WWII fire bombings, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=116293&amp;page=1">which had Brad Pitt attached in the early 2000s</a>, but ultimately was too expensive to get off the ground. Additionally, one of their most acclaimed film’s features characters loosely based on real writers. The Palme d’or winning <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101410/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Barton Fink</a> (1991) starred John Turturro as a playwright turned fledgling screenwriter with roots in Clifford Odets and George S. Kaufman, alongside another character depicted in the mold of William Faulkner, himself a great influence on the Coens.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other side of the spectrum are films where the cinematic influences are more apparent than the literary ones, like screwball comedies <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093822/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Raising Arizona</a> (1987), which seems to meld the crime film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078326/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Straight Time</a> (1978) with the high speed action antics of Chuck Jones’ <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041349/">Wile E. Coyote</a> cartoons and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Road Warrior</a> (1981), and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110074/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Hudsucker Proxy</a> (1994), a post-modern love letter to 40s comedy films by the likes of Frank Capra, Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges.&nbsp;<br><br>Their 2004 Tom Hanks vehicle <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335245/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Ladykillers</a> (2004) was a remake of the Ealing Studios British comedy film of the same name from 1955, itself littered with shades of Faulkner and Flannery O’Connor, whose influence can be seen across the filmography, while <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138524/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Intolerable Cruelty</a> (2002) was developed from an existing romantic comedy screenplay.&nbsp;<br><br>But some of the Coens’ most significant movies aren’t necessarily literary adaptations or film genre homages, but original films where they’ve worked under the spectre of specifically cited literary figures. From hard-boiled detective fiction to Greek mythology, here are some of the foremost literary influences on the work of the Coen Brothers.</p>

      <p>John and Craig examine how to best use your connections to help yourself and others. They look at ways to identify the strength of a connection, leverage them without being manipulative, the nitty-gritty of approaching others for a favor, and the important ways to be generous in return. We also look at the good news [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Conflict is everything in a screenplay. Without conflict, there’s nothing to drive the story forward. Stories need characters to be struggling through conflict that they are either forced to deal with, or conflict that they’ve <em>chosen</em> to face.&nbsp;<br><br>There are two different forms of conflict in literary, stage, or cinematic narratives:</p>
