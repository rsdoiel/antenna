Nat Cassidy: Review by Gabino Iglesias</h2>

<strong>Rest Stop, </strong>Nat Cassidy (Shortwave 978-1-95956-536-9,

<p>
When done right, there’s nothing like a novella: short, fast, engaging,
and easy to devour. Nat Cassidy’s <strong>Rest Stop </strong>brings all
of that and more to the table. Besides being fast and engaging, it’s
also weird, intense, and deeper than it seems on the surface.

Ever watched a movie and wondered “How did they make this?”<br><br>From
a screenwriter first getting an idea to a director delivering a final
cut, there are numerous steps in the making of a movie and not every
journey from page to screen is the same. Some movies get made after
years – sometimes even decades – of development. Other movies are
quickly greenlit. Some movies are made independently. Other movies are
made by a major studio. Some have trouble free productions. Others are
marred by difficulties. Every scenario is different and dependent on
various factors.<br><br>That being said, there are <span
