“Just write a story you want to tell and don’t try to write something
which you think you can sell to somebody because that way is madness.
You have to write what you want to write whether it works or not for
other people. But if it’s not authentic to you, it’s doomed at some
point along the road. So stick to your guns!” says award-winning writer,
Andrew Bergman about writing your first spec script.

<h2 id="five-books-to-help-understand-story-structure">Five Books to
Help Understand Story Structure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-13, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Plotters vs. pantsers. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the dichotomies of writing fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Writers in the first group work out the plot of their novel in an
outline, which may be very detailed, and then write their story. They
don’t always adhere to the outline; while writing, new ideas may bloom,
and new characters may come to mind, leading authors to make changes,
but they often stick to the story structure that they initially
developed.
</p>
<p>
Pantsers are different. These authors begin with a character, a setting,
or a situation, and just let their subconscious guide them as the story
grows organically. Rather than wanting to be locked into an outline,
they exercise the freedom to go down rarely-traveled paths and discover
the story that is within them.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, at the end of the first draft, both of these types of
writers need to analyze their manuscripts and ensure that their stories
are structured in a way that readers will grasp. Here are five books
that can help writers understand story structure.
</p>
<p>
<em><a href="https://www.jcf.org/product-page/the-hero-with-a-thousand-faces-ebook" target="_blank">The
Hero with a Thousand Faces</a></em>, by Joseph Campbell.
</p>
<p>
Most writers have heard of Joseph Campbell's idea of
<a href="https://www.jcf.org/learn/joseph-campbell-heros-journey" target="_blank">the
hero's journey</a>. Combining research into the perennial hero myth
across cultures and Jung's idea of archetypes, Campbell developed a
template for this type of story. "The basic story of the hero journey
involves giving up where you are, going into the realm of adventure,
coming to some kind of symbolically rendered realization, and then
returning to the field of normal life." This story structure has been
the backbone for many Hollywood movies, notably the first <em>Star
Wars</em> movie, which George Lucas modeled directly on Campbell's
structure. But everyone is the hero of their own life, and this story
structure can be used for adventures that don't span galaxies.
Understanding this template can help novelists develop satisfying
stories.
</p>
<p>
<em><a href="https://mckeestory.com/books/story/" target="_blank">Story:
Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of
Screenwriting</a></em>, by Robert McKee.
</p>
<p>
Robert McKee developed his approach to screenwriting over many years
working in Hollywood. Through seminars, and then his book
<em>Story</em>, he presents what he calls principles, not rules. "A rule
says, 'You must do it this way.' A principle says, 'This works… and has
through all remembered time.'" Writers may think that a book for
screenwriters isn't for them, but while <em>Story</em> discusses films,
the ideas in the book apply to all kinds of stories. This 25-year-old
book is a bit out of fashion these days, as it is sometimes seen as
providing a template for the many cookie-cutter superhero movies that
are made by the dozen. But McKee's discussion of story structure,
looking at events, beats, scenes, sequences, and acts, also applies to
novels. And using movies as examples ensures that many readers of
<em>Story</em> know the basic plots he discusses, and can better
understand his analyses.
</p>
<p>
<em><a href="https://www.jessicabrody.com/books/non-fiction/save-cat-writes-novel/about/" target="_blank">Save
the Cat! Writes a Novel</a></em>, by Jessica Brody.
</p>
<p>
Save the Cat! is an approach to storytelling developed by Blake Snyder,
originally for screenplays. This structure breaks down a story into 15
beats or plot points, which describe the hero's journey to discovery,
which, in one way or another, is at the heart of most novels. Jessica
Brody adapted this for novels, and her 15-beat structure can be useful
for plotters, and even for pantsers who start a novel, and then reach a
point when they want to plan out the rest of their story. See our
article
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/outline-your-nanowrimo-novel-using-the-save-the-cat-story-structure" target="_blank">Outline
your NaNoWriMo Novel Using the Save the Cat! Story Structure</a> for
more on using this technique with Scrivener.
</p>
<p>
<em><a href="http://storyfix.com/six-core-competencies-of-successful-storytelling" target="_blank">Story
Engineering: Mastering the Six Core Competencies of Successful
Writing</a></em>, Larry Brooks.
</p>
<p>
<em>Story Engineering</em> is a general book on the storytelling
process, with a focus on story structure. He points out that there is "a
structural expectation and paradigm for your story, and if you intend to
sell what you write, you can't mess with it." Sections in the book cover
topics like concept, character, and theme, but about one-third of the
book looks at story structure. While many writers look at a three-act,
five-act, or seven-act story structure, Brooks presents a four-part
story structure, which consists of set-up, response, attack, and
resolution. He doesn't limit himself to this high-level approach, and
also discusses plot points, the midpoint of a story, the final act, and
more.
</p>
<p>
<em><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/seven-basic-plots-9781472976185/" target="_blank">The
Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories</a></em>, by Christopher Booker.
</p>
<p>
Many people have tried to determine how many different plots exist for
stories.
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-many-different-types-of-plots-are-there" target="_blank">Some
say there are 6, 36, or 1,462 plots for stories</a>, but in this long
book (700+ pages), Christopher Booker looks at literature through the
ages, and has determined that there are seven basic plots. Leaning on a
Jungian analysis of stories, the book contains dozens of examples of
well-known stories and how they fit into these categories. While this
reduction of all stories to seven basic plots may not be the one true
answer to the question of story structure, this book can help writers
better understand the commonalities across stories and how readers are
primed, from childhood, to expect certain plots. This book is not for
everyone, but if you want to dig deep into story structure, it's worth
dipping into.
</p>
<p>
The story structures discussed in these books are not the only options
for writing a novel, and you will certainly find stories that don't fit
neatly into these categories. But when you're planning a novel, or have
finished your first draft, it can be helpful to be aware of different
story structures that might help you tell the story you want to tell.

Casella Brookins Reviews House of Open Wounds by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-10, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>House of Open Wounds</strong>, Adrian Tchaikovsky (Head of Zeus
978-1-0359-0138-8, $27.99. 608pp, hc) December 2023. Cover by Joe
Wilson.
</p>
<p>
Although it is set in the same world as <strong>City of Last
Chances</strong>, Adrian Tchaikovsky’s <strong>House of Open Wounds
</strong>is very much a standalone sequel. The previous novel introduced
us to a large cast of characters in Telmark, a formerly independent
nation conquered by the aggres­sively expanding Palleseen Sway.
