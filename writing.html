Di Filippo Reviews Lake of Darkness by Adam Roberts</h2>

<p>
<strong>Lake of Darkness</strong>, Adam Roberts (Gollancz
978-1399617673, hardcover, 320pp, £22.00) July 2024
</p>
<p>
The newest novel from Adam Roberts—purveyor of endless unrepeating and
unduplicatable narratives—is a utopian metaphysical suspense/thriller

</p>
<p>
With all the much-deserved tributes to the late Terry Bisson and his
work (which included a long-running and very funny column for this
magazine), it’s easy to overlook the brilliant se­ries of author
chapbooks he edited for PM Press for the past 15 years. A virtual who’s
who of our field, it has included authors such
