I found three stories in Uncanny’s 60th issue to be standouts.
“<strong>The 6% Squeeze</strong>” by <strong>Eddie Robson </strong>will
appeal to anyone who has ever designed for a corporation with a strict
“bible” or even anyone who has experienced such a corporation’s need for
a scapegoat. <strong>Tananarive Due</strong>’s engaging “<strong>A
Stranger Knocks</strong>” is set in 1926 Washington, DC, where newlyweds

<p>“You’re reading these interviews [in the book <em>The Bikeriders</em>
by Danny Lyon] and they’re all interesting, but Kathy’s are just
fascinating. You could just tell she was a character, meaning she was
just this interesting, dynamic person, a person that was trying to
figure out how she found herself in this world because she really talks
about walking into this bar and meeting this charismatic young bike
rider. And so, it was a really beneficial crutch for me to kind of get
into this world. And then before you know it, by the middle of the
script, I’m writing words for Kathy that never existed. It didn’t hurt
that, in my research, I reached out to Danny and he turned over hours
and hours of recordings. I would drive around town just listening to
Kathy talk. I mean, I had this woman in my head and I felt pretty
confident midway through the script that I could write in her voice. It
just gave this perspective to a very masculine, aggressive subculture.
It gave this feminine point of view, but to me it was just a really
interesting point of view,” says writer/director Jeff Nichols about
writing the character Kathy, played by Jodie Comer, in his film <em>The
Bikeriders</em>.  <br> <br>In this episode of the podcast, we speak to
Jeff Nichols about his departure from Southern Gothic storytelling and
going deep into the world of a 1960s motorcycle club for <em>The
Bikeriders</em>, starring Austin Butler and Tom Hardy. We also discuss
some of his other films like <em>Loving, Take Shelter</em> and
<em>Mud</em>, starring Matthew McConaughey – a film Nichols thought
would never get released.  <br> <br>“I thought <em>Mud</em> was a
failure. We had taken <em>Mud</em> to the Cannes Film Festival, and
although we had a really nice reception there, you know, standing
ovations and whatnot – no one bought the film. And we went an entire
year with no one buying that film. In fact, no one ever did buy that
film. The financier put up half the money to market and distribute that
film and luckily, Roadside Attractions came in and put up the other half
and then it became the film that everybody knows,” says Nichols.  <br>
<br>To hear more about Nichols’s writing process, and his advice for
building stories around “emotional impact,” listen to the podcast.  <br>

Ways ‘Nightbitch’ Uses Dog Metaphor to Explore Motherhood</h2>

<p>
Directed by Marielle Heller, the new film <em>Nightbitch</em> stars Amy
Adams as a stay-at-home mother who’s losing her dang mind. After giving
up a fulfilling (though not necessarily lucrative) career as an artist,
she now focuses fulltime on her husband and young son. “Mother” (Adams),
as she’s called in the story because her identity, including her name,
has completely faded away, has lost her sense of self along with her
grip on reality. Based on Rachel Yoder’s novel of the same name,
<em>Nightbitch</em> uses metaphor to dig deep into the female psyche to
expose the animalistic nature of being a mother. In this case, the
metaphor is a mother who transforms into a dog. <br><br>Movies about
humans becoming canine aren’t new. There’s a long history of werewolf
films including a whole string of them in the 1980s: <em>The
Howling</em> (1981), <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> (1981),
<em>Wolfen</em> (1981), <em>The Night of the Werewolf</em> (1981),
<em>The Company of Wolves</em> (1984), <em>Silver Bullet</em> (1985),
<em>Teen Wolf</em> (1985), and <em>Night Shadow</em> (1989). (Not sure
why this one decade needed so many werewolf movies, perhaps it has
something to do with societal changes, but that’s the subject for
another article).  <br><br>Typically, the transformation of a human into
a werewolf is symbolic of our primal instincts getting the best of us,
our repressed desires coming to the surface, and the way civilized human
behavior rightfully clashes with our animalistic impulses. But Mother
doesn’t turn into a wolf, she turns into a dog. Why? It allows the story
to take a much more domestic turn and bends the metaphor into something
more relatable to suburban family life. Also, if she became a wolf, the
audience would worry for the safety of her son. Let’s delve into three
clever ways <em>Nightbitch</em> uses the dog metaphor in the film.

Paris, 1913, saw the first public performance of Stravinsky’s

some have said it caused a riot, but there seems to be disagreement over
that interpretation. Whatever the historical truth, it probably didn’t
happen because of magic, which is

British writers Chris and Michael Mul, known as the Mul Brothers in the
screenwriting world, have some fantastic news: their Big Break-winning
screenplay,
<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ansel-elgort-in-bear-grylls-produced-survival-thriller-faster-than-horses-afm2024-1236047326/" style="font-style: italic;">Faster
Than Horses</a>, is in pre-production with director James Erskine (<span
style="font-style: italic;">Shooting for Socrates</span>), producer Bear
Grylls (<span style="font-style: italic;">Running Wild with Bear
Grylls</span>) and starring Ansel Elgort (<span
style="font-style: italic;">Baby Driver</span>). <br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</span> is a
survival-thriller about a former Olympic runner, Mauro Prosperi
(Elgort), who attempts a comeback in the grueling Marathon des Sables
across the treacherous Sahara Desert. Based on a true story, the athlete
disappeared for nine days in a sandstorm that left him fighting for his
life. <br><br>We sat down with the Mul Brothers to find out about their
writing journey and hear how winning the Big Break competition helped
progress their career to the next level.<br><br>The Mul Brothers have
always been fans of survival stories and are obsessed with movies like
<span style="font-style: italic;">127 Hours</span>. But when they read
an article about
<a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/crazy-in-the-desert-w474055">Prosperi’s
harrowing journey</a> in 2017, they knew the shocking endurance story
had particular cinematic appeal.  <br><br>“The amount of things that
went wrong for Mauro while he was in the desert – you couldn’t believe
it!” says Michael, adding, “A missed plane that went past and then he
just so happened to not be in the right place when they sent out a
rescue team, it was one thing after another. And then right at the end
of the story, he tried to take his own life but somehow survived because
the blood just congealed. He saw that as a sign of divine intervention
to keep going.” <br><br>After that, Prosperi faced down the guns of
Algerian soldiers when he accidentally wandered from Morocco into
Algeria. No wonder survival expert Bear Grylls signed on to produce the
movie!<br><br>But a great true-life story doesn’t always translate
easily into a great movie script. Beyond just the true events, the story
must also include a highly emotional and cathartic journey for its
protagonist. The Mul Brothers were able to craft that journey by
focusing on Prosperi’s deep need to reclaim his former athletic glory –
something the judges of the Final Draft Big Break competition
recognized. <span style="font-style: italic;">Faster Than Horses</span>
was awarded the prize for Best Feature Drama in 2021. <br><br>“Every
screenplay competition has a different caliber and it took us a little
while to figure out who the big players were. So with the Final Draft
submission, we were just like fingers crossed!” says Chris, who admits
he was thrilled to find out they’d won considering they had entered the
year before. <br><br>The prize package that came with the Big Break win
made all the difference. <br><br>“Mike and I say, 100 percent, one of
the best prize packages we ever received was the fellowship that we got
as a result of Final Draft. It wasn’t so much about the money. It was
more about the opportunity that led to us writing more material. I think
it was 10 weeks and over that time, we wrote an entirely new TV pilot in
one of the classes [as part of the New York Film Academy, included in
their prize package] which was a really cool experience. The guy who was
running it, George McGrath, who we’ve stayed in contact with and was
super lovely, shared it with a friend of his at HBO just off the bat and
he’d never shared anything with anybody before, but he just felt like
the color of the writing was great. So just off that, it was like,
‘Okay, this is why Final Draft is that much higher in caliber.’ For us,
it was one of the best experiences we’ve had when it came to placing or
winning in contests,” says Chris.<br><br>The Mul Brothers want to share
this advice for emerging writers: “Keep writing. I think that that is
the best way to find your voice as a writer. The more Chris and I wrote,
we started to find that we would continually revisit the same themes in
our work. And ultimately that’s what really grounds you as a writer in
terms of the things that you like to explore,” says
Michael. <br><br>Chris’s advice is to read produced screenplays for this
reason: “A lot of writers starting out don’t realize how important the
first 10 pages of the screenplay are because sometimes that’s all a
producer is going to read. You see in those opening 10 pages of a lot of
produced screenplays, they’re almost perfect in how they’re delivering
character and introductions to the world and themes, and the economy of
those pages.” <br><br>For more information on Big Break visit

<p>
As she previously did with Cinderella, author Kalynn Bayron turned
another classic on its head this year with <strong>Sleep Like
Death</strong>, her smart and scary reimagining of Snow White. There’s a
temptation when an author revisits a famous tale to assume they will
simply modernize or dress it up a little, all of which can be
