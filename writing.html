<p>
<strong>A Magical Girl Retires</strong>, Park Seolyeon (HarperVia

Sanho.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A Magical Girl Retires </strong>is award-winning Korean writer
Park Seolyeon’s first novel to be translated into English. It’s a weird,
delightful little book, simultaneously grim and breezy, and the
trans­lation (by Anton Hur) communicates a fluid, straightforward and
self-deprecatingly humorous first-person narration. This breezy grit is
further illuminated by Kim Sanho’s

<h2 id="how-to-give-and-receive-feedback-on-creative-writing">How to
Give and Receive Feedback on Creative Writing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;When someone asks for your feedback on a piece of writing, whether it is a short story or a novel, remember that the writer requesting feedback has spent a lot of time laboring over their words, and respect the fact that they are choosing you for your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
When you seek feedback for a piece of writing, it’s important that the
feedback you receive is helpful. Telling your beta reader what sort of
feedback you expect can ensure that the feedback is pertinent. Here’s
how to give and receive feedback on your novel or short story.
</p>
<p>The importance of feedback</p>
<p>
While part of the writing journey is discovering the story that is
within the writer, it’s only when stories resonate with readers that a
piece of writing is successful. While you may not intentionally write to
please others, the goal of telling a story is to engage the people who
read it. The best way to know if your story or novel works is to find
out what readers think.
</p>
<p>
There are many ways to find beta readers, people who read your work to
give feedback before you send it out to an agent, editor, or
publication. You may ask friends, family members, fellow authors, or you
may
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-find-beta-readers" target="_blank">seek
out beta readers in other ways</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a writer, you may be asked to give feedback on the work of other
writers, especially if you are in a writing group where people exchange
feedback, or you work with a critique partner. When different people
read your manuscript, they may see things that you don’t notice, because
you’ve been seeing them for so long. It’s always useful to get opinions
on your writing, even if you may not agree with the feedback.
</p>
<p>How to request feedback</p>
<p>
When you request feedback for a novel or story, you shouldn’t just send
it to someone without giving some guidelines. Here are some elements you
might wish the feedback to address:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Is the work enjoyable, and did the reader feel the urge to keep reading? Did they want to turn the pages and get to the end?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are the characters believable, and are the main characters&amp;rsquo; motivations clear?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do the settings feel real?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is anything over-described?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does the dialog feel authentic?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is the plot believable and does the resolution make sense?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are sentences, paragraphs, or chapters too long or too short? Does the prose flow, or does it feel choppy?&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Also, ask your reader to mention any specific points that stand out that
you haven’t covered.
</p>
<p>
It’s best to ask your reader not to say anything about typos unless they
interfere with the story. You will have to do several editing passes of
your manuscript, and you should be able to find these yourself.
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/why-you-might-want-to-use-online-spelling-and-grammar-checkers" target="_blank">You
may even want to use an online grammar checker</a>, chapter by chapter,
to spot this sort of mistake. It’s not a good idea for your beta reader
to get bogged down in minor details. What’s more important is hearing
what they think about the story, the characters, the flow, the pacing,
and all the elements that make a story or novel flow.
</p>
<p>
Remember to not take any feedback personally. Your reader may praise
some things and criticize others, and their criticism is about the work,
not about you as a writer. Feedback is a valuable tool for learning more
about your writing, so use it wisely.
</p>
<p>How to give useful feedback</p>
<p>
When someone asks you to give feedback on their work, they may not have
enough experience to know what to ask for. The most useful type of
feedback is that described above, but the type of feedback they need may
depend on whether you’re reading a work by a new writer or someone who
has published already.
</p>
<p>
The first thing to do when giving feedback is to start by saying what
you like about the manuscript. Highlight what works well in the piece,
whether it’s plot, character, dialogue, description, or anything else.
Remember that you’re giving feedback to a person who may be sensitive
about the months or years they spent writing, and it’s important to
reassure them that their work is valid. Think about how you would like
to receive feedback and apply that to the feedback you give to others.
</p>
<p>
Make sure your feedback is balanced; for every critical point, include a
positive point. Don’t shy away from criticizing elements that stand out,
but do this in a constructive way. Offer suggestions for points that
seem weak, but don’t rewrite entire paragraphs to show how you would
have written something.
</p>
<p>
It’s important that you understand the writer’s intent, and that you are
aware of how their work fits in a specific genre. For example, a friend
may ask you to read a novel that is not a genre that you generally read.
In this case, you may not be able to give appropriate feedback on
genre-specific conventions.
</p>
<p>
When giving feedback, it’s useful to ask questions if you don’t
understand something, such as a character’s motivation or a plot point.
This may be more useful than criticism, as the writer, in thinking about
the question, may discover something they need to improve on their own.
</p>
<p>
Giving and receiving feedback for creative writing can be sensitive,
because writers are often personally attached to their work. Doing this
with care and sensitivity can help writers improve their work and move
ahead toward publication.

Screenwriting can raise many questions or doubts about whether something
is working. While asking your friends to check out your screenplay can
be helpful in some ways, having a professional give you feedback can

</p>
<p>
Gareth Brown’s debut, <strong>The Book of Doors</strong>, manages to
incorporate some time-travel surprises, (and not the ones readers might
expect), into an exciting novel of suspense. Told from multiple points
of view, readers initially meet Cassie, a clerk in a New York City
bookstore, when she discovers a regu­lar customer has quietly died while

<p>
Synchronicity strikes again with a pair of novels – both parts of
long-running future-history series – that show what can be done with a
particular set of science-fictional motifs and devices, especially when
the series format offers room to stretch out.

Alastair Reynolds’s <strong>Machine Vendetta </strong>is the third entry
