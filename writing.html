‘Rabbit Trap’ Screenplay Took Shape</h2>

<p>
For his feature debut and Sundance premiere <em>Rabbit Trap</em>,
writer/director Bryn Chainey took what might seem like an unconventional
path to develop the period horror story. <br><br>After drafting two
unproduced features with the goal of trying to fit industry
expectations, Chainey decided to follow his creative instincts wherever
they led. The result is a genre-defying work that weaves together folk
horror elements with experimental music and striking visuals, emerging
from a deeply personal creative process.<br><br>In <em>Rabbit Trap</em>,
Daphne (Rosy McEwen) and Darcy (Dev Patel) move to the 1970s Welsh
countryside to work on Daphne’s experimental album. Her music is full of
droning, buzzing, theremin and spoken vocals. Darcy spends his days
recording audio on the moors, until one day he picks up a strange
vibration. Nightmares keep him up at night. Then, one day, they see a
puckish child (Jade Croot) watching their cottage—and he’s soon enmeshed
in their lives in a way that threatens all of them.<br><br>Instead of
traditional outlining, Chainey said he started with his
fascinations—images, sounds, and ideas that captured his imagination.
Through journaling and self-interrogation, he allowed sometimes
seemingly disconnected elements to find their own
connections.<br><br>Landscapes morphed into scenes, musical patterns
suggested character moments, and even the growth patterns of mushrooms
influenced the film’s visual language. It’s a unique process and a way
to connect thematic and visual threads. What results is an atmospheric
story and one of the strongest folk horror tales I’ve seen in
years.<br><br>Final Draft chatted with the filmmaker just before his
Sundance premiere at a very chilly Eccles. <br><br>Chainey opened up
about his distinctive approach to screenwriting, his methods for solving
creative problems, and why staying true to your artistic vision might be
the most important lesson any filmmaker can learn. <br><br>His insights
offer valuable guidance for creators looking to find their own path
through the murky landscape of independent film. <br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: So you’re blending a few
different things in the script. You’ve got folk horror. You’ve got
experimental music elements. How do you approach putting that all on the
page? </span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bryn
Chainey</span>: For me, I do a lot of journaling. When I write, I get
fixated on certain things at different times. I get a certain kind of
music or a landscape or an image or a color, and I just journal. I’m
like, “Okay, Bryn”—I do it as questions. Why is this interesting to you?
Is it because this is, is it somehow scary to you? Are you intimidated
by this? And I just ask myself questions. <br><br>And so I end up with
just pages and pages of just ranting, rambling, kind of just asking
myself what’s going on. And along the way, rhymes happen in a
way. <br><br>I say, “Oh, what I’m fascinated by in the music is actually
connected to why I’m interested in mushrooms and the way they grow,” and
along the way I find the connection points and they just coalesce.

In her debut novel, Sheri T. Joseph mixes frus­tratingly messy politics
with painfully messy personal affairs to create a riveting novel of the
not-far-enough-away future. It’s a future of familiar challenges –
displaced people, xenophobia, tech­nologies that threaten individual
privacy. Joseph uses three key characters, and their love triangle, to

“Fugler [Robert Carlyle] was a character that I really connected with
from the beginning. I know it sounds a little strange that the Nazi was
my way into this, but it really was that idea of, ‘How can we get inside
his head and make sure that he’s a fully fleshed out person that way?’”
says Josh Salzberg about trying to make his villain, a Nazi named Damien
Fugler, a three-dimensional character.<br><br>Josh Salzberg wrote the
screenplay for <em>The Performance</em> with co-writer/director Shira
Piven. In this episode, Salzberg talks about the challenges of adapting
a short story by playwright Arthur Miller that’s about a Jewish-American
tap dancer [Jeremy Piven], who’s willing to compromise his own core
values to find fame and fortune in Nazi Germany. <br><br>“The idea of
all [the characters] is that they’re all performing on some level. They
all have another life. And that’s true to show business, that we all
have sides of ourselves that we’re not sure we want everybody to see or
that it’s okay for everybody to see. And then in Berlin in the ’30s,
there’s all these different communities that were impacted – not just
the Jews in Germany,” he says. <br><br>Salzberg also talks about his
background as a film editor, how it helped him transition to
screenwriting, and the challenges of writing morally compromised
characters like his protagonist, Harold [Jeremy Piven]. <br><br>“I think
embracing the mistakes that they make, embracing those flaws and leaning
into that is important. Sometimes we can care about our characters to
the point where we want them to be likable, which is a note we always
get, but we’ve got to be okay with the mistakes – and the consequences
for those mistakes. And that was a lesson that Shira and I kept learning
as we were developing the script,” he says. <br><br>To hear more about
Salzberg’s writing process, listen to the podcast. <br><br><em>Please
note: this episode contains discussions regarding racism and
anti-semitism. </em><br><br>

Season by David Ferraro: Review by Alex Brown</h2>

<strong>A Vile Season</strong>, David Ferraro (Page Street YA
979-8-89003-072-6, $18.99, 400pp, hc) October 2024.
</p>
<p>
David Ferraro’s new young adult fantasy romance <strong>A Vile Season
</strong>is comped as <strong>Bridgerton </strong>meets <strong>The
Bachelor </strong>but with vampires. That’s exactly the vibe. Everything
from the pacing, the intentionally and flamboyantly anachronistic
diversity in the upper classes, the garish wardrobe, the playful
disregard for historical accuracy, the overly dramatic rela­tionship
conflicts, the marriage competition,

Writers of duologies aren’t doing any favors for book reviewers. With a
trilogy, we can blather on about middle-book syndrome and three-act
structures; with an ongoing series, we can spec­ulate about
metanarratives or simply rate each new volume as though it were the
latest album from a familiar band, but a duology somehow seems to

<p>
This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best
Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The
Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out
of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László
Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent
lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build
a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The
Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely
unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).

<strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by
big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat
includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering
projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so
much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively
small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but

Jesse Ball, <strong>The Repeat Room </strong>(Catapult 9/24) This absurd
dystopian (and possibly truly Kaf­kaesque) SF novel details a jury system
where a single juror is chosen to relive the defendant’s experience; in
this case, a menial worker experi­ences an illicit psychosexual
relationship with a tragic end. “It’s in the novel’s absurdity that we
are asked to view justice and the worth of a single human life in a new
light.”
