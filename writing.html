      <h1>The Copyright Act Turns 50 (So We’re Reading the Whole Thing)</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>This year will mark 50 years since the passage of the Copyright Act of 1976. To honor the golden anniversary of what continues to be our governing law, we're launching a series of blog posts exploring the Copyright Act, section by section. In effect, we're giving ourselves an enormous reading assignment—all of Title 17—and bringing you along on the journey.</p>

      <p>John welcomes back Susanna Fogel and David Iserson (The Spy Who Dumped Me) to steal their secrets on creating an original tone in their new series PONIES.

      <h1>Bartz v. Anthropic: Updated Opt Out and Objection Dates, and a New Judge</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Since our recent post regarding the Bartz v. Anthropic settlement (Back-of-the-Envelope Math on What Payouts We May See in the Bartz v. Anthropic Settlement), there have been a number of developments in the case worth noting.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiffs and Anthropic jointly stipulated to an extension of the opt-out and objections deadline for the settlement.  These have been approved by the court and are now changed to January 29, 2026 - this change is also reflected on the settlement website.</p>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>In the webscraping cases now pending, courts should focus their analysis on whether there has been actual harm to the plaintiffs’ web infrastructures, instead of allowing digital platforms absolute control via ToS or TPMs.</p>

      <p>John and Craig consider all the words they have to write and ask, how do you know when something deserves your best effort? They offer a useful rubric for deciding when something is worth perfecting, and when over-optimization is a waste of time. We also follow up on compulsive writing habits, industry euphemisms, back issues, […]</p>

      <p>Out of roughly 16,000 eligible books, movies, or music, no more than five percent could expect to earn more than a total of $100 in the space of 20 years. The rest of the works—more than 15,000 of them—were expected to be worth less than five dollars per year (economically speaking) to their rights holders.</p>
