scholarly publications under the 2022 OSTP memo (the “Nelson Memo”). The

<strong>The Dagger in Vichy</strong>, Alastair Reynolds (Subter­ranean

Davis.

<p>
<strong>The Dagger in Vichy </strong>is very different from Alastair
Reynolds’s other recent work. His most recent novel, <strong>Machine
Vendetta </strong>(2024), saw him return to the Revelation Space
universe. This novella, on the other hand, is set on Earth – albeit (it
becomes clear) many centuries in the future. No space op­era, <strong>The

“Sameness is terrible. Your goal is to cut through it. If you have a
unique perspective, you’re going to take vampires or anything that
everybody thinks they know and do it in a way that’s really exciting and
gets people really pumped up about it. There are all these incredible
worlds to explore, but there just needs to be somebody that can take you
there that has a different way of doing it… I want to see creators that
offer something specific and unique. Specificity is key to me. I don’t
want a cover band. I don’t want people covering what has been before. I
want to see something new. I want to see a badass band with a new singer
or new lyrics, a new style of music,” says Peter Katz, founder of Story
Driven, a literary management and production company. <br><br>On today’s
episode, we speak to Peter Katz, a manager and producer championing
writers with fresh, unique voices who are forging new ground. We talk
about what he looks for in a writing sample, why he loves being a judge
in Final Draft’s Big Break screenplay competition, and why short stories
are having a bright moment in the film industry. <br><br>“Recently, I’ve
actually seen TV executives starting to think about short stories as a
foundation for potential shows. It’s a really effective way to
communicate an idea quickly, in a really conceptual way, but also, it’s
not like a pitch. It’s very tonal, you have character perspective and
you have the style that the author brings to it. So I think it has a
really unique marriage between pitching the concept, but also immersing
you in a world in a very short period of time. That’s why I think it’s
been effective in selling to a market because you could share a short
story with somebody and it doesn’t demand a lot of time If it’s
developed properly, you’re able to learn about the potential of this
project and then quickly share with somebody else on your team. And
overnight, a lot of people can sign on to a project because it doesn’t
take as long as other mediums,” says Katz. <br><br>To hear more about
Katz’s perspective on the industry and what he looks for in a writer’s
voice, listen to the podcast.

About 30 years ago, something changed in Hollywood. Big blockbuster
movies by top-notch filmmakers were no longer the clear-cut favorites to
win Academy Awards. Small films were breaking through the surface and
gaining appeal among a wide audience. Suddenly, filmmakers like Steven
Soderbergh, the Coen Brothers and Kevin Smith, whose films’ budgets were
miniscule compared to studio feature films, were finding niche audiences
and building box office credibility.

The South by Southwest Conference &amp; Festival, held annually in
Austin, TX, crackles with a creative energy no other film festival can
match, offering screenwriters lessons from its wildly diverse
slate.<br><br>While studios were certainly present at the fest, with
big-name sequels like <em>The Accountant 2</em> and <em>Another Simple
Favor</em> nabbing splashy premieres, it also feels like a remarkably
scrappy place. You’ll find swing-for-the-fences high-concept projects
sharing space with adult animation series, self-funded comedy pilots
paired with deeply personal autobiographical stories, and concepts so
audaciously weird they shouldn’t work but somehow do.<br><br>I saw as
many features, shorts, and pilots as possible and spoke with writers
from projects of all sizes and genres, putting together some of this
year’s common themes and hearing what they’ve learned.

This may sound like an odd question, but are algorithms starting to take
over the narrative func­tion that psi powers once served in SF? The idea
of preventing crimes by pre-emptively arresting supposed perpetrators
has been around at least since Orwell’s notion of ‘‘thoughtcrimes,’’ and
in the 1950s this became the province of psioni­cally gifted folks like

The premiere episode of the fourth and final season of <em>The Righteous
Gemstones</em> has a lot of people talking. <br><br>The episode, titled
simply “Prelude,” doesn’t feature any of the series’ regular cast. It
also takes place during the Civil War, and not during the show’s
present-day setting, as it follows an ancestor of the Gemstone family:
Elijah Gemstone (played wonderfully by Bradley Cooper).<br><br>One of
the main reasons the episode has created such a buzz is how much of a
departure it is from the rest of the show. Cowritten and directed by
<em>Gemstones</em> creator and star Danny McBride, “Prelude” is highly
cinematic and carries far more gravitas than a typical episode of the
comedic series. <br><br>There <em>have </em>been tonal shifts previously
in <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, largely due to the acting chops of
John Goodman (playing family patriarch Eli Gemstone), as well as the
occasional dramatic-leaning turn. The same can be said for McBride’s
other HBO series <em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em> and <em>Vice
Principals</em>. Whether it’s a shocking burst of violence or a
cathartic moment set to an evocative piece of music, McBride’s comedy —
alongside frequent collaborators Jody Hill and David Gordon Green — has
always been offset by not only a cinematic flair, but also a willingness
to embrace different tones.

Augur 7.3

<p>
Augur 7.3 starts off on a high note with <strong>A.D. Sui</strong>’s
“<strong>One Becomes Two</strong>”, a gor­geous and subtly eerie story. A
couple married for 15 years travels to Greenland to study a mysterious
sludge causing the local wildlife population to act like a single-cell
organism, sharing thoughts and knowledge. The narrator is tired of
existing in their spouse’s shadow and feeling their own life and
