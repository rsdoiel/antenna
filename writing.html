Jia-Wen </strong>opens khōréō 4.3 on a strong note, following the
rivalry between two competi­tive skaters, each using different kinds of
body modifications. The rivalry between them leads to fascination, which
develops into a romantic relationship. The story is beautifully written,
ex­ploring parents living vicariously through their children and the
pressure often put on young athletes to succeed. The story
