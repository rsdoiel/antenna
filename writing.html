outside Los Angeles? The truth is yes, as there are so many different

Hearts Abishola</em>) found a way to make inroads in the industry while
still a factory worker in Indiana.

There are many ways to cleave the views of the political right from the

confidence in the role of individual self-discipline on one’s life

<strong>Gogmagog </strong>is the first novel I’ve read by Jeff Noon
since the publication of <strong>Nyphomation </strong>in 1997. The books
he wrote immediately after his Vurt phase – <strong>Needle in the Groove
</strong>and <strong>Falling Out of Cars </strong>– didn’t appeal to
twenty-something Ian (though <strong>Falling Out of Cars </strong>looks
right up the al­ley of fifty-something Ian).
