<p>This post is by Maria Crusey, a third-year law student at Washington
University in St. Louis. Maria has been working with Authors Alliance
this semester on a project exploring legal claims in the now 30+ pending

Lessons in Horror Writing from ‘Smile 2’ Filmmaker Parker Finn</h2>

<p>
Writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6475689/">Parker
Finn</a> has mastered a specific brand of horror with 2022’s <span
style="font-style: italic;">Smile</span> and this year’s Halloween hit,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Smile 2</span>. It’s dour, it’s
high-concept, it’s ghastly and gory and great. The story might lead
viewers to ask certain questions. How does he come up with such unique
scares, and write them visually on the page? How does a focus on
character influence the tension? Also, is he okay? (Just
kidding.) <br><br>Finn has tapped into something that is resonating with
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/why-horror-never-dies">horror</a>
fans and everyday moviegoers alike, and is doing so with original
storytelling and deft direction that has landed him in the nation’s
number-one box office spot. <br><br>In this film, his smiley contagion
lands on Skye Riley (Naomi Scott), one of the world’s biggest pop stars
on the cusp of a comeback. The year before, she suffered a deadly
accident and heavy substance abuse. <br><br>As she preps for her tour,
she visits old friend Lewis (Lukas Gage), who has just had the curse
transferred to him. After he dies in front of her, Skye finds herself
rehearsing and handling appearances as everything crumbles around her.
She grows increasingly manic, not sure what’s real and who she can
trust.

Nghi Vo is full of surprises. I suppose one could argue that her first
novel, the Gatsbyesque <strong>The Chosen and the Beautiful</strong>,
and her second, the very different Hollywood fantasy historical
<strong>The Siren Queen</strong>, had a few things in common – like
early 20th-century American settings and the classic themes of the need

Michael Martineck has had the kind of respectable bubbling-under career
