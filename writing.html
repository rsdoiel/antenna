When Allison Norlian and her filmmaking partner, Kody Leibowitz, set out
to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, they knew they would need a lot more gear than
good hiking boots, a sleeping bag and a map. They needed cameras, sound
equipment and a protagonist given they were also planning to shoot and
co-direct their first feature documentary. Final Draft sat down with
Allison Norlian to hear more about that life-changing journey that
resulted in the film

What makes a successful writer tick? How do they handle bad news? How
have others changed their lives and how do they pay it
forward? <br><br>If you want to learn from the best, you’ve come to the
right place. Read on below for a glorious dive into the mind of Liz
Craft, host of the popular podcast
‘<a href="https://happierinhollywood.com/">Happier in Hollywood</a>’
whose writing credits include <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Shield, Lie To Me, The Vampire Diaries, The 100</span>, and <span
style="font-style: italic;">Fantasy Island</span>.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">FD: Let’s dig in! Now, because you already
have a flourishing Substack and popular podcast, you already share so
much information and advice with writers. But for anybody who maybe
hasn’t listened to your podcast yet, do you have a favorite episode to
recommend? </span><br><br>That’s a good question. The podcast is called
Happier in Hollywood. I host it with my writing partner Sarah Fain. And
we have a
<a href="https://happierinhollywoodpod.substack.com/">Substack</a> with
the same name. We actually put together a list of our
<a href="https://happierinhollywoodpod.substack.com/p/top-20-hih-episodes-for-television">favorite
20 episodes</a>, the best ones for aspiring TV writers.<br><br><span
style="font-weight: bold;">FD: In addition to the podcast, you and Sarah
have also written some books. Do you have any advice for screenwriters
interested in dipping their toes in the book-writing pool? Are there
ways that the process of writing a book was similar or different than
breaking a story for a studio? </span><br><br>Yeah, definitely. I think
it’s helpful to have the experience of breaking story from
screenwriting. What’s odd is how much you can write with a book. It’s
really hard to get used to a lot of description and interior monologue
because of course we have almost none of that, certainly no interior
monologue, in a script. So that is a muscle that we’re having to learn
to flex over and over again. I also think that in novel writing, you
leave more room for the story to unfold as you write than one does in
screenwriting because, you know, we always break a story completely
before writing an episode of something or a pilot, but writing a novel,
I think many writers leave more room for finding out the story as they
write.

One thing you can rely on science fiction for is a bit of
self-mythologisation. Probably every literary field (probably every
field of any kind) does a bit of it, but from the Futurians and the
Science Fiction League onwards, and among both elite writing groups and
local fan groups, science fiction has a tradition of convert­ing anecdote

generation of countless works that compete with the originals, even if
those works aren’t themselves infringing.”</p>

Written and directed by David Joseph Craig and Brian Crano,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27623406/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_i%2520don%27t%2520understand%2520you"><em>I
Don’t Understand You</em></a> is a horror-comedy that unabashedly pushes
the limits of both the horror and comedy genres. Starring Nick Kroll and
Andrew Rannells as a married couple on the verge of adopting a baby,
they take a Babymoon to Italy where they soon realize they are in over
their heads when it comes to understanding the language, food, culture –
and each other. While the fish out of water scenario provides great
farcical comedy, the horror aspects slowly begin to creep in as the
humor grows darker.<br><br>“We set out to write a horror movie with
comedic flares,” says Craig, “but we ended up with a comedy that had
horror flares. It just evolved that way.”<br><br>David Joseph Craig and
Brian Crano are married in real life and are as sharp, witty and
possibly as lovingly bumbling as the characters they inspired on screen.
The couple met on a blind date that their agent set up for them. “It was
a very interesting, Hollywood-ish way to meet,” says Craig, adding, “But
it’s 15 years later, so it worked out!” <br><br>After adopting a baby in
real-life, Craig and Crano found themselves spending a lot of time
together during COVID and wanted a shared creative outlet. “It started
in the living room. We had just had our son. It was the beginning of the
pandemic. We had an infant sleeping on us, and we were like, ‘What if we
started writing this movie together?’” Crano says.<br><br>Projecting
their Final Draft document onto their TV screen, writing together began
as a fun way to fill the time. Crano describes a moment when he wrote a
character inspired by Craig. As he typed COLE, 35, <span
style="font-style: italic;">but</span> <span
style="font-style: italic;">admits</span> to 32, Craig ruffled, saying,
“You can’t say that!” Finally conceding that the description was both
hilarious and authentic, Craig agreed to keep it in the script. As they
got to the heart of each other’s insecurities on the page, they both
knew they were onto something. <br><br>“We could make fun of each other
through this process,” Crano says, “and that was entertaining enough to
keep us sane.”<br><br>The film’s early scenes are pulled from their real
lives, including the emotional rollercoaster of the adoption process.
But rather than turn it into a straight drama, the couple decided to use
genre as a vehicle to explore – and then bust open – the familiar tropes
of LGBTQ+ stories.<br><br>“So many portrayals of adoption on screen
paint the birth mother as a villain,” says Crano. “But that couldn’t
have been further from our experience. We wanted to make the birth
mother the hero of the film, and let the gay characters, for once, be
the ones who go off the rails.”
