Natasha Bell has written two novels, and is a creative writing teacher
with a PhD in Autofiction. It took her eight years to finish her first
novel, after having started writing it then putting it aside. When she
started a Master’s course in Creative and Life Writing, “it was still
kind of bugging me. So I ended up working on that a little bit. I
submitted the first book for the anthology that we sent out to agents
and editors. I got quite a bit of response from agents, and that kicked
me back into gear. I signed with an agent and got an editor for that.”
</p>
<p>
This shows how starting a piece of fiction, then setting it aside for a
while, can help grow that story. “If you put a novel aside and you’re
never thinking about it again, then it probably needs to stay there. But
if those characters are really bugging you, tapping you on your
shoulder, then you need to return to them.”
</p>
<p>
Natasha works teaching creative writing, and I pointed out that there is
a trope that creative writing cannot be taught, though that has changed
in recent decades. Natasha said, “my attitude as a tutor is that we’re
all in this together; writing is a set of problems to be solved. You’re
always faced with problems, however experienced you are, you’re still
having to figure out these things and do a lot of creative
problem-solving.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, there is no recipe to teaching creative writing. So many
elements in writing are interrelated, and it’s hard to grasp them all.
Natasha said, “There’s good advice when it comes to teaching writing,
but you sometimes need to hear those at specific moments. Someone can
tell you until they’re blue in the face that you should try and show not
tell, which obviously, we can critique that as a piece of advice anyway.
But until you’re faced with a particular kind of challenge within your
own narrative, applying that to fixes, you’re not going to really learn
that on a deep level. We can read dozens of books telling us exactly how
to structure our novels or how to kind of polish our sentences, but you
can’t take it all in at once. You can only take one thing at a time when
it reaches you at the right moment.”
</p>
<p>
Natasha has long used Scrivener, and said, “What I find Scrivener
amazing for is the earliest stages, starting to write, vomiting out all
of your ideas, collating the research, moving things around, changing
point of view. Because you can have everything in one place, it’s such a
good place to experiment with and to move structure around.”
</p>
<p>
Natasha also said, “The Corkboard is amazing, because that’s what I do
on my floor anyway with note cards, so it’s nice to be able to visualize
it like that. Being able to label chapters, use the icons, move them
into folders, move them around. The different functionality of comments,
being able to change the colors or label them as different types. But
then also being able to turn all of that off and then just look in
Composition Mode. So being able to react to where you are in the writing
process and what you need on a particular day is really useful.”
</p>
<p>
Natasha does a lot of revision, and Scrivener helps with that. “There’s
something for me about the labor of moving things, compiling things,
rewriting even for both my published novels at quite a late stage. I
have rewritten them word for word, because it’s part of the editing
process. I quite like the analog versions of moving things back and
forth.”
</p>
<p>
I asked if she meant that she retyped the entire manuscript, and she
said, “Yeah, it really forces you to think, ‘okay, does this word need
to be here?’ You’re asking a reader to read every single word you’ve
written. Once you get to kind of that almost final draft, you’re so numb
to everything, you’re not even reading your whole sentences because you
know them so well. So I think forcing yourself to engage with your work
again on the sentence level and think about, ‘what am I asking the
reader to spend their time engaging with? And is it? Is it worth it? Is
this sentence really earning its weight?’”
</p>
<p>
Finally, I asked how Natasha separated her writing time from her
teaching time. “With difficulty. But the pleasure of teaching is that I
get to spend my days talking to people about writing, and craft, and
narrative. So all of that feeds into my own writing.”

Writer/director James Cox has had an incredibly successful career as a
filmmaker, making movies such as <em>Wonderland, Straight A’s,</em> and
<em>Billionaire Boys Club</em>.
</p>
<p>
While fairy tales can come true, the film business can be a
rollercoaster even for the most brilliant and talented artists. But Cox
is also resilient and has learned how to hang on – sometimes for dear
life - during the ups and downs. A visionary storyteller and master
world-builder, Cox has just released his first novel, <em>Grand Theft
AI</em>. Part <em>The Matrix</em>, part <em>Blade Runner</em>, part
personal inventory of inner demons, the book takes the reader on a wild,
futuristic ride that embraces our fears of the digital world while
instilling hope in humanity.

The film <em>Ghos</em>t (1990) is one of the most iconic love stories
ever put on film. Who can forget Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore sensually
touching fingers through soft, buttery clay as the song “Unchained
Melody” is soulfully crooned by The Righteous Brothers? The film’s
exploration of love’s ability to transcend physical boundaries struck a
nerve with audiences.

at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other
projects.

<p>
This year, as in prior years, we are shooting for $10K.
</p>
<p>
<b>We’re now accepting donations for 2024!</b><br/>The donation button
is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name
listed on our donor page (or listed as “anonymous” if you prefer)! Our
fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition
voting. 80% of the proceeds ($8K+ if we hit our goal) will be
distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. 
</p>
<p>
<b>What does this mean for authors?</b><br/>Because we’re dividing the
money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how
many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the
money among the top 50. If we have $10K, that would mean that the winner
of the competition will be offered a prize of $451, second place will be
offered $433, third prize $416… and so on and so forth until 50th place,
which will be offered $10.  Our goal is to distribute prizes across a
broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately
well is offered a decent prize.
</p>
<p>
<b>How do I donate?</b><br/>Please go to https://ifcomp.org and push the
big blue Donate button.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b><br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by
law. (Consult a tax professional.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize
list?</b><br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual
IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well!
Please visit our prize page to see what objects and services others have
donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how
you can contribute.
</p>
<p>
<b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b><br/>Via PayPal or Venmo.
(The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you
can’t accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If
that doesn’t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we
will roll the money into next year’s prize fund, which means it will
continue to support authors and IFTF programs.

There has been no shortage of good haunted-house tales in the past year
or so, with contri­butions from Elizabeth Hand, Alix E. Harrow, T.
Kingfisher, and others. Christopher Barzak’s <strong>A Voice Calling
</strong>(his first novella, he tells us in an afterword) might seem to
be hopping on the bandwagon, but in fact it’s an expansion of a
