“I think what Tim [Burton] does is he’s always trying to simplify.
That’s the essence of a classic filmmaker. People think he’s wild and
crazy and does all these things. His movies are brilliantly composed
frames and he’s always looking for simplicity. All of his big movies,
they’re really family dramas dressed up in whatever genre he’s in.
That’s really what they are. And I think people think he’s always
strange and weird and likes dark things, but no! It’s a classic story
with good drama. And then he brings his sensibility to it,” says about
the biggest lesson Al Gough has learned working with director Tim Burton
on both the TV show <em>Wednesday</em> and the new film <em>Beetlejuice
Beetlejuice</em>.

There’s a common piece of advice for writers, and that’s to always be
writing. Showrunner Joe Henderson (<em>Lucifer</em>) got a jump start on
those words of wisdom as he was already writing stories in second grade,
never knowing where those stories, and that creativity, would take him.
Henderson recalls:<br><br><em>“I was reading Dungeons and Dragons books
and would write stories that either took place in that world or extended
it out. I moved on to Star Wars novels and would write my versions of
that. I was just always writing.”</em>

rewire my brain chemistry. The book contains a stew of dense but
rewarding elements as people, dogs, spirits, and bots dot a literary
canvas unlike anything I’ve read. It’s a cozy dystopia that demands
attention, demands that you think on its wavelength. The book largely
contains good but flawed
