(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>This year will mark 50 years since the passage of the Copyright Act of 1976. To honor the golden anniversary of what continues to be our governing law, we're launching a series of blog posts exploring the Copyright Act, section by section. In effect, we're giving ourselves an enormous reading assignment—all of Title 17—and bringing you along on the journey.</p>

      <h1>Bartz v. Anthropic: Updated Opt Out and Objection Dates, and a New Judge</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Since our recent post regarding the Bartz v. Anthropic settlement (Back-of-the-Envelope Math on What Payouts We May See in the Bartz v. Anthropic Settlement), there have been a number of developments in the case worth noting.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiffs and Anthropic jointly stipulated to an extension of the opt-out and objections deadline for the settlement.  These have been approved by the court and are now changed to January 29, 2026 - this change is also reflected on the settlement website.</p>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>In the webscraping cases now pending, courts should focus their analysis on whether there has been actual harm to the plaintiffs’ web infrastructures, instead of allowing digital platforms absolute control via ToS or TPMs.</p>
