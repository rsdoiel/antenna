Analog 5-6/24
</p>
<p>
The May/June 2024 issue of Analog opens with <strong>“Uncle Roy’s
Computer Repairs and Used Robot Parts” </strong>by <strong>Martin L.
Shoemaker</strong>, a charming novella about a man who retires with his
wife to her hometown and starts his own computer repair business only to
find himself accidentally in a bitter rivalry with the town’s resident
“whiz kid.” It’s a fun story that does a good job of capturing

Dowie Reviews Archangels of Funk by Andrea Hairston</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>Archangels of Funk</strong>, Andrea Hairston (Tor­dotcom

<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
Choice of Games published Benjamin Rosenbaum’s The Ghost and the Golem,
a “450,000-word Jewish histori­cal fantasy interactive fiction,” in
August 2024. Rosenbaum calls it “kind of a magnum opus,” and explains,
“Unlike a game which is graphics and fight mechanics with some story
crammed in here and there, these games are purely a bunch of fictional
narrative words: you do make choices, but the output, after having made
those choices,
