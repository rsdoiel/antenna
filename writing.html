Have you written a screenplay but you don’t know how to get industry
professionals to read it?<br> <br>This is important because ultimately
it’s about getting <span style="font-weight: bold;">as many eyes on your
script</span> as possible. The more people who read it, the more chances
that someone will see potential in it: the law of averages, right?

<p>A little over a week ago, the National Institutes of Health issued a
new guidance policy on indirect costs in Federal grant awards.
Presently, NIH negotiates the indirect cost rate with individual
institutions through a carefully regulated process that ensures an
appropriate rate for a given institution’s unique circumstances, while
also providing robust safeguards and […]</p>

Cory Doctorow’s novels about forensic accountant Martin Hench are
playing out as a trilogy-in-reverse: We first met Hench as a wealthy
67-year-old freelance investigator in <strong>Red Team Blues
</strong>(2023), then as he recalled a case from 2006 in <strong>The
Bezzle</strong>, when he was probably approaching 50. Now,

I’d be lying if I said I was in a particularly great mental space to
look back at the previous year with anything like insight or
objectivity. Not only for the most obvi­ous reasons, but because the year
took it out of me in ways personal and rather profound. Of course, that
seems to be largely par for the course for the last decade, which
fittingly coincides with the years
