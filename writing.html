As a reader new to Tomi Adeyemi, I hadn’t read the first two books in
the Legacy of Orïsha trilogy, before approaching <strong>Chil­dren of

experience, because the novel, while part of a trilogy, clearly allows
for new readers.

There are many
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/the-bricks-of-breaking-in-writer-ray-utarnachitt-on-finding-your-own-path">pathways
in</a> when it comes to making it as a writer. For Gina Yashere (<span
style="font-style: italic;">Bob Hearts Abishola</span>), that path was
anything but direct. In fact, for the longest time she didn’t even think
of being a writer. She was an engineer, but her love of comedy, when
given the chance to thrive, won out, leading her to perform stand-up,
write sketch comedy in the UK, and even become a finalist on NBC’s <span
style="font-style: italic;">Last Comic Standing</span>. To get through
that door as a working writer in Hollywood, it literally came down to a
fortunate Google search by a veteran show creator in need of a Nigerian
woman writer that opened the way for her television career.

“Sometimes I think [the show <em>Pachinko</em>] is almost too personal.
I feel like every show, you look at it and say, ‘How much of myself is
in this show?’ I did a show [<em>The Whispers</em>] about children who
were communicating with an invisible alien force and somehow, I had to
figure out how to make it part of me as well. We try to put ourselves in
as much of our work as possible. But with this show, the tipping point
almost fell in the other direction, where I felt so personally invested.
I felt very much like this is my family’s story, as well. That
responsibility sometimes felt burdensome. So many of the cast and crew
have said that there’s a responsibility with this show that almost feels
too much. But at the end of the day I think it’s a thing that made us
work harder. I think the show is as good as it is because people cared,”
says <em>Pachinko</em> showrunner and creator Soo Hugh about making the
story personal to her.
</p>
<p>
In this episode, we speak to Hugh about the challenges of writing a show
where characters speak in three languages, making the characters
relatable to an American audience, and the responsibility of telling the
stories of strong women over generations.
</p>
<p>
“In Korean families, we always have these jokes that everyone knows
who’s running the house – your mother! I think it’s the strength of
Korean women that have just carried us through,” she says.
</p>
<p>
We even ask Hugh about her work on one of my favorite shows <em>The
Terror</em>, and what she thinks really happened to the real-life
British crew on the Terror and Erebus ships that got stuck in the Artic
ice. Her answer may surprise you.

A film trope is a thematic storytelling device that conveys an idea to
the audience. <br><br>If a trope is utilized enough over time, avid
filmgoers and critics will become aware of the device and will be able
to spot it when it appears. For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the Hero’s
Journey</a> is a popular story template for movies, and within this
template are several common tropes: the protagonist has lost a parental
figure, they initially refuse a calling, they get initiated into a new
world by a mentor, and eventually they come into their own and become a
hero.

<p>
Reading Puloma Ghosh’s debut collection, <strong>Mouth</strong>, brought
me back to the pandemic and the months spent in lockdown. To be clear,
not one of the eleven stories in the book takes place during or refers
to COVID, but isolation and loneliness are so central to Ghosh’s work,
her protagonist’s aching for intimacy, that my thoughts were cast

Beetlejuice: Sequel Magic or Missed Opportunity? A Movie Review by Erin
Underwood</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: Locus Magazine</p>

Tim Burton returns to direct <strong>Beetlejuice 2</strong> (2024), also
known as <strong>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</strong>, in this wickedly wild
sequel that takes on the 1988 classic, starring Michael Keaton, Winona
Ryder, and Jenna Ortega. Since so many remakes and sequels this year
have fallen flat, despite media buzz and excitement, it was easy to be
skeptical about this film. Could it live up to the original? With Tim
Burton, most of
