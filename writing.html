framed as parts of a book of family recipes collated and annotated by
Ember, who is writing them down to save them for future generations.

Hollywood has been producing biographical films
or <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/want-write-biopic">biopics</a> since
the earliest days of the movie business. Due to changing times and
tastes,
some <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">film
genres</a> come and go with varying popularity in the screenwriting
marketplace. With more and more focus on established intellectual
properties (a.k.a. IP)— due to brand recognition—fewer films are being
made based on original stories.

2023 was certainly… a year for short speculative fiction. Another
amazing year in terms of the quality and quantity of stories pub­lished,
but also a challeng­ing year as many venues have faced increased
fi­nancial pressures and de­creasing returns from social media, as well as
personal losses and national and international tragedies. While the year
might seem like it went out like a lamb, it’s possible that the full

I’m always reluctant to pick out trends when sum­marising a year’s books
for Locus. There are too many contingencies at play in what gets
published when, and so much is dependent on which fraction of the
torrent of SFF books I’ve managed to read. But this year, I do feel
confident in one judgment: It was a really fine time to be reading books
of the fantastic. The works I’m

Brendan Shay Basham’s debut novel <strong>Swim Home to the Vanished

fluid and sharp, full of shapeshifters and enchanted landscapes, rich in
dialog and insight.

id="do-you-write-longhand-store-handwritten-notes-and-texts-in-scrivener-projects">Do
You Write Longhand? Store Handwritten Notes and Texts in Scrivener
Projects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Many writers find that using analog tools can spur creativity. &amp;nbsp;They may make preparatory notes by hand, or write scenes, chapters, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neilhimself/status/1043801237093863424&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;entire novels&lt;/a&gt; on paper. It is said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/shut-and-listen/202205/the-creative-benefits-writing-longhand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;writing longhand uses different parts of the brain&lt;/a&gt; than tapping keys on a keyboard and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/03/creative-writing-better-pen-longhand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it may boost creativity&lt;/a&gt;. Since writers eventually spend so much time editing and revising their texts on a computer that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/insider/the-case-for-writing-longhand-its-about-trying-to-create-that-little-space-of-freedom.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creating a first draft by hand&lt;/a&gt; can be a way of getting a different perspective on their work. &amp;nbsp;And when writing longhand, you won&amp;rsquo;t be distracted by your computer or tempted to browse social media, shop, or play games.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Scrivener is, of course, designed for electronic input, either via a
keyboard or
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/write-with-your-voice-how-to-use-dictation-with-scrivener" target="_blank">by
even using dictation</a>. But because of the way Scrivener projects
allow you to include many types of documents, you can also store
handwritten notes in them.  Here’s how. 
</p>
<p>Taking notes</p>
<p>
If you are an analog note-taker, you have your preferences. You may
write in a pocket notebook, or you may take notes on pads. You may write
with a pencil or a pen: maybe a fountain pen, if you prefer that sort of
feeling of the pen on the paper. (And are willing to put up with the
potential mess.) Some people can write with any type of writing
implement on any type of paper, and others are more comfortable with a
very specific combination. I like the relaxing pale, yellow color of
legal pads and the smooth ivory-colored paper of
<a href="https://rhodiapads.com/collections_premium_rpads.php" target="_blank">Rhodia
R pads</a>, and I like the tactile feel of a good pencil or a smooth
ballpoint pen on paper. I especially like the smell of a cedar pencil
just after it has been sharpened; something about this smell puts me in
the mood to write.
</p>
<p>
My handwriting is terrible. While I enjoy writing in notebooks, such as
Moleskine notebooks, the pages are too small, and everything I write
ends up messy. But those notebooks are great to carry around with you so
you can write anywhere. If you have good, compact handwriting, you can
write a novel in these notebooks.
</p>
<p>
You may want to use a hybrid, combining analog and digital. There are
apps for Apple‘s iPad that allow you to write by hand using an Apple
Pencil. This allows you to erase any mistakes you make, and change the
color you’re writing in, or alter the thickness of the stroke. You can
switch from something that looks like a pen to a pencil, a felt tip pen,
or even a brush. And you can export files from these apps to PDF format,
which you can later import into your Scrivener project. One such app is
<a href="https://www.goodnotes.com" target="_blank">Goodnotes</a>, but
you’ll find many apps that work this way on Apple’s App Store.
</p>
<p>Adding handwritten documents to Scrivener projects</p>
<p>
There are two types of handwritten documents that you may wish to add to
your Scrivener project. If you’ve made preparatory notes about a scene,
character, or location, you can add these to your project, to refer to
as you write. And if you’ve written entire scenes or chapters, you can
add these to transcribe and edit. 
</p>
<p>
If you own a scanner, you could use that, but the easiest way to capture
your handwritten notes is to take photos of them with your smartphone
camera. Both iPhones and Android phones today have sufficient resolution
for you to be able to read handwritten notes easily.
</p>
<p>
I took a photo of the notes that I made for this article (I told you
that my handwriting is not very good), which I then imported to my
Scrivener project. You cannot add photos to folders in the top section
of the Binder, but you can add them to the Research folder. So I created
a Notes folder and added the photo there.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/notes1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;You can do the same thing if you have a notebook full of scenes and chapters. Take photos of each page or each two-page spread with your phone. Transfer those photos to your Mac or PC, then add all the photos to a subfolder of the research folder.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
If you’re using an iPad app, export notes from that app as JPEGs or PDFs
and add them to your project.
</p>
<p>Using handwritten notes in Scrivener projects</p>
<p>
You may wonder what the point of this is. If you have these handwritten
notes on paper, or in a notebook, you can refer to them while you’re
working with Scrivener. But there are several advantages to storing them
in your project. First, you can organize these notes in subfolders
according to what they refer to. You may have made notes on a pad or in
a notebook for different elements of a project, but not in order. You
can rearrange the notes so they fit together easily.
</p>
<p>
The second way you can use them is to use Scrivener’s split-screen mode,
viewing them alongside a Scrivener document. In the screenshot below,
I’ve hidden the Inspector to give me more horizontal room, and I’ve
clicked the Split Editor button to view my handwritten notes on the left
and a text file in my project is in the Binder on the right. (Check out
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/see-more-of-your-project-splitting-the-scrivener-editor" target="_blank">See
More of Your Project: Splitting the Scrivener Editor</a> for more on
splitting the editor.) I can refer to my notes as I am writing my
article.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/notes2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;If you are transcribing longer sections of text, such as entire chapters from a notebook, you can display the photos of your notebook pages on one side, and type in a document on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Many writers use handwritten notes or write sections of their books by
hand, in part to free themselves from their computers. The ability to
incorporate these notes into your Scrivener project makes it much easier
to go from analog to digital and prepare your final draft.

I’ve been a massive fan of Jonathan Evison’s fiction since encountering
his 2012 novel <strong>The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving</strong>.
Not only does Evison have a cracking sense of humour, but he can see
beauty and humanity in the darkest and most challenging of situations. I
never thought, though, that I’d be reviewing one of Evison’s books
