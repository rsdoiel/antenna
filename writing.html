There’s a common piece of advice for writers, and that’s to always be
writing. Showrunner Joe Henderson (<em>Lucifer</em>) got a jump start on
those words of wisdom as he was already writing stories in second grade,
never knowing where those stories, and that creativity, would take him.
Henderson recalls:<br><br><em>“I was reading Dungeons and Dragons books
and would write stories that either took place in that world or extended
it out. I moved on to Star Wars novels and would write my versions of
that. I was just always writing.”</em>

“Unlike a game which is graphics and fight mechanics with some story
crammed in here and there, these games are purely a bunch of fictional
narrative words: you do make choices, but the output, after having made
those choices,
