Left with Heavy Fees by Copyright Troll Law Firm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>The final outcome of the case: the plaintiff was ordered to cover
$102,404 in fees and $165.72 in costs for the defendant. This should
serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits,
like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the
damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should
make plaintiffs whole again—that is, as if no infringement has ever
occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be
undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams. </p>

“<strong>The Slave Boy</strong>” by <strong>Denzel Xavier Scott

forms of captivity and freedom. A young boy contemplates his own
imprisonment and the imprisonment of the talking animals he’s forced to
care for, pitying them, but also resenting them and the way they mock
and torment him. He meets a strange man who offers him

It can be incredibly difficult to venture into an established genre like
the
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-reasons-you-should-write-a-sports-biopic-like-clipped">sports
drama.</a><br><br>It’s a tried-and-true narrative with some equally
tested—and beloved—tropes. Sometimes the team is a ragtag group of
misfits, the underdogs no one believes in. Sometimes the coach has taken
on this post after failing in the big leagues. Often, the most dramatic
moment comes down to the last play in the big
game.<br><br>Writer/director Sydney Freeland (Diné) knows all these
tropes. And instead of fighting against them during the writing process,
she embraced them, flipped them, gave them a unique spin, and made them
work for the story.

<strong>Joker: Folie à Deux</strong> starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady

easily one of the most anticipated movies of 2024, which automatically
puts it at a disadvantage when trying to meet the audience’s

Scary is in. Fear is fashionable. Horror is hot. That’s what we’re told.

<em>Hold Your Breath</em> is an achingly beautiful film that resonates
in many powerful ways. While hitting many of the necessary tropes of
psychological horror, it’s the incredible acting performances that hook
you and won’t let you escape – even when it’s hard to
breathe. <br><br>Set in Oklahoma in the 1930s Dust Bowl, famine, disease
and death abound. But for Margaret (Sarah Paulson), and her two
daughters, 12-year-old Rose (Amiah Miller) and 7-year-old Ollie (Alona
Jane Robbins) who’s deaf, it’s not just the pervasive dust that’s
threatening their lives, but something much more sinister. Even when the
mysterious stranger Wallace (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) shows up menacingly in
the night, the film asks: could the mother-daughter bond be the most
dangerous threat of all? <br><br>Written by Karrie Crouse, best known
for TV’s <em>Westworld</em>, and directed by Crouse and Will Joines, the
movie seems like a dark fable inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, when
just breathing the air might put your life at risk. But surprisingly
(and eerily), the screenplay was written before the pandemic even
started. Crouse says the inspiration for the film actually came from
watching the Ken Burns documentary <em>The Dust Bowl</em>.

Work” in the Digital Age?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Author’s Union blog</p>

should be cautious in adopting the new meaning being superimposed on
“derivative works.”</p>
