Fiction which deliberately sets itself in dialogue with specific works
of earlier fiction is an ancient tradition, but it often seems like
catnip for SFF writers. Just in the last few years we’ve seen Nghi Vo on
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Elizabeth Hand on Shirley Jackson, Kij Johnson on
Kenneth Gra­hame and H.P. Lovecraft, John Kessel on Austen and

Y<strong>ou began publishing SF stories about five years ago. Describe
how you got your start as a writer, and your path to
publication.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I came to short fiction by chance. The goal was always to publish a
novel, as the received wisdom was that if one wanted to earn some sort
of liv­ing through writing, or reach a wider audience, then publishing
full-length novels was the way to go.

Asimov’s “Slight Spooky” September/October 2023 issue starts off strong
with the novelette <strong>“Deep Blue Jump” </strong>by <strong>Dean
Whitlock</strong>. The story is set amongst a group of children who have
been sold or abandoned into a life of harvesting drug-like dream

by slappers
