heady heights was asking too much of the year, especially one already
burdened by a world-shaping American election. Not that genre fiction

Contained screenwriting can be challenging. Not everyone is wired to
tell a story that involves only a small amount of characters and that
mostly happens in just one or two locations. But like most creative
endeavors, the right kind of limitations can produce surprising
benefits. Placing boundaries on your screenplay can create dynamic
storytelling opportunities, not to mention that contained screenplays
typically have a lower budget. And that could make the difference
between being an aspiring screenwriter versus

There‚Äôs a clich√© in Hollywood that a film is made three times: once on
the page in the form of a screenplay, the second time is on set when
it‚Äôs shot with the director and actors, and the third time is in the
editing bay. While any filmmaker can argue that each stage of ‚Äúmaking‚Äù
the movie is equally important, it‚Äôs in the edit where the story is
finalized and often defined more by what is cut out than by what is left
in.¬†<br><br>Many of the industry‚Äôs greatest screenwriters started their
careers as editors, including Steven Zaillian (<em>Schindler‚Äôs
List</em>, 1993), Steven Soderbergh (<em>Traffic</em>, 2000), and Joel
Coen (<em>No Country for Old Men</em>, 2007). All three filmmakers have
distinct visual styles, a knack for clear and concise storytelling and
the ability to create effective pacing. These skills were no doubt
formed and strengthened while spending hundreds of hours going over raw
footage and slowly piecing it all
together.¬†<br><br><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/tag/podcast">Final

of 110 on Goodreads) ‚Äì the main course obviously be¬≠ing speculative
fiction, with a small dessert sampling of literary fiction, romances,
comics and non-fiction. The meal wasn‚Äôt entirely satisfying, as there
were plenty of anticipated titles that I didn‚Äôt get to read, and plenty

Hiromi Kawakami is one of those authors whose long and decorated career
has, thanks to the vagaries of translation and market dynamics, appeared
in English in a slightly scrambled form. Almost certainly her best-known
novel in English is <strong>Sensei no kaban </strong>(2001), first
released as <strong>The Briefcase </strong>in 2012, and then re-edited

<strong>The Man Who Saw Seconds </strong>is an action thriller that uses

If there‚Äôs one writer/director whose work I‚Äôve been consistently excited
by and whose name at festivals promises a project both heartbreakingly
raw and funny, it‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323708/">Cooper
Raiff</a>.¬†<br><br>He was a SXSW breakout in 2020 with college comedy
<span style="font-style: italic;">Shithouse</span>, which snagged him
the fest‚Äôs Grand Jury Award. And in 2022 took a step into more adult
territory with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of <span
style="font-style: italic;">Cha Cha Real Smooth</span>, which won the
<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/cha-cha-real-smooth-sundance-win-cooper-raiff-dakota-johnson.html">Audience
Award</a> in the U.S. Dramatic category.<br><br>This year, he is back at
Sundance with an episodic work,
<a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753360063b9434588c22178" style="font-style: italic;">Hal
&amp; Harper</a>. The series follows two codependent siblings (Raiff and
Lili Reinhart) who, years after a traumatic event in their family, still
haven‚Äôt quite recovered. That pain seeps into their messy present-day
relationships, including the ones they have with their dad (Mark
Ruffalo) and his new partner (Betty Gilpin). When we get flashbacks into
their childhood, Raiff and Reinhart play their grade-school versions of
the characters, forced to mature too soon.<br><br>Raiff is always highly
involved in his projects, writing and directing as well as starring, and
he brings a singular sensibility to the work that‚Äôs a bit hard to pin
down‚Äîsomething about an awkward honesty, naturalistic dialogue, moments
of emotional punch that feel familiar and real. ¬†<br><br><span
style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</span> is no different, but
as an episodic, the story is a bit more freewheeling, interwoven with
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/frame-story-flashback">past and
present threads</a> that slowly unravel the family‚Äôs
anguish.<br><br>Final Draft spoke with Raiff ahead of Sundance to learn
what was different about his approach to episodic work, his methods for
building characters that he might not fully understand in the beginning,
and how the writing comes together on set.¬†

<h2 id="rules-for-2024-ifdb-awards">Rules for 2024 IFDB Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: IF Database News</p>
The IFDB Awards is an annual competition designed to award excellence in
creating interactive fiction.It is held from February 1st to the first
weekend after February 15th each year on the Interactive Fiction
Database, and take the form of polls.
</P>
Votes are public but anonymized. Every IFDB member is eligible to vote,
except for one special poll, the Author‚Äôs Choice Poll. Eligibility to
vote in the Author‚Äôs Choice competition is determined by having a game
linked to your IFDB profile (this can be found by editing a game page
and use the ‚ÄòLink to Author‚Äôs Profile‚Äô feature. Authors added
incorrectly to a game will not be permitted to vote (for instance, if
someone associates a random game they didn‚Äôt make to their account).
</P>
<p>Rules for discussion and voting <br> -Voting must be in good faith
and be based on personal experience with the games involved.<br></p>
<p>-Campaigning or organizing voting is not allowed if it breaks the
above rule.<br></p>
<p>-Discussion of games on merit is allowed and encouraged.<br></p>
<p>-There is no hard limit on how many votes a person can cast in each
poll for different games. A player voting for so many games that it
makes voting difficult for others (such as voting for every game from
the whole year) may have their votes removed, but only after
warning.<br></p>
-Author cannot vote for their own games. Such votes will be removed so
that the running tallies are correct. Authors can post about their own
games (for instance on intfiction) as long as doesn‚Äôt encourage people
to break the rules (such as telling people to vote for your game even if
they haven‚Äôt played it).
</P>
Code of conduct
</P>
-Voters must abide by the
<A HREF="https://ifdb.org/code-of-conduct">IFDB Code of Conduct</A>.
Harassment of other voters (including on other platforms) and creating
multiple accounts for one person are prohibited.
</P>
Moderation -Votes that are cast incorrectly (for instance, voting for a
Twine game in a Choicescript poll) or fraudulently (for instance, using
sockpuppet accounts) may be removed.
</P>
<p>Eligibility <br> -For most polls, games are eligible if they are
listed on IFDB and have a publication date during 2024.<br></p>
<p>-For system-specific polls, games additionally must have the
appropriate system or genre listed on their IFDB page under the
specified field.<br></p>
<p>-Each poll will have a link to an IFDB search listing suggested
games. Outside of system-based polls, users can vote for any game they
feel fits the criteria.<br></p>
<p>-Any IFDB user can edit game pages to confirm eligibility. However,
malicious editing (such as adding every genre to a game or adding
incorrect systems to a game) will be reverted or removed.<br></p>
<p>-Any game author can opt out of the competition. Adding a note to the
game page during the competition may be helpful to let others know not
to vote for it, but opting out should be officially done by messaging
the organizer (me, for now).<br></p>
</P>
<p>Results <br> -Results will be clearly visible throughout the poll.
However, there will be a grace period of up to 3 days at the end to
allow checking of votes before the official announcements, which will be
made on Intfiction and IFDB.<br></p>
-Polls with very low traffic will not have a winner awarded. This is
left up to organizer discretion, but low traffic may include less than 5
votes for the winning game or less than ten votes total cast.
</P>
Future of Awards
</P>
One of the main purposes of these new awards is to be community-owned
and regular. They need to keep working even if I don‚Äôt keep working.
</P>
The awards begin on February 1st of each year. If Feb 1st passes without
the current organizer having created the polls, anyone can create the
polls themselves.
</P>
<p>The community can propose new changes to awards or new organizers via
public discussion. A public yes/no poll on intfiction with more than 50%
voting yes can be used to add new organizers. Current organizers can
also add in other organizers or successors, subject to a public
veto.</p>
