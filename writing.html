(date: 2025-09-13)
      <p>
      <p>Thanks to the incredible generosity of our community, the 2025 Colossal Fund has already reached its $8,000 goal! We are deeply grateful to everyone who has contributed so far. </p><p>As always, 80% of Colossal Fund proceeds will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. This year marked the second-highest number of entries in IFComp history! That means more authors will receive a share of the cash prize pool, but with the funds spread across more recipients, each individual prize is a little smaller than we anticipated.</p><p><b>That’s why we’re setting a stretch goal of $10,000.</b> Reaching this new milestone will boost the prize amounts.</p><p>If you haven’t yet donated and would like to help us reach our stretch goal, please visit <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a> and click the big blue Donate button. You can choose to be recognized on our donor page or listed anonymously. Every contribution, large or small, strengthens the prize pool and directly supports the authors who make IFComp possible.</p><p>As ever, the remaining 20% of Colossal Fund proceeds support the management of IFComp and other programs of the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, which you can learn more about <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/programs/">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you once again for your generosity, and for helping us celebrate the creativity and dedication of the interactive fiction community!</p>

      <h1>Spike Lee’s 'Highest 2 Lowest' and 6 Other Akira Kurosawa Adaptations</h1>

(date: 2025-09-11)
      <p>
      <div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/spike-lees-highest-2-lowest-and-6-other-akira-kurosawa-adaptations" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Denzel%20Washington%20in%20Highest%202%20Lowest.png" alt="Denzel Washington in Highest 2 Lowest" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>With Spike Lee’s newest film, <em>Highest 2 Lowest</em>, the acclaimed New York director not only reteams for the fifth time with his Academy Award-winning muse, the great Denzel Washington, but joins a lineage of distinguished filmmakers who have adapted the works of legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa.&nbsp;<br><br>The new film is a reimagining of Kurosawa’s 1963 classic, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057565/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">High and Low</a>, about a business tycoon thrown into a moral crisis when his chauffeur’s son is kidnapped and held for an enormous ransom. Kurosawa adapted the original film from a police procedural book written by New York crime author Evan Hunter, reinterpreting the text to add a deeper pathos and exploration of class in a changing post-war Japan.&nbsp;<br><br>But this was far from the first time Kurosawa had adapted a film from previous works of western pop culture. Frequently collaborating with screenwriters like Hideo Oguni, Shinobu Hashimoto and Ryûzô Kikushima, Kurosawa found influence for his samurai films, dramas and contemporary thrillers alike in American suspense yarns, John Ford westerns and the plays of William Shakespeare (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050613/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Throne Of Blood</a> (1957), <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054460/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">The Bad Sleep Well</a> (1960) and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089881/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" style="font-style: italic;">Ran</a> (1985) all owe a debt to The Bard). While Kurosawa was always generous in crediting his influences from across the globe, his acclaimed films are unique in how often and in what a broad range of filmmaking styles they’ve been reinterpreted as well.<br><br>From a star-making 1960s spaghetti western to a recent low-key British Oscar nominee, Kurosawa’s storytelling fingerprints have echoed through history, across countries and genres. Even filmmakers who haven’t remade his films explicitly, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=sWjOwucg28eP3HZC&amp;v=E9V2T1ONA2I&amp;feature=youtu.be">George Lucas</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?si=sDe_axLe2K5ASD_K&amp;v=ErelcWcNelQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Martin Scorsese</a>, are still quick to acknowledge the extraordinary influence his cinema has had on their work.&nbsp;<br><br>By filtering aspects of Hollywood genre cinema and western literature through his own culture and distinct cinematic language, Kurosawa became an international star, and subsequently reinvigorated countless western storytellers. In studying Kurosawa’s influence, one finds an ever-lengthening daisy chain of inspirations and remakes whose links have traveled the better part of a century to arrive at one of this year’s most high profile films by a modern master in his own right.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are 7 English-language reinterpretations of the great Japanese master, Akira Kurosawa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mysteries are one of the oldest and most effective storytelling devices. Audiences are drawn to &nbsp;them because they are challenging and engaging. It’s a step above a normal story narrative because a good mystery is not just entertaining - it’s interactive. The audience lives vicariously through the protagonist(s), creating an even more visceral cinematic experience.<br><br>When we watch movies full of mystery, we become detectives ourselves. We’re tasked with looking at the clues, finding the most obvious suspects, and solving the mystery. But writing a mystery isn’t just about withholding information. It’s about <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> you reveal it. It’s about giving the audience just enough to keep them invested and guessing.&nbsp;<br><br>Then there’s the added thrill of anticipation and expectation. The best mysteries play with audience anticipation, and do all they can to subvert their expectations to create new, unique, memorable, and cathartic cinematic experiences.&nbsp;<br><br>Here we offer a beginner’s guide to writing mysteries in your screenplays. Let’s see if we can anticipate your questions, subvert your expectations with pro writing tips on the subject, and offer you a new outlook on how to write effective mystery.&nbsp;</p>
