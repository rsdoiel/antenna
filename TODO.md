# GTD

## Bugs

- [ ] Titles for archived pages need to be more explicit, this will help in formatting the search results with PageFind
- [x] The attenna SVG isn't place correctly it needs to be in the mast head to the right of the site name and slogan
- [ ] Sometimes the data in the feed is wrong, e.g. https://islandtimes.org/ngarametal-attorney-refuses-to-comply-with-court-order-held-in-contempt-of-court/ is listed in the islandtimes feed but returns a 404 if you go to it.  Need to filter out broken links and exclude from feed output.

## Next

- [ ] Look at Mozilla's [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability)JS Package on GitHub and evaluate creating a reader for Antenna that works in RISC OS an could function as a standalone Pocket like application  
- [ ] Render the Antenna content as a Gopher/Gemini site.
- [X] Need to build a page that shows the "current edition" of the aggregation
- [X] Need to build a page that links to all archived "editions" of the aggregation
- [ ] Need to improve the README, should be more welcoming
- [X] Need to address that I am not editing the feeds content only curating the list of feeds, the curated list and sight design are mine
- [ ] See if I can add copyright info at the item level, also look at citation styles for insight on this
- [ ] If an item has a DOI it should be sited at the item level
- [ ] Need to make sure the HTML I am generating is accessible to assistive tech
- [ ] Improve metadata in head of HTML pages
- [ ] Produce a feed for each "edition" of the aggregation
- [ ] Can I integrate "Save to Pocket" buttons?

## Someday, maybe

- [ ] Look at how I could usse htmlq (jq like for HTML) to either cleanup HTML feed content or to render a web page as a feed source
- [ ] 3 column output on wide screens
- [ ] Responsive design
