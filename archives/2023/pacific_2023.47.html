<p>The beauty of Thanksgiving on our islands lies in its vibrant blend
of cultural traditions at the dinner table. In the CNMI, a melting pot
spread across turquoise Pacific waters, locals mark the holiday through
distinctive food, meaningful rituals passed down for generations, and
gathering with loved ones. Yet an underlying spirit of gratitude
connects these diverse celebrations across the many ethnicities that are
part of our shared islands’ home.</p>

Chuseok and Thanksgiving: A harvest of distinct traditions</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, updated: 2023-11-22, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>As autumn settles in, two nations, South Korea and the United States,
observe their respective festivals of Chuseok and Thanksgiving. Though
both centered around gratitude and harvest, these celebrations reveal
nuanced differences rooted in the cultural fabric of each
society.Chuseok, Korea’s harvest festival, is steeped in tradition,
dating back to ancient farming practices. Families gather for three
days, engaging in rituals to honor ancestors and partaking in culinary
customs. It’s a reflection of Korea’s historical continuity, where past
and present intertwine.  Thanksgiving in the United States traces its
roots to the Pilgrims’ feast with Native Americans in 1621. While
honoring history, the modern-day celebration centers around a single day
marked by a traditional meal, symbolizing unity and abundance.Chuseok’s
timing is determined by the lunar calendar, falling in September or
early October. The extended holiday period allows for more extended
family reunions and additional days for celebration. The festivities
involve traditional rituals and games, complemented by dishes like
songpyeon and japchae. Also, many Koreans and Chinese travel during this
period of time, including to Saipan.Thanksgiving, occurring on the
fourth Thursday of November, is a one-day affair. Families gather for a
meal featuring a quintessential roasted turkey. It marks the beginning
of the holiday season, often extending into a long weekend.Chuseok
engages the senses with vibrant colors, fragrances, and flavors.
Traditional attire, the scent of songpyeon preparation, and the taste of
classic dishes contribute to a multi-sensory experience. The celebration
includes traditional dance, games, and the rhythmic sounds of the janggu
drum.Thanksgiving, in contrast, focuses on familiar scents associated
with a classic American meal—roasted turkey (or roasted chicken),
stuffing, and pumpkin pie. The celebration is accompanied by parades,
football, and the start of the holiday shopping season.In contemporary
times, both Chuseok and Thanksgiving have evolved. Chuseok witnesses
diverse celebrations, ranging from travel to modern leisure activities.
Thanksgiving has expanded beyond its traditional roots, incorporating
activities like Black Friday shopping and online deals.As we navigate
these autumnal traditions, let’s appreciate the distinct beauty of
Chuseok and Thanksgiving. In their expressions of gratitude and harvest,
these celebrations offer insights into the cultural nuances that shape
our global society. This season, let’s acknowledge the rich diversity
present in these festivals, highlighting the various ways societies
express gratitude for their respective harvests.</p>

organizations spread Thanksgiving cheer early</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, updated: 2023-11-22, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>Three organizations began spreading Thanksgiving goodness early this
year, as Northern Marianas College (NMC), Northern Marianas Technical
Institute (NMTech), and the Rotary Club of Saipan all donated meals on
November 21.The Rotary Club of Saipan was present at the Manamko’
Center, complete with a full Thanksgiving feast. Irene Holl, Rotary Club
president, stated that the menu included red rice, turkey, ham,
stuffing, and many other holiday essentials. She mentioned that the
organization hosts a lunch for the manamko’ so that they know how much
the community appreciates its elderly.“We want to make sure that the
manamko feel that they are important and that the Rotary thinks of
them,” Holl said. “That’s why we set a budget and a plan for the manamko
lunch every year. We want them to feel that they are still a part of
this community.”Holl explained that the Rotary Club is an organization
where business and community leaders can collaborate and pool resources
for charitable activities such as the Manamko Center Thanksgiving
lunch.“The stronger the pool [of participants], the better we can serve
the community,” she said of the composition of the Rotary Club. She
confirmed that Rotarians made donations to the day’s Thanksgiving
feast.“If [businesses] can send a member to the rotary, that’s the
biggest part, is to have somebody representing your business in the
Rotary Club.”Over at NMTech, Culinary Level 1, Culinary Level 2, and
pastry students spent their morning preparing their own feast, which
included ham, turkey, pumpkin pie, and more, donating their hard work to
Guma Esperansa.Ben Babauta, NMTech marketing and outreach coordinator,
confirmed that this was the third year in a row that the NMTech Culinary
Arts program donated a holiday meal to Guma Esperansa, which houses
victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other
victims.“What we did was we used the skills that [Culinary Arts
students] learned at school and used that to give back to the
community,” Babauta said. “What we’re doing is showcasing that our
skills learned at NMTech could be transferable into the job workforce,
but also giving back to the community.”Lauri Ogumoro, of Guma Esperansa,
said that the food will be served to around 30 clients in the
shelter.“Thanksgiving has always been about the family,” Ogumoro said.
“[NMTech] giving back to the family at Guma Esperansa is really
important because they’re away from their families and they really
appreciate that you care about them.”For this holiday season, Ogumoro is
thankful for the relationship being built between NMTech and Guma
Esperansa.“We’re thankful that they’re thinking of the women and
children and adults that are residents of Guma Esperansa during this
holiday season,” Ogumoro said. “[Clients] get to enjoy the fruits of
their labor. It’s a beautiful relationship that we’re building and
growing.”She adds that the residents at Guma Esperansa appreciate a
home-cooked meal.“They appreciate that someone thinks about them and
cares for them. That makes it special,” Ogumoro said.Finally, over at
NMC, the Office of Student Activities and Leadership was able to serve
prepackaged holiday meals to 200 students on campus.Students could
select from a mashed potato with beef pot roast and corn set; a mashed
potato and sliced ham with ko’ko’ set; a white rice and breaded
mahi-mahi with ko’ko’ set; or a white rice, broccoli and tofu stir-fry
set.For NMC Office of Student Activities and Leadership manager Maia
Pangelinan, the event was a way to build camaraderie on campus as the
holidays approach.“Our Thanksgiving event at NMC was designed to spread
a grateful spirit by fostering a sense of unity, providing shared
experiences, encouraging reflection, and promoting collaboration among
our diverse community of students,” she said.</p>
