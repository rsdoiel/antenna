NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 PM CDT Sun Oct 22 2023

Valid 230100Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery early this evening shows a potent mid-level
low/trough over northern CA.  This feature will move southeast along
the CA/NV border by early Monday morning.  Showers and isolated
thunderstorms will accompany this upper-level feature.  Farther
east, a strengthening central Great Plains LLJ will focus a zone of
low-level warm-air advection from eastern KS into IA.  Isolated to
widely scattered showers/thunderstorms will be possible tonight
within the aforementioned corridor.  Surface high pressure centered
over the Upper OH Valley and encompassing much of the East will lead
to tranquil conditions.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0441 PM CDT Sun Oct 22 2023

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

The extended period will feature a persistent trough in the western
CONUS with multiple individual embedded shortwave troughs. The
larger scale trough will start to move east by next weekend.
However, in the meantime, there will be windy conditions across the
Southwest and in the Plains for much of the extended period, first
from lee troughing in response to the aforementioned ejecting
mid-level shortwave troughs, and then from a strong polar high which
will move into the northern Plains later in the week. Gulf moisture
is expected to stream north across the Plains through the period
which should mitigate fire weather concerns there. A somewhat drier
airmass is expected across the Southwest. However, minimum relative
humidity is expected to stay mostly above 25-30 percent.
Additionally, while fuels have undergone some drying in the past
week, they remain above critical dryness. The combination of
marginally dry fuels and a marginally dry airmass should preclude
fire weather concerns through the period despite the expectation for
windy conditions across the Southwest.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1216 AM CDT Sun Oct 22 2023

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Synopsis...

An upper shortwave trough migrating through broader upper ridging
centered over the Midwest will lift northeast from MN/IA through the
upper Great Lakes and into southern Ontario on Monday. Isolated
showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing at the beginning of the
period in association with this feature across IA/MN/WI. This
activity will shift east into MI during the afternoon/evening. Poor
surface heating and weak lapse rates will limit destabilization, and
severe storms are not expected.

Further west, an upper trough over the Great Basin/CA will develop
east/southeast across the western states through early Tuesday
morning. As this occurs, modestly enhanced southwesterly deep-layer
flow is forecast across the southern Plains. Southerly low-level
winds will support northward transport of Gulf moisture, and a
tongue of low/mid 60s F surface dewpoints are expected across much
of TX/OK into the Mid-MO Valley. Despite increasing moisture in
TX/OK, somewhat warm midlevel temperatures will lead to poor lapse
rates, precluding stronger instability. A shortwave impulse
migrating through southwesterly flow ahead of the western trough
will support shower and thunderstorm development, especially from
west-central into north TX and southern OK. However, severe
potential appears limited.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight across the
contiguous United States.

...Synopsis...
A series of mid-level troughs will move east across portions of the
north-central states and the CA/NV vicinity during the period.  A
surface high initially centered over the middle to upper MS Valley
will shift eastward to the central Appalachians.  Southerly
low-level flow will strengthen across the central Great Plains in
response to a low amplitude mid-level disturbance moving east from
CO/WY into the lower to mid MO Valley by mid evening.  The northern
rim of appreciable low-level moisture will reside across the
northwest Gulf Coast this morning with a narrow plume of modest
moisture advecting northward during the day.  A few weak elevated
thunderstorms are forecast to develop in an area centered on IA
overnight.  Elsewhere, widely scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms are possible over the Great Basin northward into the
northern Rockies.

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Discussion...
Thunderstorm potential will be limited to two confined areas within
the CONUS. The northern extent of a Gulf of CA/Pacific coastal
Mexico lobe of higher PW values should support isolated
thunderstorms peaking in the late afternoon across southeast AZ to
perhaps as far north as the Mogollon Rim. Weak deep-layer shear and
surface temperature-dew point spreads in excess of 40 degrees may
foster pulse microbursts capable of locally gusts from 40-55 mph.

A shortwave trough over the southern Canadian Rockies will amplify
as it digs east-southeast into the northern Great Plains.
Strengthening ascent and moistening near 700 mb should yield scant
elevated buoyancy from late afternoon into this evening across
central ND to the Upper Red River Valley. Very isolated
thunderstorms may form within a developing band of elevated showers.
Separately, low-topped showers should also form within a
post-frontal regime centered on southeast MT and adjacent border
areas during the late afternoon to early evening. Shower downdrafts
will further enhance already strengthening gradient winds and likely
result in strong gusts over parts of the northern High Plains.
Models largely suggest only a sliver of buoyancy at most is
anticipated, but aggressive ones infer a low-probability threat of a
thunderstorm or two.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An expansive continental polar surface high will shift eastward from
the southern Plains into the southern Appalachians, favoring
cool/dry boundary-layer conditions and limited thunderstorm
potential across much of the central/eastern CONUS. Farther west, a
shortwave trough will cross the northern Rockies/adjacent Plains,
while a related cold front sweeps east/southeastward across the
northern/central Plains. However, thunderstorms are not expected
given limited moisture/instability ahead of the front. 

Over parts of southeastern AZ, diurnal heating/steepening low-level
lapse rates beneath a plume of adequate midlevel moisture will yield
a weakly unstable air mass. While large-scale forcing for ascent
will be minimal, isolated diurnally driven thunderstorms are
possible during the afternoon/early evening given the adequate
instability and gradually eroding inhibition. Inverted-V
thermodynamic profiles could support locally strong gusts, though
the weak instability and lack of vertical shear should limit updraft
intensity.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CDT Mon Oct 16 2023/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low across the CONUS today. A
shortwave will move across the Pacific Northwest, shifting the
western US ridge eastward across the Rockies. A trough across the
eastern US will continue to move eastward offshore. A few areas of
breezy westerly winds will be possible across southeastern Oregon
and southern Montana. Relative humidity will stay above Elevated or
Critical thresholds with moist fuels in place, keeping fire concerns
low.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated lightning strikes are possible over parts of Washington
state and perhaps southeatern Arizona. However, severe thunderstorms
are not expected today and tonight.

A deep, mid-level, long-wave trough centered over the Atlantic Coast
is forecast to slowly weaken as it consolidates into a broader
mid-level low and moves offshore late in the forecast period. In the
wake of the large eastern US trough, northerly offshore flow and
cool temperatures will dominate the eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS,
limiting thunderstorm chances. To the west, transient mid-level
ridging over the Southwest will be suppressed and shift eastward
under the influence of an advancing shortwave trough along the
border of southern BC. Weak inland advection of a modified eastern
Pacific air mass across western and northern WA State may briefly
support destabilization sufficient for a few thunderstorms late this
afternoon into the early evening. However, scant buoyancy (less than
500 J/kg of MUCAPE) confined within the lowest few km, will limit
the potential for strong, organized and persistent updrafts capable
of more widespread lightning. A few lightning strikes are also
possible over portions of southeastern AZ where strong surface
heating and marginal moisture may support a brief thunderstorm.
However, coverage appears unlikely to reach 10% and no thunder area
will be included. With limited to negligible thunderstorm chances
for much of the country, severe storms are unlikely over the CONUS
today and tonight.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 710
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central into southeast Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 125 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered low-topped thunderstorms will form this
afternoon along a slow-moving front across central Iowa.  The storm
environment will favor of mix of multicells and some supercells
capable of producing a few tornadoes, along with isolated marginally
severe hail and wind gusts.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 35 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west northwest of Fort Dodge
IA to 30 miles south of Cedar Rapids IA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 350. Mean
storm motion vector 18020.

Mesoscale Discussion 2250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Areas affected...Parts of central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 131712Z - 131845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few brief tornadoes and isolated hail are possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A deep-layer cyclone currently centered near the IA/NE
border will move eastward across western/central this afternoon. A
surface front extends northeastward from the low into northwest IA,
then arcs southeastward across central IA into northern MO.
Widespread cloudiness is noted along/ahead of the front, though some
thinning and cloud breaks have recently developed across parts of
north-central and south-central IA. 

As pre-frontal temperatures warm through the 60s F within a modestly
moist boundary layer, MLCAPE will increase into the 300-700 J/kg
range. Weak convection has already developed in Pocahontas County,
with additional development expected by early/mid afternoon
southward along the frontal boundary. A band of storms is expected
to evolve by mid afternoon, with modestly favorable effective shear
(generally 30-35 kt) potentially supporting embedded supercell
structures, especially from central into south-central IA. 

A combination of modestly favorable low-level shear/SRH and ambient
vertical vorticity associated with the cyclone will support a threat
of a few brief tornadoes this afternoon, both within a
hybrid/marginal supercell environment across central/south-central
IA, and a landspout environment into parts of
north-central/northwest IA. Cool temperatures aloft may also support
isolated hail with the strongest storms. While coverage and
magnitude of the threat may remain relatively limited, tornado watch
issuance is possible this afternoon if confidence in the potential
for multiple tornadoes increases.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The risk of fire spread will remain low across the CONUS on
Saturday. Building high pressure across the western US will keep
winds light where the driest air mass resides, within the
southwestern US and southern Plains on Saturday. Pockets of breezy
northwesterly flow will be possible across the central Plains and
the Great Lakes region. However, cooler temperatures will lead to
higher humidity and overall low risk of fire spread.
