## OPINION | Truth 26: A disconnected people — our $$$ & tourism

date: 2023-11-30, updated: 2023-11-30, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is the people of the CNMI are extremely disconnected from the actual activities and ownership in our government, as things are just being left-up to the powers that be without any form of input or protest BY the People. There was a time when Public Hearings really meant something in the CNMI but ever-since the Casino was forced down our throats without any form of Public Accountability, it has now become a common practice to avoid all public Hearings that has created an extremely dangerous and detrimental practice for creating legislation in which the People PAY-the-COST. The people really no longer have a real say in the important issues that WE the People are facing that adversely affect our quality of life. The legislature is trying to raise money that adversely affects the People without giving the People any say, other than the public comment section that virtually no-one knows about in time before the Bill is passed into law.
