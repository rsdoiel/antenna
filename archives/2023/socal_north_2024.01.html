<p>Dylan Andrews brought the ball up the court, his team trailing by
three with less than 30 seconds to play. The sophomore guard had already
delivered a last-second shot to win a game exactly one month prior, but
he entered the possession having shot just 2-of-11 from the field and
1-of-6 from behind the arc.</p>
