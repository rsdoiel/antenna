Mesoscale Discussion 2333
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Areas affected...parts of the coastal Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 171706Z - 172100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A conditional risk of brief tornadoes or damaging gusts is
forecast today, from the South Carolina upper coast toward coastal
North Carolina. The risk is conditional on air mass recovery, and a
watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...A surface low will deepen as it moves northeastward off
the SC Coast today, along an existing baroclinic zone which is
currently well offshore. Surface observations show cool air over
land with gusty northeast winds, and this will likely maintain a
decoupled boundary layer which should mitigate tornado and damaging
gust potential in the near term.

Later today, gradual warming is expected as the warm front shifts
north along the coast. As winds veer to east and then southeast, a
warmer and more unstable air mass will then support a risk of brief
tornadoes and damaging gusts, as shear will remain strong along the
warm front. Observational trends will continue to be monitored
closely, along with satellite imagery, to ascertain when a potential
watch may be needed later today.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
150 PM EST Sun Dec 17 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  800 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible

SUMMARY...Potential for locally damaging winds and a couple of
tornadoes will gradually increase this afternoon and into this
evening, as locally intense thunderstorms shift north-northeastward
across the North Carolina Coastal Plain and Outer Banks area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
east and west of a line from 110 miles northeast of New Bern NC to
30 miles south of Wilmington NC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 55 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean
storm motion vector 18040.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NEW JERSEY
INTO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
A few damaging gusts are possible from the eastern shore of New
Jersey into southern New England Monday morning. A few isolated
lightning flashes are possible along the northern/central California
coast.

...Northeast...

A strong coastal low, oriented near NJ/DE Monday morning, will
continue to modestly deepen as it lifts north/northeast through the
period. Very strong deep-layer south/southeasterly flow ahead of the
low and the associated shortwave trough will be oriented over the
offshore waters and overspreading New England. While this will allow
for 50s F dewpoints to spread across parts of southern New England,
very moist and warm low/midlevel thermodynamic profiles are
forecast. Widespread showers and cloud cover will preclude much
heating, and low/midlevel lapse rates will remain poor. As a result,
instability will remain meager. Nevertheless, strong ascent may be
sufficient for a few lightning flashes and perhaps a stronger
convective element or two moving onshore from the New Jersey to
southern New England coast. With forecast winds in the 925-850 mb
layer well over 50 kt, strong/damaging gusts are possible despite
the overall poor thermodynamic environment. 

...Northern/Central CA...

A shortwave trough will move onshore during the afternoon and into
the nighttime hours on Monday. Cool temperatures aloft and strong
large-scale ascent may be sufficient for a few lightning flashes
through the afternoon hours.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Cool temperature, weak winds and recent/ongoing precipitation over
much of the CONUS will keep fire-weather concerns minimal through
the forecast period.

..Lyons.. 12/17/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023/

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper pattern will characterize the synoptic
environment over the CONUS today, with multiple mid-level troughs
traversing the eastern U.S. as a third mid-level trough impinges on
the California coastline. Regardless, surface high pressure and
associated cooler air will surge southeast across the Rockies toward
the Mississippi Valley, with wet conditions likely along the West
Coast, mitigating major wildfire-spread concerns across the CONUS.

Valid 171630Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes will be possible
through tonight across the coastal Carolinas.

...Discussion...
Recent surface analysis shows a low just off the northeastern
Florida/southeastern Georgia coast at this time, which is progged to
steadily deepen while shifting north-northeastward through tonight. 
At this time, what appears to be the most likely track for the low
will be to remain just off the South Carolina coast through the
daytime hours, and then possibly move just inland across coastal
North Carolina or the Outer Banks overnight.  

North of the low track, widespread/steady precipitation is ongoing,
which should reinforce a persistent cool/stable boundary layer
inland through the daytime hours.  With that said, the favorably
strong/veering wind field observed within the northeast quadrant of
the low continues to support occasionally rotating cells just
offshore.  This will continue, along with gradually increasing
potential that a couple of these cells will begin moving inland
across South Carolina coastal counties northeast of Charleston. 
While any storms would become increasingly elevated along their
inland advance, storms may remain rooted near enough to the surface
across immediate coastal counties of northeastern South Carolina --
and then later over eastern North Carolina and in particular the
Outer Banks -- to yield risk for a couple of tornadoes, and possibly
locally damaging wind gusts.  As such, will maintain current
delineation of the SLGT risk area just inland across South Carolina
for today, and then across eastern North Carolina and the Outer
Banks area for this evening and overnight.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT
ACROSS THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts and a tornado or two will be possible
through tonight across the coastal Carolinas.

...Coastal Carolinas through tonight...
A deepening cyclone will progress from north FL this morning to
eastern NC by 09-12z Monday, in response to gradual phasing of Gulf
of Mexico shortwave troughs with a larger-scale trough over the
eastern CONUS.  Midlevel drying with the passage of a lead shortwave
trough and diminished ascent have acted to limit deep convection
across FL overnight.  Any lingering severe threat will end across
southeast FL by mid-late morning as drying occurs from the west and
vertical shear continues to weaken.  The cyclone will skirt the GA
coast during the day and then approach SC this afternoon and NC
tonight.  A narrow portion of the surface warm sector could spread
far enough inland to support some threat for near-surface-based
convection across the coastal Carolinas, where vertical shear will
be strong.  However, poor lapse rates aloft will tend to limit
buoyancy in the zone of stronger forcing for ascent where vertical
shear will be strongest, and cool shelf waters will likely maintain
a shallow stable layer near the coast.  Will maintain the outlook
area given the conditional potential for isolated damaging gusts and
a tornado or two, but it is not clear how much of the potential will
be realized inland.

...Northern CA coast...
To the east of a closed low over the eastern Pacific, isolated
lightning flashes will be possible with embedded/elevated
convection.
