**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-12-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The last episodes of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22">The Crown</a> were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png">Oh The Humanity</a>.

## FDISK 1.3.11

date: 2023-12-17, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>The FDISK program creates and manages partitions on a hard drive. FreeDOS FDISK recently had two new maintenance releases that fixed several bugs. 1.3.10 increased compatibility with some older quirky IDE controllers and added an Italian translation. Version 1.3.11 fixed a bug where FDISK was not writing the partition table of the 8th disk. You can download the new versions from the FDISK repository <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a> or more directly from the <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk/releases" rel="nofollow">releases page</a>.</p></div>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/lastDuel.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Picked a movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)">The Last Duel</a>, more or less at random, based largely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)#Cast">who</a> was in it, and the fact that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/movies/the-last-duel-review.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Gk0.YAJS.AGdcc4Vz9G0C&hpgrp=k-abar&smid=url-share">NYT</a> gave it a critic's pick rating. It was good. But this isn't a movie review, it's a review of the user interface for choosing movies on streaming services. Why can't we integrate a site like <a href="http://metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> with Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Max, AppleTV, et al. Just let me know what Metacritic says, and make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I want more info. Don't make me look it up. People joke about how we spend our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it's true, I do it. Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online. How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of the links generated by their CMS are broken.)

## LAST NIGHT I DREAMED OF HIPPOS ON THE BEACH

date: 2023-12-17, from: Howard Jacobson blog

&#8216;Why are there hippos on the beach?&#8217; I asked the lifeguard. He looked like an older Tadzio from Death in Venice, clad in striped concentration-camp pyjamas, conscious of his beauty. He answered my question with a question. &#8216;You&#8217;ve heard of liposuction?&#8217;
