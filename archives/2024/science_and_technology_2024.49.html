<h2 id="exigy-lets-make-shareware-again">EXiGY: let’s make shareware

<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>EXiGY rolls up the all of the above experiences into a single
package: make games the way they were made in the mid-90s, by dragging
and dropping objects into a window, programming some behaviour into
those objects, and clicking the Run button. It’s like ZZT with tile
graphics instead of ASCII. Want to send your little game to some
friends? Click the Gift button to package all of the files up, and send
your friend the .XGY file. EXiGY is about making it fun to create games
again. ↫ Chris on the Exigy website I fell in love with this the second
I saw it come by on Mastodon. Chris – I don’t know the author’s full
name so I’ll stick with Chris – has been working on this for the past
year, and it’s not out quite yet. Still, the feature list is packed, and
on the linked website, they intend to post development updates so we can
keep up with the goings-on. This seems like an incredibly cool project
and I’d love to play around with it when Chris deems it ready for
release.</p>

<h2 id="risc-v-redox-runs-on-x86-64-redox">RISC-V Redox runs on x86-64
Redox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every time a new Redox monthly report comes out, I’m baffled by the
fact we’ve apparently rounded another month. They just keep on coming
and going, don’t they? And I even turned 40 this 1 December, so it hits
even harder this time. I’m now as old as I remember my parents were in
some of my oldest memories, and now I’ve got two kids of my own. Wild.
Time isn’t supposed to move this fast, and I strongly advise the Redox
team to stop this madness. Anyway, this month also saw the release of
the 4th alpha of system76’s new COSMIC Linux desktop environment, and
the parts of COSMIC available on Redox were updated to reflect that.
This past months also saw a major milestone: the RISC-V version of Redox
running in an emulator on the x86-64 version of Redox. That’s quite the
feat, and highlights just how capable Redox has become in such a short
time. There’s also the usual list of kernel, driver, and relibc
improvements, as well as additional Rust programs ported to Redox. Also
highlighted in this report: a video detailing how to build Redox under
Windows Subsystem for Linux. This could be a great avenue for operating
system developers who use Windows to get their feet wet at building
Redox on their own systems.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the availability of Vanir, a new open-source
security patch validation tool. Introduced at Android Bootcamp in April,
Vanir gives Android platform developers the power to quickly and
efficiently scan their custom platform code for missing security patches
and identify applicable available patches. Vanir significantly
accelerates patch validation by automating this process, allowing OEMs
to ensure devices are protected with critical security updates much
faster than traditional methods. This strengthens the security of the
Android ecosystem, helping to keep Android users around the world safe.
↫ Google Security Blog Google makes it clear this tool can easily be
adapted for other avenues too – it’s not locked into only working with
Android and Java/C/C++. Since it’s now open source, anyone can
contribute to it and make it compatible – for lack of a better term –
with other platforms and programming languages as well.</p>

announces massive rebrand that mentions Firefox exactly once</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla isn’t just another tech company — we’re a global crew of
activists, technologists and builders, all working to keep the internet
free, open and accessible. For over 25 years, we’ve championed the idea
that the web should be for everyone, no matter who you are or where
you’re from. Now, with a brand refresh, we’re looking ahead to the next
25 years (and beyond), building on our work and developing new tools to
give more people the control to shape their online experiences. ↫
Lindsey Lionheart O’Brien at the Mozilla blog I have no clue about
marketing and branding and what investments in those things cost, but
all I could think about while reading this massive pile of marketing
wank is that the name “Firefox” only occurs once. How many Firefox bugs
could’ve been squashed with the money spent on this rebrand literally
nobody is going to care about because nobody uses Firefox as it is? Is a
new logo and accompanying verbal diarrea really what’s going to turn
this sinking ship around? I’ve already made my choice, and I’ve left
Firefox behind on all my machines, opting for an entirely different
browser instead. I’m writing about that experience as we speak, so
you’ll have to wait a bit longer to find out what choice I made, but
rest assured I know I’m not the only one who is leaving Firefox behind
after two decades of loyal service, and I doubt an expensive new logo is
going to change anybody’s mind.</p>

operating systems written in Rust are not exactly a novel concept, but
that doesn’t mean each new one that comes up isn’t cool. This one is
still in its very early stages, but focuses on something quite
interesting: every filesystem and memory operation is cryptographically
verified using a proof system. It’s already got basic file system
operations, signal handling and a scheduler, a shell, and more.

id="harmonyos-next-gets-container-tool-to-run-android-applications">HarmonyOS
Next gets container tool to run Android applications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>HarmonyOS Next, the new version of Huawei’s mobile operating system,
runs on a brand new microkernel, uses a new, homegrown programming
language, and most notably in this duopolistic world, does not run
Android applications. This won’t be much of an issue inside China, where
Huawei can more easily make sure the most important Chinese applications
are supported and ported over, but outside of China that might pose some
problems, especially for Chinese tourists visiting other countries. It
turns out there’s a solution for this, called 出境易 (as Android
Authority notes, this seems to translate to something like “Easy
Abroad”), which is basically a containerised Android runtime using
microG. It comes with its own built-in application store filled with a
number of popular Android applications, and runs them on HarmonyOS Next.
The tool is called 出境易, which roughly translates to “Easy Abroad.”
It’s apparently designed to aid Chinese tourists who travel abroad. The
tool seems to create a container for Android apps to run in, which is
not a new concept but is surprising to see pop up so quickly for the new
operating system. When installed, the tool lets you install a number of
Android apps from its self-contained app store, including Facebook,
Instagram, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, Google Search, Google Maps, Uber,
Chrome, Gmail, Spotify, Disney Plus, Netflix, Steam, and more. These
Android apps show up in a folder in the home screen but they cannot be
dragged out of the folder. An early hands-on of the tool from
YouTuber LL Techview shows that it works surprisingly well. Android apps
launch quickly, run pretty smoothly, and even appear in the recents
menu. It’s even possible to sign into your Google Account to use apps
like Google Search and Gmail. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority
There are limitations, of course, and they’re roughly the same as the
ones found on any device running microG instead of Google Play Services
– something I just wrote about in my review of /e/OS on a FairPhone 5:
certain banking applications won’t work, anything that hooks too deeply
into Play Services won’t run, that sort of stuff. On top of that, this
tool also brings in some limitations of its own, like only whitelisted
application being supported, notifications not working properly, and a
few other issues. This all feels very similar to what Jolla and Sailfish
tried to do way back in 2014. Running Android applications as a side
hustle was jank back then and I feel like it’s probably going to be jank
today. Even just running Play Services in a restrictive sandbox – like I
do with GrapheneOS on my daily driver, a Pixel 8 Pro – presents some
issues, and microG adds even more compatibility issues on top. Putting
all of this in a container will surely add an additional layer of jank,
like it did on Sailfish OS. Regardless, I’m 100% down with trying to get
my hands on a HarmonyOS Next device if they ever become available in
some form here in Sweden, as I feel like a review of what is the most
serious attempt at breaking the Android-iOS duopoly in over a decade is
something that belongs here on OSNews. If that time ever comes, I might
set up another fundraiser to get it done.</p>

id="microsoft-were-not-lowering-the-windows-11-system-requirements">Microsoft:
we’re not lowering the Windows 11 system requirements</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you were secretly hoping Microsoft would lower the system
requirements for Windows 11 so you could upgrade your or your family’s
Windows 10 machines to Windows 11, you’re going to be in for some bad
news. In a blog post, Microsoft detailed that its most stringent Windows
11 requirement – the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 – is here to stay
and crucial to the future of Windows. By instituting TPM 2.0 as a
non-negotiable standard for the future of Windows, we elevate the
security benchmark. It allows you and us to better align with the
growing need for formidable data protection in the modern digital
sphere. In conclusion, TPM 2.0 is not just a recommendation—it’s a
necessity for maintaining a secure and future-proof IT environment with
Windows 11. And it’s an important part of the larger Zero Trust
strategy, alongside Secure Boot, Credential Guard, and Windows Hello for
Business. ↫ Steven Hosking at the Windows IT Pro Blog So no, if you had
the hope Microsoft would lower Windows 11’s system requirements in the
face of the oncoming end of support deadline for the 60% of Windows
users still using Windows 10, your hope has just been dashed. A more
likely outcome here is that as the deadline grows closer, Microsoft will
extend the deadline by another year, and if needed another, because
leaving 60% of users without security updates and little to no path to
upgrade is not going to be a good look for the marketing and legal
departments. If you really do want to upgrade to Windows 11, there’s a
few options. There’s the enterprise-focused Windows 11 LTSC 2024
release, which does not require a TPM 2.0, regarding it as an optional
feature instead. On top of that, LTSC is much more bare-bones, shipping
without much of the stuff many of us more nerdy users aren’t interested
in anyway. The big downside is that getting your hands on a legal copy
of LTSC will be difficult, as it’s only available to volume licensing
customers, which you most likely are not. Of course, you shouldn’t give
a shit about Microsoft’s rules, so you can always use unapproved methods
of getting a license. Another option is the one I took for my parts-bin
Windows 11 PC which I only use for League of Legends: I bought a cheap
TPM 2.0 module from eBay, slotted it into my motherboard, and was on my
merry way. Due to League of Legends’ required rootkit, a TPM 2.0 module
is needed, so a few euros and days waiting later, I was ready to go. Do
make sure you get the right type of TPM 2.0 module for your motherboard,
as they’re not universally compatible. The final option is to use one of
the few remaining ways to circumvent Windows 11’s system requirements,
which are sadly dwindling with every major update. Right now that means
using a tool like Flyby11, which uses the Windows Server installer to
bypass Windows 11’s system requirements. We’ll have to wait and see for
how long that trick remains possible.</p>

to Btrfs and boot Windows off Btrfs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft’s
NTFS filesystem to the open-source filesystem Btrfs, much
as btrfs-convert does for ext2. The original image is saved as a reflink
copy at image/ntfs.img, and if you want to keep the conversion you can
delete this to free up space. ↫ Mark Harmstone An amazing piece of
software that works on both Linux and Windows, and even, as described
above, comes with the option of undoing the conversion if you so desire
and haven’t removed the original image yet. Its developer, Mark
Harmstone, of course stresses that while he thinks the tool is quite
stable, he obviously makes no guarantees or claims about its stability.
In other words, please don’t use this on sensitive data or in a
production environment. What makes this tool even more amazing is that
you can combine it with two of Harmstone’s other tools to really pull
some rabbits out of your hat. First, there’s his Btrfs driver for
Windows, which, as the name implies, allows Windows to work with
Btrfs-formatted drives. Second, and here’s where things get really
spicy, there’s Quibble, his custom bootloader consisting of open source
reimplementations of Windows’ own bootloader. Using these three tools
together you can, if you’re lucky, boot and run Windows off a Btrfs
drive. That’s quite cool, and while perhaps not particularly useful due
to its experimental nature, it’s still an awesome weekend project.</p>

id="intel-board-kicks-out-ceo-launches-new-budget-desktop-gpus">Intel
board kicks out CEO, launches new budget desktop GPUs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is a bit of an odd few days for Intel. Mere days after the board
ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger, once heralded as the chip giant’s messiah,
they’re today launching two brand new desktop graphics cards. They’re
aimed at the more budget-oriented consumer, and might very well be the
last discrete graphics cards Intel makes, since this is one of the
product lines on the chopping block. Intel’s next — and possibly last —
desktop graphics cards will begin arriving in just 10 days. Right on
cue, the company has announced the budget $249 Arc B580 and $219 Arc
B570, shipping December 13th and January 16th, respectively, as the
“best-in-class performance per dollar” options in the GPU market.
They’re based on the same Xe2 “Battlemage” GPU architecture you’ll find
in Intel’s Lunar Lake laptop chips but with more than double the
graphics cores, up to 12GB of dedicated video memory, and up to 190W of
power compared to their limited laptop forms — enough power to see the
B580 slightly beat Nvidia’s $299 RTX 4060 and AMD’s $269 RX 7600,
according to Intel’s benchmarks, but sometimes still trading blows. ↫
Sean Hollister at The Verge As for Gelsinger’s dismissal, it seems the
board forced him out after being frustrated with the slow progress the
company was making in its turnaround. The fact that a finance person and
a marketing person will together be interim CEOs seems to indicate the
board is more interested in quick profit than a long-term turnaround,
and with companies like Qualcomm being interested in acquiring Intel,
the board’s short-term mentality might be winning out, and ousting
Gelsinger is just paving the way for selling off parts of Intel until
there’s nothing left. Who knows, I might be reading way too much into
all of this, but it feels like expecting an organisation as complex as a
high-end processor makers to turn itself around in just a few years is
incredibly shortsighted, and you’d think board members at Intel would
understand that. If the goal is to maintain Intel as a separate,
profitable entity making some of the world’s fastest processors, you’re
going to need to give a CEO and leadership team more than just a few
years to turn the ship around. Within a few years we’ll know the board’s
true intentions, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Intel being sold for
parts over the coming years.</p>

<h2 id="if-not-react-then-what">If not React, then what?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Rejecting an engrained practice of bullshitting does not come easily.
Frameworkism preaches that the way to improve user experiences is to
adopt more (or different) tooling from the framework’s ecosystem. This
provides adherents with something to do that looks plausibly like
engineering, except it isn’t. It can even become a totalising
commitment; solutions to user problems outside the framework’s expanded
cinematic universe are unavailable to the frameworkist. Non-idiomatic
patterns that unlock significant wins for users are bugs to be squashed.
And without data or evidence to counterbalance bullshit artists’s
assertions, who’s to say they’re wrong? Orthodoxy unmoored from
measurements of user outcomes predictably spins into abstruse
absurdities. Heresy, eventually, is perceived to carry heavy sanctions.
It’s all nonsense. ↫ Alex Russell I’m not a developer, but any
application that uses frameworks like React that I’ve ever used tend to
be absolute trainwrecks when it comes to performance, usability,
consistency, and platform integration. When someone claims to have an
application available for a platform I use, but it’s using React or
Electron or whatever, they’re lying in my eyes – what they really have
is a website running in a window frame, which may or may not even be a
native window frame. Developing using these tools indicates to me a lack
of care, a lack of respect for the users of your product. I am
militantly native. I’d rather use a less functional application than a
Chrome web application cosplaying as a real application, and I will most
likely not even consider using your service if all you have is a
website-in-a-box. If you don’t respect me, I see no need to respect you.
If you want an application on a specific platform, use that platform’s
native tools and APIs to build it. Anything else tells me all I need to
know about how much you truly care about the product you’re
building.</p>

Hall SC-VGA-2 video processor, the Atari ST and NeXTSTEP: more tales of
the unscreenshotable</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the Hall Research Technologies SC-VGA-2, sold as a “VGA/HDTV
Video Processor.” In addition to slicing, dicing and pureeing,
apparently, it will take any of a bundle of input formats and both
rescale and resample them on the fly into the VGA or HDTV signal you
desire, including 60Hz rates. This came from a seller specializing in
teleprompter equipment and Hall still sells an HDMI version with
additional resolutions … for around US$500. However, this or the
slightly newer SC-VGA-2A and SC-VGA-2B are all relatively common devices
and found substantially cheaper used. Let’s try it out and show some
sample output, including those delicious NeXTSTEP system messages and
some ST grabs. ↫ Cameron Kaiser With the obscurity of some of the
hardware Cameron Kaiser details on his website, I’m not surprised he has
some seriously unique needs when it comes to taking screengrabs. He
couldn’t very well not take the device apart, and inside it appears to
be a system with two small processors, at least one of which is an Intel
8051 8bit microcontroller. Kaiser goes into his usual great detail
explaining and showing how the device works. If you’ve got unique
screengrabbing needs, this might be of interest to you.</p>
