<h2 id="if-not-react-then-what">If not React, then what?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Rejecting an engrained practice of bullshitting does not come easily.
Frameworkism preaches that the way to improve user experiences is to
adopt more (or different) tooling from the framework’s ecosystem. This
provides adherents with something to do that looks plausibly like
engineering, except it isn’t. It can even become a totalising
commitment; solutions to user problems outside the framework’s expanded
cinematic universe are unavailable to the frameworkist. Non-idiomatic
patterns that unlock significant wins for users are bugs to be squashed.
And without data or evidence to counterbalance bullshit artists’s
assertions, who’s to say they’re wrong? Orthodoxy unmoored from
measurements of user outcomes predictably spins into abstruse
absurdities. Heresy, eventually, is perceived to carry heavy sanctions.
It’s all nonsense. ↫ Alex Russell I’m not a developer, but any
application that uses frameworks like React that I’ve ever used tend to
be absolute trainwrecks when it comes to performance, usability,
consistency, and platform integration. When someone claims to have an
application available for a platform I use, but it’s using React or
Electron or whatever, they’re lying in my eyes – what they really have
is a website running in a window frame, which may or may not even be a
native window frame. Developing using these tools indicates to me a lack
of care, a lack of respect for the users of your product. I am
militantly native. I’d rather use a less functional application than a
Chrome web application cosplaying as a real application, and I will most
likely not even consider using your service if all you have is a
website-in-a-box. If you don’t respect me, I see no need to respect you.
If you want an application on a specific platform, use that platform’s
native tools and APIs to build it. Anything else tells me all I need to
know about how much you truly care about the product you’re
building.</p>

Hall SC-VGA-2 video processor, the Atari ST and NeXTSTEP: more tales of
the unscreenshotable</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the Hall Research Technologies SC-VGA-2, sold as a “VGA/HDTV
Video Processor.” In addition to slicing, dicing and pureeing,
apparently, it will take any of a bundle of input formats and both
rescale and resample them on the fly into the VGA or HDTV signal you
desire, including 60Hz rates. This came from a seller specializing in
teleprompter equipment and Hall still sells an HDMI version with
additional resolutions … for around US$500. However, this or the
slightly newer SC-VGA-2A and SC-VGA-2B are all relatively common devices
and found substantially cheaper used. Let’s try it out and show some
sample output, including those delicious NeXTSTEP system messages and
some ST grabs. ↫ Cameron Kaiser With the obscurity of some of the
hardware Cameron Kaiser details on his website, I’m not surprised he has
some seriously unique needs when it comes to taking screengrabs. He
couldn’t very well not take the device apart, and inside it appears to
be a system with two small processors, at least one of which is an Intel
8051 8bit microcontroller. Kaiser goes into his usual great detail
explaining and showing how the device works. If you’ve got unique
screengrabbing needs, this might be of interest to you.</p>

Söntgen If you have a Pocket Reform – I reviewed its bigger sibling
earlier this year – you can now run Genode on it. Not everything is
working flawlessly yet – most notably audio and NVMe need work – but
networking is operational, so you can actually browse the web. I’m not
sure how much overlap there is between Genode users and Pocket Reform
owners, but at least both groups now know it’s an option.</p>
